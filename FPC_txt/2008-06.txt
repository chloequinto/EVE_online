loot snatching with impunity got old after my first kill
absolutely and without question that thread is 100 pure win
signedthats what poses allways should have been likei also think these shouldnt have pos shield bubble like weve seen them till now but a normal shield covering all the structures beside guns and leave the pos bubble to the current large towers theres too many hidingplaces at small and medium towers all over eve all industrial and research poses should be built up as suggested in this thread the large towers could be kept as deathstars and fuel bay and requirement should be increased
heres to looking at all aspects of poss theyre really important to eve and everything from how they look to how theyre managed needs looking at

this is one of the few ideas that have been spawned in the forums that have such a positiv response i have never come across anyone that thinks that this is a bad idea and yet the devs dont apeare to be willing to tuch the subject with a 10 foot pole

im one of the 8 i have an incredibly difficult time figuring out if a module is active or not the only way i can do this reliably is to move the camera around so that the modules in question are against a black background if there is no background well im out of luck need to mousehover over each one in turn i remember reading about this on the forums when i first started playing eve and i was happy thinking that the issue was going to be addressed and that fixes were already in place on the test server i guess it was put back on the shelf
the ui is tough even for people who can see fine i fully sympathize with those who cannot

hell yeah
sorry i didnt respond sooner i lost track of this thread somehowa fair question i could suggest some rules but how could they be enforced in real life you go to prison if you break the rules i dont see how that could work in evefor example altbier is an alliance and as an insider he learns that a significant industrial corp is about to join that alliance he buys lots of shares in the alliance from people who have no idea what is about to happen the industrial corp joins the alliance share price goes up and altbier sells his shares at a profithow can that be prevented andor punished

actually reloading a weapon is more like ejecting the empty clip put in a new one then arm the weapon what you are saying is shooting round after round from the same clip and were talking big clips hereabout the iff codes  radar bsg has draydus and afaik its systemwide or close to it unlike local  bacon it gives intel about the size and type of the ship its exact location heading and speed so if ccp removes local they should put something like draydus insteadedit not signed i like bacon yumm
ok from what i have read this program is for a player that are afk or some one who happens to be reading the forums or whatever so from what it understand players are fighting for baccon and other programs like it so players that are to bored to pay attention to whats happening in game can protect there shipsside noteoh and about the reloading the weaponclip thing yea if you are target practicing you could fire until your slide or bolt is locked back in a position to expose the chamber drop the clip insert new clip release the slide  which cambers the round   and then fire if you are in a combat you do not wait until the slide locks back you should know if trained well when to drop the clip pop in a fresh clip in while you have a round still in the chamber and then back to work
this isnt cheating its a ui enhancement
save the pigs no more bacon
never used bacon never want to i think ccp is already working on this but its nice to let them know that we want them to
i think that something should be done about moon materials etc but not this proposali dont think there is a problem with various 00 regions being more valuable  permanently   than others the high value areas are where the big boys play and the low value areas are where people start out similar to the progression from high sec to low sec to 00 in general the issue i see is that the rarity of a moon material isnt a good gauge of its value because of the reactions and uses of that materialdysprosium promethium neodymium and thulium are all of the same rarity and one would expect that they would be of the same approximate value much like low sec ores are similar in price but not exactly the same currently dysprosium is twice as expensive as promethium and almost 50 times as expensive as thulium this is because thulium is only used in producing 1  per race   t2 component  which is only used in ships   whereas dysprosium is used in producing 5  per race   t2 componentsi believe ccp should look into balancing the uses of the various materials such that their price is more reflective of their rarity rather than simply which things they produce and which other materials they must combine with to produce themthe rarity system for moon materials is completely broken and making moons move around wont fix thatand btw make abundance of moon materials useful in some way
in short no i disagree jade youve got a good thought but perhaps a better idea would be thisall moons are given a greatly increased number of materials that can be mined however this can vary from 2  meaning double what you get now if you use a t2 harvester ifwhen they are released   to 01 which would give a 10 yieldyou would have alot more moons bearing rarer minerals but in smaller amounts and to prevent moon mining from being complete overkill you would have a limit on the number of moon harvesters that could be present or you would start getting severely diminished returns  on all harvester   if you have more than 2 maybe 3 at the moonfor examplestar fraction pos 12 is currently at a moon with 2 atmospheric gases and 1 platinum harvesting both my change comes into being now your moon also has 08 cobalt 05 technetium and 03 dysposiumyou stop harvesting the gases and begin harvesting the dysposium but you only get 30 as much due to a 03 content in the moon you then decide to gather technetium as well however the 3rd harvester causes a reduced income of each harvester total  stacking penalty   and you receive 10 less from each harvester  now getting only 27 the dysp  imo that would be better as even the crappy moons would have some value and if people flood the market with valuable materials like dysp theyll find themselves possibly changing their mining setup to collect something else for better profit

increase length of aggression timers by 100200 to balance with hp buff seems to be the easiest way to fix thisdreads and carriers ships should have an even further increased aggression time to increase risk of undocking and engaging targets in a carrierdreadanother idea is to implement certain penalties of fighting in docking rangesomething along the lines of lower sensor strenght lower sensor resolution lower locking range  i have not thought out all scenarios this idea could be to much

actually i only run courier missions when i get tired of mining or have enough minerals for my latest production job i will run courier missions for a bit just to relieve the tedium so assuming that no legit player would run one is completely wrong
alright this is one issue i feel strongly about and would like to make some points known1   people talk about how macrominers help the game by providing scores of lowgrade materials to allow pvp to occur cheaply bs the reason there are so few miners is because mining is so hard to make a profit at due to the macroers eliminate the macroers more real players begin mining the prices on minerals may increase but it wont be by that much increase the excitement of mining  using the idea i posted in my csm bid helps but other ideas are welcome   and make it as profitable as other ventures2   ccp action i use a 5point test to determine macroers while not foolproof it does a good job of verifying that i have reported over 100 verified macroers to ccp any guesses how many of them are still in the game the job ccp seems to be doing is similar to a fishing net it catches the small fish but the big whales break right through3   interpol i know this is making a huge jump and going out on a limb but i think selling fantasy items for real money should be considered fraud if interpol made this illegal it would benefit all games i know its kinda a waste to post it on this forum but i wanted to put the idea out there and see how likely it would be to occur4   keystrokes i think wow did this but use a program that can access the kernel of the os and determine if the input is being delivered by a program or by a peripheral device such as a mouse not foolproof but it will go a long way to stopping the macroers5   player advisors i strongly support this measure listed under a previous poster more has to be done and to be quite frank is not being done ccp has confirmed that this is a problem yet refuses to take any steps to remedy this problem for crying out loud ccp has the biggest server farm in the industry and recently acquired white wolf games they have the money to stop this considering 200k characters spread over roughly 100k accounts 100k x 15 usdmonth is 15m per month most of which is probably subsumed in bandwidth charges if we eliminate macroers  which are widespread   the bandwidth should be cut in half as well as the workload required of the servers meaning that the game will support more concurrent real playersim sorry to rant but it drives me nuts seeing these macroers continue on their merry way any miner will tell you ice mining is worthless due to the macromining invasion im not trying to say that ccp is bad in any respects but please something has to be done
as much as id like for it to be impossible for isk farmers to abuse this game i cant get behind that sort of idea the difference between that and what wows warden does is not a large one software such as warden will never be permitted to run on any computer owned by me even if it worked to catch every single macrouser it would do nothing to detect account sharing and sweatshop operations and would alienate regular customers
1   agreed 2   id be curious to know about what this test is and my guess is 100 just judging by how edoff you sound 3   youre crazy isk isnt a fantasy item in the slightest it may not have physical form or anywhere near the same popularity but its as real as dollars or euros and theres also a lot of mmos out there to my understanding that allow ebaying besides if youre going to argue that irl money for ig money should be illegal youd have to end the gtc trade since thats nothing but cashforisk this is why moralizing over rmt has always stunned me  we play a game whose developer actively encourages and facilitates rmt and still manage to think its evil whos up for some cognitive dissonance4   youre even crazier than you were on 3 if ccp starts installing spyware like that on my computer itll be a cold day in hell before they see another cent from me 5   circa 500k characters over 250k paid accounts actually and i seriously doubt that macroers eat half their bandwidth but that said im not at all sure what sort of player advisors you want
ive never liked how crappy abs are
it does not need to outright disable the mwd but reducing the speed bonus is also possible
increasing the speedboos of ab even more feels wrong to me i think a solution should be sought in the folowing directionaltering mwds should also help reducing the ever present nanofitsfor abhave them bestow 25 to 50 invulnerability to webs  25 in t1 meta 0 to 50 for t2 at max skill  yes add a skill to boost webresistance   make sure faction abs do not get above 70 ever  improve acceleration  not agillity   on active absfor mwdhave mwd refuse to function whenever the ship would be unable to warp i never understood why they could work when scrambled or in bubbles  
im fairly new and therefore dont know a lot about the subject but the fact that it seems like everyone needs a mwd on their ship   and judging from the commentary about nano gangs this is even more true than complaints about nanoing   to pvp suggests theres something wrong alright you can shoot that down with everyone needs weapons on their ship but theres a range of those at least i suppose you can also shoot that down with everyone needs a warp disruptor too but thats actually a far more tenuous argument  also i agree with everyone who doesnt understand how a microwarpdrive works when youre warp scrambled on the other hand with the tendency for everyone to be warp scrambled in a fight as far as i can tell means that would probably be a pretty heavyhanded nerf  i still like it though  
supporting this should be other options to having to fit a mwd for pvp
i support this
this idea has been floating around for so damn long

ok learning skills suck but they shouldnt be removed from the gameincrease starter characters sp by 500000  probably not a realistic number   and put all these new sp in learning skills relevant to their career choice
id like to throw my 2 pennies into this here convo now as a new player  3months or so   i believe learning skills are a good balance for the game but alot of my mates who started out at the same time as me have left because of the riducilus training times on some of them now im all for keeping them but for the newer player would it not be an idea good or bad to maybe decrese the training time on just the learning skills i dont mind happily trying to leave something running in my skills for 1530 days for something like a dread or carrier or something useful that helps me progress in the game but spending 610 days as some of my mates have done learning skills like focus and learning just isnt a fun thingdecrease the training time and maybe some 10 learning implants would be nice for us newbies as were often called but from my own expierence it would just give the game a nice big kick up the learning skills backside tbh and i for one would welcome that
an alternative to learning skills might just be an automatic acceleration of learning abilities over time so for brand new players a rank 1 skill might take 7 days to get to level 5 but for year old players itll take 5 days and eventually after a couple years will level off at 34 days  accelerating at a decreasing rate   that way new players  for whom rank 2 skills like racial frigate v are a big deal   will have to be patient for those skills but older players  working on rank 16 skills and the like   will have accelerated training for the much longer skills theyre working on
face it learning skills are there to give ccp extra 1530 per character its a scam you know like that 90mil notquitenavy caracal contract same thing weve all been had the difference is some of the suckers are foaming at the mouth claiming that their shiny new itsnotnavysrsly caracal is just as goodif you like learning skills so much why arent you asking for more time sinks how about a rank10 skill pointless waste of time level 4 required to fly any cruiser or higher anybody who doesnt like it can stick to frigates
dont support
support 100 as long as i am allowed to redistribute the points spent on learning to other skills
i have them maxed out and i support this 100 they do not add to the game in a positive way i think their removal would attract many new players to the game
remove them
wipe them out

local chat is in my opinion the number one intel gathering tool used by every pilot in lowsec and 00 space  highsec as well i suppose   i dont believe it was ever ccps intention for it to be used this way but thats the way it is whenever someone enters a system anyone paying attention to local chat will see that player show up and can instantly know if they should run log out or start hunting them it is still possible to get snuck up on when not paying attention to local just as it is possible for a piracy target or war target to sneak by you when youre not paying attention however its a lot harder for any sneaking to happen at allim trying to convey the fact that local chat makes things easier for npcerminers to avoid pirates as well as well as making it easier for pirateswarring corps to find targets hence a removal of all or part of the intel gathering features of local chat would make things harder for both sidesnow the first feature of local chat that i am suggesting be removed is the instantaneous display of a players name and portrait to the chat window of other players when they enter the system as well as the instantaneous display of everyone elses names and portraits to that player upon entering the system this quite frankly gives everyone too much info without having to work for it i suggest that this feature be changed to the delayed chat update that displays a persons name and portrait only when someone speaks in local chat this would as i said make it harder for both predator and prey so it wouldnt cause any imbalance second it would make the game so much more fun which is of course the point of a game you could enter a system as a pirate and not know if it was chock full of npcers and miners ripe for the picking or if you would be chasing other pirates around the whole time  lol   as an npcerminer you would have just a little more adrenaline pumping through your veins  mining and adrenaline who wouldve thunk it   because you never know when a pirate would show up on the scannerwhats that shnergin scanner you say yes you would most definitely still have some warning of a pirate being in the system because they would show up on the scanner when close enough after all they usually try to use the directional scanner to find you and if they can see you on the scanner then you can see them you only see their ship of course but if an interceptor or recon ship shows up on your scanner you can be fairly certain it is a pirate tackler perhaps for a larger gang not on the scanner yetnow not all information from local would or could be removed for instance im fairly certain that you would still be notified when someone enters a system because the little number that indicates how many people are in local might have to stay i say this because that information is accessible in a way through the galaxy map by coloring stars by average pilots in space in the last 30 minutes im not sure if this information is delayed and i know it doesnt technically show you the current local count but an increase in this number over time indicates someone jumped in personally i would like the number of people in local to be removed as well but if that means people will resort to constant checking of the galaxy map then dont take it out just to cause an annoyance like thatone last area that needs to be covered is when someones portrait should disappear from local chat a timer from when they last spoke would be most appropriate i think as having them disappear only when they leave system would provide unneeded intel and discourage talkinggetting close to my character limit so let me know what you think if you would suggest different changes then post them and give a thumbs up only for the opinion that local needs some kind of changethis is my main and only character it might just be my first post i dont recalledit grammar
just want a little room here to link to  possible   later replies and ideas in  possible   future pages of the thread and to give myself a thumbs up 
on one hand reconnaissance is a good thing especially in a game  you dont want pirates getting even more bored for lack of a target on the other hand too much recon is a bad thing since it makes things too easy for all involved the goal should be for any player who is looking to be able to find without too much difficulty and to make chat channels not be an intel source the bit about making local not be an intel source is easy enough  either make it an optional channel along with corp and alliance for that matter  why does the game force me to keep open windows i dont want   or make it a facesnotshown channel like npc corp chat or even both but there needs to be compensation  you cant just have everybody flying around blind the current onboard scanner is a good start but it needs some work for starters its range is too short for a proper system scanner  i know why its 2147483647 metres 2311 for those of you less mathematically inclined   but 143 au isnt nearly enough for a system scanner how about you remove that cap and make the time go from being a flat scan time to being based on how much volume youre scanning say 1 second per au at 5 degrees 2 at 30 3 at 60 4 at 90 6 at 180 and 10 at 360 have a skill that reduces scan times by 10 per level or something just to make it not take an obscenely long time for bigger scans also there needs to be some refinements to the process first off the aim point for the scan needs to be made explicit  perhaps have a scan cone show up when you have the scanner window open secondly while filtering by overview settings is nice some added filtering options are needed most notably exclude last scans results also im tempted to suggest either an advanced skill or a module to allow you to get better results from your scan data  heres a  very   rough draft of what i meanscan filtering  rank 3 science tree int primary mem secondary  this skill allows the onboard scanner to receive added information when scanninglevel 1 allows display of the objects type eg drakecaldari control tower small   instead of merely its class eg shipstarbase structure  level 2 allows display of the objects current speedlevel 3 allows display of whether the object is currently occupiedlevel 4 allows display of objects current hp if you want this skill to be really good make it absolute hp if you want it to be less good just a percentage of each type  level 5 allows display of the object owners name ie ship pilot or pos owning corp  this will be autolinked to allow for fast show info  itd be cheap and have pretty low requisites to allow new players to make use of it properly
this is stupidfor more information see thiscloaking ships are already powerful enough there is no reason to make them the only ship worth flying for roaming
what if they added a skill that gave you a chance to scan through a cloak say 10 per level for a standard cloak and 5 per level for a cov ops cloak   would that address your balance concerns you do have a very good point here but im loath to say that the current form of local is the only solution to the problem of cloaks being too good
i agree that the main problem will be with cloaking ships i know they dont show up on probe scans but i was under the impression that they showed up on directional scans just a week ago i was able to see a force recon ship sneaking up on me using the directional scanner  and i let it happen so i could fight him   if cloaked ships dont show up on the directional scanner then it will be easy for them to sneak up on an npcerminer making this change unbalanced towards piracy perhaps a slight change needs to be made to cloaks too then either herschels suggestion or perhaps making them show up on the directional scanner 100 of the time but with no distance listed then if you happen to notice them on the scanner you dont know if theyre right next to you or at a planeton the topic of surprise attacks its entirely possible under my proposed changes to sneak up on an npcerminer in an uncloaked ship by not scanning for it and simply warping to a belt that is out of scan range and hoping to get lucky youll only show up on the npcerminers scanner for the few seconds of warping however you have no guarantee that anyone will be at the belt to attacki think that some ability to sneak around the directional scanners limitations is a good thing but that cloaked ships with a gang out of scan range will be bad for gameplay
nope they do not when they are cloaked are you sure it was a force recon and not a combat recon you were looking atif you read the link you will understand why you cant just let cloaking ships show up on the scanner even in that mannerany mechanic that replaces local needs to have pretty much the same functionality as local does currently you need to be able to know who is in system and you need to be able track them down and kill them if you do not risk is increased people will blob up gate camps will become more powerful as will traps of all sort combat will become more scarce as people are more hesitant to engage without clear superiority and larger as people cling to numbers for security the problems associated with local have little to nothing to do with the mechanic itself but the mechanics that allow you to run from combat specifically cloaking and logging off fix the problems associated with running and you fix all the complaints about the local channelthis runs to two problems1 everyone will be hitting the scan button every 5 seconds 2 this is a game between the carebears and the attackers the carebares need to be able to get away its not like they are going to be able to defend themselves from an attacking gang
 goumindongi did read the post that you linked to but that post indicated that the current local functionality should be included in the scanner meaning that you could see both what ships are out there as well as who is piloting each i dont think peo
i would love an amount of randomness in missionsone idea would be to set a bounty limit for a mission ships of the appropriate type could then be randomly selected until the bounty is reached for example mission x has a total bounty of 100k this could be a large load of frigates or a cruiser with some drone support etc but the bounties all total around 100k would still want to limit the kinds of ships that can appear in certain missions  wouldnt want a battleship appearing in a l1 for example  but some randomization would be nice
now this i can go for youll need to make sure your npc tables are variable enough to make this randomness actually matter but i think thats largely satisfied by the current system
i agree compeltely also remove the tie between sec difference for highsec doing missions in a 1005 is on the same magnitude of risk lowsec missions should keep the increased rewards
i agreeapart from the recent introduction of faction drones the only loving drones have got in the last two years has been some improvements on drone ai and some extra nifty interface improvementsthen again drones have a pretty stand alone set of skillz and the other weapon systems only have the single unique weapon upgrade albeit that they do have named and t2 variants i think with the introduction of named and t2 variants of the drone upgrades the droneloving community would be quite happy for quite sometimewe have also had the introduction of ew logistic and combat utility drones so were not that hard done by edit i just read the entirity of the op and i see that i failed to grasp the your point your issue being with the role that drones have in combat im not sure that drones were ever meant to be more than a secondary weapon platform or as a primary weapon platform on supportspecialist ships ie my explorer of doom ive got a huge amount of sps in drones but will look to my hislots for primary dmg unless ive got some other role in gang logi ew smoking phat cones etc
again not wanting a changenot wanting your opinion on their use or how you thing ccp has treated their implementationi am asking for someone to ask the devs about what are their intentions for drones are they supposed to be primary weapons systems will they introduce any implants for them will they expand on them or keep making them secondary or support weapons systems and a whole lot of questions that only ccp can answerare drones a dead end support only due to lag considerationsthis also includes the answer being posted for all to seenow if you support this question being asked please say soif you dont want someone to ask ccp about drones say sooutside that there is little to discussthank you
i like the idea maybe let the wreck be accessed in space like a pos array only its your personal hangar so you can try to save your stuff but cant refit or anything also could allow the rebuilding of the wrecked startion for 5075 of the costa true 100 wiped out outpost idea would be cool but i cant see it going in simply because lots of players would stick to npc stations when able if it means they could login one day and find their assets gone forever that were in a stationespecially players that come back after a long time
yes
nothing would make the largest alliances in the game even stronger than they are today now not only would we get to take your space but we wouldnt have to bother defending it after destroying your stationsunless you want to make large alliances even stronger and make small ones even weaker you will vote to not present this to ccp
for me it feels wrong as well that anything a player can build cannot be destroyed by other playershowever i think the conqereble stations should be included in the list of destroyeble structures these were the first iteration of player owned stations and they should be included in the same mechanicsi agree that a station should be taken and controlled before it can be destroyed i also think that a cost reduction for reconstruction is a good idearusing the pos based corp hanger mechanic to access your hanger in a destroyed pos also feels right somehow even including the refit option normaly availeble in this mechanic does not feel immersionbreaking to me
as horribly painful as it is for me to agree with goumindong i do on this issueweak alliances are only allowed to exist in 00 because taking their space would overextend the powerhouse alliances if stations were destructible the powerhouses would mow them over pop the stations and move onit sounds great at first glance but in reality it simply wouldnt work its taken years for 00 infrastructure to become what it is destructible stations would make 00 a no mans land with a handful of superpowerful citadels occupied by bob a and the like

this is the only feature i miss from wow there reporting for spam was an option right under block in the rclick menu from a persons name on the chat window in eve im usually busy and cant be bothered to stop every 10 minutes to report the new spammer whos showed up on local and write out a petition i did it the first few times but havent for a while i just block nownote that the report spam option also automatically blocked the person being reported
they annoy
concur this statment this should be a mandatory feature
beaverid tesu s plutonianthats a feature that needs to be impemented if this  goes through i want a graphic depiction alsoenough said
or how about thisbeaverid tesu slices plutonians neck ear to ear saws off her head takes a sht in her mouth urinates on the rest of her corpse and puts it in a public area of the station
sounds like someone has some personal problems trouble getting along with others perhapsits okay no one really thinks youre a social failure and wants you out of the corp killboard stats will most certainly gloss over any shortcomings right
it needs some sort of combatdoesnt have to mean death   but i would like to see something bad happen like you wake up with beers on your tab
eve  a fpstrying to make it into one will kill the game on so many levels
where is he taking about making it an fps he just want the visual emote not damage done to the other character as a public humiliation for his bad understandingfunny as it is it probably doesnt fit the evil dark mood of eve so highly likely not going to happenstill i support it as that a high number of visiual emotes between characters should be integrated into ambulation
now alot of us have flown in and around 00 space and i know that pretty much anything goes and im all for this and such but one thing i believe should not be allowed is afk cloaking it considerably slows the game down especially when you want to go out and ratmine etc etcnow this is not to say all cloaking is bad i like it but i logged out at the we hours this morning and when i left we had 4 hostiles somewhere afk cloaked in our system just sat god only knows whereive come back online this afternoon and low and behold the afk cloakers are still there  what a surprise   so i was wondering maybe ccp would engage me on this topic alone if anything and state what or even if there going to consider doing something about this maybe a max time your ship can stay cloaked or anti cloak device or something to make it a bit more worthwhile then having peeps drop in cloak and afk it for hours on endadded note also please dont criticise the grammer or whatever i went through it twice and got everything on the second pass also its comments like that that make me think that people on the boards dont give a monkeys about anyone but themselfs or thier wallets just goes to show that when an average joe turns up with a comment the snotty people show up in force and disrespect him

how do you know there afk i sit coaked for hours sometimes collecting intel i get the hey we know you here blah blah smack ref to mother blah blah and i dont say anything im not there to fight im there to gatehr asmuch info on your movements docking areas safe spots and such so how would you treat me as compared to afk players how would you makeit to where the afk gets uncloaked yet i dont or is that your point that cloaked ships should be detectable
when you say hours did you mean 23 hours or like 1216 in the case of some people who do it down here and yes i would like to see cloaked ships detectable it would make for an interesting change tbh
different aggression timers for different shipclassesgood ideai support
oh my god im agreeing with a goon as well
this is a serious issue that needs addressing aggro timer is universally too short at the moment and is certainly too short for large and capital ship classes ill be happy to advocate this issue
this ship needs to be able to do its job at the very least with less fitting issues its not appealing in any way other than the tank and the drake makes a perfectly good brick as it is

i understand that this may cause extra load on the servers but probably little more load than creating a contract with the item  which lists the contents of the container the container can appear on the assets screen and simply be another expandable node the contents of which are not populated until the container is selected then the contents could be cached on the client  at least for containers in your own personal hangar since you are the only one with access to the container and therefore the only one with the ability to change the contents

bs fleets can beat cynojammed sytems with caps with planning seen it done multiple times to at least 4 allaincesi like the way the work now
yesespecially the personal assets changes this is a game that is heavy on logistics yet the tools it gives to manage them are sorely lacking yet begging for these basic features
big support especially since i just removed a column from my overview to effectively give ew icons a column by leaving part of it empty
nice suggestions
signedmainly for the assests search idea i totaly agree with being able to search for a class of ship rather than specific name like you said eg drake when battlecruiser would suficegood ideas all round

have a look at the average station in eve you might notice a few hundred windows  or huge transparent coverings in some minmatar stations   and yet if you want to know if the station is being camped you need to either send out a disposable alt get a friend to come and have a look or take your life in your handsgoing through this rigmarole feels silly breaks immersion and has no real justification maybe an argument could be made that it prevents people from simply staying docked up but if someone is really scared about going from black screen on undock to clone bay theyre likely to be using one of the roundabout methods of checking the undock anyway and given the normal degree of services available saying that the station owners wont tell you whats outside doesnt quite ring true  and thats assuming the owner of the station isnt your alliance  what id propose is getting your normal inspace view centered on the station and overview as with normal flight you can move the camera and look at other ships in the grid  though not target them  
i believe ccp has said this would be horribly laggy but i cant find a quote to back me up on that also what ship are you playing with that you cant survive 30 seconds against the average station camp
my arguments for this feature dont include im getting killed by station camps generally i get a warning from someone in alliance my point is i shouldnt need to rely on those over just being able to look outsideif lag is an issue then maybe a simple ability to reproduce your overview in a station seeing ships in the local area
posted with alt there
i agree there should definitely be some way of knowing that theres a camp outside besides undocking if lag is the only reason this isnt implemented then perhaps have a button thats similar to the undock button but that simply takes you to the outside view of the station  view centered on station   there would be an overview and everything you just wouldnt be able to go anywhere because you arent in a ship and you also wouldnt be able to use the look at function for items on the overview no extra lag would be caused by this that wouldnt be caused by undocking also people in station wouldnt cause any lag either because no functionality is being added to the normal instation functions
wow it would cause lag how does that make any sensethe player in question isnt moving or affecting anything in the game at all all hes doing is looking at what the server is already thinking about from the perspective of the stationand it wouldnt be something every player is doing all the time anyway looking outside would be a service or an option while docked and most players  read as those not worried about station camps   would have no reason to use itregardless i support this idea
some new drone mods would be tasty and herschel yamamoto has some great ideas
agreed
remove insurance on capital ships  or only give default payments  if insurance was added to help players out it shouldnt be there for capitals because if you can fly a capital youre a big boygirl now and dont need your hand held

first off ill say to take my post with a goodsized grain of salt  ive never even seen a capital on tranquility and the only time ive ever fooled around with them outside eft was on armageddon day im getting this from eft values from talking to some friends in 00 and from what i hear via forums and the grapevine in general ill split up my concerns by class first up carriers frankly i dont see a lot of problems with carriers they lag systems to hell and as such the old drone interfacing fix comes to mind 1 drone  20 drone damage and hp   but aside from that they seem reasonable theyre essentially superbattleships  cost 510x as much gank 50100 harder tank about 3x as well and have about 10x the hp that seems like a perfectly reasonable endgame generalist ship  cheap enough for the moderately wealthy functional against any size of target and hard to kill without being win buttons the only thing that makes them brutal to fight is the fact that they use high slots for logistics instead of needing to put weapons there but that just leads to roles for subcapital support fleets in the form of cap warfare and jamming aside from lag fixes and fixes to make them less good at some of their less inrole functions ie the corporate hangar nerf   leave carriers alone motherships get a lot more intimidating but at 30x the cost of a carrier theyre supposed to be they are only tackleable by a limited range of shipsmodules all of which it has the firepower to burn down quickly short of a screw the ammo just ram it approach or lag hell its pretty hard to kill a mom and they have almost as much firepower in a capital fight as a rangefit dread to boot but frankly for a ship that costs north of 20 billion this again doesnt seem unreasonable theyre hard to kill but the loss inflicted when you do seems to balance them out enough for my tastes dreadnoughts are where we start running into problems not problems with the ship class itself aside from the naglfar which needs a boost   but problems with the whole structure of 00 warfare that make the ship unreasonable put simply as long as sovereignty rests on poses the dreadnought class will be far more important than it ought to be because dreads are the only ships that can take down a pos bubble in reasonable fashion as such an invasion of a system consists of putting together a dread fleet running it headlong into all their poses and waiting for their dreads to show up and try to stop you since nothing else will be able to do the job   the result is blobby laggy death and because the grinds through systems are so slow the natural disadvantages of dreads  theyre slow unwieldy and live on a diet of pure cargo space  dont really make themselves felt because theres more than enough time to be leisurely about applying your thousands of dps my suspicion is that if you base sovereignty on something other than poses like stargates   youll actually find dreads becoming far less relevant just because there will be so much less for them to shoot at after all a dread fighting battleships does less dps than a carrier at twice the cost titans are an even bigger problem of course but im running out of characters for this post i hate these forums   so ill split up my post and address titans in part 2
okay titans the biggest baddest most terrifying ships in the game capable of hammering entire fleets into dust in seconds and the most important parts of their fit are istabs and a cloak if this isnt distilled insanity i dont know what is  ships that could ebay for the price of a decent car and theyre fit out like babys first iteron the reason for this is simple of course  their stats are currently such that the correct way of using them isnt as a command ship or a mobile station or anything else of that nature but rather like a hand grenade  toss it frag a room and get the hell out asap theres no conceivable incentive for a titan to actually fight because they can only fire one weapon an hour so they get off that shot and then get as far away from anything that could possibly tackle them as they can and of course if they do get into a fight they dont tank any better than a carrier and dont have any way of actually contributing except by being a magnet for enemy fire ive seen a lot of proposed solutions to this  mostly based around killing their ability to safe up and cloak  but none of them appeal to me a better alternative is to make it so that they dont run at all make them ships that can stand in fleet battles and actually have a role to play and make it so that they cant get out of dodge just by fitting up a couple of stinking istabs to dodge the tackle the first thing that seems obvious to me is giving them a true supercapital tank instead of one smaller than a dread has a titan is a massive ship and it deserves a massive tank of some variety either give them enough cap to run an extra repperbooster or give them a huge rep bonus 20level   or even both it should be hard as hell to kill one and not just because theyve left the field survivability matters here  if they cant dodge a fight and cant survive one they become an extinct class hoarded for their jump bridge nobody wants that secondly the current timer on a doomsday is 15 seconds this isnt nearly long enough  it promotes hitandrun not standandfight make it 60  you wont see unsupported titan drops that way i guarantee it to avoid making the ddd obsolete due to friendly fire maybe make it work like a remote ecm burst  aoe at a range itll still blueonblue anything that gets in the way but it should be easier to keep your support fleet outside its range without forcing them offgrid entirely im not sure thats the right solution but its the best ive come up with to prevent the fleet supporting your titan from being another four titans make the doomsday have a sig radius but adjust its damage to match two million base damage at 10 km sig should keep your titans well apart from each other while still inflicting around 80k damage base on a battleship 30k base on a cruiser and 10k base on a frigate which should clean out their t1 ships real good also it acts as a minor mwd nerf if youre so inclined  not especially relevant in fleet but it can be nice on top of that it needs a way to stay relevant in fleet once the ddd is gone im almost perverse enough to suggest letting it fit a siege module as a solution  2x the dps of a dread baby  but i dont think thats quite the goal similarly the idea of a focused annihilation script for a ddd that deletes the cooldown is appealing but im not sure its correct i think the easiest way of doing this would be to make the titans gang bonus only apply to ships ongrid with it  it still cant fight for itself but it can do a number on you with its buddies also it makes it a lot easier to fix the ragnaroks currentlylame bonus  have it be 10 or even 15 sig per level and the gjallarhorn have the biggest aoe of the ddds so that your fleet gets a free 50 or 75 doomsday damage theres more i might say later but thats all i have to add on combat damn im verbose also heres a thumb for you
while i understand that ccp feels that capitals are pushing out sub capitals look at what most modern navies are likethe usa navy for example has 0 battleships and several aircraft carriers why most commanders realize the usefulness of a multifunctional ship like a carrier and the inherent limitations of battleships and their kin dreadnoughts in real life as in eve the only real use for bss is to blow up other bss however bss are easy targeted by bombersso heres my suggestion first introduce bombers theyre about the same size as a fighter but move much slower but do a great deal of damage when they drop their bombs second reduce the hps of fighters to a very low level and increase their spread while reducing their damage the role of a bomber should be antiship the role of a fighter should be antifighterinterceptorbomber the idea is to force the carrier pilot to have to pick what he or she will fill his or her drone bay with and what he or she should launch theyll have to use bombers if they want to deal any real damage to ships like bses but will need to escort their bombers toandfrom their targets unless they want them to be shot down on titansi think titans really really need to be defined better then fathers of the fleet i mean wtf is that suppose to mean does it have hot space sex with motherships who give birth to thousands of little frigates who grow into more titans and moms id really really like to see ccp revisit this ship and a give it a more defined role and b make sure it works in that role and c no nerfs or at least nothing game changing like removing the dddnow from my understanding titans are basically suppose to be most useful to alliances but this isnt really helpful now if we look at titans as if theyre suppose to be mobile stations then we need to introduce station related bonuses like the ability to research bpos and build items like ammo if it is suppose to be a mobile station then the ddd should only be usable as a defensive measure and only when the titan is deployed to station mode anywaysinsert wall of text here
well if you insist okay more titans noncombat titans this time though titans are in addition to their role as pimpedout rides for the fc are supposed to act as mobile stations as it stands they just dont yes they have a clone bay and a small hangar and yes it has some uses but an outpost its not so in the spirit of the clone vat bay i heres some potential modules for titan highslots all of them are 100000 grid and 100 cpu just to make the numbers easy also none of them should require the ship to stop moving  the labs and factories cant really handle it and before i continue yes i acknowledge my likely insanity mobile refinery iallows refining of items in the corporate hangar and cargo bay 0 base efficiency requires mobile refinery operation i  edit skill to add 5 per level efficiency  accelerated mobile factory iadds one factory slot usable by the titan pilot or a player docked in the maintenance bay works at 500 speed adds 100 wastage requires mobile factory operation i  edit skill to reduce wastage by 10 per level  efficient mobile factory iadds ten factory slots usable by the titan pilot or a player docked in the maintenance bay adds 100 wastage requires mobile factory operation i  edit skill to reduce wastage by 10 per level  mobile laboratory iadds one research slot of each type usable by the titan pilot or a player docked in the maintenance bay 50 research speed requires mobile laboratory operations i  reduces penalty by 5 per level  there are few enough titan pilots that the existing stockpoles of mfo and mro might be sufficient but failing that seed them on market at a couple billion so none of the investors lose money and of course mlo will be the same price and will require science v and laboratory operation v   and last but not leastmobile cynosural jammer iprevents the opening of noncovert cynosural fields in system displays on overview for all pilots in system as a cynosural field   requires propulsion jamming v anchoring vwell if theyre going to be a mobile station why not ducks flamethrower
supported in general id love to see titans changed to actually be involved in fighting and not just hit and runs
i dont i repeat dont want to see these as modules they should be inherent ablities native to titans and other ships except for the mobile cynosural jammer
not the response i was expecting admittedly the reason i went for modules is that it both allows for customization and it gives titans something to do with all those useless high slots they have besides throw on random warfare links and smartbombs its not like they actually use guns after all making them inherent could work too the biggest problem with the modulebased version is that titans go offline during downtime and this does solve that however it still seems wrong to me somehow  maybe its the idea of people sitting inside researching blueprints as the ship is jump bridging in an assault fleet but that seems a little too generalist

the bounty hunting system is weak bounty hunters in eve dont exist but they really really should this is one way to help do it
i support this idea killrights should be tradable
i have been wondering about this topic for some time traditionally bounty hunters are paid to do their job how will it be possible to have a bounty hunting system where the bounty hunter has to pay the victim for the right to shoot the criminal if the bounty hunters only income is the criminals bounties and gear how will any selfrespecting bounty hunter be able to support themselves most of the guys with bounties on them are already 5 or lower and looting pvp gear does not support a pvp lifestylei would be grateful if anyone could clear up my confusion
anything that allows for more pvp is fine by me
ive just looked at all the numbers to see if you have a point and im not sure that you do blasters do the highest dps at the shortest range with middling tracking and fitting requirements pulse lasers have the longest range middle dps but terrible tracking and fitting requirements autocannons track a bit better than blasters are a bit easier to fit but do the lowest dps of the group the easiest comparison is between the unnamed t1 biggest gun of each class neutron mega and 800   theyve all got the same rof which makes them a lot easier to compare directly the damage mods are 35 3 and 2695 meaning that the autocannon does 77 of the damage of a blaster its got 2 km less optimal and 6 km more falloff meaning only a marginal increase in range it tracks marginally worse it uses 250 less grid and 16 less cpu which is actually significant as well as using no capacitor which is nice especially when facing cap warfare   but these arent worth giving up a quarter of your dps for as a rule in fact a maelstrom fitting 800mms versus neutrons will get less damage from the autocannons using t1 ammo and only about 3 more with t2 ammo with allv skills and 8x t2 guns it gets 450 dps with antimatter 423 with emp 539 with hail and 525 with void   this is a ship with a projectile bonus and the hybrid is still doing almost identical damage the pulse laser comparison is less direct since the numbers dont line up nearly so well the autocannon does 90 of the dps tracks 28 better has significantly less range 416 km vs 208   and takes 500 grid and 11 cpu less theres no minmatar ship that does better with pulses than autocannons and of course pulse lasers are pigs for capacitor 53 caps per gun with multi fully skilled   whereas autocannons use none all that said theres also the fact that the races are optimized a bit differently blasters are supposed to be the best shortranged weapon type  no ship can do dps as well as a gallentean blaster boat especially once you factor in the plussized drone bays and thats intentional and highly unlikely to change  its part of racial balance not just balance between different weapon types blasters do ludicrous dps but they have infinitesimal range take cap and cant change damage type pulses have good range and middling damage but they take a lot of cap cant change damage type generally doing the worst type at that   and arent as good closein due to their lack of tracking tldr  autocannons do crappy dps but they arent as bad as they look the rest of the difference can be chalked up to the fact that theyre supposed to be bad bane i see where youre coming from here but im afraid i cant agree when they knock 25 off the speed of minmatar ships they can feel free to add 25 to their autocannon dps until then ill let racial balancing take its natural course
willing to give a thumbs up on the conditional that an explanation is given as to cap usage  blasterspulses do more dps but also use cap i agree minnie bs need some help but at the same time i wouldnt want ccp to create a close range monster where autos suddenly have huge dps with no drawbacks
the issue is neither minmatar bs nor is it large autocannons two of the minmatar bs are perfectly fine in their current iterations when using autocannonsthe maelstrom and typhoonbooting those will give an unnecessary boost to both those two ships which need nothing as well as may impact the balance of other ships as autocannons are the near universal choice of supplementaryunbonused turret  the problem is only in the tempest and only due to the tempest not being properly engineered to deal with the inherent problems of low optimal high falloff weapns that is large autocannons are to be used within a tight optimal window and are fit on a ship class which is heavy and cumbersome this makes it take more time for the ship to achieve that tight window which reduces its effectiveness boosting the weapons directly changes the racial characteristics towards a more homogeneous form changing the ships to be less heavy and cumbersome pushes out smaller ships as the larger one hedges out the agility and speed niche filled by smaller onesyou should not bring this issue to ccp
hey hey goumidong shut it we know you wouldnt like this change as its not buffing your precious amarr
actually i find large autocannons to perform perfectly fine them not needing cap is a real bonus in close quarters which nicely offsets the somewhat weaker dps not to mention them stretching out nicely into medium rangeotoh large  and medium   arties need help badly as them not using cap is relatively inconsequential but their dps is teh suck and their variable damage type advantage is something of a joke too
his suggested fix was buffing the tempest to be quicker and more agile how are you interpreting that as mindless amarrian partisanship
464 dps with t2 ammo on a ship with double dps bonus and a gyrostab isnt fun  
gouming youve gotten better over the past few weeks but youre still no where close to bane shut up and get out
i support the opacs should get some more damage o
actually its 100 cube bandwidth 300 cube bay that i am more pushing for the phoon and maelstrom have been engineered properly and are fine ships when using acs one of these will use only acs in its high slots so clearly there isnt a problem with the weaponsand if there is it means you have to nerf the phoon and the maelstrom in your quest to boost the tempest its a lot easier to just boost the tempest
phoon gets only 200 dps from acs doesnt look like a minnie ship to me
the typhoon has more unique weapon systems than any other ship in the game  it uses guns missiles and drones as primary sources of damage only the naglfar even comes close to that status and even then the drones are a lot less relevant as such its probably the worst battleship in the game since its the only one whose bonuses help it so little but my typhoon hatred aside its not supposed to do obscene ac damage since it also gets 300 dps from drones and 300 dps from torpedoes 200 ac dps is hardly the problem
so what do you see the role of a battleship being if you think its acceptable to do crappy dpsits also a myth that minmatar bs  that rely on acs   have a speedagility advantage the tempest is barely any quicker than a hyperion with the same mass and agility maelstrom is heavy and slow and nothing like a minmatar bs typhoon doesnt need acs it relys on torps and droneschalked up theyre supposed to be bad wtf nothing in eve is meant to be bad or theres no point using it theyre meant to perform equally through different methods and quite simply they dontits more than acs its the ammos were a long way from when emp was a great ammo with active hardeners being the only real way to tank nevermind hail that makes acs have less range than blastersof course the end performance is important so relys on the ship hull a lotmaelstrom is totally not minmatar in style and limited to active tanking hides ac damage as it can fit 3 gyrostempest relys a lot on base damage due to slot layout meaning limited damage modules and for a ship woth rof and dmg bonus its rubbish same mass and agility as hyperionmegathron and barely anymore speedtyphoon relys on torps and drones and only has one bonus effectively as 1st bonus for 4 weapons and 2nd bonus for 4 weapons where other ships have 1 bonus for 8 weapons at least it has minmatar speed mass and sig even though the nanophoon days are long gone except for bumpingtldr tweak acs themselves a bit  such as falloff and falloff per tier  fix ammos that no longer have the benifit they were given lower damage for and hail that sucks with optimal and falloff penalty
we can ignore the quality of autocannons on the maelstrom because it it is slow and sluggishman what
i approve this message
this side of eve could really do with some new content and improvements
the eve economy is just not realistic because there is no product differentiation aside point of sale and pricebut allowing people to make their own custom modules and ships is a can of worms not least because it has the potential to cause an explosion in the number of items in the items dbthus i think your list is good but isnt going to fix the fundamental problem
i have no experience with the industry side of eve that said anything that will make their lives easier sounds good to me it can only lead to lower prices  o

every gtc that is sold for isk is perminantly appied to a players account sure i dont like the fact that people with rl money can take advantage of the game but all that rl money is going to ccp to maintain and develope the game
no but as there is always in and outflux of people demand will never dissipate so you are wrong sorry
wrongan isk sink must by definition require a regular flow of isk out of the game most people who can afford very expensive implants are going to plug them into worthwhile characters and such characters will likely be sold to someone  or given to a friend   if they leave the gamevery few players are going to terminate an account with characters on it that are so valuableno isk sink youre wrong
permanently applied to a players account huh isk moves from character to character account to account many rich players exist in eve through gtc sales and not hard work plenty of folks buy expensive implants and expensive ship with gtc money and not hard work

as a falcon pilot i dont think theyre imbalanced when im not in mine and my gang comes across one or two we figure out a way to deal with them sometimes we dont have a good solution but usually we do if its a roaming gang you send one fast ship at it to go harass it and that poor falcon cant fight back at all it just sits there being scared and will warp out or succumb to fofs or drones its not like it has any dps worth mentioningthat said i also would not consider a small reduction in the falcons range to be out of the question
there are loads of counters to falcons and ecm boats in general range and ecm is their only real tankif your small gang only consists of slow short range high damage ships then long range ecm is the perfect counter and you wonder why it seems overpoweredyes a falcon the biggest threat to a small gang this doesnt mean it should be nerfed
i think id rather try and explain the problem one more time instead of commenting on each of the replies it seems to me that people dont understand the situation and therefore dont see the need for the changelets take a theoretical example of a 3 vs 3 on a gate in low sec all of them flying battleships outlaws t2 fits and with max skills the outcome of the fight is now decided by tactic and fitting of the 2 gangslets add one force recon to one of the sides and see how they can influence the fightrapier40km web range and 63km paint range it can effectively stop a spider tank if it webs the bs when they decloak at gate it has to stay within range all of the bs to be effective even if it stay at max range it can be attacked by missiles drones and ewpilgrim125km nosneut and 101km tracking disruption if it stays out at 100km range and disrupts turret ships it is still possible to counter with missiles and sentry drones arazu48km warp disruption and 63km remote sensor dampener can dampen 1 ship down to 1214km target range if it dampens all ships down they can still fight the other bs if it try to take out one bs the other bs can still attack the arazufalcon228km ecm range can jamm multiple bs probably all of them unless they have 2x eccm fitted none of the bs is able to target the falcon when they are not jammed the falcon will effectively prohibit a spider tank the bs can not attack the falconwhen setup for max range there is no way of countering the falcon in the above scenario while the 3 other force recons is possible to attackcounter the only viable counter to a long range falcon in low sec is nano ships  long range jamming was previously the domain of the rook to successfully fly a long range rook you would actually have to pilot it lots of tactics could be applied against a rook  mostly before the fight   but most important even if it could stay out of range the other side had the chance to scout it out first to discover a long range jammer before the actual fight is extremely important since it is out of range during the fight it is not possible to scout a cloaked falconthe falcon is now the new long range jammer it has taken the place of the rook  which is now obsolete   it requires little to none skill to fly a falcon this way you can just park a cloaked falcon alt out at 200km and use it when needed there is no other ship that requires so little personal skill to fly and has such a huge impact on pvp i dont understand why the falcon is considered broken if it cannot perform and do exactly the same as a rookthere could be many ways to fix the falcon give it more low slots give it a drone bay give it a ecm drone bonus give it anything but it should like with the rest of the force recons require some personal skill to successfully use a falcon in pvp now its just decloak  jamm  cloak preferably with an falconalt200km range tripple ecmbonus and cov ops cloak is 3 powerful attributes combine them all on one ship and it becomes overpowerededit spelling
wow this thread is full of garbage  not from the op he is correct  the biggest problem is that the most effective counter to a falcon is to bring another falcon of your own here are some of the counters proposed so far1 fit eccm guess what 1x eccm on a battleship will make a good skilled falcon with racials have a one in three chance of a jam per jammer im sorry but sacrificing a med slot to make you resistant to jamming should do a whole hell of alot more than taking your chance of getting jammed from 1 in 2 to 1 in 3 honestly i think eccm should give around a 200 bonus taking a 22 sensor strength battleship to around 66 jammers still have a chance of working agianst that just like they have a chance agianst carriers now but at least a falcon wont still cripple your gang even when you fit to counter it2 bring a sniper ok so you bring a sniper apoc assuming that the falcon doesnt jam it then the sniper will hit with one salvo and the falcon will warp off at this point the falcon is free to warp back in and try to jam the apoc agian but meanwhile your gang is left with a sniper while the enemy gang is left with a cloaked falcon if your sniper warped in at zero and is right in the thick of the fight the enemy gang can melt him almost instantly then the falcon is free to decloak and jam with impunity if your sniper came at range then the falcon can come back in at range from an opposite direction and be out of the snipers range of course there is nothing to stop the sniper from trying to chase the falcon around but the falcon is a cloaker and it warps quite a bit faster than a slow battleship will 3 burn to the falcon with a tackler ok so you send an inty or a hac to the falcon and try to lock him down and kill him one racial jammer is good enough to absolutely permajam  as in jam str  sensor str   anything up to a hac and in some cases a command ship something like an ishtar might be able to make the falcon warp out and back in to get the drones off but thats about it to really kill a falcon you are looking at a couple nano recon ships minimum preferably with eccm fit i personaly have only lost my falcon once to a huginn and vaga that burned to me even then if i wasnt running the falcon as an alt while i concentrated on my main in a battleship i would have warped out if they started to get near scram range and i didnt have jams on them yet i am hardly a perfect falcon pilot i know a better undistracted falcon pilot would have easily escaped that situation now for the real falcon counter5 bring your own falcon if you bring your own falcon then you have a chance to jam him first and then jam the rest of the enemies with impunity if the falcon jams you either warp back in and try agian or pick a spot out of his range at the worst you force a breakeven situation where you both are able to jam the damage dealers and the fight is ballanced in fact an even better tactic would be to bring two or three falcons and jam three times as many targets if you have three falcons and the enemy doesnt target is the only word to properly describe their ships
i completely agree with the op we cant have a onetrickpony that actually does that one trick well can wein addition it is against caldari design principles to have a ship that is actually useful
this issue is difficult to describe and can have many meanings but overall it is characterized by a marginalization of subfleet ships when considered alongside battleshipsthe discussion at the csm would be an exhaustive analysis and discussion of battleships effects on the game what the problems are  if any   and possible approaches to alleviating the problems concrete solutions might not be included but if the overall result is an expansion of ccps perspective on battleship overproliferation then progress has been madethis would include discussion of  battleship overabundance  t2rig  only the superrich can afford to regularly fly and lose fleet ships  see divide and stratification    sniper fleets and what can be done about them  the divide between veterans and new players  the stratification between powergamers and more casual players  effects on eve warfare  revisiting new antifleet features and ships such as the titan imbalances within battleship classes themselves  eg underpowered minmatar fleet ships  even if you dont think that anything should be changed at allthe bottom line here is this ccp has stated that they feel that battleships are crowding out subfleetships and something has to be done ccp changing something with battleships is inevitable and it is in everyones best interest to use the opportunity presented by the csm to discuss this issue with the developersneglecting to bring this up at the csm would be a huge waste of an opportunity i have a notion that the csm was created with this issue specifically in mind among a few other topicsshow your support if you feel compelled to do so
i see what you did therewasnt funny though
i just see a lot of words here and little meaning to them tbh
sums up this thread nicely
i agree if they put the votingsupport aspect in an ideasissues forum that would be awesome but the csm serves no unique purpose just a few redundant onesediti find it funny that if this thread gets the 5 support it needs the csm will bring it up and then not escalate it to ccp the system works
i do not agree to this proposalthe csm had barely time to get started and because we do not see immidiate results the first call for stopping the csm i think it will take at the very least 6 month before we can really assess what good or bad the csm did besides this first csm has a harder time then any other who will follow in their steps becaue they have to create the rules and procedures from scratch a lot of people have never learned to argue or to respond to a rational argument perhaps the fault is not in the csm but in the persons who call everyone who disagree a whiner and react angrily if they cannot get their way
hardly anybody is interested in the csm just look at how many thumbs up the most popular topics gettopics get nowhere near enough votes to warrant things being an issue as per ccp rulescsm was supposed to be voice of the players it isnt
agreed
currently torps and hams have very little use while they do more damage than their guided missile counterparts their fitting and other disadvantages are too greatmy suggestionput fitting costs and abilities more in line with other close range weaponsdecrease fitting costs as seen fitmake them behave more like upsized rockets short range  current ranges are probably appropriate  high velocityhigh explosion velocitylower explosion radius  at least on torps  damage and rof should be adjusted as appropriate
i find hams quite useful am and torps i find useless in the extreme
ya hams can be a bit tough to fit but torps do you not have engineering v and advanced weapon upgrades iv
torp ravens are scary do you pvp
let stealth bombers fit torps pleeeeeeeease
dont lump torps in with hams theyre separate systems and i cant support bringing both up hams need help torps are fine
seen a lot of hambased insanity theyre fine asis it just takes a little more creativity to use them well and creativity is not a bad thing
torps hams and rockets are the blasters et al of the missile world their damage range rof and fitting requirements are all in line with the other short rangehigh damage weapons as ispve  pvp
3 torp phoon
i agree hams needs a bit of love
hams maybe need a slight bit of loving but slight and mostly in the pg department so caldari can fit them easier that said i love hams as they are now and use them as aux dps on my hurricanes theyre awesome weapon systemstorps are awesomerockets need major loving the damage output is extremely underwhelming for a short range weapon system up to the point where unbonused acs  which are lowest dps of them all   do more damage then bonused rockets
i use both a lot and find them to be perfectly fine weapon systems then again i dont use hams on caldari ships so maybe they do have too high pg reqs for those but torps definitely dont need another boost
swap the powergrid usage on heavy missiles and hams so they follow the tradition of longer range weapons taking up more powergrid that would make hams far more viable on ships like the caracal and the cerbbut torps are just fine
bearing in mind thatthe strongest argument against democracy is a five minute discussion with the average votercan we have some confirmation from ccp that the csm is not going to be a carte blanche for populist measures that may serve some peoples selfinterest but ultimately damage the game that i enjoy
all the csm has the right to do is forward suggestions and ask for information  its not like ccp just gave 9 randoms access to the source code if ccp thinks a given suggestion is bad for the game they just wont implement it i dont have a single quick quote handy but this was made pretty clear in the csm founding documents
the csm is a soapbox this game has a history of caving in to whining and therefore giving people a more effective medium to whine can be destabilising as they will feel that their ideas have some more legitimacythe most popular decision is not always the right one
yes occasionally though not often enough imo   i think you care way too much about the mindset of whiners and its also not always the wrong one
if your country held a referendum tomorrow and the question was do you want to halve income tax what response would you geti trust ccp to run this game they have for 5 yearswhy do we need a say now
frankly i think such a referendum would fail  we canadians like our taxes far too much or at least were way too stoic about well its going to a good cause   as for why we need a say why dont you ask ccp that they did this of their own accord maybe its marketing the game maybe its an attempt to create an actual process for dealing with whine threads instead of adhoc dev responses maybe its because they want to broaden the whine thread process a bunch so you actually get people on both sides of the debate instead of just the usual signed and thereby get a better feel for what the players really think maybe they realize that the player base has a lot of good ideas if you can just filter out the crap and as such they want to set up a system to take advantage of those ideas or maybe they just think itll be funny to watch who knows the point is its here and id like to see it succeed a lot more than id like to see it implode
from this thread dated 51707 but nothing since
eula section 7 conduct   paragraph a specifically restricted conduct   line 2  you may not use your own or thirdparty software to modify any content appearing within the game environment or change how the game is playedffs ccp why did you put this in the eula if you were just going to allow people to take advantage of the game in that wayim calling for those that use any and all third party programs to be banned within 1 month following an in game warning
i am not familiar with any third party programs that modifies any content appearing within the game environment or change how the game is played
its not just an issue of what you want but its an issue of what can be reasonably enforcedtheir stance on this issue has always been very reasonable
this pops up all the time any third party application that gives the player additional info or allows him to command himself or his fleet more efficiently is breaking this part of the eulaany programs that give the player additional tools that give him an advantage over players without it are the epitome of this rule and players use them all the time and think nothing of iti agree that something needs to be done ccp needs to either revise the eula or start enforcing the rules
im firmly in the revise the eula camp any eula that says evemon eft and an eve maps book are banned is a eula that needs a total reworking
needs more support
seriously i want a thumbs down option in this forum dont think this has been posted before just skimming
check serenitys stickyissue this forum needs a thumbs down option  and neutral  
so mining exploiters  jetcan mining   get extra aggro rules to deal with theft  but highsec pirates playing on gang mechanics get smacked down it is only fair that the war target warning works in any circumstances  but removing this mechanic altogether is another gift to pure carebearsim curious to see how command ship alts will affect highsec wars  too
this issue will get no traction nor should it look at the big picture here ccp is not doing this out of any particular love for carebears or hate for high sec pirates they are doing it because they realize that faction warfare will be a total flop if people cant trust each other in forming fleets realistically between preserving a specific type of scam and promoting a huge and greatly anticipated feature like faction warfare which do you think is going to take priority in the dying words of mr spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
and here i thought it was called mwdguns  you can pulverize a hic with just about any battleship on the market if you pvp fit it and can catch him
noif you cant get past a hictor then learn to play hics dont change the effectiveness of pirate gatecamps at all they just make it slightly more convenient for us weve always been able to run 10 point laches sensorboosted to catch frigates now theres a tougher ship that has trouble catching cruisers1 wanna get past one istabs rather than wcss2 mwd out of his range those guys are slow3 bring ecm a hic that cant lock you cant catch you4 scout5 bring an escort6 avoid lowsec there are other methods for avoidingevading hictors that i use on a regular basis to get past them i fly my alts occator through lowsec all the time the only thing im ever afraid of is bubbles and theres none of those in lowsecin lowsec you should never lose a ship unless youve engaged someone and you should never lose your pod unless youre smartbombed if you do then l2p
nomaking isk from getting ganked is justwrongwhat is stopping me from making an alt and sending him through losec on autopilot for a week collecting killrightsim 100 for tradable kill rights but this is not the answer
i agree but i dont think this would happen under this system itd have to be a kill contract  the bounty hunter isnt going to pay for the right to shoot someone and the contractor isnt going to pay someone to take the kill right away with nothing to show for it so a contract is the natural middle ground bounty hunter takes contract acquires kill rights kills gets paid theres no other stable setup
reposted response from the other whiny thread on this issueyou get benefits from declaring the war and those benefits give you certain privileges in secured spacecongratulations you have just paid concord war fees here is what you get1 the right to blow up war targets in secured space2 the right to pod war targets in secured space3 the right commit the above without interference from concord or sentry fire in secured space4 the right to commit the above without loss of security status  in secured spacehere is what you do not get1 the right to freely harm neutrals in secured space2 the right to use aoe weapons without consequence in secured space3 the right to worry free and unobstructed looting and salvaging of war targets wrecks  in secured spaceif you do not like these restrictions we are sorry concord suggest you have a dedicated looter get a faster ship or get your a out of high sec to fight your warconcord thanks youpatri
factor this in while deciding thenyou have fought another ship and beaten it the aftermath of the fight is that the defeated ship was converted into a wreck which might contain loot and salvage worth several million isk the current mechanics allow someone to swoop in and run off with all of that you are not allowed to stop that from happening  in empire   without becoming criminally flagged a game mechanic that allows someone to run off with millions of isk worth of items that belong to someone else with the full protection of concord  highsec   or sentry guns  lowsec   does not belong in what is supposed to be a pvp game it is the worst sort of carebearism youve got mission runners agreeing with pirates agreeing with pvpers on this issue the only people disagreeing are the carebears who dont want to be shot at while they take what doesnt belong to them
hey guys after looking at it and comparing it with the naglfar and her abilitiesi was wondering would it be appropriate to introduce a 5th high slot to the phoenix  caldari dreadnought  to enable the use of the turretthe ship looks weird without a railgun on the platformsand i really dont understand why the phoenix has the ability to fit a railgun and not give it any sort of boost to make it a ethical decision to place a railgun on the shipso why does the naglfar get 2 turrets and 2 missiles with a siege module and the phoenix only get 4 high slots to support only a 3rd of the weapons with the siege modulewhat is so great about it now that it doesnt allow the turret me makes petition to get the phoenix a 5th high slot to use the 4th weapon with a siege module d
looking at the pheonix i see no reason why it has that turret hardpoint at all but buffing the pheonix would unfortunately put it out of balance with all other dreads so all dread would have to be buffed i think going on the pheonixs awesome dpv  about 80k with kinetic torps   the rail gun is completely uselessalso the naglfail is horrible to train for due to the dual weapons the pheonix is good as it is atm and imo the dreads are pretty well balancedme is no eft warrior
solution remove turret hardpoint from phoenix
naw i dont think enough of him to stalk him im just a heckler thanks for the creepy compliment though its nice to get acknowledgement for my effortswindjammer
i dont like you either you just watch yourself were wanted men i have the death sentence on twelve systems
ill explain my view a moment if i may the members of the csm will definitely have their own views on the topics brought to us and will certainly discuss them to and fro with our own thoughts but at this time we are saying that a particular topic is worth getting a discussion with ccp about whether we personally think it is good or bad iz
this one there is no reasonable way for the community to give input to the csm on the threads for them to make their decision until after they have been announced as on the agenda if you do not have said reason then you will only have the supporters making the discussion not a discussion but as previously said a rally or could the my post on the 29th be a record for when this topic came up for discussion so that the csm could vote on it if they so wantedby your argument they can by your argument they can vote on anything that has been posted to the forums everi mean hell the csm didnt record a single nay vote regarding any of the topics or if they did it was a strikingly low number   the csm didnt even have an idea of what half of the suggestions were trying to say or what they ought to be as evidenced by the minutes where they had to agree to discuss it at a later dateno it does not give any power to the csm since it only allows players to give the csm more information this venue is soft power on the part of the players over the csm which by definition reduces their powerit means one thread is for people to support an issue and one thread is for people to discuss an issue it means there is the required discussion and it means there is the venue for which the 5 support can be reachedwhat is this template and why has it not been posted anywhere for the public to review
the csm is not here to discuss the issues the csm is here to bring the issues to ccp if the csm were to discuss each issue at the meetings they would never get anything done you couldnt argue the merits and problems of two of the issues in the entire time the csm had to get through its meetingsthe forums are where the discussion is supposed to happen and that is why it is so important that we actually have a venue to discuss these things instead the  that we have now that is why its so important that we have discussion threads on what the csm is going to be voting onthere is a clear timeline issue forum    discussionformulation forum    csm vote meeting    ccp meetings and response assuming yes vote  csm rep summary explanation assuming no vote  implementing this is really really easy requires no changing of the csm documents no vote or anything all that needs to be done is for a csm to make a thread after an issue has been on placed on the agendaor when it meets the requirements to be voted on and keep that thread open for 7 days preferably in here rather than in the assembly hall since since there is not signed mechanism here   before voting on whether or not to bring it to ccp and in what form its going to be in note the csm document requires no end date only a minimum of 7 daysits that easy
it would be nice to somehow flag threads that meet the requirements for csm discussion  one representative support or 5 support   on the discussion thread i am of the opinion that if a representative is going to support an issue to be taken to the csm meeting then that representative should state this clearly in the thread before the 7 day discussion period is up  and possibly within the first 2 days or so  an interesting selection of topics brought up for the 2nd meeting however dont treat us like idiots there was no way that some of those topics had popular general support it also looks like the csm is going to become a technical development branch by the look of some of those topicstake carearithron
an interesting point brought up in that post however dont treat us like idiots there is no way that the topics couldnt have had general supportit also looks like the csm is going to be a council which represents the playerbase by the looks of some of those topics
just throwing another idea at the table make the focused script anticapital weapon thingy actually damaging significantly the titan firing it himself  as if the focused dd energy is too much for the ship to handle   the dmg would have to be percentagewise ex 20 of remaining hp so multiple hits will not render the titan useless and a 2 reduction to that dmg from a new high rank titanonly skill but give it great alpha as in popping carriers  at least   in one hit ecm effect to the ship being hit and energy neutralizing on top this may bring tactical options up as in fleet logistics for the titan that will need to be repaired energy transfered protected etc ps or i may just talk crap all along p
impossible is something quiter says csm document doesnt say it cant be amendedthere also no reason why you cant have more then one meeting a week you can have the normal meeting and then a approvel of the minutes meeting 2 days latereither way saying its impossible thus why your way is the only way seems very weak to meeditgreat slander herenow i cant speak for darius nor will i dare to even tryill merely point out the committees we have in my government were made during a offical meeting you can argue that unoffical meetings can create a lot of problems and group think which i think we need to avoid since there are many different type of people in eveall the csm need to work together to make this more efficiency but not sacrifice what they believethink is right it will never be perfect cause when people disagree there will always be a lot of going back and forth till there is a vote i will say this to me it seem like jade was pulling a fast one the motion wasnt clear and it changes the csm documentthe very same csm document that crazynamecsmperson says makes it impossible to approve the minutes the next meeting but whatever csm first meeting is shady already no surpise to me
youre being horribly unfair here  they found a solution a functional one at that its not the default one used in most councils but it suits their needs just fine and if chat logs go up as soon as the meeting ends then the minutes are next to irrelevant anyways its fine leave it alone
a solution that changes the csm document that csmcrazyname says they cant approve the minutes next meeting due to the very same csm document its not fine cause the logic behind the change is wrong csm document says minutes must be out 3days after the meetingthus change csm document to allow chair to sign off on the minutesthey acted like this was the only solution and darius was made the bad guy cause he wanted all the members to voted on it i remember countless times of our minutes being mess up while logs are good its quite clear there were problems with communcation in that meetingthey are setting up the ground work for future csm i think there are good reasons why most bodies that produce minutes have the voting members approve them thus allowing them a chance to correct minutes or misunderstandingclerks make mistakes if you look at the motion they were making it was very unclear yet jade was trying to push a vote and probably didnt even know the question themselves since they had crazycsmname person say iti do think its interesting im unfair for speaking my opinion and pointing out this is how majority of the world does it the logic is wrong and im more then free to point it out
letting the chair sign off on the minutes is hardly a change to the csm document its a stopgap that was approved by the council and as such meets most rules of order ive ever seen and dariuss objection sure didnt seem to me to be about the lack of a vote  the vote was being called and that was his objection he wanted more time not more democracy he also objected to the chair having power somebody else didnt of course but that explains what his vote was not so much the debate around the voting as for what they should do in future id agree that they should seek a change to the structure of the minutes to allow them to be approved at the subsequent meeting as most other organizations do and use the chatlogs to fill the threeday rule it seems almost backwards to have the more detailed version come out first but its probably the right solution the unfair part was impossible is something quiter says  something is against their constitution thus they dont do it thats not quitting thats the rule of law and attacking them for it is stupid  and yes unfair also its way easier to type ank or ankh than csmcrazyname when its too long or unpronounceable just abbreviate it
please delete
i dont pvp too muchusually its unwilling too lol i understand the issue though id be ed if someone was able to loot a level 4 id finished with no threat of repercussions pvp just adds to the game like it or not how easy  ie boring   would the game be if we didnt have pvpirates to add suspense and danger
support this poss are pretty ugly and their layout makes no sense at all its a tower surrounded by a bubble with random bits of junk floating in and around them
yes

i concur
currently the only way ive found that i can play one eve across 2 monitors is to use a spanned desktop which then gives the options for a really wide eve window in the escape menu in theory its cool but in practice its kind of crappy and you have to play in windowed mode  which i do anyway so i can have a client on each monitor   the spanned desktop also does bad things to other stuff i want to do on my computer like watching a movie in fullscreen mode makes it chop in half when streaching an eve window across both you actually have to make it quite a bit smaller than the full multiscreen size too or your speed dial and centered messages get brutalized and hard to comprehend during time critical situations as the game technically has dual monitor work arounds but no true support i definately give this a thumbs up some things needed aremulti monitor fullscreen suportnot having to use desktop span as a workaround because of its negative effects on other computer usesthe ability to unlock and move the speed dial section to be fully on one monitor so it doesnt get ruineda checkbox in multiscreen mode that causes centered popups and messages to be fully on one screen or the other
i dont have a second monitor atm but id love to see this as an option supported

all done thanks
as a min bs v pilot the mael does something like 67 more damage than the tempest its just not worth justifying the loss of 2 utility highslots and a 50mil price mark up i could see it a bit better for small gangs where you might be able to tank better but most the time small gangs are more nano friendly  another reason why everyone loves minmatar especially with the rapier and huginn   and there isnt much place for a slow battleshipi really think projectile guns in general could use a bit of a boost too but even with that the naglfar would still need a significant change to make it a worthwhile dread
minmatar capitals definately need to be looked at and brought on par with the other races

if you are going to support this topic then do so in the original thread not this oneoriginal thread for this topic
one common abuse this game does suffers from is the acquisition of skill  research points  resources   from accounts that do not pay to play we would all be against some sort of daily isk stipend given to all players why are we okay with this situationdid i leave eve at one point in the past yesdid i set a battleship v to train while i was gone yesof course in equal measure i was gone for 4 months and no i did not reactivate and start new training and deactivate i have never made secondary accounts that farm the game from an inactive state in fact i only have two accounts  since 2003   and i only have two mains who do some research mind you i dont think others should play the game my way but i do think that if others want to compete with me they should be required to actually play the game and the gain of resources is competing with myself and everyone else stop the injustice stop the abuse account expires suspend all resource gainnow i think that allowing expired accounts to gain anything may be more marketing than it is game balance knowing that your account will have that super long skill trained and a crapload of datacores to sell if or when you decide to come back is likely a strong inducement for people to return to eve wow typed that last paragraph and i realized ive got nowhere to go from here  
i guess i sort of agree about research points but i dont think theres a problem with allowing one skill to finish when an account is inactive overall i dont think its worth bringing up
well i think having a range of issues both large and small gives the csm the first csm the chance to reap rewards that take little work and would make it into game faster while everyone waits for the bigger ideas to be implementedand two things id add here if i remember rightly this is something implemented on evechina when eveeveryone else heard of it the screams of worry and outrage were rather pronounced now a good bit later it may be a good time to revisit the idea since at least in the market forum weve seen major economic vehicles fully built out of maximizing expired account resource gain i think it would be hypocritical to put a stop to one form of free resource gain and not anothersecondly i also realize that this idea is not going to be popular after all how many people you know sometimes say bah im going elsewhere for a month and ill just let insertlongskill train while i pay a ccp competitor instead
i disagree with thisif you want to compete with expired accounts in the research points field you can simply do the research agents daily mission and voila you get 2x the number of points compared to the other guy plus you can follow the markets and sell the datacores when its profitable or daily rather than trying to offload a zillion every 6 months at a loss there already are tools in place for you to actively competei also think that the majority of your competition isnt expired accounts rather its active accounts the pvper or the industrialist who otherwise spends his day playing other aspects of the game but is also getting some extra income from the rpsas far as the skillpoints weve always had that bonus and its nice people get bored of the game and need to take a break if you take away their battleships v should they return they may not returnso i disagree its a nerf thats not needed you can already compete in an active way and nerfing this would result in a loss of players  however small  
these things are rewards for not playing the game i thought the whole point of ccp was to have us playing and using the game paying accounts to have any benefiti cant understand why this is still in if someone wants to talk about bad things and character farming allowing to put a 1 month skill every two month for free its bad
training warfare link specialist v on my trail account while it is inactive going to train up hopefully 3 hulk pilots in a few months using the trail  1 gtc thing if possible after the initial training time you want to know something i will need them in game and working to pay for their gtcs so they wont be expiring again soon leave it as it is it encourages other people to make accounts and get ccp more money my main is a hulk pilot turns out mining is less isk an hour than ratting or missioning but scales much better
well this is something of a digression into another area i think long overdue for overhaul as well the fact that by doing nothing someone can make half as much as i do in fact they can be coasting on an expired account as well makes actively missioning your rd agent a fools errandmind you im not impoverished by these matters not everything aired is because there is a direct gain for the person championing the cause im well known for many years not for my whining but for my thinking  speaking this is a small thing that could use some critical   objective   review and debate
no part of what makes eve better than other mmos is that you can take breaks without messing up your training or like me go without internet involuntarily for three freakin months  thank you embarq for having a singledigit iq   without losing much in the way of training timepeople have real life issues that are more important than a video game ccp recognizes this and that is part of why i like this game so much
no just no
no thanks being able to have your skills still training even if your account has expired is a pretty powerful inducement to keep coming back to the game imoyou may have found the game rather stale and boring but you set up bs v before you left your account may have expired last week but suddenly you remember hey bs v finished training a couple days ago i can fly cap ships now and you go and resub your account happy ending for all concerned id say

i am far more intrigued by this prospect than i ought to be
seriously why would anyone ever fly one of these things it is worse than a mining cruiser in every possible way except cargo capacity and possibly price  once you factor in the strip miner   and even then not by much it has no capacitor can barely defend itself against belt rats and has a laughable mining outputrecommend something be done about the uselessness of this ship if mining is looked at by the csm i would love to see it get some sort of bonus that would make it actually useful to a mining operation perhaps a stripminer range bonus so it can pick off that lone asteroid 5km away from all the hulks it definitely needs a capacitor boost as is it caps itself on long warps more often than frigates dosupport procurer love
im supporting the topic because i agree that the procurer is useless it takes a lot less time to train for a cruiser that can do the same amount of mining if not more and it only takes another day or two before you can move up to retrieverhowever i think the better way to deal with it is to remove the ship altogether without some kind of change that would require some rebalancing of all the other barges theres little you can do to make the procurer a viable mining vesselcruisers would still provide better yield if you change the range so making it a better miner would be the obvious change but again you cant do that easily without having to rebalance the other barges thus i suggest just removing the ship completely
well you also need the procurer to invent the  also pretty useless   skiff
with regards to training up for the next in line theres no reason you wouldnt spend the extra day or so training for the mackinaw and just getting that right off the bat is there i believe that its in the same boat as the procurer except its slightly more useful since it can deepcore mine whereas cruisers cannot
the skiff is the best mercoxit miner in the game the mackinaw is the best ice miner in the game they serve different purposes dont drag exhumers into a discussion on the procurer this isnt much different from the tech 1 industrials that become blockade runners as tech 1 ships they are nearly without merit but as tech 2 they have a role
it doesnt need to be usefull it is designed to be replaced in what 16 hours a day of training when the navatis gets a hardcore buff that makes it a preffered t1 frig over the tier 3 ones then ill support the tier 1 barge having a reason to live until then wise people will mine in a mining cruiser because it outperforms a tier 1 mining barge and if they have the skills they will mine in a dominix because it outmines a retriever and sometimes a covetor
as a ceo of a oneman corp i support this thread   
more granular permissions would make a lot of sense however i am not sure it should be locked in by owner perhaps a more elegant solution may be to assign an owner to a pos this could be set by corporation vote the pos owner is then allowed to set an access control list for specific tasks  ie create cancel and deliver   for each task a set of permissions could be selectedowner  the pos ownercreator  the person who created the jobdirectors  ceos and directors of the owning corporationalliance  anyone in the alliancecorporation  anyone in the corppublic  anyone  probably not best to set this for cancel or deliver

not supported artillery are capless you can fire 237 as long as you have ammodont complainlaser drain your cap in less than 5 mins in most caseand they are really hard to fitrailguns also use both ammo and cap   with significantly lower damage  you can fit a mwd on your minmatarr boat without any disadvantage  unless active tank in fleet   so dont ever complain about them
typical omg cap response if your going to comment on cap then take a look at how often arty needs to reload and what that does for the dps that is already significantly lower than beams 1400s are as hard to fit as beamswhen artillery was given rubbish tracking it was deserved as at the time you could really hurt ships with the alpha especially smaller ships but after so many hp boosts and ways to increase hp that alpha is nothing like what it used to be yet the penalties are still therealso ranges have increased with the new apoc giving the lower base range beams much more range  and dps and tracking and no reloading for cap use   rails already offering more range and tracking  especially more tracking on mega   then finally the rokh which can hit even further without any need to fit a tracking moduleas i said in the large ac topic not just artillery should be looked at but ammo as well possibly the range could be helped with a falloff bonus on tremorbasically the downsides for the advantage of no cap use  its the only true advantage   are just to much with the increases in other snipers performance and the already great performance of the rail mega no one is asking for beam style dps or rail optimal so ill keep complaining until there is a balanced minmatar style artillery for todays eve
supported the only reason to fly a minmatar bs in a fleet battle is that you dont have another races bs trained artillery especially large andor minmatar bs must be looked at as a result
you have to take the rough with the smooth i think the fastest ship should have the weakest long range fire you have excellent short range fire autocannons are good enough that amarrians mount them on their ships instead of lasers now they may be too much too weak but id definitely say they should be the weakest im not averse to looking at and overhauling them but i think youd have to expect to give up the capless weapon bonus in order to make any real progress
higher damage modifier compensated with increased rof  supportedbigger clip size even without stealth dps boost  supported tremor adjustment  supported if spike and aurora are boosted with similar fashion i feel urge to add that rather than having all t2 long range sniper ammunitions changed id like to see falloff bonus included to tracking computers range scripst and to tracking enhancers much like it was introduced to tracking disruptors

i see a crapton of pvpers in this thread all flaming baconim a pvper and out of curiosity i tried it i run dual accounts my main in one system my alt scouting in the next when bacon yells at me that theres a new local i go looky and hit scanner to see if i can be bothered to kill itits also cool for afk gatecamping if you are a light sleeper like myself set up bacon turn ur comp speakers up to very loud then when a new local pops in  you can jump out of bed run over to comp gank his ass wait for aggro timer to finish warp back to gate then go back to sleepbacon helps in fleet ops too  as an fc i run my scout infront of the fleet and my main with the fleet if bacon bleeps i know we have incoming and i can quickly make my decision it saves me the hastle of either buying a second screen for my comp or tabbing between the charactersi wouldnt be gutted if they declared bacon an exploit nor if they encrypted the log files so it didnt work i like bacon personally because it has advantages to both pvpers and carebears making it easier for both and harder for both at the same timebacon has already got me a couple of kills here is one of themlinkwe were on quick deploy back home  not moving as fleet but warping to 0 individually   then bacon bleeps so i tell the guys to hold on the gate which they do he jumps out bacon notifies me he has left the system and bleeps again when he entered the system containing my main and the rest of the fleetit works both ways but i dont mind it really its actually rather clever  and at least gunfleet made it public so everyone is on a fair playing field
id be interested to see multiore asteroids as well you could make crystals increase the yeald of a certain ore you get from a multiore asteroid
i have to agree with you if i want to fight someone and they are on the station i have to realize that they are there so that they can see outside choose their targets wisely and dock if nessisary i would be an idiot not to weigh this into the strategy why insist that people cant fight on stations should they just stay docked and nobody get to play why are people demanding that the rules must change so that they can kill more people for making the mistake of undocking or demanding someone stay vulnerable for as long as it takes get revenge now people that undock dock undock dock into a camp without agroing anyone just to waste peoples time and ammo makes me want a redock timer that increases everytime you do that within a set period of time but that is not what the op specified i have gotten a nice amount of kills on the station with my moros and havent lost it yet but it wasnt because they were stupid and thought i wouldnt dock they were bumping me while giving me targets to keep me agrod trying to get me off of the station so they could kill off my drones and subsequently kill me theyve come close several times but ive been lucky so far it makes sence though as my moros costs more than a 30 man gang i cant survive that gang if im off the station but if i can down a few of them while taking a risk that i may be knocked off the station it makes for an exciting fight i can fully understand why that gang would be fuming that i got a coupple of them and they didnt get my one ship but a   i was unmistakeably on the station and have a kazillian hitpoints b   i chose the battleground they chose the attack plan and know the game mechanics c   they could have won but they failed to achieve the mission objectives  bump or seige button to strand myself for 10 min keep me aggrod without taking casualties   d   if i have a chance to loose a 3b isk ship  gotta fit it good for maximum performance   within docking range then i dangwell better have a chance to kill a few hundred mill of their ships for the risk im taking that one of them is successfull at bumping or that theyll use the cynobump which has flung me at over 1kms more than once d   its the station they know im going to try to deagro and dock if they let me the only reason theyre fighting me is to keep me agrod while they work me away from docking range so they can kill me and they will kill me if they succeed but nobody makes them do it and theyre not doing it because theyve been cheated or something e   the moros is specifically designed for fighting smaller ships it says so in its info thingy f   i dont even shoot battleships because they can deagro and tank a moros until they can dock  i loose a drone about every 5 seconds and that cuts down on firepower as well as costing a lot   a moros cant gank a bs unless it enters seige mode and that guarantees death if fighting aloneall in all the station adds a dimension to fighting that cant be found anywhere else in the game im often online when nobody else in my corp is to be able to use the station tactically allows me to have sphinctertightening combat mahem bloodbath heartattacks when im alone vs 1030man fleets in the area and still have a chance of getting some kills or loosing really big against that many im tethered to the station because they would always win otherwise i have to depend on them choosing to fight me on the station because there is nothing else i can do in that situation the station doesnt need to be changed because this is another clear example of people not thinking about the endless variations the game can be played in and wanting the game changed to better suit their limited understanding of it
rofl ethiat just posted lol and you wrote an essay in reply to himi think all the points against this idea have been posted already   afraid to say it but nerfing pirates in this case isnt a good thing which is sad
small idea that i once brought up a while back before lps but one i still think is worthwhile basically i find it vastly annoying when i look up my own standings and have to wait a minute or two for liked by list to populate given my age in game that list is rather extensive and i can quite happily live without a couple of hundred entires there so i wondering if possible could we have the ability to forfeit our relationship with any agent we have positive standings withalso having 6 points or 8 pts or 14 pts with this agent or that agent is wasted space actually thats the whole point of this idea if it is of no benefit to me i dont want to be bothered and that should be within my choices to forfeit positives im also sure that there could be some small benefit from the removed database entries on those people who choose to do thisbut the idea is small perhaps within easy reach and might make some difference who knowsme shrugs
i like this youd have to make sure theres a confirmation screen of course but the idea of getting those 15 lp from the federal intelligence office off my screen makes me happy
perhaps a redo of the transport class of ships to give them much more capacity would fill this role the blockade runner serves a purpose but its sister ship doesnt really
oh god yes this idea was floating around for literally a year and a half high time to get going

my idea how to do it
signed100200k m3 would be idealthe cost should be higher though somewhere in the range of 300m  since the cargorigged hauler already costs around 180m  
i think it needs to have slots still even if i had to use them all to fit 120km3 with expander 2s it should still be able to fit a couple of warp core stabs or inertial stabilizers i also think it should be able to scoop from wrecks

yep it is too easy
ok bright guy how do suppose to compensate everyones skill pointsi do not see any solution or cognitive reasoning in your frothing rant if you are so set in doing away with them enlighten us on you plan to do it there is not one solid theme in this thread everyone is all over the place or throwing out one liners because they have no clue
compensation in eve you dont get reimbursed after falling victim to a scam instead you try to avoid getting scammed in the futurewhat plan do you require besides removing the darned things and tweaking the learning rates accordingly
heh thats a good onewhats that youre serious no really you actually mean that you actually mean to suggest that getting scammed by a player via a mechanism you ought to have known was susceptible to it and having two months of skill training arbitrarily ripped off your character by the devs with nothing to show for it are the same thing jaw hits floor
on one hand we have the unfortunate idiot who farmed missions for a week just to afford to accept a freeform contracton the other hand we all flipped enough burgers to make 30 and spend it in subscription fees to train learning skillscontracts were changed to be more readable in order to make scamming harder victims didnt get reimbursementlearning is just another stupid game mechanic i dont see why its victims must get something backis it because real money is involved what if i buy 300mil isk via gtcs then lose it to a surprise extralong session timer do i get my money back
that is quite the most stupid line of reasoning i have ever seen on these forums thankfully ccp arent going to pay any attention to you
i do not support this idea learning skills are a part of this game that should stay
i dont support this as ive said in the other thread
please visit your user settings to reenable imageshuge thumbs up from me on the removal of learning skills supposing they ever do get removed id be fine with not even being reimbursed for them knowing that eve was a better gamelearning skills dont make eve unique  they make it a bigger grind training times across the board from rank 1 to the ludicrous rank 14 all need to be slashed in half too
thank you for your insightful contribution to this thread now go run along while the adults talk
wait why should we tweak the learning rates why arent you supporting a plain remove all learning skills platform
because many skills are designed around the concept of learning skills existing without them wed all lose 11 points per attribute making skills take 3 to 3x as long to train depending on default attributes and implantsrather than removing the learning skills id like to see cybernetics expanded upon and replacing the learning skills with these take augmentations to the next level and along with it allow players to gain more attributes through that for example these new learning augments might be schoolspecific  engineeringgunnerywhatever   andor have sp caps that once reached they would expire and free up the slot they were inserted into in the meantime they might produce extremely accelerated results in the skill school youre pursuingif these implants were craftable youd have the added benefit of creating a new market and placing greater demand on current supply
i definietly agreeiv introduced a lot of people to eve but a lot of them got bored to start with due to learning new skills very slowly i then tell them to learn the learning skills first but then they dont get into new ships for ages and again lose interest in the gamemy idea would be to start new people with higher atributes which will then slowly degrade to like they are now over the first month or two of gameplay this would mean that new people can get a decent ship and advance through the game quickly to start with  making them more interested in the game and more likely to stay   and then by their atributes start to drop they will be happy with the ships they have and will be used to the long training times  a lot of my friends were ed off by even having to wait an hour or two for a lvl 1 skill when they started  might have some issues with farmers making new accounts following a ban very quickly but i think this idea could be workablered
what youre saying is that with perfect intel youll have better intel i agree you will but im not sure that its necessary for the game or desirable either i dont mind the idea that people should have to work a little bit in order to scan their system nor do i mind the idea of a covert fleet having the ability to possibly get by you the solo pilot in a force recon damn well ought to be able to sneak by me to open a cyno behind the front lines it shouldnt be automatic but it should be possible with a bit of luck that said one thing you do have a point on is that people will just spam the scan button all the time as such the scanner window should have an autorepeat button to lower the amount of input the player needs to provide for reconnaissance also the ability to sort the data in a useful manner and perhaps even audio notification filters for when something you want to be notified of comes up
no that post highlighted the problems involved in doing that that doing so would cause just those problems you are talking about it was a response to mindstar suggesting just that and was showing him what would happenif you did implement that functionality well then what would be the point of removing local besides making hostilefriendlyneutral counts even easier   it would be entirely for the purpose of making the mechanic feel rightif they dock in a station then take the station if they go to a pos siege the pos if they jump through a gate follow them and kill them if its lowsec or highsec camp them in if you arent willing to jump through a gate siege a station siege a pos or scan them down in a safe spot then they should win that engagement
no it might not be but i am not saying that i am saying that reducing the amount of intelligence will undoubtedly be a bad thingcoverts already have the ability to move through space that it is not perfectly undetected is simply a reflection that is is a game played by humans against humans and not one played by humans against computersas much as some peoples intelligence seems to be artificial at points
no supportone of the most fundimental needs in a multiplayer game is that you need to know when you are playing with other people its what makes a patroll go to the next system and a mining barge warp there should be no effort in finding out if i can interact with others in the curent system not having the thrill of expectation when a player of an oposing team is around just ruins the whole idea of multiplayer or makes it too stressfull if you could be pounced on without a reasonable chance of warning if im searching each system on a patroll route just to find out if anyone is playing eve in the area then too much of the game is now devoted to determining if there is a game to be played any feature that gives the feeling of being alone negates the entire concept of a multiplayer gamethe only real problem with people knowing ive entered system is that its easy to exploit local and log off or warpcloak a 5 minute dissapear timer on logging off and perhaps a cloak doesnt work so good timer if someones hull was recently ionized from taking dammage in any kind of combat would seem to solve all the most reasonable complaints about local simply i want to sneek up on everyone that isnt scanning like a maniac does not hold any water

love that idea just put everyone at 20 again to start with they should have serious corp standings by this point anyway
this idea is better i dont support the op but i support this agents should simply have a quality growth value that is reduced each time a mission is completed for that agent this would allow underused agents to gain quality and popular agents to lose quality as their growth value adjusts system security should determine the default growth valuethen remove the 2020 caps set on quality and allow them to settle wherever the populace lets them at that point low security bonuses on rewards is probably unnecessary and should be removed as well allowing effective quality alone to determine your rewardsthis would also rectify the issues with level 5 agents as these agents gain enormous levels of quality more players will make use of themwe dont need another way of determining your personal relationship with an agent or corporation we already have standings that adjust the effective quality of your agent on top of their innate quality and your negotiation skillif this did actually make all corporations the same from the perspective of the mission runner then lp rewards ought to be more fragmented andor expanded upon in a distinct way for example shipping companies might offer faction expanded cargoholds mining companies might offer faction laserscrystals etc currently 99 of distinction in lp stores is handled on the faction level and that doesnt make much sense why joint harvesting hands out amarr navy energy turrets i dont know that makes them seem more similar than anything else
guys you dont need dynamic agent quality its pointless and will have the same effect as giving all agents in a security zone the same quality if all lvl 4 agents in hi sec are quality 0 the mission runner population will spread out evenly among all of them to reduce lag which is exactly the same result youd get in an optimal situation with dynamic agent quality except that involves a lot more coding and work all that is necessary is to remove the fact that some agents are just objectively better than others
part of the point of adjusting qualities is to avoid people globbing up at trade hubs if quality was nonexistant the systems within 5 jumps of jitarensetc would become the most popular
i support the idea of having the quality system changed but i dont know what would be besti always like the idea that you start running missions you are at 20 then you add you the standings for agentcorpfaction  negotiations   to get your agent standing so when you start running missions for a new agentcorpfaction you will have low quality but over time you get more and more pay because the agentcorpfactions likes you more if you move agents in the same corpfaction you dont have to start over because they know about you but you do need to develop a relationship with that agent to get better paythis also rewards people who are willing to take a stand and work on their faction standings for one side rather then trying to be on good terms with bothjust my 2 iskedit to give support
standings and negotiation already affect the effective quality of an agent and produce the result you seek that is how it works now
you are correct currently this is the forumla for effective qualityeffective quality  base quality  personal standing   negotiations skill  5  i am suggesting that we remove the base quality and then have personal standing  with the agent   and corp standing and faction standing along with negotiations creat all for the effective standing
another good point keep it up
having the main goal of agent progresion being to get to the one best agent where everyone else is doesnt seem too bright they probably did that because they can then move that agent to correct traffic problems if all agents were of equal quality then people would tend to cluster where the best market access is its easy to move an agent but you cant really move the markets you are smart and will probably go to one thats more peacefull but the majority  and you know it if you read the threads that are based on problems with the game   will insist on staying in their favorite lagy system while demanding something be done about the laganother harder option would be to inconvenience all the mission runners and make the agents only have a certain amount of missions available for everyone and have amount be based on lag in the system when a peacefull system becomes the favorite of too many people and lag kicks in then all the sudden you cant allways get a mission there then you have to hike to the next available agenti supose the only really good thing to be said about my idea would be ammunition against whiney miners that say that mission runners have it so much better but keep mining on oblivious to the fact that if they know the other guy has it better has the ability to train the skills and get the ship that guy has and can improve themselves but stay there and mine and gripe about mining then they are foolish
long overdue
actually quite the contrary i would like to see more people in 00 and that the moment that means more excitement more dynamic conflict and more motive for being there at the moment the only reason for taking an outpost is because you want to become a stationholder yourself and commit to all that means in long term pos maintenance and that style of gameplay but allow these things to be blown up and you have involvement with people who want to hurt their ingame enemies without necessarily becoming what they fight destroying a fixed strongpoint should be an option in any wargame and what is eve territorial conflict in 00 if not a grand multiplayer wargame on some level
jade i take it you feel the rewards of 00 are significantly greater than the risks  currently   thus you propose to make stations destructible to increase the risk  losing the cost of the station and the stuff in it   to rebalance the equationor do you support they be destructible as anything built by a player should be able to be destroyed by another player
you can already take space and then enforce neutrality effectively making the space as ty as you want hell you can take space and then let no one dock there effectively taking the station out of circulationeve territorial conflict is a grand war game and in acknowledging it as such you need to accept some basic realities realities like allowing alliances to destroy stations allows alliances to constrict space extending the area that they can effectively control and realities like eve is not a game like any other war game since it has no end point in a typical war game what the board looks like at the end doesnt matter because at the end of a typical war game you fold the board up and go home not so for eve at the end of a war in eve the board is still there for others to play onyour idea will not put more people in 00 it will do the opposite this is why its so confusing when you state contradictory goals

why would you ever blow up something you could take it doesnt make any sense
actually the way its phrased you would be blowing up something you already have taken wrap your head around that one as for why you would choose to even if a different mechanic than jades was used itd be because its easier to destroy it than to conquer it same reason you shell a city instead of just walking in and taking it  its not as nice when you finish but itll be yours
it is too early for us to consider this topic seriously  and the specific example is in my opinion totally out of order with gameplay   other issues such as changes to cap ships online and the sov system are far more important i am against this proposal
even if it was harder to destroy than hold it would be something we would dobecause its easier to not defend it and come back later when someone puts up a station and blow it up again than it is to expend resources to defend the space
yes and  partially    if you review the example i cite youll see i would support a partial destruction solution at least for the initial implementation ie the outpost goes boom but peoples personal hangers are still accessible from the wreck basically alliance takes a hit  individual players generally dontthis too especially in 00 space which is the fullpvp zone in eve where everything should be put on the line
maybe you want to blow it up simply to hurt a war enemy but since you dont want to become exactly like the war enemy youre fighting you dont want to be bound by the same mechanics and paradigms they play by in war sometimes you just want to blow up the enemies base doesnt mean you want to live there yourself
this is an oversight that needs to be corrected asap i should be able to show my disgust with an idea without relying on someone to actually read my post out of the pages of other ones that are generally shorter than mine and therefore easier to barely read and then dissreguard
ever since the introduction of faction ammo most t2 ammo has been uselessi admit there is a minor role for some ammos and a few still shine  range boosting ammo   but the entire market on them tankedthey simply need to be redonei admit that having them outdamage faction ammo would not be in line with ccps desires for combat duration so damage is not an optionhaving the penalty effects be applied for each system having loaded that ammo type realy gimps the ships with many hardpoints over the ones with less and an added dps bonusso i would suggest a system that does not have have a penalty nor gives a major bonus to damaget2 missiles could for instance lower actual speed  not max   by 1 or 2 per hit making them indirectly support other weaponsystems and increas the time a target needs to get to warp  even prefent it if there are enough of you  the rage version with more dage ofset witrh a greater target signature allows a ship to engate a larger opponent miore effectively without boosting its damage against the same sized ship class removing other penalties from these missile types  rocket ham torp cap torp   might do it but they should outperform faction missiles against larger targetsretaining a form of precision missiles  light heavy cruise and the missing capital cruise   without penalties do deal with smaller sized ship a bit more effectively might work as wellfor gunnery ammothe ranged version seem to work although i personally would prefer slighly less range and slightly more damage allowing t1 a part in sniping as wellthe damage version tha5t reduces range and tracking without outperforming faction ammo by a good margin is a sick joke either have it reduce rangge and increase damage and tracking  compatible with the general mechanic less range  more damage   or make them equivalent to short range ammo with an intresting side effect  for instance laser ammo make targets suffer more from heat  if used by the target   ballistic ammo give a chance to deactivate a module on the target ship  as if deactivated by the user   blaster ammo could reduce weapon sig radius slightly or maybe other have better idears
one time on evetv stavros said that hed heard a dev confirm this would be included anyone remember wherewhen
an afk player is easily determined  from the servers point of view   as someone who sits in one spot or has a steady automatic movement pattern  like orbit or go forward   a nonafk player is there and participating with the game somehow if you could detect the afk and not detect the active players then all would be happy in evelandheres how to do it make locating and unmasking a cloaker a long and deliberate ordeal so that an active player can react to it on successfull attempt to counter the cloakers cloak they become uncloaked but is otherwise able to respond by warping andor recloakingsooo lets say that a cloaker was probeable as cloaked object but had a reduced whats the word scan strength so that you could probe him but youd fail more often than if he was uncloaked then after your final short ranged probe where you end up on the same grid you launch a new probe that pings the surrounding area it takes a decent amount of time to finish its cycle and then it either fails to decloak or successfully decloaks if the person was not afk and was doing anything a long duration cloaker would be doing then they should have picked up probes on scan several minutes before you got there and would have done something if they recloak on you then you just have to be ready to run them down as is usual for people that cloak if theyre not afk its their right to do so its the ccp given right for a cloaker to hide from you they just shouldnt be able to cloak and then go play rl while discouraging you from playing evealso op guy the emotional content of your post is like yelling dont kick me youre going to get kicked for doing that
afk cloaks are annoying when ur trying to kill them but i live in lowsec arocitas alliance frequently send in cloaking inties and stuff we ignore them until they show up on scan then we hunt them and chase them offthis is like saying that people should timeout if they dont move thier mouse or something in eve when theyre sitting in a station afk theres no real difference between an afk cloaker and a guy in the station who is afkif he pops up on scanner then hes either up to something or he just undocked when he uncloaks u know u have company and if ur in 00lowsec you should always be watching scanner and local him being docked or cloaked makes no difference
in my opinion and its only an opinion this is good in theory but not in practice here is why  from a buddy that does this  1   logon in favorite system2   cloak and go back to work in rl3   periodically watch scanner for ratters  they have to make a living   4   locate belt of ratter using scanner5   decloak warp to belt kill ratter loot wreck6   go back to scan point and cloak while ratters buddies form up and hunt you in vein7   get more work done in rl8   repeat steps 37 until time to go home9   make sure alt has market stocked with new ratting ships parts and ammonow im not saying this isnt a cleaver idea and a good way to kill time at work but for the duration that hes not playing the game the other people clearly are they should have an oportunity during the time hes afk and alttabbed to do something about that specific thing hes doing sure they can hit scan every 2 seconds for the brief period every hour or two when hes decloaked and inbound they could fit stabs or rat in pairs too sure cloaks are meant to suck for other people but there should be something more reasonable a person can do in an afk cloaker situation like thisagain im only suporting an improvement to combat afk cloakers not scouts or intel gatherers that are actively playing the game this is not related to afk in a station because they have more delays induced have given themselves away before able to locate a target and are much more vulnerable currently cloaking in a safespot has zero risk yet provides great rewards when used like this

i cant find the thread in question unfortunately but what i recall as being said was that instation and outofstation players are handled by different parts of the server and mixing them isnt really feasible if im remembering incorrectly or something in that vein then ill support this idea since it seems like a good one but its not something im willing to eat lag for
no supporton the surface it sounds like a realistic and good idea in practice it allows an indestructable fc to command a station fight from inside the station without the lag of his client having to respond to the actions and effects of other ships it also allows multiple people who have a selection of ships and fittings in the station to bypass the undockdockchange shipundock delays this would give so much more strategic advantage to being docked than just simple cowering people fighting over space with unconquerable stations  this crowd has increased a lot in the last year   will likely have both sides staying docked peering out the windows ready to switch ships and engage only something they know they have 110 chance of completely obliterating is that the eve you want
lol heres some things that might interest you1  if theres hostiles in local that arent in the station with you then theyre either outside somewehere or docked in another station2  if you undock and immediately stop ur ship you will remain invulnerable if you hit dock straight away it says plz wait 20 secs by doing this you lose your invulnerability so stop ur ship wait 2030 secs then redockif you have any brains there are only a few stations that could catch you out  those where the undock point is out of docking range   in which case its a crap stationand this would cause immense lag imagine jitabad ideakkthnxbye

id love to see more drone varietiesfor example a drone which does the same damage and ecm as a small drone and requires 25 bandwidth or perhaps a faster ogre which uses 30 bandwidthoverall once you get drone interfacing v heavy drones v and bs v your drones are maxed there is no way to increase your damage any more

too many walls of text herecomplaining about getting a cap hotdropped on you train a capship yourself tbh
how about we remove insurance payouts for ships lost in 00 if you can fly around in null sec youre a big boygirl now and dont need your hand heldi agree some balancing is in order but the op does not mention the real titan problem which is their use in tandem with cyno jammers outside of that they are okone thing i think should be mentioned is how poss are sieged any responsible commander will not put dreads into siege without having subcapitals locking down the gates the result is that you get dread pilots shooting the structures while the subcapitals are bored out of their minds

i own a dread and a carrier and feel i can talk with some understanding of them also i havent lost a cap yet so my view may be skewed a little im one person buying my own things and use my caps only when reasonably sure that im not about to throw them away1   titans seem to be a bit of a fumble but ive never encountered one face to face  unless you count its bridge   so cant realy comment on them so much and am skeptical of others who havent encountered them and probably dont have any good understanding of them either from what i have seen though they are making their way into our npc owned 00 homeland where its much safer for them to nuke gangs that have a very low probability of fielding an antititan response this is how it is in my neck of the woods anyway this is crap imo and if there was any serious cap problem then this would be my foundation of the arguement in the crap 00 owned by npcs most of the gangs are composed of many small ships and rarely cap ships this is too inviting a target for a ship that can push a button and destroy the entire oposing gang with almost zero risk my instinct tells me that the dd should have some ballancing mechanism that bases its dammage output on the total ship tonnage currently in the grid this way if there isnt a significant cap ship presance then the dd will largely fizzle consequently this would still correct a battleship swarm attacking a pos seiging party2   dreads ive found are usefull for a   killing poss b   cynobumping my moros and putting the hurt on me c   in the case of the moros fighting small ships on a station where it can constantly redock and reload its small drone bay 3   dreads are not usefull for the everyday person or small corp  with the possible exception being the moros   their prohibitive cost limited usefullness and nessessity in numbers for pos warfare excludes smaller alliances from challenging sovernty or playing the dread card in a counter hotdrop4   dreads are not overly abundant unless you consider their disproportionate distribution one dread does nothing but 5 dreads and the ability to survive the financial loss can do something that doesnt make your team super or anything its just the point where you can start to carefully flex a little bit a major alliance would still pee on you because of its ability to replace dreads5   carriers are the ships that seem to be everybodies goal especially miners for some reason it seems that frequently people get a carrier and then out of want to use it for something besides an icon in the station hanger will use it for ratting or mining ive been involved in 2 dieing this way and both times it was to battleships usually a carrier cant do enough dammage to a battleship quick enough to kill it the bs simply warps away and reps its self in warp it warps over and over to keep the fighters from apearing while it heals sufficiently or until the fighters are reported as withdrawn and placed on a new target that is at the fight in doing this battleships can easily kill a stranded carrier without losses these carrier populations are kept in check without troubble and people keep an eye out for stranded carriers6   in my experiance where i live carriers are not over abundant my reasons for assuming this is that carriers are employed mostly hugging the crap out of a station all alone supporting a pos attack or repair transporting stuff and very rarely in a hotdrop if carriers were over abundant in my area i would see them dropped more often and counter dropped if caps were crowding out subcaps there would be roaming cap gangs instead of the roaming nanoecm gangs if anything is getting crowded out its the battleships in my opinion as they have so much troubble killing groups of anything smaller than them are primary targets for jammers cant warp or move fast enough to keep up and cost more than smaller ships that can do the job better
yes
would be especially interesting to see from my pov if the actual cost of the individual capitals ship types  in terms of training and actual isk   still reflects their usefulnessversatility or has run askew
im uncertain on the solution but i agree about the problem
good post bane eve turning to capships online is a problem that needs to be tackled head on hopefully hot dropping can die a hideous deathfully support this being one of the most important topics amongst ccp and the csm
players have seen this coming for a long time now cap ships online is a serious  and complex   issue support
supported
agreed
interesting topic certainly
what are we supposed to be discussing a csm has already supported it there is no reason to needlessly stick thumbs up in the thread you all get to vote on itare we going to have a discussion as required or are you going to vote to have a discussion later
oh christ not this again its being discussed just look at my posts you even have the floor if you want it just because not everybody is into walls of text doesnt mean its being discussed now ill agree that signed is particularly useless in this thread since the op was a request for thoughts and not a request for a specific change but even a statement that people think that theres an issue that needs addressing has a little value
what was to happen if you kill a guy who has been playing 2 months in his caracal you yourself have been playing 6 months then the 2 month old guy gives his killrights to a 34 year old playerwould you be happy i think noti have a bounty on me and it makes no difference to killrights because killrights allow you to kill the ship not the podso as reguards the ingame bounty system transferable killrights make no difference this appears yet again to be another thread that is biased giving the carebear the option to have someone else do what he cant or wont doif you have  think you have the ability to avenge your own loss then do it or pay a merc corp to do it the killrights system works fine as it is
signed
theres an easy solution to your problem dont kill 2month old players if you want to fight carebears legitimately declare war or become a bounty hunter yourselfjust a reminder that the eve economy works because of carebear miners researchers and manufacturers theyre the reason that ships and equipment are as cheap as they are imagine if you had to mine for and build all your ships and equipment from scratch the way the skills break down we cant all be combat specialists but those who have chosen not to go into combat professions should be able to benefit from a market for specialized muscle just as that muscle benefits from a market for specialized ships and equipment transferable killrights legitimizes mercenaries and makes the market for them more efficientyou make a good point the loss of a ship is still a loss though i think its fair a bounty hunter should be able to charge much more to podkill since hell have to take a sec hit in empire to do it
aye
not signed i agree that the bounty system needs some looking into but this is definitely not the way to go i have seen some other alternatives  even detailed one myself   that would solve this issue far better than the ability to give others your kill rights as stated before the proposed system can be easily exploited andhonestlydoesnt make a lot of sense there are other options out there that would be far more feesible than this
the following link is to my proposed bounty system
could you explain the difference between your proposed solution  as shown in the link you provided   and transferable killrights it sounds to me like were agreeing completely the original victim is contracting the killright to a bounty hunter i like your fleshedout contract details they make sense as you say bounty to be paid only if target is actually destroyed but the person placing the bounty should be able to dictate the duration of the contract  maybe within a certain max and min   and the collateral themselvesi agree when killrights are transferred the original aggressor should be notified who is hunting them the hunted can already return fire  anyone can legally return fire when fired upon   so i dont think its necessary for them to be able to legally shoot their hunter on sightillicit bounties  where the person hiring the bounty hunter does not have a legal killright to the hunted   should still exist and the framework of the contract should still work but the bounty hunter assumes all security penalties they may incur these will still exist under the table anyway this can be a way of tracking them and keeping all involved parties honestany of these systems though can be abused by an alt of the original aggressor acquiring the killrights and killing himself for the bounty making sure to minimize his losses any ideas on how to prevent or minimize this
good idea
the most straightforward way to fix bounty hunting that i could think of so far and which hopefully has no loopholes  not easy   would be this transferable kill rights by simple contracts public contracts would require a fee or otherwise the hunted will just snatch them up with an alt  he can do so anyway but at least it will cost him   a new icon for the overview pilots for which kill rights are available  just a detail   context menu option for such pilots show kill rights once kill rights are acquired the hunted gets kill rights on the hunter immediately the hunter gets kill rights after a delay of a minute or so  avoiding nasty backstabbing traps   maybe no notification for the hunted but it appears in his kill rights list the kill right for the hunted expires as soon as the hunter loses the kill right so acquired kill rights are always mutual bounty system as is but with payouts based on guaranteed destroyed value  eg 60 of platinum insurance value for ships 80 of clone value for pods   no insurance payouts for pilots with negative sec standings  bounties this is probably too controversial but sadly i dont see how else the hunted can be stopped from collecting his own bounty by blowing up well insured ships this would also obsolete no insurance payout for suicide attacksi did like the various ideas of combining bounty with contracts at first but i have yet to see a concept that would not allow the hunted to collect his own bounty or which would be otherwise complicated or involve pve  im not saying that those solutions are bad just offering an alternative  partial payout should also increase the motivation to actually put bounty on a pirates head because it guarantees that it wont be used up before the target suffered actual financial damagei like the system described above because it would make it very simple and straight forward for bounty and pirate hunters to find legal targets and hopefully help create a better balance between bad guys and good guys in empire space  right now its mostly bad guys vs carebears afaict   pirates would still get the advantage of a larger selection of targets and easy hauler kills while legal hunters get the advantages of a positive sec status and the additional income from bounties  as well as the incharacter moral high ground     in any case i am glad that bounty hunting is in the spotlight and i am sure that the csm will do a fine job at presenting the various ideas to ccp who will hopefully come up with a solution that actually works i am very much looking forward to what comes out of this
via my system multiple people can take out contracts as long as you have a bounty on your head someone can take out a contract on your life the main difference between my idea and a simple transferrence of kill rights is that in my system you dont get to choose who hunts the person who you have kill rights against its open to the public at the same time you arent recieving isk for your kill rights the collaterals are an isk sink and thirdly you still maintain your kill rights even if you put up a bounty so there ends up being more pvp all around while also making it a possibly lucrative profession and even if the hunted isnt notified of their hunter the hunter should at least be kos to the hunted that way the hunted could if nothing else tell when an enemy just entered his area after all its a concord sanctified contract during which the hunter forfeits his rights to protection as far as alts go this could happen but then again it is even easier to exploit at the moment so at least its a mild deterrent besides most pirates are fond of their bounties and the higher your bounty the more likely you can get pvp so most would rather keep the bounty on them i find  i would at any rate  
so a public contract just like other public contracts sounds goodi think id rather see this float freely on the market is hiring someone to avenge your loss more valuable to the victim than getting to legally kill an aggressor is to the hunter i honestly dont know and id be very curious to see which way that would swingim open to convincing but im predisposed to say that if you hire someone else to do your dirty work you forfeit the right to do that work yourself if youre suddenly given the opportunityfair point maybe there should be an indicator in the local channel or on the overview of who has the right to kill you we already have a white skull for someone with a bounty on their head how about a red skull for someone with permission to kill you for a bountyi really like the ideas that have been brought up in this thread if csm presents this to ccp and ccp likes it theyve got a rich mine here for ways it could be implemented

if large acs suck but minmatar bs that use large acs dont suck when fitting large acs then large acs dont suck so if only one of them is suboptimal when fitting large acs and the others arent then the problem isnt in the acs its in the ship that isnt doing its job properly
i have to agree with this one though im not sure if the issue can be solved solely by twieking projectiles or minnie battleshipsif i remember right tempest with max skills is the only minnie bs hull  due the dual damage bonus from hull  that gives more dps out of 800mm repeating ii than siege missile launcher ii in cases you dont have room for damage mods if you dont have minnie bs lvl4 fitting 4x siege missile launcher iis and 4x 800mm repeating iis will most likely give better dps over 6x 800mm repeating iis and 2x siege missile launcher iisin maelstorm  3 launcher slots   you need atleast 1x gyro ii and in typhoon i doubt even 2x gyro iis are enough to boost 800mm repeating ii dps over what siege missli launcher ii can provideok comparing two totally different weaponsystems has its own issues and autocannons are not about damage but i recon were not far from situation where fitting everything but projectiles to minnie bs will give you the best damage output and i find this issue disturbing it sure would be nice to be able fit acs to minnie battleships to get the best dps possibleps maxed out char  maelstrom fitting full rack of neutron blaster cannon iis with cn am will give 506 dps when 800mm repeating artillery iis with rf emp only adds up to 468 dps
lmao mythical fits now with the exact same setups go compare the tanks besides the fact that no one would use that tempest or typhoon setupwrong hyperion is 1261 ms so tempest doesnt even have 100ms advantage besides it taking 3 cycles to get to that max difference so the difference will actually be less sure compare the damage range and tank difference with the abaddon while at iteverything can be good but in different ways blasters are king of peak dps pulse are king of range point is acs offer something different but at bs level theres just no point if you can fly another race and im speaking as a minmatar bs pilot with t2 projectiles torps heavy drones bs 5 basically the works but has a amarr char with amarr bs 4 that performs better as theres just no role for acs at large level if you have an alternativeheres a lesson all t2 close range ammo sucks just minmatar dont have an alternative because emp sucks and so does the faction ammo based on it but eft warriors expect minmatar pilots to use hail because its the highest mythical dpseither fix t1 ammo and its faction varients or hailyou fit 3 gyros on a tempest and ones a basic talk about rubbish fit id love to see your glass tank and your use of it calling it a monster only proves youve never flown the thing any self respecting pilot knows the tempest is weak  even goum says it needs something  
no it does mean they suck but the ship was compensated through another method  extra drone damage for example   id happily lose a drone from maelstrom if it got more damage from its turrets especially if it got more range  ie from pertier system   tempest  typhoon dont need anything taken away if large acs were improved
tbhmaelstorm its really fine but it could really use a tad more agility  think 10   as its one of the worst handling bs and feels incredibly unminmatar it handles much worse then most of its counterparts room for spare drones would be beautiful but isnt all that necessarytyphoon its fine barring one small detail it could really use is switching armourshield hp amounts it is annoying to no end that a ship built for armour tanking has more shield hp then armour and considering that its not a huge hp difference it wouldnt unbalance the ship in any waytempest meh the tempest it gets outpreformed by its tier 1  tier 3 counterparts at whatever you try but its versatile wanting to keep that flavour i would do three things  the last one is a minor issue but still annoying   a   give the tempest 100m3 bandwidth  slighly increasing damage output   and 175m3 dronebay  for a pack of lights plus a pack of mediums   b   give the tempest 10 more agility  its straight line speed is fine but it handles horribly particularly for a minmatar ship   c   switching the tempests armour hp and shield hp values again as a armour tank  mostly its the popular way to fit one   it needs to be focused on armour hp the change is marginal but it would help the ship in its most popular rolefrom there id see how it pans out  but at least itd get a bit more damage output and would be more minmataras it is large acs are soso they lose a number of advantages which medium acs have over medium blasters  particularly because of the ships fitting them   but any major changes would still leave the tempest in the dust and would boost the already good ships maybe tracking would be nice currently a megathron is better at both ganking big things and small things then a tempest is since the tempest uses two damage bonuses to get reasonable dps while the megathron gets a tracking bonus to play with  as only one damage bonus brings its turrets up to awesome dps  
mael does 800 dps from turrets alone with 3 gyro ii 800 iis and rf empit also has the grid to fit 3 falloff rigs for 30km falloff with rf emp easilywhile doing those two it can still fit a bastard tank in the midswhere exactly does that need a boost
the tempest
i can only get 765dps out of said setup  you must be using some hws on top of eft all lvl5 skills   but i get 831dps if i make it 3x magstabs and neutrons and cn amone could think ac fitted mael would outdps blaster fitted mael after the 25 rof bonus those acs get dont you thinknah acs are just fine
something is wrong with your character i get 805 dps at all 5s with no hardwirings
last time i checked 805 was less than 831 so his point is still valid
i have 8x 800mm repeating artillery iis fitted with 3x gyrostabilizer iis and rep fleet emp l on barrels also all the affecting skills show as lvl5 and it tells me 765dps if im truly getting wrong number someone should check if my blaster dps was also off
so large blasters suck and need to be boosted because the megathron would suck if it only had 50 cubes of drone baythat is edfake edit 855 for blasters on a maelstrom but the acs have a whole  tonne more range if the acs are using hail its 890 dps on them and you can easily fit 3 falloff rigs for more range than a blaster ship could ever hope to haveonly if blasters dont use cap are as easy to fit as the 800mm iis and have 30km falloff with similar pg usehint they dont
its 8046 for 8x 800mm t2 ac with 3x gyro t2 and rf empwith 8x neutrons t2 with 3x mfs t2 and cn am its 855 although will have serious fitting issues nevermind range with such a heavy and slow ship which is why the hyperion closed the small gap between gallente bs and tempest while all the other tier 3 bs were made slow and heavyyour being idiotic i didnt say anything like that so stop with the what if rubbish because its nothing like the situation described maelstrom has the max number of turrets possible and a rof bonus so only way to give it more damage is through drone baytyphoons ac damage is pathetic tempests ac damage is pathetic maelstroms isnt bad so if ac damage was increased  such as through the ammo   and any other changes like falloff per tier that would help maelstrom the most then knocking a heavy drone off it would balance the whole lot up
okay so you get about 30 dps more with blasters thats about the dps from one small turret big deal also you get 30km range with acs blasters are within 15km and the blasters will be using cap and will therefore make it harder to run a tank on top of that the mael is somewhat bulky and slow and therefore isnt cut out for a blaster boat the reason the mael seems to be unminmatar is that it has a defined role that of sitting back from the fight and raining hell on the enemy the phoon and pest are much more flexible that said ive personally witnessed a single mael  with the help of myself in a stealth bomber   beat a team of two hyperions that were using ecm drones the mael pilot had to use 3 cap charges the entire fight and never hit armor and to dissuade the comments both hyperion pilots were professional mercs and had more than 15mil sp each just because you get marginally more dps out of blasters doesnt mean theyre better than acs only an idiot would sacrifice 15km of range for 30 dps
no that is exactly what you said domis blaster damage is pathetic megathrons blaster damage is pathetic hyperions isnt bad so if blaster damage was increased  such as through the ammo   and any other changes that would help hyperion the most then knocking a heavy drone off it would balance the whole lot upbull ing  all ships need to be considered in their entirety two of the ships that use large acs are fine andor very good one of the ships is notthat doesnt mean there is a problem with large acs it means there is a problem with the one ship which is not fineor hell here is a better exampleidiots waaa large lasers suck my apoc is terriblenot idiots no the geddon and abaddon are fine the apoc sucks so its not the large lasers its the apocif you took all the drones off the geddon it would suck too but that doesnt mean large lasers suck it means that if you took off all the drones the geddon would suck
but what you just said isnt what you said either your changing the statement and claiming its the samethe fact the ships being compared are nothing like your comparison is obviously beyond you but keep trying to make the same point with increasing hostility until no one can be bothered to discuss things with you like normal what im saying is more damage should come from acs than the other sources  drones and missiles   than the current balance theyre the racial weapon after all increasing the ac performance will help tempest especially and also the typhoon a bit but will also shift some of the maelstroms damage to its turrets

first stop with the eft no one actually uses hail due to the penalties
i had include reload time in dps ticked on thus lower dps by ignoring reload time neutron setup i used to show how autocannons in my opinion lack dps on shorter range goes up to 855dps ofcourse blaster setup  optimal rigs   would dominate by its dps only up to 12km compared to ac setup  falloff rigs   but then again maelstorm with mega pulses  optimal rigs   will outdps autocannon fit starting from 14km all the way up to 28km anyway the reason i brought these lolfits up is that in my opinion they are way too good when you remember that were using completely wrong weapon system with hull that has rof bonus to projectiles and should shine with that weaponsystemin scene i brought up autocannons are second best on close range second best on long range  after 30km your only scratching paint   they have second best tracking  though only by 00012 so lets call it shared the best   only thing they really have going for em is the most cap friendly tittle and even this tittle can be questioned when you think how meny of closerange cookiecutterfotm setup are build around effective hp buffer tanks if you go and try the same thing in hulls like megathron and apoc or geddon you will notice that in these hulls the right weaponsystem is the best on most areas if not in all of em so why cant maelstorm  or typhoon it has the same 5 rof bonus   do the same with autocannons is it because autocannons dont really have role due somewhat poor design is it because these ships are not made for autocannons in the way like megathrons apocs and geddons are made for their weaponsystemsid say its because both most if not every minnie bs needs little finetuning and so does both autocannons and artilleries id say its impossible to fix all these issues that minmatar battleships have by only looking one possible source of the problem
why should more damage come from acs why change 3 ships and 1 or more weapon systems in order to fix 1 ship its ed when you balance you change as little as possible in order to get the desired result in order to lower the chances of unintended side effectsand no the ships being compared are very similar if you took the drones away from either of them they would suck its the same problem with the pest except it never had them in the first place
i think large autocannons are fine given that they use no cap to be balanced they have to be less good than either blasters or pulses that is if you ignore cap the autocannon should look less attractive tempest could use some help though
youre a mwding minmatar ship so range isnt the issue youve got a buddy webbing them to effectively nil so tracking isnt the issue and youre in a capboosted pvp fit so cap recharge isnt the issue on the other hand theres a good chance theyre fitting an armour tank meaning the damage type is very good and its got far higher dps than even faction emp tell me again why people dont use it
you might be a mwding minmatar ship but youre still not going to go more than 1ksec in a none nano setup any cruiser with a mwd will be able to outrun you its just not worth cutting your cap in half for a 30 dps increase when you can get the extreme falloff of barrage especially when youre in a relatively slow ship
signed
it really depends on what you are doing and what you are fighting there is a lot of benefit to be had by changing ammos to a shorter range higher damage option and there is only one mwding minnie ship that goes under 1kms and it can fit 3 falloff rigs easily to hit 15km falloff easily enough for most engagementsespecially when a lot of targets like blaster ships will be wanting to come to youhail isnt good for what we do but neither are blasters of any sort and that doesnt mean both dont have a use
my ship fits have no tackle gear  theyre gangonly if youre in a gang where battleships dont tackle that means youve probably got frigates that do frigates can pretty easily outspeed fleeing cruisers and get the web on them at which point your 1 kms is plenty to catch up to them and cutting your cap in half is a farce  the cap recharge on these ships while in combat comes almost entirely from the booster the phoon gains 29 caps the pest gains 36 and the mael gains 48 by switching from all hail to all rf emp if you want to recharge naturally you can dock up failing that carry rf emp  its still good to have on hand  and switch out ammo when you actually care
signed
thanks for explaining it out for the masses now i dont need to do the samenot signedim happy with autocannonsand when i need raw damage i just switch to a mega
im not sure to cry or laugh at the tempest and typhoon setups the fact you think theyre good and hence think the weapons are fine is frankly amazing maelstrom setup is fine really but then you dont have much choice besides active tank 3 gyros and 8 gunsrcu and pdu on a typhoon yes because this will offer so much more than another races ship that doesnt need so many fitting modsshield tank pest with 2 cpus why not just use a maelstrom with say an istab for a much better tankmythical because its quite easy to open eft then copy the setup onto a forum these actually used in game wouldnt suprise me really the number of awful ship setups ive seenthe fact that a shield tank tempest is quite pointless is clearly besides the pointyes because having only 15km optimal with max damage ammo is awful  try having 3km   nevermind the option of taking a few seconds to switch to scorch and having 40 odd km range which more than makes up for a 200 odd ms max mwd speed no they have limited damage switching missiles have damage switching tracking you do realise a neutron t2 blaster is nearly identicle tracking to 800mm t2 ac so scratch off that less obvious advantage as noneexistantclearly the extra 08 damage  552 vs 56   is worth the 125x cap use increase optimal penalty falloff penalty and tracking penalty you get more damage from cn am due to hit qualitytempest is a monster i can sort of agree it is a abomination which is a kind of monster
fyi those are some ing terrible setupsfirst phoon setup  no tackle hail ammo lol and pds with a ty armour tank seen more competent fits come from brucepest try tracking anything with those guns when youre moving also basic gyro are you having a laugh 2x coproc dear lord son learn how to compensate on cpumael christ again with the 800s theyre crap for normal usage terrible tracking and again with a coproc wasting a lowif youre going to argue about ship balance at least learn how to fit the things
i have one tiny edit request not sure if you already had those in mind as a subset having to travel across the region to refine ore or reprocess makes little sense it lessens the value of being able to remotely install a manufacturing jobnice workpatri

lots of ideas herei fully support some of them im strongly against some others and neutral towards the rest oh and some of them are too vagueso what should i dosince you are sponsoring the whole list anyway you probably dont need any votes pthere are more ideas that i support thoughbut here are just some negative pointsremove the 10 bid increase on auctions  this would turn auctions into 001 isk race as is the case with the current market orderscorporation wide evemail box for people outside the corporation to contact a corporation without contacting one specific person more opportunitites for spammersmepe research on bpcs no no no please no as much as i would like to be able to research a cheap copy i feel it would break the whole bpo system after all its perfectly logical that a copy comes with restrictions including mepealso this idea contradicts with your previous statement of increased barriers to entry which itself is too vagueitems variation an excellent and longcoveted proposition in itself but i suspect that the design and programming efforts needed for its implementation would be enormous in the current state of eve its just another bling idea on par with platenary interaction or painting your shipsthat being said the majority of your points would have gotten my vote if you needed one   
thank you for putting this together lavista the inclusion the ability to buy from specific vendors on the market would be a huge advantage and i wholeheartedly support this current system is a bit like not being able to target individual ships  which would make no sense
i fully support this we science and industry people need more love
sorry cannot pledge my supporti agree with another poster that contracts can deal with buyimng from a specific purchaser  this one point prohibits me from agreeing as i consider the other things i disagree with as minor  what i would like to see and is not in the document is the power for the seller to ajust pricing based on standing basicly 2 settings on a specific sell order being  as you may for example want to limit sales to enemies in low sec or 0 but not in empire   a  surcharge for each full point of standing below value example add 10 for each point below 5 do not sell to standings below valueexample do not sell below 55

instead of depleting existing minerals which would make existing holders mad why not have exploration like depletable depositsidea moon minerals exploration sites on spawned on moons on random basis they stay until depleted each spawn is say 14 to 30 day supply this metal will be in addition to any other items on the moon once found with probes the minerals are extracted through regular pos operation this would help fix the huge inflation of high end moon metals and allow industrialist some of the exploration fun not all exploration needs to be pew pew
even better than that  because it takes about 8 hours to put up or take down a pos worthy of defending dyspo   would be that all moons have their perminant stuff like they do now but can have one or more temporary ones during downtime the server would populate x many random moons with one or more additional but temporary materials if the moon has a temporary material on it allready then it is skipped if it doesnt then it is given an aditional material that lasts until its depleted the amount of cycles it can be mined would be random but probably not an entire months worth the method the server would choose for determining what aditional material to put on that moon is not in my realm of expertesethe idea here is to help avoid having only a small minority of players able to dominate the game to the extent that they simply cant be beat the curent system alows a single type of income to be so highly valuable and protectable that controlling it allows its owners to build wealth so much faster than any potential challengers there is absolutely no balance in this for example i could make over a billion a week buying and selling transcranial microcontrollers from and to npcs but only if i was the only one doing that there is competition in that market and you simply cant keep other people from using the market therefore it has a ballance with megacyte you can guard all the systems that have megacyte in its roids but people get mega from grinding up loot and drone alloys so you cant really pinch that market too hard either the bottom lineanything in an mmorpg that allows there to be a final victory  such as a resource that if totally controlled by a group grants them an unstopable advantage   effectively ends the game for everyone there is no way that anyone else can win if a selfpropetuating victory condition has been achieved
static and valuable resources promote the conquest of territory to capture those resourcesdynamic andor random resources promote people sitting on their butts and rolling the dice with what space they have moving pos within their space when new opportunities arisei am sure you can figure out which one is best for a game designed around internet spaceship combat but just in case ill tell you its not the one that is proposed in the op
every time a gtc is sold it is imediatly applied to the buyers account no gtc can be sold twice in short these players are gaining isk by paying for others to play
so it is still buying isk with cash and allows people who do not work hard or even work at all within the game to buy expensoive implants  or anything else  therefore people with plenty of rl cash can buy plenty implants which is completely contrary to your saying that high level implants would be a reward for those who work hard
stefan said the implants should be sold by npcs therefore its an isk sink when the money goes to an npc instead of a player therefore its an isk sink also most people who sit in stations are most likely traders  like me   and earn their money by trading not by gtcs anyways  even though id love to have 6 or 7 implants  and id gladly pay 1015b for a set    its still probably a little too much for most players in eve veterans or not
listen implants add less and less efficiency to learning as they go upthe difference between 4s and 5s is relatively small  about 8 hours or so for every four days depending on your base skills   so 6s and 7s while making training faster wouldnt give players using them as much of an edge as youd think  besides it takes about a month to get basic learning to 5 with decent starting attributes why spend a billion isk on a months worth of training   and it would cause an extra isk sink npc items take isk out of circulation while player items dont even if someone bought 7s and then sold the character the isk spent to pay for the character would be coming from isk already in circulation while the isk used for the implants would have been removed from circulation how is that not an isk sinkmy only complaint with implementing this is that it would keep people with them from pvping of course if you have the isk to pay for a set of these chances are good that you dont pvp anyway
i beleive the op meant to litearlly give new characters 6 and 7 implants as veterans would be the only one able to afford them they would literally have to be given to new players who hope to catch up to older players
wronga they are not an isk sink unless they are destroyed until then theyve only been an investmentb if you or others cannot see how 6 or 7 implants sold from npcs would affect the market for player sold 5 implants  or lower   then you are sorely misguided it would ruin the market and value for themc you have absolutely no evidence at all that gtc sellers are the minority of welthy players you are simply guessing the fact is that isk can be bought with rl cash through gtc sales which immediately grants such people an advantage in purchasing highlevel implants  or other expensive items  
only if players can make them most implants should be craftable with the uncraftable being the named just like modulescannot support op
a no no no no it would only be an isk sink if you bought it from an npc as the isk would go out of the game its an isk sink when the isk goes out of the game the liquid isk it does not matter what you do with the item since you cannot sell it back to an npc therefore there is no isk faucet for it and youve already used up the isk get itb i never said anything about the them not ruining the market as well i didnt see you say anything about it maybe they would ruin the market maybe they wouldnt what do you consider ruining the market anywaysc true i was simply guessing still i was probably guessing right yet the gtcsellers have an advantage nevertheless therefore its not a valid argument to forbid 6 or 7 implants from the game only due to gtcsellersanyways if it wasnt clear from my previous post im not supporting those higher level implants i just wasnt against them either therefore i guess were on the same side owl algernon
im not going to argue semantics as its off topic i perfectly understand what you are saying  which is correct   but i think my previous statement wasnt phrased well regardless the argument for introducing 6 and 7 implants into the game as an isk sink is utterly idiotic if you want an isk sink then take all the current implants  or just 1s to 5s   and have npcs sell them theres your isk sink introducing 6s and 7s to do so is simply stupidif you think they wouldnt ruin then market then you are delusional regardless as i stated above have npcs sell 1s to 5s otherwise what you and others are too myopic to understand is that the rich  gtc sellers t2 builders and those with more free time   will gain more skill points while those casual players get screwed see a pattern here its a horrible ideaprobably guessing right hahaha prove it you are again guessing by saying you are probably guessing right stick to facts fact  one can sell gtcs for isk which means one can buy high value in game items for real life money so those with the inclination and then cash can buy 6 or 7 implants while others cannot its a moronic ideaintroducing 6 or 7 implants hurts newer players and helps older ones the skill point difference between newer and older players would only grow wider if you cant see that fact then im not sure what to saysure sounds like youre supporting them to me
first of npcs are actually selling 1 to 5 implants via the loyality point store  however its called   therefore 1 to 5 implants already are isk sinks im not sure why we even started arguing whether it isshould be an isk sinkagain i have to ask what do you consider ruining the market i would see the 6 and 7 implants as an addition not as a chance in the implants system therefore it shouldnt affect the market at least not significantly also if they should affect the implant market greatly it doesnt have to be for the worse i mean it can affect the market without ruining  whatever you mean by this   itgtcsellers can buy anything with rl money so why does it sound moronic that they could buy 6 and 7 implants i mean they can buy a 70m sp char right away which is in my opinion an even greater advantage i would protest against gtcsellers if there was another way to play the game for free  yep ive only payed 15 for all my time in eve  anyways i wont reply anymore to this topic as not to bring our discussion into a fight at least youre considering others arguments which is goodgood luck on protecting us against those almighty attribute enhancers
completely and utterly wrong you contradicted yourself in the same paragraph they are not isk sinks because they are purchased with loyalty points no isk leaves the game through players purchasing implants with loyalty points i would think this statement would be selfevidentsemantics again suffice to say that its my personal opinion that few people would bother with 5 implants when 6 or 7 exist unless the skill requirements for 6 or 7 are so heavy that 5s would remain useful for an extended period in which case the usefulness of 6 or 7 would be seriously compromised this is why 4 implants are so cheap now they dont serve much of a purpose beccause the difference between training for 4s and 5s is negligible and 5 are far more advantageous in the long run which is precisely the kind of market that 6s or 7s would target
do you use the lp store a 5 implant costs 65000 lp and 65000000 isk thats 65 million leaving the game per lpbought 5 implant and the reason 4s are so cheap is because they cost 1265ths of what 5s cost  the isklp is almost identical
yes ive used the lp store countless times im aware of the isk cost however as you probably know 65m isk to an npc is hardly much of an isk sink when compared to the billions the op has proposedive said it several times already trying to rationalize introducing 67 implants for the reason of creating an isk sink is indeed moronic for all ccp would have to do is have npcs sell 1 through 5 implants directly from npcs to create the sinkthe isk sink defense is inane the implants arent needed and the problem they would create is simply that the skill point gap between newerpoorer players and wealthierolder players would widen
i was calling you on your comment that no isk leaves the game through players purchasing implants with loyalty points since clearly some isk does just not as much as the isksink fetishists would like i agree with you on 6 and up implants being crazy though the only change id like to see to learning implants is making 2 implants need cybernetics ii and 3 implants need cybernetics iii and even thats just for flavour
i would love this
terrible ideanot signed for obvious reasons stated above
this there will always be ships out of wack and people fervently trying to keep their iwin mobile i only do small scale pvp and the falcon utterly screwbars everything about it now i have to sit in one myself to counter other falcons and making the game utterly boring for those poor few gangs that didnt bring any of their own
basically it boils down to the fact that while you can counter other cloaking recons using conventional  and very varied means   youre either bringing your own falcons  which have a ton of extra utility as well   or bringing very specific counterfits which are totally useless  read big liability to any small gang   otherwisea huge part of the issue is the range really  and relative ineffectiveness of eccm particularly on nonbs ships   which makes counterfitting not so effective  as you still get two to three  depending on racesensor str   ships jammed out from the fight to one falcon even when counterfitting  not to mention losing a bunch of midslots alltogether which isnt that horrible  altogether the best way to deal with one  for a small gang anyway   is to bring a falcon yourself  or a very specific counterfit   which wouldnt be a issue at all if it werent for the covops cloak nobody ever complains about the rook  which is defacto obsolete i almost never see them  the ease of use makes a lot of people simply use falcon alts
i think the fact that ecm is chance based is a factor here i can be racially pumping out 14 points of jam per cycle so say vs a bs i have about a 60 chance of a jam with each ecm module if someone gets ontop of me by nano or probing and warping i die like a t1 cruiser the problem jamming is that there is no garrentee which is why its so powerful so when it does work its extremely effective
you should be pumping more out with racials actuallythats what jammers are for  and why you dont just unload all your jammers on a single target at a same time   even two ships  hacceptor   are most likely not going to kill a falconyeah but statistically its extremely effective even though there are no actual guarantees itll work sure sometimes you get unlucky jams on someone but sometimes you jam 4 eccmed bs  which you in theory should never haveyes jamming isnt 100 certain  which is good for you as eccmed ships would be incredibly hard to jam and jamming would only happen if jam str added up you effectively put more ships out of the battle this way since throwing 15 points of jam on a 22 point ship is rather effective particularly vs a slow locking ship  while itd be totally useless if jamming wasnt chance basedhowever statistically youre doing a awesome job at reducing the effective enemy forces much better then any other recon and at ranges where classical setups cannot even target and nanoships take their sweet time to arrive  while someone will be on that 50km away lachersis in a very short time you only need to cross 22 km before you can point with a overheated disruptor  jamming not being chance based would be a definite ecm nerf  a eccmed bs  when heating   would require 3 racial jammers to have any effect  yes effect would be total   and if doesnt have correct racials sorry mate your two jammers arend doing anything at all everright now youll jam a ceptor on a off jammer imagine the fun if you couldnt possibly do that but ill always say it none of this would be a issue if falcons didnt have a covops cloak
falcons are trivial to counter im getting fed up of being killed or driven off by tacklers acting as warpin points by snipers by eccmed nanohacsnanorecons  arazus and lacheses in particular   so im considering returning to scorps  more ehp similar jamming power and far cheaper so i dont have to run away whenever something gets within 60 km of me
however in small gang pvp you dont have designated antifalcon boats at all times as a rule and the covops cloak makes it really really nasty because you cant scout for them to bring specific counters which is why people are arguing the covops cloak plus its capabilities in combination are the issue particularly and specifically for small gang warfarein bigger gangs the covops cloak and the element of suprise doesnt have such a huge impact as you will have enough extra tacklers and nanoships to take care of the threat
not supportedthe damn ship can only do one thing well jam it doesnt do any damage it doesnt tackle it doesnt nano its not even a good scoutadapt and stop whining
the issue is that unlike a rook it can do two things well jam and covops cloak thats what the discussion is aboutthat said weve adapted weve got our own falcons the issue isnt that we cannot adapt  we can and did   the issue is that the ship is a showstopper for small gang pvp unless you have falcons of your own or very specific counterfits which are utterly wasted for other purposes in a small gang you cant scout for a falcon so you know wether to bring them or not  while your scout should spot a scorprookbbkitsune and act accordingly if he doesnt and you get suprise  then your scouting is badunlike any other cloaky recon which you do not need special preparations to counter most of the time its the crux of the matter and the reason why seeing rooks is very very rare
this just isnt true and you know it bringing a sniper in a small gang is a specific counter of limited use elsewhere ill accept that but inties nanorecons  particularly arazu and lachesis   or hacs such as cerberus and nanoishtar are standard small gang ships and will very quickly remove that falcon from the field
so long as number 3 is a part of this agenda this is an incredibly bad idea you will only support this if you want to see the game become a  hole
constructive criticism as always i see
this is all very well kelsin and may have been a nice way to start out sovereingty claims at the beginning of eve but somehow i cant see your plans ever seeing the light of dayhow would you for example compensate those alliances who have spent many a year and considerable amounts of isk on building up pos networks and stations in order to claim their own spacewhat bemuses me about your efforts here though is the fact that your corpalliances mission statement clearly tells us that you have no interest in holding or claiming space so why the time spent telling those of us who do how to do it betterif you were a space holding alliance putting forth these ideas then they would surely hold more water but for an alliance who didnt have the caps necessary to remove sov from an enemy during a recent war your words are only akin to a baby flinging its toys from the pram when it doesnt get its own wayit is precisely this type of attempt from your alliance to force a very specific agenda that suits only yourself that irritates me i do hope that the remainder of the csm delegates are able to withstand the constantwhining of the new chairman
posting in a star fraction sovhater threadsorry i had to now to be serious1   agree capships online sucks2   disagree smaller gangs are not capable of causing the damage that a large fleet can cause letting them do so would not be realistic yes you can harass or annoy a faction but a bunch of people in dinghies with rocket launchers arent likely to do any lasting damage compared to say the entire british royal navy besides there are already many advantages that small roaming gangs have in 00 just that gaining sovereignty isnt one of them3   neutral towards the idea disagree strongly with your proposal capturable stargates encourage no demand gatecamps people regularly complain about gatecamps as it is anything that gives people a good valid reason to gatecamp will quickly make 00 less safe than downtown baghdad on free firearm friday as people camp gate after gate to maintain or establish sovereignty this also means that anyone jumping in is a potential sov threat since they might see an unguarded gate and call in their friends youd need a nanoship or an interceptor just to get through the sheer volume of bubblecamps this proposal would generate
in all fairness a single submarine today could turn most of the eastern seaboard into a parking lot but this is a game and we should just stick to make believei think itd be keen to see small well coordinated and tailored gangs be able to have some sort of harassment ability when it comes to pos structures not to destroy them not knocking them into reinforced or whatever the term may be but rather into an offline status for example ten stealth bombers decloak and unload their volley into a research or manufacturing structure and warp out before the towers can get a lock perhaps a special type of cruise missile is called for a shieldbreaker of some kind like in dune slow moving and totally ineffectual against ships but can bypass pos shields no problem its ballsy and its got a great yarr quotient staring down all those pos guns which are going to melt you instantly sneaking into sov space but it accomplishes sweet  all now if said strike were to knock that structure into a offline status for ten hours or so youd actually be able to conduct a viable 00 guerilla campaign thats a little more exciting than using t1 frigs to gank semiafk miners and ratters
keep in mind that im suggesting multiple small gangs as an alternative to a single large one  not a single small gang instead of a single large one the idea being youd still need numbers to take and hold sovereignty but youd spread those numbers out across multiple systemsgrids instead of having them all focus on one grid and strain the server i guess my response to this is isnt 00 supposed to be unsafe secondly the popular complaint about the current state of 00 sovereignty is that its mostly empty space with the occasional massive fleet battle in which lag is a large factor to take those massive battles and spread them out across space and time would ease lag issues and mitigate the ghost town feel of much of 00the general principle is that the required military presence to hold sovereignty advantage in 00 should be less hot and cold  due to single timed reinforcement battles   and more a patrolled presence style of control
as to offlining pos modules before the guns can target whats to stop a group of bombers from doing this over and over and over and over ad nauseum until the entire pos is offline after all if any opposition arrives they can just cloak at a safe until the opposition leavesas to 00 being unsafe turning it into gatecamporama as your proposal suggests will make it not only very dangerous but very dangerous in an annoying way in other words dont waste your time with anything not a nanogang because it wont get through the bubblecamps of people maintaining their sov combined with the other sfchampioned proposals to remove local destroyable outposts and limiting map information this would turn 00 from empirebuilding space into a giant freeforall counterstrikewithspaceships clusterf well you get the idea kinda like fw testing on singularity without the free shipsi disagree with your idea of what 00 space is intended to be i would like to see it more dynamic yes and i would like to see the larger alliances with massive holdings forced more into working to keep it but i dont think 00 should be quite as dynamic as you dodisagree on principle i suppose
fair enough but id suggest that there is a way to increase the dynamism of territory holding without adversely affecting the concept of empire building the proposal i linked leaves the infrastructure building industrial pos side of things intact but takes the territoryholding tools  jump bridges cyno jammers plus new additions of gateusage alarms   and grants those via a new more dynamic system based on subcapital combati think its fair to say that powerful tactical tools like the jump bridge should be based on an alliances patrolling presence rather than long term fixed constructs like the pos which rely more on logistics and fueling than on active duty combat patrols especially because the pos shield and reinforcement mechanic lead to massive battles at predetermined times that necessarily involve capital ships while it makes sense to have a pitched battle over a fixed structure the concept of territory ownership is not based on the outcome of a single conflict but on a consistent military presence and enforcement on borders and chokepointsthe idea that ownership of territory should be determined by having two massive armies meet on a battlefield and duke it out is a bit outdated and thats what this seeks to resolve
the problem is it turns 00 spaceholding not so much into something you do in eve but a 40hourperweek job that doesnt pay any money not everyone wants to spend all their online time running patrols through empty space
but this problem is tweakable  you can have reinforcementstyle timers  as the proposal i linked has   so that when a capture point is contested the defending alliance has a certain amount of time to reset their claim if they fail to do so they lose control of the point under the current system there are no patrols at all but that doesnt mean the alternative is nonstop patrolling jobstyle
no the popular complaints are1 pos warfare sucks when there isnt a fight2 there are no realistic goals for small gangs that matter3 pos are too difficult to put up and take downfor the most part people love big fleet fights they dont like the lag but they love the big fightsyou can already do this just attack a bunch of different pos at the same time
would you fools stop using that word it means change combat dynamism doesnt ing mean anything if you want to see dynamism in territory holding then get off your lazy butt and go take it or go and destroy the towers or make it your own as far as i can tell there has been plenty of dynamism in combat over the past yearand if you dont believe that just ask triumvirate ascn lv veritas fix smash roadkill and all the rest i cant rememberanything that increases dynamism must by definition adversely effect the ability to empire build the problem is not that capitals are valuable the problem is that there are no intermediary benefits for smaller gangs fixing one does not mean scrapping the everything else in sov warfarehave you ever even taken down a jammer they are outside the shields you dont have to reinforce anything same for bridges and generators you want to take them down get off your butt and do it if there is a problem with how difficult it is to do then say there is a problem with how difficult it is to do and dont say lets scrap the entire idea of fighting over sovereigntyare you arguing based on realism now seriously
poses currently grant industrial and sovereignty benefits to their owners moving the sovereignty benefits to a different system doesnt mean the epic elements of pos warfare would go away there could still be pos sieges and capship warfare  but to gain the jump bridge cynojammer and some new abilities alliances would instead engage in subcapital territory controlsubcapitals engaging in territory security actions adds dynamism where constructing poses top gain territory fails to and it provides subcapitals with objectives to maintain the security or overturn the security of a given territory where pos sovereignty fails to
alliances will take part in whatever gives them the most benefit that doesnt mean that its a good idea it means that alliances are rational actors and holy lord stop using dynamism if you dont know what it means if you want smaller gangs to have objectives then give them objectives dont remove the entire idea of taking space being a strategic game from the game
the word dynamic  and the made up nounform im using here dynamism   is very appropriate the proposal to reexamine 00 sovereignty is in response to an overly static sovereignty system to make it more dynamic without making it a pingpong of major objectives we need a broad array of smaller objectives that add up organically to create a larger effectthis is where a distributedobjectives mechanic can really shine instead of a linear series of massive laginducing battles that is pos warfare stargate warfare would be a parallel set of objectives fought on separate grids and in separate systems throughout a region the results of which would add up to a cumulative effect
so you admit you are making up a definition for a word in order justify your argumentthere are smaller objectives that add up to create a larger effect1 economic suppression1 taking out jammers2 taking out bridges3 taking out economic pos4 taking out sov holding posif there isnt enough you just make them easier and add more ability to take out economic structuressov warfare isnt static if you believe that you clearly havent been paying attention to all the taken space and failed alliances its been static on your front but that has nothing to do with whether or not its static all around1 its not linear as you are describing i know ive been using that word but a better one would be contiguous2 parallel objectives are ed it promotes blobbingas you attempt to capture 2 objectives i blob each in order to defend them and and removes all strategic decision making since all gates are equally valuable
i agree with this topic sovereignty system needs reexamination another problem with sov is that 00 alliances usually claim far more space then they actually use and newcomers to 00 do not really have a chance to take on them with the reinforced timers and the fast capital deployment possible in eve i think some game mechanic change penalizing the claiming of space that is not actually being used by the claimer would do good to the game
yep im happy to support it

well if you were going into combat and you were planing on not going into siegh mode aka ganking some battleships or somethingthen having the rail makes it deal more dps than the other dreads  minus the minicarrier of doom  its a dumb reason but its factual
you dont use a 2 billion isk ship to gank a 100m battleship and a moros seems to do just fine at ganking a battleship in siege mode that is too say without drones
good looking out big guy you keep believing in yourself
no idea who you are but you gave me a smile all the best
you must be very excited about this trip does ccp pays for the beers
ah youve got the keep optimistic end of the day i do have a lot of faith in fellow eve fans i really do i think everything will be fine in the end
i find it funny that he states they dont have general support when he himself can go to the forum where people are showing there support and clearly see they have support
actually if you read carefully i stated popular general supportas was first staed by the chairman about the topics selectedyou can see clearly that the thumbs up for support for some of these topics is low hence not popular just by being read 200 times or posted on the topics thread doesnt make something have popular general support from a player base of 200000you may have noted the small hint of sarcasm in my post i would have expected a slightly more intelligent reply from a candidate than i recieved anyway the main part of my post is still relevant and unaddressed
i think we are all aware that the 5 rule expressed in the csm docs is unreasonable  would require 11000 support posts in a thread   hence the term  popular support   is taken as being relative to the support other issues are getting i am unrepentant in my support of the most popular issues being expressed on the assembly hall forum as i believe its the job of the csm to get substantive answers on these things to the player base through the process of constructive discussion and feedbackits said sarcasm is the lowest form of wit you know nobody forces you into the gutter
ok my opiniion about the topic a titan is a 50b150b asset depending on fittings and manufacturing costs so making it 3x6x more expensive then a mothership and 250x750x more expensive then a fitted tier2 battleship therefor i think its only fair that it is nearly impossible to kill yes it is true that only rich well established alliances can get their hands on 1 or more and therefor making them even harder to defeat and thus inbalancing the game but like in every mmorpg the best and most difficult things to obtain are not for poorly organized clansguildscorporations or for casual players but for the best of the best and thus making them even better ofcourse there always should be an opening for the underdog to win and thefefor i think introducing an only carriermodule to tackle capitalships could be the answer for bringing balance and giving the underdogs the chance to destroy supercapitals ofcourse this again should be outbalanced ofcourse by increasing the damage multiplier on titans for capital gun turrets as it can never be the intention for a carrier to solo kill a titan so bottom line give them the chance to tackle until help is there or die trying to keep it tackled long enough titans combined with sov 4 combined with cynojammer is in my opinion a bit overkill but i think it can be solved by either not allowing titans in systems with a cynojammer or only making pos structures inside the pos shield indestructibleps i have no experience with capital fights or titans so i base my personal opinion on information and post i read
i cannot find any thread in the csm forums discussing evetv which suprises me given the amount of people who complain about its absence anybody have any points to make on the subject
not really having a point to makebut if you create an issue thread in the assembly hallit would receive my support
supporti killed 15billion isk yesterday when a corp came to try and kill me  lol  how was i supposed to l00t the wrecks whislt i was still fighting do you know how much i spent on cap boosters and armor repair in that fight 20million isk for 5 mins of pvp and i earnt nothing

very much signed i plan on getting two new monitors quite soon as it is doing anything but carebearing is impossible at 1024x768 theres overview selected item drones local any intel channels you may have the fleet youre in the moduleenergy readoutoften when im roving i dont even see my ship or any of the action simply because of all the damn windows so let us move what windows we want to a secondary screen with the f11 constellation maps and whatnot that would be keen
thats the problem  the line down the middle is distracting with two monitors and how many video cards support 3 video outputs on a single card

i like these proposed changes
after thinking about it for a bit i dont think the nidhoggur changes will change it to be a better shield tank than armor tank it will however give it better cap regen the nidhoggur doesnt really need as big a boost than the naglfar and without significant changes to cap recharges  cprs vs pds it probably wont ever be shield tanked
the naglfar does more damage than any of the other dreads at an effective pos siege range  all the others only have 4 high slots 3 for weapons the naglfar has 5 high slots for 4 weapons   you are forgetting that the naglfar can fit close range weapons and still be effective while blasters and pulses tend to come in under the range required to be effective in a pos siege and useless unless you are ontop of enemy capitals in a capital fightif you were to balance it to require just guns you would need to remove a high slot like all the other dreads then you could give double damage bonuses instead of the current split bonuses there is a danger of making all the dreads too generic though i did like the flavour the split system gave the phoenix does the lowest damage but it is forgiving of range the moros does excellent drone damage but it cant use blasters effectively in most situations it also has a weaker tank than the revelation the revelation is probably the best dread out there for sieges not requiring you to keep pressing fire having a good range and tanking well the nidhoggur is already arguably the best carrier out there for the usual remote repping circlejerk setups that you see these days giving it an extra mid would be unbalanced it had one removed to give it an extra low i personally think this was a mistake given that there are already two armor tanking carriers and this as you point out means training another skillset although being minmatar you should probably be used to this faster regen on the nidhoggur also suits its role as the best remote repping carrier out there being as the cap trick doesnt really work on capital ships it will easily out rep the other carriers the thanatoss damage bonus isnt hugely significant anymore  in days of assigned fighters from behind pos shields it was   with the change to an armor tank the cpu isnt really an issue as it isnt on the archon or thanatos all capital ships need more cpu especially the ones that shield tank you need fitting mods on the phoenixchimera still also which for a capital ship is ridiculous grid as far as im aware is a total non issue ive never seen anyone run out of grid on any potential capital ship fit
supported and pulse have greater range than acs  
just a quick questionthe op states that the nag needs to use 4 damage mods to compete with the other dreadshow can this be when the nag starts with 33 more firepower than other dreads due to 4 weapons instead of 3 assuming tech ii moduleswith todays stacking penalties 3 bcu on a phoenix would only give a total damage modifier of 1573 weapons  157  471compared to a nagflar with 1 bcu and 1 gyro4 weapons  12  48so now you 2 extra slots for tanking whether you go shield or armor i dont knowbut do you still say the nag needs love 
signed
yes please capitals in total need a revamp  tanking is too important to give one race the ubertanks and the rest some nice little bonuses  but that should be a different topic right now the only reason to train for minmatar capitals is that they look awesome which is cool but a bit more game balance would be nice     
this
plug it into eft and take a look there are two glaring problems with the nags split weapon bonus first every other dread has two bonuses for its gun type the nag has to one ship bonus for each of its weapon type now take any of the other dreads if they fit 2 damage mods those damage mods apply to all 3 of thier weapons the nag fits two damage and it either only applies to 2 of its weapons or each weapon only gets 1 damage mod to get the same effect as 2 damage mods on all of its weapons it needs to fit 4 damage mods  2 for each weapon  also the relatively low dps of both projectile weapons and capital torps doesnt help the nags dps
theres a lot of misconceptions here that are pretty common with people who dont actually know what theyre talking about first off just because the naglfar has 4 turret slots doesnt mean for half a second it does more damage than any of the other dreads thanks to the reasons i mentioned in the post before this one  mainly that projectile and torp damage is low in comparison to beams  rails  crazy drone bonuses   people will never fit auto cannons on a nag because if for whatever reason you have to shoot things further away  say pos mods or getting hot dropped   youll be completely screwed you could fit pulses on the revelation and get just as long range but youd be in the same boat its much better to fit long range guns and use short range ammo switching to longer range ammo if needed at this point id be very happy with double weapon bonuses for both weapons  just take on rof and damage mod instead of just one  secondly before the nidhoggur change the nidhoggur was the absolute worst carrier by far it had a terrible shield tank and because pds suck vs cap rechargers for cap it had terrible capacitor in order to correct this youd probably need to take away a low slot and add two medium slots  basically taking the previous change in the other direction   and adding a large capacitor buff to the nidhoggur people would probably just armor tank it and use the insane mid slots for even more insane cap regen though oh and you can still assign fighters and sit in poses you just nudge outside the shields assign fighters and go back inside the naglfar is the only capital to require fitting mods chimera and phoenixes use pds for cap regen not fitting
minmatar capitals need some love
i dont have access to eft atm can you put up the dps numbers for the ranged ship setups your talking about pleaserail moros v beam rev v citadel phoenix v   artycitadel    nagcant help but feel that your underestimating the influence of the 4th capital weapon this is 33 more highslot resourse than available to other dreads which compensate via better use of damage mods
has never made sense to me that i needed to train 2 weapon systems to 5 use 2x the damage mods and my reward for that is medicore dps and a weak tanksupported

longrange dreads with 3x damage mod  naglfar with 2x bcu 1x gyro best combo   closestrange ammo garde iis all skills at 5 as the republic fleet xl ammo has been removed from lp stores shortly after the introduction for reasons beyond me the naglfar and phoenix can not use faction ammo i added in parens the dps numbers if morosrev use faction ammophoenix  3531 dpsnaglfar  3682 dpsmoros  4352 dps  4848 dps  revelation  4383 dps  4996 dps  
thanks im stuck at work without eft also but iirc with 4  2x gyro 2x bcu   faction damage mods and all other dreads having 2 faction damage mods the phoenix had 3900 dps the nag 4100 dps the moros 4800 dps and the rev 4900 dps  this might have been with faction ammo too   of course the phoenix had something close to 80k alpha  and the other dreads around 20k   this is with the nag having twice the number of damage mods as other ships it just doesnt make sense also iirc the effective hp of the dreads is nag about 113mil the pheonix 2mil the revelation and the moros 182milim not estimating anything anyway i wrote this after looking around at tower killmails  eft oh did i mention that extra fourth turret also means you use 133 ammo too  in comparison to the moros  phoenix   thats great when your cargohold is full up of stront  fuel  ammo
now nowthe phoenix uses 258 m3 of ammo per siege cycle the naglfar 422 m3 and the moros 57 m3 per siege cycle  my fit above empam ammo   and the naglfar has the largest cargo hold of them all its not the worst everywhere of course if you look at the ammo cost of a single siege cycle the naglfar shines again 24208826 isk the siege cycle of the phoenix costs 22899650 isk while the economical moros only needs 21550332 isk no this is not a serious balancing post  
just a note i didnt do the exact calculations  just rough ones   but it seems that when shooting a minmatar control tower with no shield hardener arrays this roughly balances out again  once you start fitting hardener arrays it approaches the above values again  the point for me here is that the naglfar is not in itself completely inferior to the other dreads in competent hands its slightly worse but not completely outclassed the main problem is that you need to train multiple weapon systems to achieve the same effect as with other dreads
well presented arguement as to why us minnie cap pilots could use a boost
signed
i have not embarked on cap skill training purely because my racial caps really suck and im a staunch minny pilot damnit i dont care if my tempest is primary every fight while costing more then other t2 snipers i chose minmatar because i love artys
i agree minmatar capitals need to be revised but not what your selling
minnie cap ships need a buff although i am not sure about your particular boosts mentioned unified tanking skills would certainly be a start
i like it here here
i think the current hangar  permissions system and things like poss need a major overhaul before something like this happens because otherwise they will be doing it twice the ability to give corp roles to non corp members and the decoupling of roles to membership would really help as well as more obvious things like allowing nonalliance members to use poss via standing instead of via password  easily exploited   a complete change of the permissions and hangar systems would let things like this happen as a side effect rather than having to code it in specially
i would like to see these as seperate issues rp gain wouldnt be that effective if it was just the odd player doing it but given that the very isk made from rp is the cause for some players to have entire altaccounts that can afford to be activated every 6 months etc by gtc to give them a boost of isk i think that it has become an issue albeit a minor onesp gain while inactive i think is a nonexistant issue given that you only get to finish the current skill and that skills of one player dont really detract from another players experience datacore gain reduces the value of datacores so reduces that which real players have gained i think in some respects the recent nerf bat that has hit gtcs while hurting real players also hits the passive datacore farmers since they now have to wait twice as long before its worth reactivating those accounts

just not true with equivalent skills once you can get into a covetor it beats even a rokh at mining granted the rokh fits a much stiffer tank but just ore m3 wise even the great rokh best of the mining bs loses  since the mlu nerf  domi is second and normally preferred for the drone bay domis can defend themselves rokhs just have to take the beating
you can not compare bs to mining barges because they are built for different mission roles yea you will have a better out put with a bs with ty mining skills then a procurer with ty mining skills once your skills improve each ships use improves also you need the procure so you will know how to operate its tech ii version and if you think the skiff sucks then once again you are not using it for its intended mission same stupid comparison is made that you will make more money doing missions then miningand yes you will once your at a high enough skill and mission level once again however both serve different roles
i do mining as more of a secondary profesion so although i have a good hulk skillset i also have top drone skills gal bs v and lots of miner upgrades fitted im able to tank and kill the bs rats for my covetor buddy with his t2 strippers but i was also putting more ore in the can inbetween spawns perhaps he was slacking or something but my point is that if a ship doesnt fit your needs you dont use that ship right you dont need to petition every variable of the game that doesnt work acceptably for your circumstances you train and save and research and discover the equipment and techniques that are allready there so you can do the best at what you want to do the procurer can probably mine ice more efficiently than a hulk btw assuming the belt is under attack from the dreaded jihadswarm the hulk will be the target and the proc will probably survive if it does die it will be such an insignificant loss compaired to the hulk  ice hulks fit expander rigs so they can mine for about 30 min without having to dump making them really expensive   that the proc pilot has still successfully mined ice more efficiently than the hulk pilot there ive given the procurer a strong buff king me
thats the issue  its not that the procurer doesnt fit his play style its that it doesnt fit anybodys play style its a dedicated mining ship that mines worse than a cruiser and not even a mining cruiser a thorax outmines it by 72 for example   the only conceivable reason to buy a procurer is to increase your chances of getting a skiff bpc no youve come up with a flimsy excuse about how since the ship is too pathetic for even goons to want to kill it its better real feat of deductive reasoning there i really hope youre sarcastictrolling
its useless because its supposed to be uselessits a t1 mining cruiser that takes very little to train fortherefore you get very little in return if youre whining because you want to use one take the extra 3 hours and get a retriever
theres a second good use for the ship i may use a bit of sarcasm at times to help bring my point across but im really quite serious when it comes to game changes my main gripe and reason for replying is that the op doesnt recognize the usefullness of this ship instead of finding a use for this ship or selecting another one more suitable for his intended use he is demanding that the ship be changed to be inline with his assumed needs as a matter of fact the ice mining quip is based on a true story a guy in my corp has an alt that mines ice in a procurer he did it because goons were killing mackanaws hulks and covetors on sight he can use a hulk and iceminers at lvl v but he chose the proc he would anounce when other ships in the belt were getting ganked but he didnt get ganked having a procurer mining ice means both that youre not afk for a long time so you see when bad things are happening and youre the least desireable target so you have plenty of time to flee before its your turn to die in comparison to that i got another acount and trained it from scratch to mine ice i got that charactor a cargorigged hulk and subsequently was suicide ganked in an ice belt after months of training a few hundred million in inplants skills ship rigs modules and 2 weeks of mining ice for the entire duration i was awake i lost my ship and retrained my alt to do other stuff he ended up mining more ice than me and never lost his ship thats nobodies fault but my own but it proves my point i should have found the right ship for the job the wisdom ive gained from that experience id like to shair with you and the opsorry for sounding like a sarcastic troll earlier i often come across that way but i generally dont commit to typing something unless i feel ive got something important to say even if i cant word it right all in one post p
would like to point out that i have no particular need for a procurer having been able to fly a hulk for longer than ive been able to fly a battleship im simply pointing out that there is no use for it  its totally completely thoroughly useless for everything except skiff inventioni challenge anyone to find a legitimate everyday use for this ship im not interested in wild situationals just in things you might actually consider buying this ship for
my bad  i heard jihadswarm was killing all ore ships not just the 3 most common in that case his decision does make some sense though itd still make more sense to use a retriever instead that said what theyve done with exhumers is a good idea of what i think barges should look like each of them has a clearly defined role and is fairly good at it now im not suggesting that ice and mercoxit are what the procurer and retreiver should be doing but what if the smaller barges had bigger tanks and holds give people some actual choice  coveter is still best for iskhour but the others are easier to use theres probably a better idea to be had but thats a start imo
its like trying to find a really good use for the 50k and less frigates they are very very cheap and if someone is going straight to barges and cant afford a retriever yet it gives them something to mine with in the mean time
i personally would like to see the change somewhat like faster rof but a smaller ammo capacity so you get more burst damagealpha but the same overall dps i think it did miss the change when everything else got a hp boost making the alpha it had alot less useful
i would say they should lose about 25 of thier rate of fire  aka fire slower  and increase their damage by 35
i will support this  despite not being able to use large art yet  
the problem is that the minmatar do not have a solid sniping battleship that can compete with the megathron rokh and apoc the problem is large artillery or the battleships theyre fitted on also i would like to point out that the minmatar speed advantage is very small at the battleship level 10 and the agility is precisely the same as equivalent gallente ships  
supporting this because i trained minnie bs v

op says all
page2snypareally work on this stuff
i support this topic artillery is a weapon system designed for a long since bygone era preferably i would like to artillery regain its stature as an alpha strike weapons systemperhaps through a combination of weapon rebalance and a rethink of certain ship specialization bonuses doing so will preserve some diversity in weapon platforms failing that end matari pilots demand whatever changes are necessary to transform artillery into a viable and competitive long range weapons system
minmatar needs a comprehensive exmaination as they have ruined the battleshipsthe only reason to fly a minmatar battleship was alpha strike they are fragile and their speed advantage over a sniperthron is negligible rigs and doomsday proof cruiser fits have meant that alphastrike is no longer the arbiter of fights but dpsthe end result of all this was the half baked abortion the maelstrom an active tanking fleet battleship with half a guns improvement in damage and is a whale to get out of a fight what a stroke of game designing genius that wasmy point minmatar 1400s need to be restored to their place of prominence quickly or the entire line of minnie bs needs a drastic overhaul the problem is that there is no chance of the this happening as the clueless game designers have no interest in doing this they want close range fights where lag is maximised minnie ships are useless and have only one possible way of surviving nanoshipsby all means ask but please do not expect anything from ccp they know best
oops double post
i believe the guns are fine its just the ships that need to be looked at the tempest is so damn annoying atm with the tc nerf i have galamamin bs4 with all gunnery support skills to level 5 when a t1 gun geddon does better in fleet fights then my t2 tempest then theres something wrong the tempest already needed all of its mid slots just to perform on par with other t2 snipers 2xsbii1xmwd2xtcii   along with 4 of its 6 low slots rcuii3xgsii   with the other 2 usually ending up being dcii1600 plate then we got the tcsb nerf now the already horrible tracking gets worse while its still the only sniper with the lowest targetting rangethe guns were never changed the ships were the ships were balanced around the guns change the ships or change the guns
something need to be done to either the ships or the guns alpha is now worthless making artillery the worst long range weapon system

something definitely needs to be done currently damps have a very minor niche compared to any other ew  even target painters
yeah i luve my arazu shame it sucks now and collects dust
damps first of all need a role and then be made good at that rolefirst of all disable a hostile ship is not the role for damps they did that hence they were nerfed that role is for ecmthe two possible roles for damps that i see are1   force blaster range a typical support module for gallente force the enemy to fight in blaster range where gallente blaster boats are awesome iirc you just need to increase the damp strength bonus slightly to achieve this2   antisniper make damps work at sniper range  up to 250300km   but not in optimal but falloff this means they do not work all the time and its useful to combine them with the lock time reduction script the ops suggestions for range rigs etc would fit here
sounds good to me
damps certainly do need a boost and to be honest i like most of goumindongs ideas even if he is an ass
increasing damp bonuses does not work unless you change the way that bonuses are applied back to its prescripting method and if you change it back to its prescripting method you likely dont need to change the strength of the bonuses
they need a boost they got nerfed because everyone fitted them so instead make the celestisarazulachesis have a much bigger bonus to them than now making them good on those ships and rubbish on everything else
theres a reason i generally tell people the keres is a waste of money and this is it

the best way to prevent macros is to kill their mrket this means punish really hard these who buy isk for life bans freeze all their assets etcas for farming by real players etc nothing can be done is part of the game if you dont want people to farm missions just do not seed them after dt easy fix if people want to play missions 247 is their business as long as they are not macros  crap

nerf it
even a scurvy pirate such as myself can see the sense in this suggestionno insurance payouts for people with concord on there kill mail full stopthis is not intended as a punishment it is intended as a way to raise the value of cargo that can be carried before a suicide gank becomes profitable because at the moment it is way to lowatm suicide ganking is low risk  high reward and needs a fix and majority of community have been calling for this fix for ages with no response from ccpso yes council bring this topic before them
not supportinga suiciding macro barges would make it 0 payout at all since macros use junk t1 fittingsb folks that fire on mission buddies via accident  happens alot   lose their ship and get nothingc most suiciders looking for sheer profits only bother with farmers that buy isk then snag up faction items for their shipif this change is passed its yet another confirmation that ccp fully supports the 150000 farmer and macro accounts safety and again isnt concerned with the intense lag server problems and rmt problems eve has
ill repost the ideas i put into a similar thread in cp earlier insurance isnt so much the issue as much as there is no punishment to fit the crime the 4 main empires the most powerful known governing bodies in new eden  excluding the jove of course   would be less lenient about this i would imagine so if people want to be outlaws and pirates why not let the empires treat them as onethe following would apply to any acts of piracy in high sec empire space1 impounding of ships and goods stored in empire stations until a hefty fine is paid2 seizure of bank personal bank funds3 no admittance to empire stations4 no admittance to empire jump gates5 removal and destruction of clones in empire clone bays6 offending characters actions effect their corp standings and open the possibility of siezure of corp assets in empire space these seem a bit extreme but it would open up business opportunities for corps that own poss and outposts as well as pc run banking outfits there are ways around it still but it would make it a lot less appealing signed either way
this suggestion is a veiled attempt to removing it all together and that wont happen as you know it does not balance the risk award factor the balance factor is slowly coming about but this kind of over aggressive stance does not contribute to anything really no there has to be something else we have to be able to give the haulers miners more options to fit there ships better to give them a chance give them better tools to help them to fend for them selves and make it harder for the suicide gankers to succeed as far as rattersmission runners that is another issue they have to think beyond the the mission and fit them selves for a possible attack against gankers yet still allowing them to finish there mission maybe make them harder to find due to some kind of interference to spacial anomaly making the aggressor to work harder or have better skills and equipment to to be able to get a better chance of finding the targetwe have to find a balance between the two one extreme or another does not solve anything
the problem is not mission runners found in a mission  you can actually protect against that somewhat by eying local and scanning for probes   but mission runners jumping through a gate now if ccp changed every mission to spawn in the agents system this would be a perfectly fine fix too but i have the underlying feeling that ccp enjoys subjecting mission runners to stupid idle time sinks like jumping to other systems or traveling 70km to the next gate in a mission where it takes a velator 20 secs to kill all enemies so i dont see that happening
thumbs down goes here
its not a veiled attempt at anything it is a solution in line with standard and fairly universal methods of curbing crime it removes nothing but instead adds to the challenge eve thus far is a game that caters more to piracy than to those that wish to peacefully co exist with other players and build and mine and sellthe people that make up the core of new edens economy capsuleers are valuable assets to the empires as well as costly investments why wouldnt they protect those assets from pirates in their own sovereign space i have no probelm with piracy in the game but with crime should come consequence
i also disagree with this idea as somone who has played in the market a lot ive learned that pricing competition is part of the game if you dont like the competition you are getting then either massivly under cut your competition or find a market that is not so competitive
if youre not whining about combat pvp youre whining about trade pvpeve is about pvpopposed

this is partly true ccp not always can be bothered to fix bugs in fact a lot of the minor or even insignificant bugs arent fixed since betapart of the problems that occur is that ccp releases a new patch way too soon and it causes tons of problems and taking up several months to fix the biggest holes you can blame marketing you can blame qa but i think you have to blame the top brass for this since they give the okone thing csm can do is ask ccp to have the volunteer bughunters team replace by ccp paid professional bughunters these people are more efficient precise and are educated for this line of work they also can give faster feedback to devs  read kick their behinds   if neededthis can shorten the time it takes to identify bugs pre and post release of a new patch they also can ask ccp if they can fix all the smaller stuff thats been broken for years now  eg typos in descriptions pos industry related stuff etc etc  
would you care to explain why you believe it is totally out of order  with gameplay   please pezzle
easy enoughimplementing destructible outposts with the current state of cap ships online would lead to outpost griefing other groups have said as much already  cap ships being a different issue that also impacts gang and fleet combats  an alteration of sov mechanics might well make for more engaging fleet combats the effects of those changes might also see space change hands more readily ending what some see as absurd deadlocks  sov issue impacting gang and fleet combat logistics general deployment super alliance and so on   finally i believe outpost disabling should actually add new options to the game rather than remove them outpost onoff does no justice to the complex possibilities of eve
well people say a lot pezzle but surely its not sensible to balance eve territorial gameplay on the boasts of particular alliances and individuals specifically to the example proposal i make in the op  it doesnt become any easier to take these outposts than it is in the existing system and you are simply allowing an aggressor to inflict damage on the enemy rather than using the conquests for ongoing income  as happens now   thats really another topic and doesnt have a bearing on the discussion of the feasibility of outpost destruction i think remember pezzle this isnt a vote on making outposts destructible in one foul swoorp  this is a question about whether it is fair to ask ccp if they see feasibility for the introduction of destructible outposts in the 00 game in the futurei have to disagree with you there the selfdestruct mechanic and dramatic bids for controlrescue and the tragedy of exploded outposts and ongoing derelicts for people to salvage their stuff from thats many new options for the game right there
as things stand larger alliances can invade a smaller rivals territory but once the reach a certain point they struggle to hold on ot it if you allow outposts to be destroyed youll see the larger alliances stamp on their smaller rivals and destroy their outposts before withdrawingthis will mean that the large established alliances become even more entrenched than they are now and that small up and coming alliances wont be given the chance to growthats why destructible outposts are a bad idea
well rodj at the moment a handful of megaalliances hold the majority of 00 space that suggests they arent exactly struggling to hold space and well see smaller rivals striking back on multiple fronts and burning the territory of the larger powers while they are involved elsewhere its sauce for the goose i dont believe its actually possible for the large established alliances to become any more entrenched than they are at this moment rodj the game has reached a nadir of dynamism in 00 right now i believe the time has come for the trainingwheels to come off 00 and the spaceholders should be expected to seriously protect their holdings once again well ultimately lets ask ccp what they think
i very much would like to see the ability to destroy outposts but there are big problems with this if you use the same or similar mechanics to pos warfare it favors larger alliancesconvince me that its possible to develop a mechanic that allows the destruction of outposts that doesnt favor larger alliances over smaller ones and youll have my support
jade says stuff i am not quoting because pyramids bother me here is my responsegame balance must consider both ends of the spectrum jade not a single viewpoint it is irrelevant for purpose of discussion that groups have not gone on a tirade of outpost destruction it being possible means that the impact must be considered the same considerations should have taken place with the introduction of cap ships or any new game mechanics if we push something to the extreme what happens to the game is that something acceptable or even wantedmoving your loot out of a derelict outposts can be made to sound exciting if you dress it up with the right nouns and adjectives but reality is players will use alts or friends in the area to do it sell the items or simply write it off for the time  which is what happens now when an outpost is lost   hence no real change there needs to be more unexpected and bizarre results would attract more attention and generate more interest even from those outside the immediate conflict because i do not believe your proposal includes anything more dynamic i choose against itfinally you brought up the topic and asked if it was fair to consider now i have said no and in my response touched on just a few of the reasons as an example so others can understand my objection there is only so much time and some issues are more important than others i believe that other topics are more important at this moment what i have stated absolutely has a bearing on this subject please do not try and dismiss my saying no as somehow off topic other issues do influence outposts and any change in their nature if pointing that out now brings realization to some that we are getting ahead of ourselves so much the better
we need more stations in 00 not less there are large expanses of unused space out there controlled by large alliances while at the same time being considered worthlessadd a few outposts and the scale will tip slightly they might still be willing to expend the effort of defending and maintaining that rather worthless piece of 00 yet at some point with too many stations to hold the scale will tip far enough for them to ignore a smaller alliance moving inpeople live in deserts we just need an oasis
jadethank you for the response the reason i asked was that it appears you posted a change  make stations partially destructible   then cited the reasons for the change i feel this is putting the cart before the horse i feel the csm should focus on determining what the big issues are  eg lag sov getting more people into low sec etc   not  necessarily   proposing particular solutionsthus i feel there are two issues in this thread 1 the risk  reward ratio is out of balance in 00  too little risk   2 everything player built in 00 should be destructible if one none or both of these are voted as issues then the csm could post a thread requesting solutions from what i see in the above comments and votes people  for the most part   are arguing about the fix not whether they feel the rewards are too big for the risks in 00 and whether in 00 everything should be destructible  or partially destructible   i guess im asking the csm reps to id the issues then ask for solutions  at which point they can propose a solution of course   otherswise i fear the csm will spend a lot of time discussing solutions not whether something is a critical issue to game play
no a handful of megaalliances have to sell off space in order to keep it friendly because they are too overextended to hold it allif you make this change they will be able to destroy the space rather than hold it reducing further population density and the ability of hostile organizations to move on their resourceseg currently we are taking geminate from smashrkatlas now we are faced with a problem wtf are we going to do with all this space we dont want if we could blow up the stations we would then no one gets to use the valuable space without putting up another station that we can blow upno you wont because those fronts wont be there they will be destroyed by the mega alliances as buffer zones to prevent serious staging of war jade it is not possible for there to be a limit on the ability of large established alliances to become more entrenched until one alliance holds all space furthermore any suggestion that pushes further entrenchment cannot reduce that entrenchment its like giving tax cuts to the wealthy and then wondering why the gap between rich and poor increasesthere are no training wheels in 00 you get shot and you lose your space and all the work that went into taking and holding it the only training wheels exist for corps that sit in high sec and complain about how static 00 is without doing anything about itno that is not what the csm is for the csm is here to discuss ideas and determine whether or not they are valuable to be brought to ccp to refine the good ideas so that ccp sees a the benefits concerns and expectations for new features and to weed out the ideas that despite sounding good when someone blows sunshine up your ass would be bad for the gamethis is an idea that would be had for the game and unless you want to see goonswarm being more powerful and you being even more impotent about it you will not bring this issue to vote or vote against it
i quote the above simply to make a point this is pure griefing if an alliance has no intension of holding the space they are taking over then why bother attacking it in the first placealliances usually only take space for a handful of reasons two of which are1   they want the space to begin with2   the enemy is too close to their space they want to keep so they take an outpost hoping to force the enemy backif you have a truly nomadic alliance and out just out to destroy outposts or remove alliances from 00 space then you would not care of be interested in holding the space anyway the fact you remove an alliance from space but left the assets behind only gives you a reason to come back 6 months later to do it again if you have enjoyment in that type of power play then you wouldnt opt to destroy the outposts because it removes that opportunity to do it againoutpost destruction is a nice tactic but really needs to be justified other then ha ha we destroyed your stuffi would support the following iteration of the ideaif an alliance owned all the outposts in a region they can not destroy their own outpost and no alliance can destroy any outpost in that region just because they have the firepower to do sohowever if another alliance came along and took an outpost in that region both the original alliance and the agressive alliance have the ability to destroy each others outposts however eventually it would come down to one outpost left in which would be invulnerable to attack because its the only outpost in the region therefor there is no contestationthe idea here is to leave the legacy and make agressive alliances accountable for their destruction if they totally remove all other outposts from the region and are left with one then say we dont want this and leave it makes that part of space at least somewhat attractive to someonea totally outpostless region of 00 space is not as desirable as one that has at least one outpost even to new alliance looking for a place to livespeaking for someone who has actually lived in geminate i can say if there was a way to destroy all outposts geminate would be abandoned for a very long time the region itself is incredibly poor in terms of moons etc the only value it has is the fact you can get to and from jita in under 15 jumps
and i am not seeing why anyone would not destroy the stations forcing anyone who wanted the space to spend billions and billions of isk again making it livable so that when the destroyers came back they get to blow up the outposts again creating an even larger financial burden on the enemynot sure what to say about the rest of it
you guys are thinking of alliances as single entities like giant ogres and are arguing that its unfair or stagnant that single entities should hold so much space or what not but the truth is that an alliance is a swarm of players and its numbers that hold the space not a single entitya lot of the scenarios predicted here about what would happen between big alliances and small alliances dont make much sense when youre talking about swarms of players seriously as an exercise replace the word alliance with 1500 players  or an accurate number   throughout this discussion and see if your arguments still make sensecause for example it seems to me that 800 players  the alliance   are perfectly capable of crushing multiple attacks by 50man gangs  small rivals   while 700 players  the other half of the alliance   are involved elsewhere
the issue is see with this is assets as many 00 corporationsalliances and individuals keep hundreds of billions of assets inside stations if a station is taken over the assets are still there so there is some hope of getting them back by having the outpost as destroyable you remove this hope that maybe someday the assets will be recoveredthere are 2 ways around this interbus  has exclusive access to remove all character and corporation owned assets and puts them in the corporation hq station the other option would be have the station out there as a dockable station wreak or something you can interact with to recover your own assetsthat is really the only issues i can forsee station owners should beable to selfdestruct them  with a timer of about 2 days  at downtime they blow  and should require at least sov1
this is the resolution i prefer basically having a derelict wreck that people can move close too and access their stuff from
if the stuff isnt destroyed and accessible then why blow up the station
stations cost money upgrading stations costs money the point is inflicting loss on the owning alliance and ensuring that afk defense is no longer possible on the alliance territorial scale destroying a fully upgraded outpost can cost the owning alliance a lot of isk and you can bet that the alliances investing in full upgrades will be the richest alliances not the poorest something you need to realize goumindong is i want to make eve harder for alliances not individuals i want to increase the risk of alliance loss in 00 space but i dont want to see jonny alliance ratter 101 bankrupted out of the game to no good fault of his ownincreasing the territorial forfeit penalty for overextended alliances is a targeted measure designed to restore risk and reward balance on the alliance level
afk defense is already not possible why would it change if you gave alliances the ability to destroy stations it would be even easier to defend space since players wouldnt be able to assault jump off pointsif you dont believe me why dont you take some space and then afk defend it i guarantee you you will not hold your space longthere is no need to patronize me i am perfectly aware of what you want to dobut what you are doing is increasing the risk of small alliance loss and not increasing the loss of large alliances these over extended alliances dont exist they sell the space or they lose ithere is a good example gs overextends into delve now were we able to destroy stations we would have popped 49 and qy6 this would have cost bob a lot but bob was not over extended into those areas we were cost to the overextended zero  we would have saved money   cost to the defenders everythingend result large alliances consolidate and everyone else gets eded not to mention that alliance risk is personal risk stations dont get built out of magic isk that comes from magic land it comes from people putting up the cash to get it done it comes from people flying ships into stations to build and maintain pos chains it comes from the people in the alliance
i take it back this would be a whole new world in alliance level grievingoh you dropped a few stations in random worthless system haha not anymore suckas
i support this so long as we are allowed to blow up ds1s stations and force them into a nomadic madmax lifestyle
everything should be explodable
i support this idea because it would make it possible for goonswarm to destroy stations currently held by smaller alliances twisted
goumindong is right it allows you to have a significant impact on another persons infrastructure without deploying similar infrastructure yourself you could just roll in blow up the outpost and roll out with no actual risk taken yourselfan outpost is a double edged sword yes it gives you a secure base in deep space but its also a vulnerable point you can lose it just as easily as youve gained it the same goes for the agressors  they might take it but now theyve got a 20b isk asset to defend the ability to take that asset without risking it yourself would give waaay too much of an advantage to nomadic powerseve does not need fewer static combat points it needs more since the removal of complexes all there has been for this is high end moons and outpost systems there need to be more strategic objectives to take and hold  fw for example is something that could be implemented on a grander scale in 00
actually if you just stiffened the rules regarding how often you can put up strategic pos modules and then made those modules easier to attack as well as making economic pos modules easier to attack then you can fulfill those strategic objectives without a major change to pos warfare while giving smaller gangs reasons to go do thingsyou wont even need to implement fw type systemwhich is pretty flawed imo in order to get that benefit
i think the simple principle here is that nothing belonging to a player or group of players should be indestructible besides big explosions are always good tt
thats just it forcing anyone who wanted to the space to spend billions if you truly enjoy destroying alliances worthy of fighting then you should leave the outposts where they are and just abandon themunless youre objective is to just pwn every single alliance with a pos in 00 and not give anyone the opportunity to establish themselves even a little from a griefers perspective you want to give them an opportunity to come outas an alliance if i know a mega alliance is roaming 00 bbqing outposts and destroying assets just because they can without rhyme or reason then why would i want to even begin to dump billions of isk into a systemyou would be totally destroying small or medium alliance opportunities to go out to 00 ergo removing your fun because youd have nothing but alliances of equal or greater power then your ownhow fun would that be roaming 00 looking for poses and outposts to destroy and only coming across empty space because the threat of losing an outpost if simply too much to swallow for anyone newnow as an industrialist i want the outposts destroyed there needs to be some big major isk sinks in this game and this would be a great one however i can also see the difference between a bandaid over the issue and a long term solutionyes destroyable outposts would be great no the ability to totally wipe every outpost out of every region is not that is why i like my idea of only destructible if the region is contested by multiple alliancesno alliance should be able to be allowed to roll up at 5 hours before downtime without warning and totally bbq an outpost with 500 capital ships there needs to be a set formula for destructionalliance a owns all the outposts in a regionalliance b wants to destroy alliance aalliance b has two options 1   deploy their own outpost 2   take over one of the existing outpostsalliance b can now destroy all of alliance as outpostsit would be crazy stupid for ccp to allow a massive blob the ability to just roll around from system to system destroying outposts without that alliance committing to the fight by bringing their own outpost or taking the time to take an outpost firstboth alliances must have the same set of objectives1   defend your poses2   defend your outposts3   defend your fleets4   attack your enemy fleets5   attack your enemy poses6   attack your enemy outpostsunder the scenario suggested and more importantly suggested by a particular alliancealliance as objectives are1   defend their poses2   defend their outposts3   defend their fleets4   attack the enemy fleetsalliance bs objectives are1   attack the enemy poses2   attack the enemy outposts3   attack the enemy fleets4   defend their fleetsthis is not acceptable since alliance as defend objectives are static and their attack objectives are movable whereas alliance bs are the exact opposite alliance b would have a massive advantagethey are two different objectives each obtainable in very different ways for something as major as total alliance destruction the objectives of both alliance a and alliance b must be the same
havent really thought about whether it should be changed really i just know that i dont like having to remember a set of variables for each ammo type i load and i dont use it i go for the faction stuff because i can just buy it from the station without having to find some jerk that builds it or get it transported to me like it is with the t2 it hits as good and i dont have to think about added penalties its standard ammo with more juiceso is t2 ammo broken i dont know does it need to be a big improvement over t1 it probably is an improvement over normal t1 ammo already as it can do new tricks is t2 ammo suposed to be the best and make me a lot of money to build and sell it probably not go build t1 ammo and trade it for faction from your agent and sell that more people prefer the faction stuff and that doesnt mean that t2 is broken
i agree conflag that green stuff you mean xray right you say its short range and high damage so you mean amarr navy multifrequency wait you mean to tell me there is tech 2 short range ammo the slight damage increase with penalties to tracking and cap use just make conflag not worth using that and in most cases i would rather have more em damage then thermal damage them caldari folk like to tank for guristas and manufacturing t2 ammo just sucks ass 2 weeks to build 40 scorch l thats 10 runs with a pe 4 bpc really thats not cool
def needs a fix and these are a few good ideas
with a few exceptions t2 ammo is either a onetrick pony  range ammo   or sucks outright  most closerange ammo   scorch and javelin hams are the only two that i see regularly used over faction ammoplease make them better
especially short range long range acpulse ammo is basically fine
t2 ammo definitely needs some luvin
i wonder if ccp could make a chart of the  of each ammo type used with each gun that would certainly point out what needs boosting as it is alot of t2 ammo that was supposed to be situational is to be used in no situation even if the bonuses need to be lowered in exchange for no penalties its fairly obvious that much of the ammo is completely useless as is
for once a good topic in this forumit would be ok if t2 ammo actually was situational like advertised but so much of it is simply crap compared to faction ammo in all situations the penalties of using it is usually too heavy
agree with the idea of overhauling t2ammo but not the specifics in this thread
just undo the nerfs introduced in revelations tbh dont see the point of void if its not going to hit anything or javelin if you cant move
things like spike aurora and tremor  for long range   and null scorch and barrage are nice and have their own nicheclose range stuff has way too many penalties that make their effective dps lower than faction ingame
the penalties are a bit ridiculous and stack up way too fast i agree that an overhaul of tii ammo would be great
agreed while i was curious to see how the csms would respond this was something of a lark not to be taken too seriously
i fully endorse this
exploration sucks and this is one of the reasons why amongst othersmultiple items in each can pleasebring down the insane cost of donuts if nothing else

agreed this sucks when it happens
thats a novel idea and all but since my pos is set to autoattack everybody it would surely take a long and important step out of the process of reclaiming purchased goods from shoppers if youre thick that means that someone buys or wishes to sell something to the pos and gets nuked without me having to be there also if the pos is destroyed or removed what happens to all the stuff that the owner of the pos cant access to move out of there i imagine that extortion would run rampant with evemails going to all the users of the pos  give me xxxm isk or ill offline the thingy and you wont ever see your stuff again i think theres a lot of problems with a hanger or public access things that can be arbitrarilly confiscated by other players i have stuff in conquered stations that i cant dock in anymore but they will remain there until i do one of any number of things to effect them i can count on the fact that they will never dissapear or be forced to change status by the actions of other playersedit now i may have just missunderstood your proposed mechanics or something but im just going on what i could envision from your post it seemed rather abstract
ill do it for you james just for you
why is it that you cant use implants again
the pg4 uses slot 6 is where my snake or nomad omega goes
this would encourage people to put things in containers  currently a practice avoided for just this reason   and as such it would reduce some of the stress on the server generated when opening hangars that are currently much more full than they should be so that items can be seen remotely

salvaging is what destroyers r good at with the numerous highslots but i agree that there should be a dedicated salvager with bonus towards salvaging tractor beams and cargo capacity and possibly even a speed boost to get to those far away wrecks faster
the new features on the killmail system are all great and i enjoy the idea behind them but someone should take a look at the system and find out where all these unknown weapons come fromsome of the issues ive found with killmailsweapons are not identified sometimes and placed as unknown or the ship the player was inships are not identified and sometimes confused for other ships  players are sometimes considered sentries or rats  sometimes inert objects such as warp bubbles find their way onto killmails by having done damageive seen other things happen but not any repetition and ill leave them to copypaste errors atm but im sure that a lot of people can understand why it might be necessary to correct these issuesalso just as an aside thankyou for showing rigs on killmails think we could get implants on podmails d

to not stifle any interesting thought on this subject i am going to try to keep this post short and simple please elaborate with your ideasrecently the eve economist implemented a plan to remove the price caps from trit by making shuttles no longer an item produced by npcs the intention was to remove artificial price caps on tritanium while i believe  as a marketeer   that the sentiment of this is a great idea i think the implementation left a lot to be desired also implementation is problematic as as one price cap is eliminated 20 others are discoveredoverall the market in eve needs something to make it prolific for both new industrialists as well as old i have an idea i think that would considerably improve the overall market and increase the feasibility of new and old characters to participate in industry and tradingthe root of the problem lies in the calculations used to produce npc prices of low end items if i recall correctly from the dev blog on this topic all prices of items in eve are based on static base prices that are derived from some magic number value of minerals this leads to market prices of low end items being static and unchanging no matter what supply and demand it and no matter to the supply of mineralsa shuttle takes 2500 tritanium to produce this means that at the old market price of 9000 isk the shuttle is valued at 36 isk per unit of tritanium this is clearly not how a real market would work a corporation would base the end price of the shuttle on the cost of materials and add a margin of profit they would want on top of this pricethis leads to my idea that is to nix this static pricing and come up with a system that generates regional prices of npc sold items based on the price of regional minerals so rather than base the price of the shuttle on a static value of tritanium base it on the average market price of tritanium then add a marginan example lets say tritanium is selling for 3 isk a unit in the forge the corporation wants a 20 margin on what it sells this would mean the material cost of the shuttle would be 7500 isk then you add on the margin of 20 which would be 1500 isk the total price would then be 9000 isk if trit dropped to 2 isk a unit the shuttle price would be 6000 if the price of trit shot up to 9 isk a shuttle would cost 27000 isknew prices could be applied at downtime mineral prices could be an average of sell price in the region for the daythe effect of this would be very interesting interregion trading could become a very profitable enterprise for fledgling traders enterprising industrialists could produce items in a region where trit was very cheap and ship them to a region where it was expensive and have a good profit this would revitalize the tech 1 market and give newer players a shot at having a profitable career without having to train for 6 months to get into t2 gear where competition is already hampered by existing bpos from the bpo lotteryive tried to keep this simple so other can add ideas or suggestions ive also tried to base the idea on math that already exists inside eve  regional averages   so while i am programmer i wont claim to know how easy things are to change in eve but my suggestion seems within the realm of possibilityyour thoughts
i dont know what price caps exist as of right now that are actually affecting prices theres no ship thats had its mineral value pushed down so far that the insurance price floor is affecting it and while i admit that i dont generally have to think in terms of largescale logistics i cant think of any others that are relevant right now ill just stick by what seems to be the current plan of dealing with price limits  change them as they become relevant
you realise that even with rof bonus a 800mm t2 ac is lower than a unbonused neutron blaster with both behind a unbonused seige launcher in fact a megathron with 1 mfs or a 2 hs abaddon will have around the same dps per turret as a 3 gyro maelstrom the only reason acs are fine on a maelstrom is because the maelstrom shield tanks so can fit the damage mods if you look at tempest with no damage mods its dps per turret is 76 and seige launchers are 72 thats a rof  dmg bonused weapon only just beating a unbonused weapon large acs on a typhoon is frankly comical with around 50 dps per turret when its bonused seige are doing 95hell rather than just raising the base damage even if it was only by 1 point at large size id prefer them moving pp and fusion to the max damage level and lower emp plus fixing hail  and all other t2 close range ammos  the main issue with acs is the lack of reason to upgrade per tier tracking between dual 425s vs electrons is 8 advantage and 800s vs neutrons is practically identicle you get no extra range besides a few hundred km optimal unlike other races where larger tier means significantly more optimal and falloffthe difference in our comparisons is the huge difference in damage source it would be quite clear that the weapon system that already gives the best damage per turret wouldnt need it increasing further for example 3 gyro 800mm on tempest is 125 dpsturret with 3 mfs neutrons 133 dpsturret  hyper or mega   so is not only behind on dpsturret its behind on turrets and slots available for damage mods unless you use a 4 slot shield tankbut whatever theres still a lot of tweaking needed of the ammos and tier system of acs without even changing the end damage amounts of the ships
i support a boost to minmatar autocannonsthe damage with 3 damage mods is frankly too poor
and this matters because 800mm t2 ac on a mael will do more damage with hail than it will with neutron blasters with emp the ship will have up to 30km falloffso now you are complaining that your low tier weapons are too good that it hurts others more when downsizing so we should nerf 650 acs and 425s1 damage mod on a mega with electrons does 608 damage with no drones to 37km cn am   0 damage mods on a tempest with 425s siege and hail does 594 damage with no drones to 2410km plus launcher damage that is as much damage with more rangeahh yes lets conveniently ignore the 6 lows on the hyperion and the 2 free high slots fir missile launcherswhich do not fit in any fit on the megaso the idea is to make the ammos do more damage but not affect the final dps of the shipswhy nerf 2 things and buff something else when you could just buff one thing
first off all the people ing about my setups post yours please id like to see themfittitng mods are fitting mods  sometimes you need them a 2slot shield tank isnt a serious option thus you want an armour repper and that takes grid but after your complaints i see i did fit it wrong  drop the 650s to 425s drop the pds for a bcs ii  goes from 917 dps to 980 and you dont lose much of anything on cap or shield hp can even raise that to 1063 if you drop a tank mod to add another  losing an eanm costs you 8k hp and 46 dps tanked but gains you 83 dps dealt depends how much of a glass cannon you wantif youre going to compare it to the mael then yeah its worse at everythign but speed the mael is probably the best pvp battleship in the game at least for closein work in small gang im trying to see what the tempest can do and this is the best answer ive found to that that said youd have to be nuts to fit an istab on a mael  youd have to strip a gyrostab for thatwhy is it pointless youve got the slots for an adequate one though certainly not great   and you want the lows clear for your damage modsyeah pulses switch range really well your point the minmatar either get in close where range doesnt matter or they orbit at a speed where slowtracking lasers cant hit them its kinda what they do  you know the speed race also its almost a 400 ms difference not 200missiles switch damage better than projectiles but projectiles switch better than hybrids or lasers ill take what i can get and youre right about 800s and neutrons tracking similarly but its still a big advantage they have over pulsesim also looking to be costefficient in my pvp fits and void is about 20 of the price of cn am where i am now and compared to am void gets an optimal bonusof course its not fitting tackle  i said right at the beginning of this that i was fitting for small gang  ie i assume a tackler battleships have better things to fit than webs and scramsre pest basic is what fits if you want to hardwire for cpu feel free adds 49 dps or go for a rf gyrostab and add 68 dps i was trying to standardize though so i used a basic sue mere mael test your arguments even dropping it to 425s its still 18 cpu over
this thread is almost as bad as large autocannons
supported however if ships are changed  namely the maelstrom and the tempest   than it might not need to be a large change also change might be done with ammooh and please dont post terrible fits in this thread
supported though id rather see the tempest brought in line with other fleet snipers
are you being dense on purpose i never suggested using blasters on a maelstrom  that was someone else   my point is if even a rof bonus on acs is behind unbonused weapon how far behind do you think it is vs a bonused weapon wtf did i say they were to good clearly the point of this topic is flying over your head you realise how idiotic you look right now suggesting nerfing acs if people are gonna say but acs have x advantage they might want to actually look and not just go by rumour because theyll find the advantages arnt what they thinkand whats the range of the torps so what is the range that as much damage with more range its a limited area nevermind the lost damage from torps sig that complicates things when comparing turretswtf did i compare end damage i didnt bring drones into it either so why are you ignoring them if you bring missiles into it yes because the hyperion doesnt have a better tank so cant afford to use one of its lows on a damage mod and yes clearly when talking about damage per turret ignoring a unbonused weapon that isnt affected by the damage mods is bad you do realise the launchers do less dps per tempestmegahyper turret so actually bring the average of the fitted weapons downmy current idea is to not affect the raw damage amount but to reorder the damage types  or change the damage types of emp   as the best ammo does not have the advantage it used to at the start of eve and was given the lower raw damage amount because ofno idea what 2 things am i meant to of suggested to nerf

my setups arnt a secret go look on shcsometimes you do only on my dual rep typhoon do i use a single acr rig your tank is pathetic and your talking about fitting more damage mods seriously do you just gank people that cant shoot back glass cannon more like a glass wet fish you use a single rep setup a medium cap booster is enough to feed it that saves both the rcu and pds slot for more resistances to give a big increase in tankdoesnt suprise me that you cant do anything appart from the obvious to fit your ship admittedly i have a 3 cpu implant  all of 20m   and named dc to fit an istab that gives me better agility than your tempest if being clever you could remove one of your mid tank modules for a lower cpu mod  passive em for example   named dc to save more cpu then fit the istab with no hardwiringbecause the maelstrom in a similar fit will outperform it every timepoint is your doing much better dps sooner than the ships that have to mwd  even with better speed   to the target orbiting battleships ive heard it all clearly you do not pvp on tq or at least with minmatar battleshipsits a minor difference since its so hard to get that advantage ingame due to the rangetransversal you have to hit while usually webbedwell thats your problem if you want to be less effectivesmall gang and your not tackling tackler dies then your uselesssounds like the typical sisi pilot with there max tanks and no tackle because everything costs 100isk so why warp
tell em marn i think that yamamoto guy is a goumidong alt the amount of uniformed bull he spews
look just because minmatar bs arent gallente bs doesnt mean we need to buff them ive fought against all minmatar bs  small gang and fleet   and i have no complaints about any of them theyre actually really good sure a mega might outdamage a tempest but tempest can easily stay out of range or deal enough damage to kill the mega before it has time to kill the pest besides the average bs tank in pvp is about 300400 in a gang with just about any ewar an armor tanked pest will be easily enough to break tanks  plus damage from whoever else is in your gang   ive seen phoons kill hyperions solo and  see above   a mael kill two hyperions at the same time ive seen a pest tank three domis  admittedly the domis werent very good but still   what are you complaining aboutalso depending on your gang you often dont need tackle gear on bs no selfrespecting gang has only one point even if your bs doesnt have one youll still probably have at least one  probably two   inties a hac and possibly a reconall with points the extra damage is worth the lack of tackle if it will shut you people up then fine give them better tracking or base falloff but increasing their damage any more is just rediculous a mael can already outdamage a hyperion and at longer ranges too  if the hyp wants to fit a tank   a buff would be overkill and quit saying pests are bad because they cant stand up to a mael thats like saying exequrors are bad because they cant stand up to thoraxs bottom line minmatar are fast and versatile they deal enough damage with their weapons  acs missiles and drones  to compete with any other bs

and this matters because oh wait it doesnt because it only matters how it performs on the ships and it performs just fine on the ships except the tempest112 you see you are complaining that there is no reason to upgrade your weapons well  that is the same as getting more for downgrading you are essentially complaining that your low tier weapons are too good if you want to lose range like blasters and lasers do and if you want to gain less tracking like blasters and lasers do then fine i guess its ed but its your decision the only reason to buff the top ends would be if the top ends were under performing but we just showed that the top ends werent under performing because we have a ship performing just fine with them no you didnt and that is why your argument is ed if you took the drones away from the megathron it would suck balls because it would be doing ty dps at a tier rangeso with the tempest when you ignore its two other high slots that it can actually fit and ignore its drones it sure does look ty and while its not great because it has deficiencies in those areas it means you can fix those areas to make the ship fineit doesnt matter if the average goes down if the final number goes up and oh look it does now if you are saying that the tempest ought to do more dps than the hyperion or megathron you are just ed if you move fusionpp to 11 base you will just nerf the lot of them since hail is 14 and faction fusion isnt coming close the 2 things you would have to nerf would be the phoon and the maelstrom
no just wrong the speed advantage at bs level is absolutely minimal minimal and the agility is the same as gallente a tempest cant stay out of range of anything one minmatar bs deals good damage thats the typhoon the tempest is useless and the mael has a lot of problems
the tempest isnt useless its really useful if you want to see big numbers

agree completely
market  seller column in marketi love most of the ideas so on the whole this definitly has my supportbut is the item mentioned above translated as showing the name of the seller i question its validity market should be economic pvp only by being able to determine who the actual seller is you bring politics andor opinions in to play then motives like the sellers standing to you or your corp or even your own reputation start to out weigh economic descisions imagine being a famous pirate  who everyone hates   and trying to sell stuffas a result everyone will use an nonallied unknown alt to sell their stuff resulting in the whole point being useless anyways
are you suggesting that you are going to table 60 issues for the agenda  as all your list are seperate issues not one   and discuss them all in the csm meetingsome of these will have farreaching ingame implications which are not for the greater good they need to be discussed each in turn and then voted one seperately im sure ccp wants 60 individual issues to respond to from one meetingoh but then you are not going to discuss issues in meetings anymore since the discussion happens via the threads rightlumping many issues together masks some important ones which are good ideas that should be put forward to ccp however i stand by my earlier post elsewhere regarding the role of the csm it is not a game development grouparithron
very good point one that i missed due to being overly optimistic of the implemention of new industrial contenti fear that alot of ayeayers here are blinded by the type of suggestion and dont take a closer look at what is suggestedi retract the vote i never managed to cast in the first place

i support this
you cant make them too cheap otherwise people will start to use them in missions i wouldnt reduce the cost to less than 5 million per bombhowever the mechanics for deploying bombs need to be revised currently its too difficult and not rewarding enough
oh and supported
make bombs act like normal missiles do and prevent them from damaging other bombs and a small price reduction honestly 75m would be the lowest i would suggest but nothing below 5m per shot would help these vastly underused things thriveit would be disgustingly expensive to use them casually still but in a small fleet on fleet engagement 30 ships on either side a squad of bombers successfully jumping on the enemy fleet might be able to cripple the enemy long enough to break the stalematealso maybe if they werent so suicidally it would be good too increase the duration of the bomb and reduce the speed a tad to give the bombers a chance to disengage and get out
since bombs cant be used in empire worries about mission whoring with bombs is silly however bombs do need to made1 cheaper its like losing a bc if you get popped with full load2 need to go off every time whether you are alive or dead near or in warp you should be able to drop it and go3 more damage 4 drop while cloaked  though it decloaks the ship once released that would be a nice compromise  5 let it drop more the one bomb at a time likea bomber or give us cluster bombs for smaller targets6 make them cheaper along the lines of faction ammo  i know i said it already but it bears repeating
i give this my support
i support this10 million for a bomb is stupid
yes but they must require lvl 6 and 7 of the cybernetics skill   
as long as there are counters to a falcon  and there are   they are not overpowered if you want to cripple the only ship the caldari have that does anything well then lets nerf nanoing of all ships the same logic i have been reading in this thread can be applied to that or many other ships for that matterjust get over it and play the game
oh please if the caldari didnt have  blackbird  best gang support t1 cruiser   drake  a awesome pvp bc if you stopped fitting it like a mission runner and trained some fitting skills   scorpion  awesome ecm gang support bs   raven  awesome gang bs   rokh  same as raven but with more tank and turrets   rook  now underused thanks to falcons but oh well   crow  do i really need to say anything   kitsune  best eaf   griffin  best gang support t1 frig   and so on youd have a point therecaldari dont deserve the onoz we have only one effective ship crap
it is not the counters that decides if a ship is overpowered or not it is decided by how it performs compared to its sister ships and how it affect the overall gamplay the arazu could be countered by sensor boosters nanophoon by webifiers and myrmidon by smartbombs yet they all got nerfedi dont want to cripple the falcon i want it to become something else the effect of 200km falcons in low sec is changing the pvp for the negative to counter this falcon development you will either have to fly nano gangs or bring more ecm when not even a bs gang can deal with a falcon image the effect on a bccommand gang a falcon can probably keep 6 cruisers jammed however all this would be ok as long as the ships have a fair chance of killing the falcon now they dont i personally dont understand why caldari pilots dont want the falcon changed changing the falcon so it could actually operate and survive at closemedium range would give you another tactical option not just long range jamming
falcons are ok now no need to mess with good ship fix myrmydion tho p
falcon is almost ok it has two problems huge range make it untouchable for shortrange combat  as noted in the op   there is no reason to fly a rook instead unless you want 100dps more in your gang hell theres not even a reason to fly a scorp  bs   instead falcon is making two ships almost obsoleteto counter the range thing give gallente recons a use make them antisniper give damps a range similar to ecm  with falloff so its not a 100 killer at those distances  to counter the rookscorp problem reduce the ecm strength bonus on a falcon slightly  back to 15   it can still jam the hell out of a lot of stuff but the rook will actually have a use then
have yall seen this post just look at those numbers edit you need to enable images on your forum settings to see this but the numbers are absolutely unreal just try and show me something that compares to thisthis totally breaks small gang pvp solo bs 23 man gang lol youre sol m8 hope your third guy is a falcon or youre going home in a podone racial has an 86 chance to jam my geddon one multi is 58 chance if i use 13 of my total mid slots i can basically halve that number and then one jammer only jams me 44 and 29 of the time not counting lock time lets hope he doesnt have more than one jammer fitted eccm doesnt counter jamming in small gangsthere is no real counter in a small gang other than bringin one of your own every other shiptype counters ignore the fact that in a small gang setup youre limited by your pilot numbers the whole metafitting idea behind small gangs is fit a small number of ships to be adaptable enough to deal with a large range of targets fitting to deal with a falcon requires a dedicated vessel or a falcon of your own this is not countering a falconthe second thread linked by the op is my thread i offer three viable solutions my favorite solution being stacking penalties combined with racials losing their offrace strength let me go over that one more timeit wont change the falcon in large fleetstyle fights you still will be applying a max of 12 jammers on correct racial targets at nearly no jam strength reduction youll still reduce their overall dpsrrff ability hell in fleetstyle pvp eccms even work since there are more targets than jammers and if everyone fits an eccm than the falcon cant jam as many guysthis breaks down in small man pvp where even if youre 2x as hard to jam that just means the falcon gives you a few extra jammers often offrace and still effectively perma jams you if you stacking penalize jammers and remove offrace strength thena   multis see more use lowering range and indirectly lower overall jams since multies are less strong this makes overall jamming a little lower and makes nanos a stronger counter since they have less range to coverb   it gives small gang ships fitting eccm a realistic level of jamming protection if the falcon can only really apply 24 jammers with the third and fourth being pretty weak then if you fit an eccm you might be able to get more than 1 lock cycle a fight the best part is your 00 blob performance is nearly identical you pretty much dont lose anything whule it becomes possible to small gang pvp without being permajammed by an untouchable falcon
very nice ideas endless   
although it seems that ive been defending the falcon in my posts here ive really been criticising those that maintain there is no counter other than dedicated singlerole ships because thats palpable nonsense endlesss quote  fitting to deal with a falcon requires a dedicated vessel or a falcon of your own is simply not true any viable remoterep bs gang has room for a sniper and any gang has room for  indeed requires  a fast tackler capable of acting as a ongrid warpin pointbut the quote above highlights the real problem  that the rook is now useless i always thought that the falcon should never have received the same ecm bonus as the rook because of the huge force multiplier of the cloak but that the old 10level bonus was inadequate 15level would be idealalso the scorpion is far from obsolete unlike the falcon it has the ehp to survive some dps and the systems for nonecm selfdefence like neuts and smarties and being t1 its almost free
well to be quite honest they couldnt arazu could still damp a battleship to a range at which it was unable to do anything nanophoons inertia could still carry it to the gate even when quadruplewebbed i agree that a ships performance should be compared to its sister ships but in that sense there are only four dedicated jamming ships available rook falcon bb and the scorpion  others are multirole ships especially gallente and amarr recons out of those four the falcon is unarguably the bestpersonally i feel the following way unless i can stay at a range where i have ample time to do something against the opposing gang i know i will die if there is even a single ship that can target me it will and it will remove me from combat granted i dont do lowsec small  36   man warfare so i do not feel flying an overpowered ship  theres always someone targeting methat does not mean that your argument is invalid however but on the other hand changing my ship to balance your combat environment feels wrong if removing a showstopper from your arena means that id never take a falcon into my combat environment again thus the question is what to do with the falconto keep the ew lineup focused strictly on ew  and being paperthin   i dont really see how one could change the bonuses range of 100km with racials means its not useful unless its ew effectiveness is increased and by giving it an another midslot  since a single missed cycle means instadeath making the ew combat into a coinflip either you win or you lose theres nothing in between   but it would remove them from lowsec i guessi might be tempted to make the falcon into a nanoship though drastically increased speed and more lowslots say 5 lows you balance range with polycarbs  rigs   you balance cap stability with jamming  mids cap batteriesrechargers  mwdjammers   and jamming strenght with speed  lows ods vs sdas   perhaps part of the speed increase could come from the ecm range bonus being changed to extra 5 speed per level bonus itd also become the first real caldari nanoship
maybe in 00 and even there actually no the small in small roaming gangs refers to 34 bs tops and thats actually on the big side endless refers to 23 ships total you do not have the room to drop 20 of your dps for a sniperfalcon is basically guaranteed to jam a tackler  inty hac   200km takes a long time to cover falcon has all the time in the world to lock jam and warp off
the tackling inty isnt the problem the problem is the ships  and more importantly their drones  that warp to the tackler also youre neglecting recons and their excellent sensor strengths an arazu or lachesis is tough enough to jam even without considering eccm and will completely shut down a falcon once in damp range a curse will similarly ruin a falcon pilots day jamming an ishtar aggros its drones these are standard small gang shipsin any case a falcon that warps off is a falcon neutralised he wont be back on the field for a good minute and longer if he has to do a further warp so he comes back to the field on a different vector yes if hes prepared then hell have on grid bms to warp between but why dont you
way to pull it out of context again small gang pvp gpysio specifically in low sec it doesnt sound like its a problem in larger gangs where there is the option to bring antifalcon support without gimping the entire gang my suggestions dont limit its role here at all but in small gangs were limited by pilot numbers outline a 23 man gang where its better to have an antifalcon ship than a falcon of your own or a 23 man gang in low sec that has an inty in it and ill give you a better gang everytime
while the falcon warps off yes and were back at the original problem to provide a warpin the tackler needs to tackle and if its just for 20 seconds and an inty canta single racial jammer module on an unrigged mediocreskilled falcon has 433 jam chance on an arazu multispec is 281 half that if the arazu fits an eccm module but the arazu wont get into range it needs to travel 160km either visibly to the falcon  160km time for the falcon to warp  or 160km cloaked which will take longer than the fight lastsan arazu with four damps will bring a falcon with 250km lock range down to 54km lock range which is long enough to lock the arazu far from completely shut downsame problem for travelling 250km in a curseyou have 250km drone control range on your ishtarnot in lowsec actually  none of them can usefully tank sentries  yes you just used half your gang  2 ships or so   to neutralize a hostile ship while the other half of your gang got blown up job well done for the falconuhmno one asked for the falcon to be made useless its just a tiny bit too good at what it does right now  i still like endless ideas stacking penalty yes please     
no you can warp to any gang member on grid beyond 150 km he doesnt have to tackle someone to enable this 160 km will take an arazu about 45 seconds its more like 150 km anyway accounting for overheated scram and typical combat ranges  and that requires the falcon to have a bm net and not just have warped in at 100 km   and even less to apply damps and prevent the falcon from jamming your dps ships similar for curse ishtar will get into range just as quickly as any other hacrecon or it can just deploy sentries and not have to worry about drone travel timethe tools are there the last few times ive flown my falcon ive been damped and killed by an arazu had a face full of beam from an apoc then had a huginn ongrid warp to a crow that had mwded up to me sometimes ive been able to warp out  then have to explain to my gang why i wasnt contributing nanoishtar and fof cerberus will be next i expectbut having said all this i still support a reduction to 15level to make to rook viable
falcon is fine dont nerf the last good caldari ship please
this sentiment is both awful for game balance and unfoundedeven if all the other caldari ships were rubbish which they arent using that to justify the existance of an overpowered caldari ship is not balance overpowered ships need to be brought into balance to ensure a better game environment
lets put it this waywe either have effective ewarships in the game or we dont if we do they will be in widespread use due to their effectiveness and general unwillingness to fit antiewar modules that makes them capable of turning the tide of a small skirmish this is also due to the fact that defending against dps is effective against all types of dps a plate doesnt care if its taking em or kinetic damage its simply increasing your hp buffer otoh every antiewar module is simply focused against one thing and is generally ballast if youre not facing the thing youre trying to defend against thus people do not generally fit them because to fit them means gimping your tankgankgeneral combat capabilitynobody really used falconsrooks when lachesisarazu was as effective as it was before the damp nerf thus i claim that there will always be a need for people to fly effective ewar ships nerf them and were back to either blobs or nanosid rather do one of the two thingseither boost the other ewarships significantly especially the cloaking variants give the pilgrim its range bonus and whatever it takes to make it UFFFDber raise the bonuses on gallente and minmatar recons to something thats utterly insane or make variations of the modules used in pvp  plates hardeners mwds scrams webs extenders damage mods whatever   have different versions that also improve targeting range scan resolution sensor strenght whatever at the expense of module effectivenessrangewhatever one could use scripts or somethign for that thatd make ewar tanking more viable without removing the capabilities of the ship that wants to just focus on murderlating everyone with raw dps itd just have to give up some of the tankgankwhatever on the fly to protect against the sudden situation where the opposing side has powerful ecm put against them
when it comes to the paper thintank it is so because you chose to fit it that way falcons have the same option to fit a tank as the rest of the force recons it is because of the offensive capabilities it has that it is called primary not its lack of tank i dont think it means instadeath if it looses a cycle either all the other recons have to stay within 100km and they seem to somewhat managei agree ewar ships add an important tactical element to the combat however 200km falcons does not add to low sec pvp they prevent itim not sure how the recons should be balanced tbh there is a lot of options here i have always considered the combat recon to be the standard one and the force recon a lighter version with a cov ops cloak not the other way aroundi think to boost all the force recons would instantly obsolete the combat recons i guess some overall balancing would be in order for the whole line but the falcon definitely needs to be changed
with the right fit on a cerb you can get its missile to hit at 180k easily also why snipe with a bs snipe with a hac or command ship the eagle can be setup to hit at over 180k heck ive set a harpy to hit at 180k granted the harpy hits will be laughable but an eagle or say astarte theyll be backing off real quick
there is definitively a need for ccp to look 00 sovereignty mechanics even trying to make it more diffucult for a single entity to hold large portions of space
thumbs up
tusko i think this is an excellent point the mechanics of sovereignty really should accurately reflect the usagepatrolling of space by the the controlling entity  so a revamp of sovereignty would want to have in mind mechanics that result in space being marked as owned by alliances that are frequenting that space and unfrequented space should easily default to unclaimed status
sovereignty really needs to reflect an entitys ability to control space with ships not their ability to put up postt
that is boring and static it results in players who want to keep space having to have a job to maintain it pos logistics are bad enough as it is there is no reason to go and make everyone do  like that
myrmydion is currently only bc which has been literally castrated and useless myrm bonus is practically unusable because of its drone bandwidth which cannot be utilized successfully with 5 medium drones there is no even possibility to rat in it decently in 00 which is doable in any tier any race bcmyrm need something extra if we gonna stick with drone boat it should be able at least release 4 heavies and 1 medsmall and have additional place for at least one set of smallseven useless ferox can be utilized as cheap eagle myrmydion cannot be compared ishtar anywayim familiar with projectiles setup  but even than myrm is just castratedo something i like vertical ships   
but but all vertical ships are the worst of their kind you cant upset the natural balance you cant play dev with nature itselfbut seriously why should the myr have more bandwidth than the eos
myrm is perfectly fine as it is it can no longer do it all  tank gank and drone it could in the past which is why they changed it
yeah the eos got castrated too they should have stripped turrets off the drone boats that had too much dps not stripped drones knock off 23 turrets on each give them back their 125 bandwidth i think the op is overstating his case here  the myrm is hardly useless and it was a little too good before the change  but the bandwidth nerf was inappropriate and should be rolled back in favour of the correct nerf
fix the myrm 2 turrets  or even 3   and back to 125 bandwitdh

the issue is that it requires the full key of a ceo or director of the corp if the developer or person hosting a killboard collected those keys they would then have access to all the api data for both that person and the corp this is preventing a lot of people who would like to use the killmail feature of the api from doing soi think we definitely need a way to create a number of keys that can be assigned one or more specific roles like kill data character sheet data market data corp market data and so on you could then use one key for your killboard another for evemon another for market analysis tools etc
folks since the csm has been developed and put into action there have been constant bickering by characters less than 8 months old that dont have any idea what theyre talking about nerf what i dont have skills to use and buff what i have skills to use this human nature of complaining has gone far enough so to get an actual feel for the community there should be a character age limit on to who can post on the forums just as there are voting drinking and driving ages in many nations of the world there should be a forum age stop the armchair generals today
unfortunately that is a bit off this character is my third life in eve i started long ago so the age of the character has no bearing nor does a bought 3 year char being manipulated by a n00b that has no idea about mechanics at all and by you suggestion it will give validity to an idiot who bought a 3 year character that does not have 6 weeks in the gameunfortunately what you are suggesting is that a large chunk of the player base to be silenced which will go over like a wet fart in churchi do see what you are saying that we have a bunch of players that do not really understand the game yet making knee jerk suggestions not understanding what damage it can cause or the long term effects and whine threads has been going on long before the csm they just happen to find another place to post
nerf whining
the suggestion to make the largest weapons system out there effective against smaller targets is just a tad on the silly sidei personally thing hams are a little hard to fit on any ship that can use them to do damage and a little light on the damage side on the ships than can fit them more easily
torps are nice i havent use hams yet  maybe i should hmm damnation  
torps are great but hams could use a bit of help
torps are useful but not in thr right way when one thinks of torpedos you think of very long range very high damage very slow missiles the sort of thing you use to tackle poss and supercaps from 150km with as torps are they satisfy criteria 2 and 3 but dont get number one at all i think that the highfitting missiles should be something like thiscruise missiles high velocityexplosion speed low explosion radius very long range pretty much as istorpedos something like 1000ms base speed 11 or 12 second base flight time about the same damageexplosion speedradius as they currently arethird option not sure what should go here but it should fill the role that torps currently use maybe a very rapid firing heavyham launcher ala the assault launcher maybe something more akin to the bomb launcher dont really knowso while i dont really know too much about hams  was told they were crap never touched them   i do think that torps need a major rethink
heavy missile  cruise missile  railgunham  torp  blasteri think it works pretty well from the torpedo standpoint put an mwd on your raven and melt the big belt rats hams not trained i wanted the range when in a cruiser or bc
hams are absolutely great on a cerberus while i wish they had a bit more damage potential than close range gun counterparts due to delayed damage im fairly happy with them on this shiptorps totally rock on a raven while i wish they had a bit better range as i miss them for the occasional ratting it is possible to fit up a raven to rat with them still as for pvp these rockcourse caldari have always been about range so im a bit biased
hams are awesome on a drake too as the drake is shieldtanked it can fit more damage mods than other bcs and have a good tank at the same time easily outweighting the slightly lower dps of these compared to other closerange weapons the range is also quite good  optimalfalloff in parens with longrange tech 2 ammo   blasters 1538  3847   acs 1410  2715   pulses 755  235   ham 20  82     torps are a good deal beyond overpowered if you ask me that horse has been beaten to death but torp raven gets the dps of a blaster megathron at triple the range and little to no drawbacks torp range is also quite ok at 25km  30km theoretical   with tech 1 ammo or up to 45km with tech 2 ammo
when i think of torps i think of medium range fairly slow but highly fatal weapons while cruise missiles are long range very fast but not so fatal ones i am not exactly current on todays weapons but iirc todays surface combatants have better chances to survive a hit from a cruise missile than from a modern torpedoother space games i played also had torps as fairly short ranged weapons even if there it was not due to flight time but due to them being easily interceptable when fires too far out
rockets need across the board help torps are fine hams are fine except that their pg requiements are ludicrously high preventing caldari missile boats from using them properly
im afraid i cannot support your proposal because you stuck two of them together torpedos are fine imo hams would be fine if you could fit 5 ham ii  mwd ii  2x bcs ii onto a caracal and have enough grid remaining for some low power use midslot mods but basically no tank
many of you may have noticed that tech 2 mods are only slightly less common on the market than dirt this is primarily due to the invention system being implemented although the invention system is a major improvement over the old lotto system  the less talked about the better   it still could use some major improvement in of itselfcurrently invention creates tech 2 bpcs period i propose a percentage system that would make tech 2 bpcs less common but generate more bpcs overall creating bpcs to make limited runs of mid to high grade tech 1 mods and possibly the rare bpc of faction mods let me use an example to help explainlets say you wanted to invent off of a heavy missile launcher i blueprint instead of the current system what if the results breakdown was as follows30 failure nothing gained30 10run bpc of malkuth heavy missile launcher i20 10run bpc of advanced limos heavy missile bay i10 10run bpc of xr3200 heavy missile bay i5 10run bpc of arbalest heavy missile launcher i49 10run bpc of heavy missile launcher ii1 5run bpc of a random faction heavy missile launcheri can think of several major effects this would have1   tech 2 mods would become less common than they are now but in light of the current market flood of tech 2 mods i dont think that would be a major problem2   midhigh grade tech 1 mods would become more common on the market but would still be rarer and harder to aquire than the basic mod this would eventually reduce the prices on these mods but would do so more along the lines of module effectiveness as the better tech 1 mods would have a lower invention chance3   faction mods would become somewhat more common lowering the prices on them but since there is only a 1 in 1000 chance to invent them the effect would be minimal and if invention of faction bpcs is a problem that 1 could go into the tech 2 mod chance instead4   moon mineral prices would drop due to fewer tech 2 module bpcs being invented5   asteroid mineral prices would rise due to an increase of tech i module manufactureoverall i believe this could be a very good moderating force within the commodoties market at least for ship modules in terms of effectiveness alone the best standard tech 1 mods should be economically nearly the same price as their tech 2 counterparts plus there would be a greater variety of modules being manufactured by industrialists spreading out sales within the market among most if not all of the standard tech 1 variantsremember also the percentages i listed are just a basic example and it may require some mathematical tweaking by the good doctor to make it as fair and balanced as possible this proposed fix would take some time to reach its desired effectivness as there are still many tech 2 bpcs out there waiting to be used and until they are there will still be a flood of tech 2 mods on the market this is a longterm fix not an instant bandaid
i see no need for this  itd spike t2 prices to where they were preinvention the added source doesnt much compensate for the added players   itd make invention supplies more expensive in the process thus putting brakes on the amount the system could be used   itd gives us more trashy named gear than we already have  a lot of which isnt even worth manufacturing  and itd provide a wholly unneeded stream of faction gear which is supposed to be rare and factionsourced
paragraph breaks for readabilitymany of the topend named tech 1 mods  especially turrets   are significantly more expensive than their better tech 2 counterparts as it stands right now an increase in the supply of these woundnt be a bad thing giving moderately skilled players an opportunity to use gear that is better than the base modules without breaking them financially the faction gear was an addon to the idea and would not necessarily be a requirement some tweaking down of the supply of t2 bpcs wouldnt necessarily be a bad thing currently many t2 manufacturers cannot sell their mods reasonably due to the excessive supply plus manufacturing prices would most likely drop due to the increase in moon mineral compounds on the market this would at least minimally offset the increased cost of invention for t2 mods as to spiking prices to preinvention levels i doubt it would be that bad but the prices would increase the trick is to find a balance between supply and demand and unfortunately right now supply is winning big time
no this would be bad for just about everyone
lowmeta gear is already really easy to get your hands on as a rule meta 0 gear t1   sells for a touch less than mineral price meta 12 gear sells for not a lot more and only meta 34 gear is expensive enough to be worried about as for best named being more expensive than t2 of course it is most of the time it has the same stats but needs less fitting and lower skills when thats not the case  say with hardeners  the t2 variant tends to be far more valuable than the bestnamed
i dont agree with this one bit if you want to build named tech one modules then get at ccp to reintroduce reverse engineering and make it like invention only for named productsyou know that isnt a bad idea

your thread title indicates only drones but in the post you also want a commandtype ship i can kind of understand what youre asking for  basically a command link ship that dpss with drones because its highs are full of command mods   but i think this is really not needed heres whymy alt in a drake runs 4 ganglinks nonstop and has a cloak and cyno it cant defend its self but if it could while doing that then it would just be stupidmost ships in the game have a drone bay since most ships  even most galente ships   dont have a drone bonus besides a generally bigger drone bay then its just as important to have top notch drone skills as it is to have good speed or locking skills you dont need the moros 50 per level drone bonus to reak havok in a vagabond with well trained small ecm drones out in a fight the drones will get off at least one jam which will let you escape a rapier every timea common misconception about carriers is that its just a big dronespewing death machine in reality it does not do its dammage with its drones its a logistics ship it keeps your battleships and cap ships alive so that those ships survive to kill the enemy i cant stress enough that a carier does about 2 bs of dammage but can make lots of friendly bs and caps invulnerable for long enough to turn the battle also fighters are 20m each are slow cant hit well die easy are so impractical youll wish you never trained them and youll use ordinary drones about 90 of the time or loose millions of isk in fighters learning not to pull them outa ship that is between the size of a battleship and a carrier causes me some worry though first you would have to get over the fact that bs play a decreased role today as they are slow have troubble defending from small things and are generally less desireable than a plain old cruiser in roaming ops because of its sluggishness it is usually an all or nothing commitment to deploy a battleship whereas a cruiser can do good dammage and escape repeatedly for less investment so my question is what would your jumbo battleship provide that will make it usefull given its immobility and big price tag the gang mods and drones idea doesnt really stack up due to the bccommandship alternative and because you have no reason to not train drones for the other ships youll use on the way to carrier the bigger battleship would only provide a distraction to keep your training and money from focusing on the carrier you specified was the primary goal what the big battleship would be good for if it could work well in a fight and would be a cheeper easier to train option than a fullblown carrier then it may add spice to subcapital gang skirmishes imo it should be cynoable to let it hotdrop on a fight use remote reps effectively and a max of 5 drones at a time i still dont really want them in eve thoughmy specific grudge is that more and more threads seem to indicate that people who have not been playing as long as most cap pilots are demanding their own cheep and easy to train ship that will let them kill lots of people that have years more training and lots more money invested in their setups than they do i strongly discourage any flex twords this mentality why did i play for 4 years to get skills and cash for a carier and a dread for some new guy to get all flex on me in his baby cap a new charactor can get every bit of pawnage an older charactor can by simply making friends and operating in groups 10m isk of destroyers does as much dammage as 1b isk of carier i know a guy that almost lost his carrier to some destroyers look up eveuniversity i think is the name
excluding the quote which i am too lazy too readi see no mention of an actual fix to the issue of dronesjust some whining about warlinksbut on the subject of drones i beleive the curse is a drone boat typhoon also has a siezeable bayim sure theres more im just too lazy too find them therefore i call false advertisingand thumbs down
thank you for the response mostly i wanted something that was worth training heavy drones sentry drones or di5 for caldari as only 1 ship gets 75m3 of bay and the other 2 bs only get 50m3 i also wanted a ship that i could use before i had to invest the 1 bil in skill books before a carrier i am training logistics v currently so it seems to be good enough until you get capital reps my biggest problem is that my drake with warlinks isnt that useful in fleet engagements with its horrid dps this ship would likely let me solve all three problems but i mostly posted here to get others opinions on it so thank youwas trying to fit something into the 100m bs slot and the 1 bil cap ship slot
caldari dont use drones as a primary weapon or even as a secondary drones are more of an afterthought on caldari ships you want drones train gallente or amarr both of whom have some very nice droneships
that being exactly the point the op is makingas caldari there is no previous ship that really uses drones so one can smooth the transition to a caldari carriermight be interesting to have a ship that has some small specific sentry drones  sticking to the caldari range theme   bonus or something along those linethough if this is the case for the other two races hmmm lets call this a partial thumbs up
so will anything ever be done with the macros or has that been forgotten since that gap has been filled with buying time cards with isk i think a good way would be to put more of the doing in the hands of the playersif someone thinks there might be a macro miner around he could go and purches a kill rights if the macro is verified as one with a quick check up and then person that bought the kill right can go and pop him put in your comments or ideas about this
thats a really bad solution to macros if someone has been verified as a macro you ban them you dont shoot them and if you think youve found one you petition them you dont purchase kill rights
i have petitioned many times about believed macros and have never been sent anything to let me know if they looked into it other then thank you for the petition and seen the same people keep on doing what they were doing it would be nice if you got some conformation saying yea they were or not they werent whats the point of taking your time letting ccp know about it if it does not seem they are really looking into it
ccp doesnt just instaban the person as soon as you petition them they perform background checks and with the gigantic queue of names they receive every day i am sure they are just behind a littlegms and devs have said in other threads that despite not showing any immediate reaction to please continue petitioning any macro miners you suspect it does help themnot signed sorry

quite frankly i like how it works thats one of the things that sets this mmo apart from the others with games like wow you have to constantly play for hrs on end to get anywhere in the game at least with this you set it and forget it plus if you took away the learning skills it would mess up the balance and it would be a huge deal to rebalance so leave the damn learning skills alone thats such a noob thing to say imo i for one will not support this

the general conclusion was that posting issue threads in the assembly hall for seven day minimum was the best means of facilitating discussion if you read the 2nd meeting chatlog youll see that we didnt have it ready and had to defer  should have it up this week
bull you never discussed it hell your post in the look at 00 sov thread is i support thisway to have a facilitate discussionthere is only a chance in hell of having a discussion if a csm starts the topic and even then its flooded with  by all the idiots who dont realize they dont need to vote anymoreput up a thread where we can have a discussion its not difficult its no undue burden all it requires is a little honesty and a smidgen of initiativei read the chatlog and it looked to me like you voted to approve it
ive told you before about swearing and insulting people in your posts goum learn to behave with a little respect and maybe youll get some discussion continue like this and youll continue quite rightly being ignored

seeing is how the abaddon lacks a cap bonus that all other amarr ships have give it an extra launcher hardpoint or 2 and remove 1 or 2 turret hardpoints the abaddon is a cap  as it is running a full rack of guns drains that cap in no time at all
the abaddon is made from hardened win sauce and emits hot laser death to those who disagree its find asis leave it be
reevaluate your ship configuration eyes and you shall see the way of the abaddon
do not touch the abaddon it is absolutely perfect the way it is a glorious tungsten razorball of disco destruction shame it only lasts to the end of one song but no one else should be around by then   
i really dont think the abaddon needs this kind of nerf

in the reasonably distant past ecm modules were fitted to all kinds of ships and were quite effective then ecm modules themselves were nerfed so they became impractical on nonecm bonused ships then much later most ecm bonused ships were boosted to make them more useful using the lower starting strength ecmin a recent patch rsds were changed in two ways they were reduced to 23 of their previous effectiveness and they were given scripts so they affect only one of two aspects to full strength or both to half strength im not arguing that this was a bad change as it wasnt rsds were being fitted to all sorts of ships  rapiers ravens domis etc   making them similar to ecms of yorehowever now the rsd bonused ships are a bit lacking just like the ecm boats used to be they cannot keep a single target from doing damage like a falcon can or even like a pilgrim can to a turret based ship i ask that the bonuses to rsd ships be looked at to make them more useful in small gangs a strength boost returning them to prenerf strength on those ships would not be overpowered given the scripting changes
i really hope that will be put on the table when talking with ccp staff
signedpersonally i would like to see ranges of rsds increased so rsd specialized ships can hit at 250km fairly easily this would make rds ships a counter to sniping bs as well as a counter to ecm ships as it is right now there is no reason to use an rsd over an ecm in any scenario people like to say that rsds complement ecm well this is true but two ecm is more effective than ecmrsd
i remember flying my arazu just a few weeks ago its a nice toy to just mess with people while they are ratting but both you and your target knows that the arazu cant much more than just toy with them
yeah i dont know why it never occurs to them to exempt ewarspecialized ships when they nerf ewar due to too many people fitting the ewar to nonspecialized ships in other words signed

dreadsrevelation and moros have massive cap use nag uses no cap for guns they need more cap mods than nag usually dread fit to be cap stable with 3 guns  1 cap rep to avoid lag that is a massive disadvatage for caldari nags do not shield tank for example go to ra killboard look up at nag losses on the first page of dread losses all nags are armor tanked so all the talk about fittings is wrongshield tanking needs a rank 4 100 useless skill unlike missile skills   to be at level 5 moros needs t2 sentry drones to make the most out of it hardest training times most likely but only slightlycarrieryou mention that the stats are better for thanatos but if you actually look at the differences you will see that nidhoggur performs very similar compared to other carriers hardly anything to whine about remote rep bonus is not bad at allsupercaps ok the minmatar capitals are not the very best of all but they are decent no one will ever say to a minmatar spec char to train some other races capitals minor boosts to nidnag such as bigger armor hp at the expense of shield hp or a slight increase for capital projectile 510   is ok and understandable but major boosts such as adding slots are not required
you can armor tank your nag but then it does even less damage than a shield tanking one  i believe it becomes on par or below the phoenix   and you have less effective hp in any fleet battle the dreads tank is rather meaningless you just have to hope your siege deactivates so the carriers can remote rep you up because your tank isnt going to work on more than 1 other dread in fact if you look at ras latest nag loss its 3 revelations and they only did 11mil damage to himjust because someone does it differently it doesnt make it right if you would like i could rewrite the original post with armor tanking and apart from lowering the training time 25days for tactical shield manipulation v the nag would be even more tier atleast with the moross t2 sentries you get to use that on other ships when was the last time you used torps  which the nag requires ontop of capital projectiles   a high sec gank is about all theyre good for or maybe cyno jammer takedownsas a minmatar character through and through and as much as i love my tempest i would tell any newbie to stop training minmatar at cruisers and to not even bother with anything bs and above they are outclassed and outshined by every other race in capitals and battleships the nidhoggurhel are okay but theyre not worth being stuck with terrible battleshipsdreadstitans

yes we  read i   need this i still refuse to think that ccp designed the dreadnoughts for pure pewpew work they are good mining vessles too they look cool and brings joy and laughter to pilots all around new edenso 1   the introduction of a capital mining laser  putting m2mdcm2 on a dread makes it look silly the turrets need a big rock eating module no it should not outmine a hulkthe cml will be slightly better than a m2mdcm2 with a longer rangeand 2   siege mode should affect mining lasers it makes no sense that siege mode does not affect the mining lasers as it occupies a turret siege should affect yield and duration  and yes i am well aware that the cost of stront most likely would make a miner go negative compared to without siege  but its the style im talking about here   and yes this is a pure i want suggestion i do not have anyone else but me and the veldnaught in mind for thisstill  you should support it c
clearly a mistake by some dev that the above is not allready in gamesigned
only because its you   
and it should only work in amarr imoall hail chribba
will i ever use a mining dread no would i ever use siege mode if i did nodoes the thought of chribba activating 8 heavy capital mining laser iis bring a smile to my face yessupported
yes
i would let the veldnaught in deployed mode outmine a hulki also propose putting a new mid slot module called the easy bake oven into capitals that allows for melting ice in deployedtriage mode how hard is it to refine ice anyway
considering what the man has done not doing this would be a crime
and cookies what kind of a dreadnought cant make cookies
1 billion isk for the strip pole low slot would still be bought my friend maybe only available if you have a clone bay fitted as well did i die and go to heaven
only chribba would make a post like this and only chribba would get such a good response
a capital mining laser makes me shudder
o chribba
very ditto and very supportedactually maybe this thing shouldnt be able to be built i think ccp should create it as a unique module and give 3 to chribba as a gift to a leading pillar of the eve community or something worded along those lines

first not all dreads are the veldnaught so this would be an option for more then chribba i would expect to see a screen shot of a titan quietly mining with a full rack of cmpiis and for that alone i would support this idea
i would so use a dread to mine in lowsec00 but what about the caldari dread maybe a 40 bonus to cml yield per level of caldari dread to even out only having 1 turret slot and something similar for the minny one

well alphastrikekills were something too common therefore they have been removed now when will the weapon specialized in exactly that removed aspect be looked at 15 dps100 clipsize
that they cant must have been an oversight surely
support this albeit conditionally there should be some drawback to using a covert cyno in a cyno jammed system  for example it could show up on the overview like a normal cyno or its fuel use could be increased or its activation time increased unrestricted use in a restricted system would be backward
supportedto the above poster technically the cyno itself is restricted since capitals cant move through it
it would make sense to me if this was the case

i agreecynojammers and a short jumprange make blackops very hard to use effectively
i shoopdawhoop it
yep
definitely agree with this i cant think of a single good reason why this would be a bad thing
without doubt make em worth the training
supported but by itself this isnt enough to fix black ops they also desperately need help in the scan resolution department they may not get sensor recalibration time but they still get the scan res hit from fitting a cloaking device making it impossible to lock subbattleship targets in a reasonable timeframe
they really should have this
oh god yes should of been brought in years ago
do this now
i support the convenience this would bring
eves ui needs serious work my biggest problem with it is that it almost always keeps getting in my way regardless if im pvping or mining
i support this product andor survice
pretty please with a leggy blonde covered in cherries on top
hell yes
orly that simplicity isnt allowing new players to play only adding headachesand please please dont argue about game you even havent playedsigned to op
supportedthe ui has some deficiencies id love to fix and this is one thing that i think would be good to outsource to players because the players are already doing it
thats the one part  the bold part   i dont like i havent a clue as to what the removed features are but knowing that there is a potentially stronger bacon out there while ratting  my only 00 experience    i could have my client open and my internet browser on another monitor easy enough to watch local there only thing i dont like is that some players could take fof ravens sit in the belt and alt tab and pay no attention
supportedbacon interacts  via the log server   with the game and automates a process the player should be doing but is to lazy to do
i think a bunch of people have said this here and its still a real gem to medo you really want to play without anything like evemon how about without something like eft i know that some people still add up power grid and stuff by hand but i know that if you had to do that thered be a programmer who would write something like each of those and on top of that ccp appears to truly endorse both of them bacon is a gray area because it opens a whole new can of worms partly because we know it could do much more but still people complaining about all thirdparty programs probably use at least one or two of them themselves besides what about spreadsheets should we ban spreadsheets too for being thirdparty applications tooeither all the people who complain about bacon are stupid and dont plan ahead or theyre all hypocrites because we already have must use thirdparty programs that effectively change the ui or at least provide functionality that the ui doesnt and if i were ccp never will because its actually better that way imo
fully support thiswould also be nice to see a bigger transport maybe something that can fit a few tractors and haul more than 1 jetcan worth of ore
listen to the thumbs one day they will be your overlords
cant remember if i supported this already or not
at least allow to train a skill from level 1 to lvl 5  for example   without having to connect to launch the next leveli train large energy turret lvl 3 and if i dont connect to launch another skill its followed by energy turret lvl 4 we would avoid to lose a lot of time   support

but the isk farmers can easily buy gtcs instead of spending real cash and by farming the isk in the game they essentially play for free on thousands upon thousands of accounts
universal methods of curbing crime what do you mean by that i did not realize eve had a universal crime fighting organizationon the average risk in empire is fairly low any way except for the zealots slamming there ships into others trying to get a kill mail or lootwhat you are essentially proposing is to basically kill all forms of risk in empire no one in their right mind or even a warped one will try anything in empire unless they are quitting anyway and looking to go out with a bang so to speak hey i dont like the idea of floating in a pod in empire while harvesting a roid or hauling my goodies to make some isk but this kind of thing pretty much all but kills any sense of what eve is so now where is the risk vs reward the carebear does not even have to think anymore just munch on a hoho watch cartoons and play the game on autopilot
i didnt mention a crime fighting force unless the x men are joining the gamehigh sec is risky for certain professions and it seems like there are new ways put into practice quite often to circumvent the veil of safety in high sec empire space my suggestion in no way changes the risk for pilots involved in high sec crime as far as the ship they are in is concerned all it does is further alienate them from high security empire controlled space things like this will add challenge to a profession that is quickly growing repetative and predictiblebut its just a suggestion
actually it will completely remove their possibility to be in high sec space making a already near risk free zone completely safe while still giving very high rewards
no insurance payout for being concorded obvious and simple it doesnt really need much more than that
exactly theres no problem with suiciding someone in empire the problem is that it can be profitable with silly cheap items
definitely not signed its so easy to avoid suicide ganking its not even funny so why should you expect ccp to bail you out of a situation where your too lazystupidgreedy to do anything about itjust because you want to be greedy and make maximum profit from missions and not work in a group doesnt mean you cant work together as individuals in a system and try to make a gank harder omg but i might lose a bit of my max isktime profit ratio cmon ffs its not rocket scienceno to insurance invalidation whole bags worms waiting to be opened therein fact no to everything that encourages ppl to be hisec isk machines that has no riskeve is a mmo one of those ms is for multiplayer i dont care how hard you worked for that pimp fit your running if your stupid enough to assume that concord will take care of you in an area where there is a tangible risk then great let me and my friends ride you like seabiscuit and in the process increase the average intelligence of the player base awesome im performing a service and making a profit at the same timethe question you have to ask is how hard is it to stop suicide ganks if the answer is that its to difficult within current mechanics then yes there is a problem and it needs fixing but when the answer is simple there is no justifiable reason to be here and believe me the answer is so so simple its incredible your all here asking to be bailed outas a side note its worth remembering theres a lot of mission runners in low sec who run the risk of ganking every time they undock and they are doing finein summary stop being lazy analyze the problem and solve it its doesnt need a nerf it just requires you think about it seriously
no insurance payouts for those killed by concord gets a mighty thumbs up from me
signedno payout to concord victimssuicide ganks for profit are fineits people who dont mind losing 20mil for a cool factiont2 ship killmail and some perverted fun  of hurting a real person   that bother me the most and those are too common right now
lol at all the carebear fgts
you dont need to cancel insurance or make kill rights tradeable that is just a bandaid on the issue keep in mind if you are going to suicide gank and you know youre not going to get insurance why insure it to begin withso the insurance isk sink is removed from gankers this is no good either although its a small isk sink its a sink none the less let them keep the insurance dont even worry about tradable kill rightswhat really needs to happen is the frequency in which someone could gankyou know someone could suicide gank 92 times in a day thats far too many potential suicides i would much rather see the outlaw timer last an hourthis also forces gankers to be more choosy when it comes to targets and being an outlaw for an hour drastically cuts down the amount of ganks they can perform but it still gives them the opportunity and motive to do itif they have the balls they can sit on a gate with global countdown and defend themselves from people attacking them a group of circle jerking remote shield repping ravens can tank gate guns so the can still do exactly what they want they just need to devote more effort to their causeif they are solo gankers they must be more selective on their targets so it works there too also when you consider what effort it would take to implement this for ccpchange the timer from 15 minutes to 60 minutes but make it so you only get 60 minutes if done in high sec low sec remove the agro timer completelyso id support removal of timer in low sec increase the timer in highsecthe reason id support removal of low sec timer is simply to make ganking in low sec more attractive vs high sec if you dont want a global counter for 60 minutes go camp a low sec gate
yes secure systems should be secureif suicide ganking are allowed then the gankers should be put in a 24 hour anyonecankillthem mode or something of the sort
why not just take the sp in learning skills atm and let you reassign it from the web to new skills then give everyone 79 for all attributes i have learning trained to 9 atm most people train tehm to at leas 7 or 8 the 10 people would suddenly get 5m sp to throw into anything else they wanted anyway alternatively you could have an extra 2  10 skill points from the learning pool tick off every second in addition to your current learning until the sp from the pool was depleted in game this will at least make people log in to change skills still without instantly giving them bs v without in game training time then do the same with the attribute bumpthe difference is players can grief and scam other players ccp should not as there is no way to defend against them greifing you  ignoring lag issue   edit also if you did the second idea with the newbie builds that come with learning skills they could learn those first skills much much faster
regarging the issue about dont steal from experienced players without compensation dont remove learning skills give new characters the learning skills  at 44   right away nothing taken away from the vets only added to the rookiesnot supporting this idea im ambivalent about the learning skills getting them to 4 takes less than a week and you can fly a frig easily until then learning the game then you earn isk get the advanced skills and train them to 3 which is also ok my main problem with learning skills is not that theyre such a big problem but rather that they dont actually add anything to the game except wait time which is a bit problematicactually i do think that the whole attribute thing needs a revampremove starting attribute differences yes no more uberachura and lolwhateverevery race starts with all attributes at 8 after that only learning skills  invested time   and implants  risked isk   affect the attributesbloodline and ancestry affect your starting learning skills say two learning skills start out at 4 two more at 3 remaining one at 2 this would mean that a new player can dive into their preferred area right away and just need a few days to bring up the remaining areas to 4 if you want to broaden their horizon too advanced learning skills can be trained up when isk allows retaining the timeisk now vs timeisk later choice  i wouldnt mind just starting out at 12 or so and not having advanced learning skills but as said above im ambivalent about that  
dont support as a fairly new player myself  just over three months   i find nothing wrong with them if people are unable to decide by themselves whether learning skills are or are not a good investment for their plans then why on earth are they playing a game that is all about various risks and costs versus rewards
i definitely support thisabolish learning skills give everyone 10 to all stats reimburse the skillpoints from people who trained the learning skills
i agree that something needs to be done about local channel how about a delay on appearing in local say 10 seconds and also cloaked ships dont appear on local unless the pilot speaks that would allow stealth ships to enter the system and cloak without detection they would then need to stay close to entry point until they know where they are going then de cloak to warp to wherever they are going thereby becoming visible and in so giving at least a short warning to everyone in system that you are therea cloaked ship should be undetectable ie you shouldnt know it is there with you appearing in local everyone knows your there however possibly some sort of advanced scanner could be implemented that can detect cloaked ships maybe just for recons or something since they are supposed to be intel gathering shipsbut anyway everyone just appearing in local channel is something i believe should change in some way

the only person i want removed from local is myself on my own screen yes i know i am in the system i keep mistaking myself for a neutral and going on wild goose chases to hunt it down

not supported the proposed changes to local give hunters more advantage and the hunted less local performing as an intelligence gathering tool is a perfectly valid game mechanic mission runners miners etc have plenty to do without having to worry about constantly scanning for hostiles even with things as they are ive seen vagas and other fast ships enter a local system in 00 warp to miners pop the miners and leave the system before the miner can move or defending combat vessels can respond eliminating the early warning local can give would make this situation absurdlook at local as a constantly running scanner everyone has and everyone benefits fromregardswindjammer

posting in support of improved account security

id support account security like this but really the problem stems from windows as an operating system and peoples general lack of understanding of internet security all it takes is a visit to one website that drops a keylogger through any number of explorers security holes  even if you use firefox   and your machine gets owned the statistics are pretty sick something on the order of 90 of windows pcs are owned

its destructible just take it off them exactly the same effect as destroying itim seeing alot of star fraction pilots posting about how anything should be destructible but seeing very little else do you actually have anything to add to the debate as to why destruction is superior to denial for the game or are you just posting because youre told tosad when the discussion can be bombarded  20 of the posts in this topic are from sf members and a fair chunk from noob corps alts including this char   with supportive opinion and it actually look to be the dominant opinion despite the actual low level of real discussion and debate goin on highlights how many people really give a toss about what the csm is trying to do though thats something for another issue
goumindong speaks for most goons you allow destructible outposts and we will try and  everyone just long enough to blow up there systems we are already huge and have sold off 1 entire region when we backed off from bob due to just getting sick of it we would have blown up every outpost on our way out that we could have also we would do the same to smash we are there for better kills and because fighting bob was a grind nightmare on morale geminate will get the giant reset buttan if this goes through smaller alliances would be completely screwed if we dont want their space now we leave it alone give goons the chance to grief a permanent 20b isk asset and it will be gone jihadswarm proves goons grief in gross proportion to the isk they can game from it already
this is a stupid idea and your reasons for implementing it are flawed some people have been complaining about there being too many 00 outposts in january 2006 but you cant dispute that more 00 conflict has been good for eve in general your claim that there needs to be a cost to losing a territory war is pretty horrible considering that surely losing your territory is enough of a cost eve is supposed to be a sandbox game where the players determine the consequences for actions and here you are asking in various ways for in built consequences to be implemented  this covers your wardec ideas as well as this and other ideas  
since youre going to be bringing this up in csm whether we support it or not can we at least get some of the other reps opinions itt
i dont support this idea in its current form done properly it might have merit but letting people just run around blowing up outposts is a sure way to let the big alliances grief the crap out of the little ones several goons have already admitted theyll do it if this gets implemented there definitely needs to be more debate and less yesno on this issue before it goes infrom my perspective destroying an outpost should be nearly impossible alexander noir flew a mothership into a station and didnt even knock it offline though he did mess it up real bad and what is an outpost but a station built by players after all destroying an outpost also denies the players of that alliance all the assets they had stored there without proper provisions or does it how long does an outpost wreck remain for forever like titan wrecks for a limited time how much firepower does it take to destroy an outpost something that expensive should require a similarly expensive fleet to bring down at all surely wouldnt requiring it to take a lot of damage ensure that its merely going to be used by the massive alliances that have the capital fleets to do it but if it takes too little damage wont you get people running around in subcapitals doing it for fun what effect does a destroyed outpost have on deploying another outpost what conditions determine when an outpost can be attacked how is an outpost going to defend itself and most importantly how is this good for the gamei want to see answers to these questions before i see any proposal this big get forced down ccps throat by an overzealous csm demagogue its also worth noting that the 00 space closest to star fractions traditional base of operations has one of the highest concentrations of outposts in the game
i fully support the idea of destructible outposts eve lives of the fact that you can lose everything indestructible player made outposts are just not in the spirit of the gamethe life in 00 became a whole lot easier by all the outposts right around the corner offering all the infrastructure you will ever need which makes it a lot easier for alliances to hold vast amounts of spacesafe hangars where the stored equipment might be inaccessible at a point but it is not destroyed or looted by the enemy which would happen if it is stored at a pos another issue is the easier way to split jumpclones over a larger area of space for tactical purposes
how can you say no to bigger explosions 
c
i agree outposts should be destructible as they are an obvious target in a war or a hit and run raid
i think you need to discount the goons admitting theyd use this functionality to grief to be honest i honestly dont think there is any such thing as griefplay in 00  its an open pvp area and anybody doing anything in 00 is actively inviting other players to oppose them and blow up their stuff putting down an outpost is no different from flying about in a pimped mothership  its inviting attack and destruction should be allowed on principle seriously goon posters complaining that destructible outposts would make griefing too easy who buys that argument really if destructible outposts really would be a griefers paradise then youd see the goons dancing in the streets in support the reality is that destructible outposts will hurt the large 00 powers a lot because they will have to take each and every territorial challenge to their vast holdings with the utmost seriousness they wont have the option  they have today   of simply ignoring certain attacks on the grounds they can always take back the outposts later on when they can clear time on the schedules real significance to threat means the large alliances will have to make hard choices on resource and military allocation and hard choices are currently completely lacking from territorial empire building in 00the opposition from the goonposters on this issue is not on the grounds of some woollyevecentric anti grief agenda its because they are worried the status quo  where they are amongst the ascendant   will change to their detriment in an environment where they could face multiple territorial challenges simultaneously that resolve in significant loss of fixed holdings
get rid of those blinds jade  goons are rightif outposts become fully destructible nobody will be able to set them up unless they are sure they can defend them or the expense is not much for themthis means only large alliancesscorched space tactics goons mentioned are extremenly effective against smaller entities where the loss is felt much more the larger alliance either abandons the space or rebuilds as they have resources for that one outpost out of 20 lost is not much but one out of 34 is a serious setback
00 handholding is bad i see no problem with outpost owners losing it all i am sure ccp can figure something out and i definately want them to take a serious look at it i fail to see how goonswarm or any other can grief anyone in eve using legal gamemechanics
the concern is the escalating barrier to entry into 00 nobody is saying that it should never happen just that the reasoning and proposed implementation is flawednew 00 alliance a puts up its first 2 outposts a refinery and faction outpost they control 2 constellations and in time could become a significant force to pew pew withagainst large alliance bob or swarm comes in and deploys cap and super cap fleet for a week takes sov sets outpost to blow up and leaves after a couple times only 2 or 3 major alliances with massive power will be left because smaller alliances just cant stand up to a cap blobit is true i am a horrible goon i dont grief or scam they only keep me around cause of the months i took training ark bis scrap to v and get the h60 implant thanks jade now i feel even more terrible about myself
you have an existing actual megaalliance with many many players tell you that they will do this if this gets implemented and you want to discount it everything else in this thread and many of the other issues and proposals are just theorycrafting calculations of what might happen and how the playerbase might react and maybe the predictions are right maybe theyre wrong who knows we can all discount and argue and reason and provide counterarguments as long as its just theorycraftingbut when an actual group of players tells you this is what well do youre gonna discard that wtfno i do not want the goddamn goons to burn my outposts to the ground mr representative of the community please make sure it doesnt ing happen
well since jade has chosen not to address my point that it has yet to be proven that the riskreward of 00 is out of balance  because it isnt imho   lets assume the community agrees that everything player built should be explodeable  which while a totally valid opinion also has not been proven to be held by a majority of the community see highsec ganking threads   what happens to npc stations in 00 assuming they stay indestructible they provide a safe base for the defender also not all 00 space has npc stations and some have more than others how do you propose to level the playing field for strategic value of npc stations
everything buildable should be destructible i had thought they were until nowthis idea is worthy of more discussion
every time a station system is being attacked wed swarm to protect it no matter what look at gq2 the second they started dropping towers there we where there sieging them you dont ever ignore an attack on a system station youre going to want it back theres no reason to give them a footholdthis would only be used in areas like geminate where we really didnt want it and would only really keep the stations if they made a sov4 cons that we could sell or something  or it was a system where we knew we where going to lose it like when qy6 was being sieged at the end of the delve offensive  
discussion yes the current proposed idea has huge wholes in it i would not support the thread as is but would give a thumbs up to a more generalized we need to look at way that this can happen thread
this is from the conclusion of the op and this is what i support discussing further
it is not griefing if jade constantine blow up my spaceship it is not griefing when bob doomsdays our fleet and it is not griefing when an outpost get captured how can the destruction of any asset in a free fire pvp zone be regarded in any shape way or form as griefing
i agree with destructable outposts in principle the implimentation would have to be considered very carefullynothing players build should be invulnerable at the moment outposts are forever even if their owners are not and this is wrong
yep because what they say will happen is not what will happenyep just i like discard most boasts made by 00 entities on caod actually csm is for discussing gameplay and eve ooc issues not getting bent out of shape by nonsense bravado from 00 alliance people sorry its not my job to make your 00 holdings invulnerable dont fly what you cant afford to lose dont build what you cant afford to see burned to the ground thats eve
yesccp remove  revise the stacking penalties especially on short range variantschange damage modifiers to balanceinvestigate adding other effects to t2 ammo instead of damage
i almost never use t2 ammoand i do like my share of sniper shipstech1faction ammo benefits outweigh the penalties for t2 ammo
i agree t2 ammo needs to be reviewed and redone id like to see microwarp drive propelled missiles as the t2 variant these missiles would scream across space but only fly for a couple of seconds  limited capacitor power in a missile   this alone isnt a solution but it would provide a marked difference between the missile tiers and more ideas are welcome

aggro time is to short as your posting is to goodyou know a lot of people want to make it completely safe in highsec but you want to make it easier for people to get killed therefore you must be a goon alt
not the perfect numbers in my eyes but certainly an idea with legs not only will it break the dockundock cycle but it works on an rpbackstory level the more dangerous a ship especially with war breaking out   the more cautious the sation owners are about letting it dock or perhaps a scalestacknerf first dockundockengage cycle  30 seconds next  1min next 2min and so on reduces the effectiveness of the tactic without punishing people who are genuinely fleeing a superior force with no intention of reengaging even if neither of these ideas come to fruition its something that needs to be looked at npcs should not offer such effective tactical support to pvpers
yes pleasealso make remote repping an aggroed ship start an aggro timer as well
issue i trained caldari industrial v before i realized they had terrible haulers
my dear fellow i appreciate that you are trying to troll me but neverthelessi trained caldari industrial 5 around 2 and a half years ago this was a time when interdictors heavy interdictors and medium and large bubbles didnt exist there were also no ships with a warp disruptor range bonus at the time therefore the odds of being in a bubble on jump in were significantly lower since you needed a lot of small bubbles to cover that 12km jump in sphere and it was possible to spot one on your exit vector with the system scanner tactical bookmarking such that you didnt use the obvious insta vectors meant that you could quite reasonably avoid trouble it was therefore much less relevant that a ship had trouble fitting a microwarp drive and therefore the crane and its bigger brother the bustard were really quite acceptable as t2 haulers goits telling that since then these ships have remained unchanged and the gameplay has evolved which has lead to the disparity between this one and its fellows hence this post
james good buddy i like you but theres a few too many commas in there
solution make them less terrible haulers supported
since when are crane pilots the only blockade runners allowed to use implants if a crane pilot has to use a fitting mod implant instead of an agility implant that the other blockade runner is using its still a 100 valid issue
i use station warehouses pretty frequently and its a real drag when ive forgotten what i had put in it and have to fly to that station to look  
exactly what i am missing it is rather a joke that you have to refer to third party programmes to achieve that goal and i am rather convinced that it should be possible to implement this without having to reduce eves speed however if there is truly a good reason that i as a person not very versed in programming cant spot and would lead to eve lagging more than before i too would rather let it be undone
would be nice but tbh just let us make folderstabs in our items hangar then have it be an instation view only so its no different when searched  simple xml could organize all items while theyre all in the same list  type of situation  approved anyway
agreed unless you stick to one station religiously theyre pretty useless for most people at the mo

way to go folks you just locked your capitals out of your own systems so how are you suppose to get your capitals back into your jammed station system drop the cyno jammer everytime someone needs to get in to the systema jump bridge is just that a jump bridge jump gates do not allow it because the ships are to big to fit through the gate since jump bridges open a cyno field in open space they fituntil there is a way to get friendly capitals back into their cyno jammed systems without dropping jammers everytime at 30 minutes a pop dont change anything

not apporved advantage should always go to a defender strategically it always has in warfare defenders have dug in fortified their position set down roots invested resources in time and material to make what they hold profitable and defensiblethe high number of goons supporting this issue should speak for itself regarding the style of play the op hopes to support goons defeat by using larger numbers of pilots for the most part they hold few systems compared to their size they prefer to rip up others rather than take systems to hold and develope for themselves weakening the defensive capabilities of those they attack would be nice for them also of course theyve been instructed to support this issuethe ops suggestion would have made the bobgoon war a little easier for the goons huh
i think it would be nice to have a quick sale button on all auctions that you setup so you can accept the highest bid at anytime you want i set a ton of contracts with my characters and really hate it when the high bidder is nearly at the buyout and it sits for another 4 days with nothing happening i would love the option of accepting the high bid and not needing to wait the entire length of the auction i think this would cause people to take buyouts more and it would also force people to keep the high bid instead of just waiting till the last minute and sniping the auction at the last minute could someone with the csm please comment on this and maybe pass this along to the devs thanks
this seems like a good idea to me especially in a system where your number of auctions is limited it would be handy to be able to free up spots when a bid gets high after all i know after posting an auction i have sometimes rethought how much i should have set the buyout for and this effectively allows you a limited degree of freedom in that regard
look at the way ebay does auctions why can i not give a maximum bid amount at the beginning why not a buy out or as arcadian suggests let the seller take a bid amount early selling auctions etc are in many ways the heart of the economy of eve and should be given serious consideration and developement time

why not give the titan dd an explosion radius like a gigantic friggin torpedo this hurts capitals more so at some point the titans stop the dd or blow themselves up seems like this would be the best and easiest solution plus after the enemy does 2 or 3 stacked dds you can warp in your cloaked titan from off grid to finish popping them would make 1 titan after the enemy uses several multiple titans very effective stillthere is also a thread on proportional titan dd damage where i suggest it just does like 35 times the base value of the structure armor and shield hp of the ship so high resists and extenders are still great but capitals and super caps become threatened by overusing dd fix the problem by giving the titan dd a boost versus itself instead of a nerf d

the question is this under what circumstances hould the players be able to force an issue into csm discussions and how will theese circumstances be be deturminedfirst the circumstances a council was chosen bassed on player vote only when the council is not doing the job of representing the players should they be able to force an issue that the council has no interest in second how do we know we are in this situationthe 5 threshold represents an emergency situation where the council is not doing their job while i do not nessesarily agree that the 5 threshold is the correct way to deal with this i deffinitly do not think that it should be reduced or replaced with a hard threshold of 1000  as cosmo suggests   which would at present be a lowering of the threshold in fact i do not think that a threshold is the correct way to deal with this issue a big part of this issue relys on how much the csm can realisticly address succusfully have no illusions any one csm term cannot deal with all of the issues or even all of the important issues a benifit of having the council is to be able to focus refine and prioritise issues to bring to ccpi propose to do away with a threshold altogether let the council see what issues are supported by players and bring the ones they prioritise that is the job we elected them to do after all also to allocate time for the top 2 or 3 supported issues during a term however much support they have be it 2 50 or 1100 accounts satis tyrps this has been a mindpost parden the spalling
way too harsh indeed no thread will reach that  well maybe except the etc one     
this one simple change could make a huge difference in game full support from me

yep
definate yes to support the bounty hunter profession

i support this topic
you must not have read the economic reports on this topic the caps are not on the price of end goods but the price of minerals the most common limiter for tritanium used to be a shuttle which capped at 36 isk the reason there was a cap is you could buy shuttles and reprocess them into trit the amount of trit you got back you could then sell on the market since the prices of shuttles is static this puts an artificial cap on the price of trit because why would you pay more when you can buy shuttles in unlimited numbers and reprocess them rather than paying the higher pricerecent shuttles were removed from being sold by npcs removing that particular item as a cap but since people have discovered many other items which you can do the same thingthe idea i am suggesting would eliminate the static price of materials and end goods thus making the market more subjective to local  regional   supply and demand
my first problem with this is a module sold by npcs gets undervalued in 1 region say somewhere like molden heath or khanid with large low sec areas the reason for this is simple most people with very large isk amounts dont want to risk a freighter through multiple low sec gates for cheaper trit and sell low in the low sec systemsnow you can get a freighter and bring the items from the high sec systems in the region with artificially reduced trit prices and dump loads and loads into a refinery and get even more tweaked caps since you would have the price of trit low there would be permanent abuse in these systems furthermore it opens the potential in 00 pirate sov for mins to be purposely lowered on an alliance level to permanently keep these items at less than 1 isktrit ratio in this system simply tell everyone to buy the item and reprocess and you have total npc supplied minerals this works for all npc items and thus all minerals that can be gotten from npc itemsi like the idea in theory but this implementation is highly susceptible to abuse
i support removal of pricecapsbut i think all but civilian modules shouldnt be refinable   should be player built so effectively your otherwise nicely laid out suggestion is kinda a waste of time in that perspectiveso this has my support
a realistic economic system say it aint socan we also do away with static prices on anything and everything npc buysell orders which run outexpire thereby reinforcing supply and demand hauler spawns in empire factional warfare for instance could do a lot of things to prices of goods or materials but i doubt anyone up at ccp makes those sorts of connections maybe they should hire an economistedit fyi you can support your own thread
not only do i read the econblogs and qens i actually get excited about them god help me i find this stuff fascinating and i watch it as closely as i can the reason i mentioned endgood prices ie ships   is that the insurance system as it stands now overinsures ships based on artificial valuations trit2 pyer8 mex32 iso128 nocx512 zyd2048 mega8192 morph32768   to the point where it creates a price floor on minerals as a group right now mineral markets are only about 5 above that floor and thats one of the biggest reasons i proposed an idea of how to fix insurance a while back not only does it artificially distort the market it also makes losing a ship way too cheap leading to a large part of the suicide gank market we have today however my point was that aside from the insurance problem that ive already seen a lot of proposed fixes to there arent really a lot of price caps out there that im aware of shuttles werent a cap they just looked like they had the possibility to become one and so they were removed preemptively that and because ccp doesnt want npcs and pcs selling the same goods on market   if more exist then im all for their removal  artificial distortions of the market are bad ill agree with you on that im just not sure where those distortions are at the moment care to enlighten me
it always bugged me that there wasnt really a benefit of fitting the larger guns sizes most of the dps advantage is lost in the falloff also the ability to overheat webs and mwds has made fighting in falloff harder and harder
any honest statistical treatment of this topic is next to impossible without belching out a staggering amount of data not only would one have to quantify the relative value of disparate strengths and weaknesses such as tracking vs optimal vs falloff vs ammo damage vs cap usage etc you would have to wrap all that up into the larger set of variables that is the ships themselves thats why these arguments go all wonky that being said im not even going to attempt to spew a bunch of numbers im just going to state the issue as i see itthere is a problem with autocannos and not just large ones but it is hard to address that issue without rethinking minmatar ships altogether the problem is you have to throw ship bonuses rigs andor damage mods at them to make them effective on top of that you generally have to use barrage no other weapon system requires so much extra help to simply function viablythey simply were designed to compete in a very different iteration of eve and too much has to now be scarified to them to make them work well this stretches well into minmatar ship designalso gaurm you are partially correct the typhoon and maelstrom do function one works because it does not employ autocannos as a primary weapon system and the other function because it generally devotes 14 slots to making them work  usually 8 high 3 low and 3 rig   this should indicate there is a fundamental flaw with autocannos and that ships have to be engineered to overcome that inherent weakness
ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha seriously maybe you should look at pulse lasersscorch is a requirement as well as rigs and damage bonuses and cap bonuses and or blasters which in the current situations almost never are valuable no matter what training you haveand large pulse lasers must suck because the apoc has to dedicate 20 slots to make them good
goum im not going to fence with you partially because that exactly what you want regardless of the topic the opponent or the validity of your proposition partially because i think you have a better understand of the game than some people are willing to admit primarily though because this is not a thread about pulse lasers or blaster i have made no arguments as to the viability of other weapon systems you are welcome to start posts about how they are overpowered underpowered or just right till your hearts contentas i stated before it is not easy to compare weapon systems based on raw data as number of relevant and situational variables are staggeringbtw i was not trying to insult you i was agreeing with you to a certain extent the typhoon and the maelstrom are function ships i would propose however that the typhoon is not an ac boat if one fits the ship with three heavy weapon systems  800mm iis siege iis and ogre iis   acs will produce the least amount of damage by a significant amount if you were to add damage mods you would gain the most benefit by adding bcus this hardly qualifies the typhoon as an ac boat
everything can only be valued relatively if you are going to say something is hard to train for or needs more work to be viable then that must mean its hard to train for compared to the alternatives and it needs more work to be as viable as all the othersand its just not true they arent really any harder to train for than anything else blasters for lowsec small gang work maybe but not lasers or a complete missile setits irrelevant if it performs with themand it does and the maelstrom is an ac boat and performs well with themthere are some problems with acs regarding things that can be done to make them more new character friendly falloff bonus on the long range tech 1 ammo   and there are things that can be done to make the tech 2 ammo a bit more reasonable nix the optimal penalty on hail   but there is no fundamental problem with auto cannons that need fixing just a  small   fundamental problem with the tempest
herschel yamamoto care to link a killboard where we can see what kind of experience you have with pvp youre clearly nothing more than a clueless eft warrior your tempest and typhoon fits are hilarious if you think the tempest is a beast thats just preciousgoum par for the course as far as you are concerned same stupid  over and over i dont know why marn wastes his time arguing with you because nothing has ever made the slightest dent in that thick head of yourslarge projectiles need to be looked at
minmatar bs with autocannons simply cannot compete with other ships if they could then you would see a lot more autopests in gangs you dont the maelstrom was not designed for autocannons it is a fleet artillery ship that makes its active tank even more of a crime for a true gunships this ship has some ordinary features like its lack of agility and speedfor those that say an 8 differential in speed is significant for the pest try running away from a blasterthron in a pest see how long you last large autocannons need loving i believe in the form of a tracking boost with ammo tweakingthe pest needs an agility and speed boost it tanks like a wet blanket compared to its peers so give it the ability to run away
if you read the information regarding how the csm works and topics for discussion you will see clearly the following1 all topics have to be presented here in this forum for a period of 7 days before being able to be discussedvoted on by the csm2 each player is only allowed to present one issue here 60 issues are being presented together i see no mention of a csm member being exempt from this one topic limit they can support as many issues as they like however each issue on the pdf and start of this thread needs to be proposed on the thread by a different player discussed for 7 days etcthe purpose of seperating them all out is clearly there are some issues that are not in the interests of the industralist player having them all voted on together just doesnt make sense and is not what the csm council was designed to dotake carearithron
all of those things are parts of one issue science and industry presenting just one tiny part would be useless and while fixing one thing wouldnt hurt it wouldnt do what lvv is trying to dosupport
i support most of the items listed in the pdf

i agree w what inanna said however i am not neutral im against this proposal for the exact same reasons that inanna is neutral for it in my opinion if the elected chair can not perform hisher duties then the chair position should follow the order of popular vote from the pod pilots neither the csm nor ccp should ever be able to call for a vote that changes who holds any csm position without letting the pod pilots vote making this change would essentially destroy what ccp is trying to createthe suggestions outlined by grismar would be an effective way of selecting new chair however i stand by the belief that the vote should not be internal but presented to the general community
no i think our votes should mean something the council doesnt need more power
so you dont think the council should effectively be able to elect who they want to plan meetings and moderate discussioni mean if someone does get elected for chair but this individual doesnt have the time nor will to do this job surely he should be able to resign and have a vote put up to replace himi think this is a sensible idea
thats not exactly what jade said but i can answer that question for you too if youre not able to run for csm dont run for csm its a large responsibility and some people have jobs or school or a family i can understand that if you cant handle being a csm then dont run you can still vote as a public member and push stuff through the forums but if you dont have the time nor will to do this job then quit and let the person with the secondmost votes lead the councilanyway since you didnt read it the first time let me copypaste for youbasically if enough people felt strongly enough about your campaign to vote for you the most then you deserve to be the chairman i do not feel that the council should have the power to vote internally for that seat
you arent quite getting the point im making i fully agree with you that you shouldnt run if you dont have time but some people do run because of a free trip to icelandalso i read jades post and i have discussed this matter with him several times im just adding my perspective to it so stop assuming i didnt read the thread because i dont make the same points as jadebut let me ask you do you think that the person with the most votes will always want or is able to moderate and plan meetings
yeah i get that feeling toothat is entirely the wrong reason to run  are you naming any names   but i understand what youre saying i dont believe that people who garner enough votes are those types of people though i believe the people who made the top 9 votes put a lot of effort into their campaigns and into the game as welli only said that because you didnt respond to what i said you were talking about something completely different so i wanted to make sure we were on the same pagei apologize if i offended youthe person with the most votes is the person that the people feel is most capable for the position that is what i am saying what this thread is suggesting is that the people cede that power to the council that is what i am against anyone who applies for csm regardless of vote count should want or be able to read the csm charter and figure out what the roles of the council are should they be appointedexample one if you have nine people who think they should each be chairman you run into problemsexample two there are a lot of people who are disappointed or upset or angry that members from goonfleet are appointed csm membership positions they could force the csm to do lots of things most of their constituents dont agree with and i dont believe it is in our best interests to allow the council to have more power than they already have
not at all the person with the most votes is the person whom most people wanted on the councilwanting someone to be on the council is not the same as wanting someone to be the chairit certainly says nothing about how willing or capable that person would be for the chair position
motion supportedthats a great candidate for the first vote and validates the chairperson in the csm councils eyesalso instills some faith in me that csm may make a difference for the better
agreed i never voted for the chair when i cast my vote i only voted for the person that best represented my views on eve
yes you did didnt either of you read the rules before you voted guess not huh this isnt a usstyle system of voting so i guess im not surprised most of you arent familiar with it
i cant say i share this feeling as a voter i have little idea who will come first nor can i know if the first person past the post will make the best chair although it makes sense to have a temporary chairperson to get business underway it is common practice for the board to vote in senior board members based on their abilityi still stand by the fact i voted for the person who best represented my outlook on eve anyone else feel this wayare you a mind reader1   indeed before i voted i read some of the council of stellar management document  i admit to speed reading the waffle to get to the important bits   including this section from page 9 which those who read the rules are familiar withthe council structureby default the representative with the highest vote tally is awarded with the responsibilities of chairman for the csm within three days of the general election the representatives must hold an internal vote to determine a vicechairman secretary and vicesecretary failure to hold this vote or if the vote is inconclusive awards UFFFDgrantingUFFFD authority to the chairman who may then appoint council members to the other positions as he or she sees fit if the chairman decides to step down or rescind his responsibility during this time for any reason a vote must be held among representatives to replace himapart from an attempt started by jades post circa 220508

id like to see a expansion focusing on the noncombat side of eve as the next one after ambulation all the fixes and good ideas about science industry and mining that are around but never got implemented due to time constraints would be part of that expansion this would also include more options specifically for 00 and lowsec of course this shouldnt be a pure carebear expansionalso it would be great to get the ambulatory corpses out into space those poor fellas that are so afraid of freezing stiff that they never undock but instead use eve as a glorified chat client after ambulation hitsupport the industry
absolutelymy wish list for an industrybased expansionadditional ore types to impede macrominersunnamed t1 loot removed from missionsmore longterm industrial goals that dont involve 00better economy of scale in manufacturing and inventionremoval of all npc sell orders for t1 modulesexploration missionsbridge between haulers and freighters
i would personally enjoy if absolutely everything in the game were player made or have the option to make itfrom plutonium consumer electronics and small arms up to blueprints and reactions and yes balance the fee to create these so they would be on par with current npc sale orders perhaps a bit cheaperif you have the raw resources and the infrastructure it should be possible to be build everything on your ownand other such industrial expansions would be nice too chribba mentioned a capital mining laser
because its the best sniper
so can someone show me a real solo kill by a falcon against anything that might be anything than a afk floating brickrapierssolo kills all of the time arazus they suck but they do get solo kills and the amamar one what ever it is can get solo kills the rook as far as dps sucks compared to any of the three other races of combat and force recon so it looks like it has a role and the only time you can actually use the damn thing is for a gang the other three can work independently or in a gang the falconrook can not
all the recons should be able to kill anything up to cruisers anything bigger then that and you will need a cursepilgrim  ofc it depends a lot on shiptype and how the ship is setup but im thinking in general  i dont think the dps is relevant for any of the force recons if you want a cruiser that deals dps you go with a combat recon or hac the reason you choose a force recon is because of its cov ops cloak and ew bonus the force recons is support ships and i dont think they should be balanced based on their solo performance maybe the rook could use a dps buff but that is another discussion
its not quite that straightforward caldari ewar boats are like they are  paper thin   due to the requirements of fitting sdas in the lowslots to get most out of your jammers or at least that was the design intent when they were introduced other recons have plenty of low and rigslots available for armor or speed tank nanorapiers or nanocurses are not that uncommon at all otoh rest of the recons are actually multirole ships  or can be fitted that way pretty easily   rrrapier is heavily armortanked as is rrarazu including plates trimarks and hardeners that does not limit their ewcapablities however  in falcons case it doesin a sense bringing a falcon in line with rest of the recons wont really work their abilities are very different and comparing them to each other isnt really fair if falcon had similar capabilities to shut down ships as an arazu itd be the underdog already the falcon would have to use all its lowslots to achieve the same effect  and rigslots as well in the case of 200km falcon   due to the need of fitting sdas without sdas im pretty sure the falcons would be pretty much in line with rest of the recons in terms of ewar ability  but with crappier bonuses to achieve what its supposed to do itd again be just another caldari cruiser nobody flies because of its lack of speed and damage and removing sdas entirely just wont work at all as they were introduced for a reasonhowever in a way i feel that we perhaps agree on more issues than we disagree on we both agree that there is room for improvement but its a matter of perspective whether that means gimping the falcon or introducing new more focused ew ships  this means changing the rest of the recons to focus purely on ew instead of giving them say damage bonuses  
so you want to nerf a ship because of your lack of preparation all you need is a covert ops scout  which you should have anyway   and a ship that stays behind and waits for the falcon to decloak a sniper bs is idealfalcons have too few low slots to cover more ships than 23 anyway reliable and also cover 200km ranges you either loose jammers jamming power or range andor sig res  or versatility if you use racial jammers  if he cloaks he will loose overview of who is jammed and who not and also cycle time and relock time if he warps out you have even more time to breatheit just takes preparation and some imagination your backup can always join the fight when no falcon shows up in reasonable time and make a nasty surprise for the opposing gangand a falcon with bookmarks in system deservers his superiority because he prepared for the fight and you didnt
i read through the thread and kept spotting people giving idiotic opinions and moving on to see if anyone responded or i shouldi have now reached the end of the thread but i have read so many ridiculous comments that i dont feel up to the task of responding at least half the people in this thread  on both sides of the argument   should go pvp a bit before they voice their opinions on the forumsregarding the topic when usedby gatecampers from range falcons are overpowered but this is not that unusual in the time honoured caldari tradition of useless solo and uber in a small gang nad sort of useful in a fleet 90 of caldari ships are like thatthey might seem a bit imba on gates with multiple sniper bms but if sniper fleets were less rare these days they would pop a lot morei personally would like all ecm removed from eve but my reason is simply i dont like i am not claimign there is a fairness related reason
based on the four force recons each one receives combat bonuses the falcon does not the pilgrim arazu and the rapier can hit dps above 220 and as high as 300 the falcon might might hit 110 if you compromise the falcons ewar capability i am trying show the balance of a player able to be effective in gang and solo the falcon is left out it is essentially pigeon holed as a support vehicle and thats about it the only defense the falcon has is the ewar unlike its counter parts it can not tank with out gimping itself it does not have drones it does not receive combat bonuses it aligns and travels slower than any of the four it can not give point or web without committing suicide so basically the falcon is a one trick pony the others can find uncompromised success in and out of gang
so in my small man gang  23 people   i should have cov ops proberscout and a sniper bs and what should my last ship be that we can actually engage some targets a titani agree that the falcon is limited in what roles it can embrace however its role is extremely powerful and fight changing compared to the other force recons additionally its still broken in small gang environmentsseriosuly adding stacking penalties and possibly removing offrace jam strength on racial jammers isnt going to weaken the falcon very much at all except in small gang environments where its targets also have eccm thats perfect balance it where its overpowered and leave it alone where it isntif the jam targets dont bring eccm theyre still sol one racial jammer has a 86 chance to jam my geddon if it isnt eccmd even with stacking penalties youre still going to perma jam a bs that doesnt bring eccm it will just be that now if a small gang has eccm one falcon wont still be able to perma jam everyone just because there are only 23 total targetshurray balance
noso if the falcon had 2 of its bonuses changed to 20 missile dmg and 5 shield res per lvl and a dronebay you would be happyin case you havent read the whole thread im discussing the scenario where 200km falcons is used as ecm cover for small gangs in low sec
strongly disagree with the opfalcons are just fine
theres no need for territory holding to be a job in the sense of a massive time sink but an entity that claims to own space should have a player ship presence in that space to maintain that claim if the population of supposedly held space is more often enemy than ally that should be reflected in the sovereignty claim
what sort of impact will this have on coalition forces that often patrol each others space or small alliances patrolling the space of a bigger partner theyre allied with
maybe a new sov system could include a way for mercenary and coalition alliances to act on behalf of the territoryholding entity
i have been ratting in a 097 system using a myrmi recently no probs so not sure if it really needs a boost though i always felt they should have given it 100 m3 drone bw and one less turret so yes
the myrmidon is perfectly fine as it is though i mise the days of its five heavy drones it was nerfed for a reason
because it was to easy to dismantlethe 5heavy myrm is so easy to make useless target its drones and pop them 1by1 and you have 1 dead myrm
brutix works for gun boat if you balanced the myrm around its heavy drones again i dont see a problem maybe 1 less total high slot and 23 turrets just saying it might be useful to look into drones have the inherent weakness versus ship turrets of being individually targettableedit forgot to vote
the primary reason the myrmidon was nerfed was because people said it had too high a dps with a full flight of heavies deployed most myrmidons used ogres for heavy drones you ever see how slow those things are just about anything in the game can out run them if theres any distance to the target they get the crud shot out of them on the way there75 m3 bandwidth requires you deploy a mixture of drone sizes to fully utilize it this creates a problem in timing larger drones trailing behind in both deployment and retrievalregardswindjammer
i dont think myrm need changes but if yes id prefer 1520 m3 bigger dronebay and 510 additional mbits bandwidth for 23 less turretsyoure going to drop one turret anyway for dla and another one typically going to repper  hull repper not armor  3 turret hardpoints going to be serious kick in the way to be real drone boat but no changes for slots layout or it will be another drake thanks we have enough mindless drakes farming eve in all aspects
the myrms in question used blasters and as such were closerange ships for gatecamping etc range was hardly an issue and its hard to outrun the ogres when webbed myrm needed a nerf but perhaps they should have removed some turrets instead so it stayed a droneboat
agree
ingame voting would be great butugh the buy our magazine popups are bad enough but its not as if anybody actually reads those you really think people would pay attention to a voting one
accidental alt post real post below
i am fundamentally against forced voting even including an abstanence optioni would however support increaced visibility satis tyrps mindpost
im not sure encouraging the uninformed to vote is a good plan just look at what happened when they tried to give slaves the vote
the voting system needs a bit of work as a whole more visibility would be useful
not voting  ccp is doing a good jobthere was a little boxy thingy the whole week myself i meant to vote and with more than 1 vote but cant say that i cared enough to do it or is that a need to remember to run next time i wants me a trip to iceland and a chance to give the ccp guys some cookies
lol its not being said that the csm reps  and their own agenda   are the problem the whole concept of the csm is being suggested as the problem jade you claim that christys opinion is in the minority of the csm process but the csm was voted in by a minority of the eve population its not the voice of the player base its the voice of a minority that thinks the csm might be able to do something to be fair it might but how much could it possibly do that couldnt be done by the player base on the forumsseems ccp has made a smart move the csm is now set to take the brunt of player dissatisfaction  whining   in ccps place
nay give the csm a chance
this
so seeing how this issue has 2 for and 1 neutral itll get brought up in csm meetings
so new players wont be able to post in the tech support or newbie help forums either and maybe the range should be set to account age if anythingnot really supported i like the forums to be free
thats completely idiotic to be honest stupidity is not dependent on character age and this will keep too many perfectly reasonable people from posting and still let idiots with characters older than x arbitrary limit post

admittedly i am one of the people referred to here ive been playing for only 6 months and most of that time ive been in empire space i dont have a real conception of how things like pos warfare work and so im happy to leave  for the most part   the discussion of advanced mechanics like that to people who do know what theyre talking aboutbut newbies opinions do matter because we want more people playing the game and knowing how newbies perceive the game and what would make it more attractive to them is valuable and useful and in some cases i think youd be surprised at the good ideas that total newbies do occasionally dream up which never would have occurred to someone deeply entrenched in the game balancing that against the needs and commitment of experienced players is the responsibility of the csm and ccpeveryone has a right to post you dont have to read particular posts if you dont want to no support  
this isnt really a problem just a minor irritation at worst posts such as you describe are quickly buried for lack of support are rarely taken seriously and may even provide a bit of sport for someregardswindjammer
it would look neater without issue starting the title every post that and it is redundant as well this is the place to bring up an issue
i guess everyone in here thought that at least once   
but how will we know which ones are the important issues and which are just the poser issues but yeah this isnt the trade channel people we dont need to know that an issue in the issue channel is indeed an issue
you want the csm to take this issue to iceland
cant support post lacks issue in title
while i was tempted to use pretty much this line exactly the op does have a point the problem isnt with the issue tag its the complete lack of other tags there should be discussion in use at a minimum for threads like capital ships online along with maybe balance or tweak for ones like the cranenighthawk pg threads and csm for pure processrelated threads issue should be for fixes to game mechanics and the like only
some sort of standard nomenclature would definitely help posting support for that
as it is now the learning skills represent an extreemly steep cost of entry to the game as a new player i am terribly excited to get into the game and start working toward my goals i am willing and eager to put in the hard work of becoming a competently skilled pilot but when the first steps of that work are without direct gameplay rewards i am unenthusiastic i propose that the learning skills be something that can be trained after a given amount of relevent directly game affecting skills are trained this would be coupled with slightly higher attributes for new characters a given learning skill would become available once a character has trained a certain ammount of skills with that learning skills primary and secondary attributes so if a character trained a threshold of gunnery skills they would then get to train the perception and willpower learning skills this would give the learning skills the role of allowing a pilot to specialise after they have had a good amount of effective game time to decide where to do so without gimping them for putting off their learning skills ill admit now that implementing this might be dificult and reimbursement to older players could be an issue but i belive that it will be ccps job to ballance that
i do not support thisaddressing both points brought up by the op1 learning skills are not extremely steep cost skills learning skills are 45 thousand isk for the rank 1 skill and 45 million isk for the rank 3 one in no way are these totals even close to being steep consider the cost of a battleship 50 million isk capitol ship 1 billion isk the majority of players new and old alike shouldnt have any trouble making the 30 mil for these skills within the first month and a half and thats a generous estimate i had all of the learning skills within 3 weeks of starting and i paid for them 2 under no circumstances should any skills learning or otherwise become skillpoint sensitive example gaining the learning skills as you train in skills that use the attribute doing this would totally destroy the current skill system and would require no less than a total overhaul of every charater in the database no
meh i kinda trained some learning skills some combat skills some support skills as i saw needed in the beginning learning skills were rather low in importance i also flew into lowsec and flew ships i couldnt afford to lose  of course not into lowsec i read the damn warnings   about a month or two in they were 43 i was flying a drake completing level 3 missions with no problems thats when i went for 54eves golen rule dont listen to them blabbering idiots in the nub corp chat
as much as i dont like learning skillsi can see why someone who doesnt have patience to train these not being able to handle the game as a wholeeve is not instantly gratifying you have to use your head to make some isk or win in pvp
oops wrong toon
i got them on a recommendation of a friend my first friend in eve actually didnt start training them till my 3rd or 4th month trained one or two then trained something else repeat ad nausem i actually finished the learning tree about 9 months ago 55 across the board another 2 and a half years till i see that training pay off
no just no learning skills are fine as they are we dont need to see them get more complex just to punish alts since its not like this helps anybody  
mmmmmno personally i wouldnt mind seeing learning skills go the way of the dodo but creating an entire new system of restrictions just for them isdumb
no
i would like biomass  you know the stuff thats left after a podkill   to be actually made useful perhaps for a booster ingredient or clone type this would encourage podkilling and the trading of biomass so allinall make pvp a little more popular and profitableof course it affects the idustralists and marketeers amoungst us as all those extra ships and equipment need to be supplied by someonetake carearithron
but if it were useful then one could make a brand new alt and then pod them over and over and over to harvest said biomassunless were talking different grades of the stuff ie pending on their total sp then it would be kind of neat but very very difficult to justifyany particular ideas in specific
nah i like it more as bragging rights in item form
backgroundthe stated goal of factional warfare according to ccp greyscales first devblog on the subject was as followsfactional warfare provides a halfway house for players from empire to get into the sandbox at the shallow end it serves other functions too for other types of player but this is its primary functionso the target audience is the empire huggers both those in npc corps and those in empire based carebearish player corps so basically at players like myself who enjoy pvp in many other gamesforms but have been reluctant to get thier feet wet in the stark reality of pvp in new edenthe problemthis is similar to the alliance issue although is quite seperate those empire players in npc corps dont have too much of an issue here they are simply free to joinleave one of the new npc corp militias at willthe empire players in player corps however have very stark choices to make if players in them want to participate they eithersign up the entire corp which means that those players in the corp that dont want to participate have thier high sec access curtailed along with dealing with other wartime dangers or have to leave the corpleave thier  possibly   long time player corps thier rolesresponsibilities in those corps ect to join an npc militia corp in order to participatemake an alt  if a slot is available   and suspend training on your main in order to train an alt for fwthe first choice is silly while it may work for empire based pvp corps for most empire carebear corps the choice is simple no its simply not fair to subject those friends who dont want to participate to the consequences of fw since by greyscales account it is these carebears they are targeting with this expansion this just doesnt make much sense to join a carebear corp in with a fw npc alliancethe second choice is a sad one to make as well for an mmo that is heavily based on player interaction encouraging players to leave player corpsalliances in any way is just bad policy while leaving to try fw for a few days now and then might work for some players for others with roles and responsibilities in thier current player corp that option just isnt realistic not to mention the annoying constant shuffle of roles leaving and joining will cause ceos and directorsthe third option any design that encourages the use of alts over main characters is a bad one in my opinion while this is somewhat consistant with many of eve design decisions that have resulted in rampant alt use for research trade hauling mission running and heck forum posting i still feel that it is not something to be encouraged or expected in order for your target audience to participatebasicaly you shouldnt have to jump through that many hoops just to participate in something that is supposedly targeted at your playstylepossible solutionwhile i dont have all the answers it seems to me that removing fw from the corpalliance mechanics seems to be the best way to do this add a new character stat faction which defaults to neutral but you can sign up for any faction available if you meet thier entry requirementswhile i can see the pros and cons of excluding players in alliances if ccp is adamant about that fact then it should be simple to exclude them using this method just make it a requirement for joining a faction so if you are in an alliance you are denied entry or if your corp joins an alliance then all corp members are kicked from thier factions automaticallyin conclusioni really see this issue as seperate from the alliance issue if fw truly is aimed at empire carebears the current implementation is highly flawed while npc corp carebears are covered it places too many barriers in front of player corp carebears who want to try this out
i believe that as long as your corp doesnt sign up for one of the militias anyone in that corp or allience is alowed to fight for the empire that they desire without leaving their corp or allience
you have 2 ways of taking part in fw1 as an individual in a npc militia corp2 as a whole corpthis excludes1 corps in alliances2 alliances as a whole3 individuals in corps you would have to leave the corp

i get a kick out of this i am going to assume that with your defence on this you are a ninja salvager so let me put it in my view or ya once i have flipped cans on a regular basis i do this for 2 reasons 1 reason free ore 2nd once in awhile you get a chance for some pvp in empire but mostly its for the ore when i do this i know i put my ship at risk and believe me i have lost a few but my point on the subject is this if you are out can mining and i warp in to a nice juicy can of ore sitting there and i fly over and slip it you and your corporation now have the option to pop me whether you do or not is another story but teh option is there now if the miner or miners corp does not engage i cannot fight them or we so they then made the choice not to defend their can i think mission runners should have same option with their salvage wrecksand before someone goes on about it i can flip in a frigate sometimes a cruiser but nothing t2 and overpowering and we got guys in our home system which is 9 mining with bs gaurds now to defend their cans that makes it that much more fun ninja salvaging is just lame not sure how it is fun with no risk but to each his own i guessill tell ninja salvagers like i tell can flippers dont build a 2030mil ship to steal in cuz you just might die in it that is one thing i love about eve is every risk you take has a potential reward but also a potential risk to your character except ninja salvaging
i agree with the excellent points made by rocket x and windjammer
not another of these antilearning skill threads look its simpleyou dont have to do themif you dont like them go skill something else theres nothing making you do them whether you do or not i dont care just stop with the chorus of whining noobs starting a thread a day on this topic
any csm member is free to use my on the right to spoils of war when considering this topic
while the dpv is seems high for the phoenix the time between volleys is much longer launchers fire at every 22 seconds versus say beams which are around 7 seconds if beams hit for 10k per turret that is 30k per volley you get almost 4 volleys in the time it takes a launcher to fire another volleyright now i believe all dreads except the minmatar have 3 gun slots and and a high slot for siege the minmatar has 4 gun slots  2 launcher  2 turret   plus a slot for siege modulethe dreads are pretty balanced why the minmatar dread gets an extra turret i dunno

i wont be available as an alt due to the timing of the meeting have fun
could you give an example of such ones
id like to raise an objection to agenda item 1 for the following reasonseach player is only allowed to present one issue here 60 issues are being presented together i see no mention of a csm member being exempt from this one topic limit they can support as many issues as they like however each issue on the pdf and start of this thread needs to be proposed on the thread by a different player discussed for 7 days etceach of these are seperate issues and have different implications level of support and the like there needs to be seperate discussion on each one i doubt that you will have time in a meeting to discuss each of the 60 issues raised in the pdf take carearithron
originally by viktor amandi personally wish the representatives wouldnt give their own ideas  some of which lack popular support   priority over those which clearly have popular support with many more support postscould you give an example of such ones  la vista  i can easily give an example
to give a proper example you would have to also include an issue with more popular support being ignored in favour of thisas an aside it is also the csm members rights to bring up issues which they feel are important to eves future thats why they were voted in if you wanted a puppet council you should have voted for someone else
this really ive actually been pretty wideranging in the issues ive nominated to the agenda thus far and looked for the highest levels of relative support as a tiebreaker its important we get the material for good meaty discussions at the iceland summit and that means getting a move on in the selection of issues some candidates did stand on purely administrative platforms without opinions of their own but by and large the eve electorate voted for people with outspoken views and the drive to get things done

not true  many players have started multiple threads on assembly hall for example ive started 4 of which 2 are being discussed this week as well many people are bringing up multiple topics in one thread  usually in the form of comprehensive fixes on one topic of discussion exactly like lavista i dont recall seeing this as being disallowed anywhere in the csm rules unless i missed something and if i did let me know   everything happening here is perfectly in orderalso jade your agenda has an error  the link to issue 11 is wrong please update it so that we can be sure which issue youre referring to
thank you herschel fixed it now
if all the issues were brought up individually you wont get the large picture either and without the large picture it wont benefit the entire eve society the industry side of eve is extremely complex some of the things in my issue relies on other issues some can be implemented alone bug fixes general ui improvements and gameplay mechanics   but some of the ideas does have large implications indeedthat is why this is just a list of things for ccp to have a look at ginger stated at the devchat recently that industrial love will happen in the next expansion postfw   and this is why the market discussion forum who put this together wants to gather together a large bunch of things such that ccp can work on it the csm term is planned around the fact that expansions go out every UFFFD year so csm is exactly the right place to bring up a huge bunch of issues and ideas for ccp to work onby your logic that one cant raise an issue with several aspects is not good many of the isuses that are brought up so far have extremely many aspects which will have to be discussed the only difference from that and then the issue i raised is that i made it pretty clear what the exact issues are
sorry quite correcti mant to say that each player is allowed to start one topic per threadobviously lavista isnt doing this since 60 topics in one threadarithron
the point i am trying to make lavista is that you do bring up many issues that need discussed but each needs a seperate thread to discuss them in turn at a meeting of the csm you will need to debate each issue in turn and vote on each one not vote once on 60 issuessome affect the whole eve society some donttake carearithron
wouldnt creating 60 issues create an extreme overhead especially when they cant really be discussed and individual issues per say due to the clear connection between most of the issues
well they already creat the overhead by virtue of there being so many of them they are connected simply by falling under the science and industry category each is a seperate issue by itselfand hence needs a seperate thread for discussion and debate for 7 days by players and then of course each issue needs to be discussed and then voted upon by the csm the csm document makes this cleartake carearithron
no that isnt really the case its way more complex than you make it out to be some of them relies on other things its that simple
they may rely on other things but you can bring those up when you are discussing and debating the issue in a csm meeting or on the thread for a specific issue afterall thats what you have been elected to do as a grouptake carearithron
what about a thread voting system everybody could just open the thread and click a yes or no to vote for the subject without having to actually post it could also be forbidden to post in the thread without having something constructive to add to it this would limit the amount of signed posts and allow everybody to see the actual votes of yesnoi havent even made it into the other section so i dont know if this is implemented or not
its entirely reasonable and they dont have to change anything they can just make the threads in the jita park forum instead of the assembly hall forumjade constantine however has rejected this idea out of hand instead of doing the sensible thing and having discussions on topics
hmm are you saying that in the last election each alt could also cast a vote if so this seems to me pretty outrageous and the vote tallies of the candidates need to be adjusted to take account of this as some will have only a third as many votes etc take carearithron
please can someone point me to the minutes from the first two meetingsthey are not where i expected them to bethankscj
the abaddon is awesome fit a cap booster and train support skills
i am glad i got a discussion going    thanks for the responses honestly i love the abaddon but the cap gets killed off real fast it was just a few suggestions to maybe make it a bit more cap friendly i have my energy skills up to lvls 4 and 5 and it does help keep the light show going for a while but it does drain so much faster than the apoc with the added launcher and one less turret it would still rain down death and destruction albeit with a bit more of a damage ranges other than em and thermal and it wouldnt nessiceraly be a nerf keep the laser damage and resist bonus because that ship can tank second to none but it does suck when you have to warp out of a lvl 4 to just go and recharge and come back to it granted the abaddon isnt the fastest bs in the game but it sure is one of the sexiest
if everybody going hell no abaddon is fine is considered a discussion to you then good for you in any case the abaddon is a fine ship try fitting a cap booster

ra extensively use shield tanks for their nags so youre quite wrongone of the naglfars main problems is that theres quite a large difference between certain dreads and theyre at the bottomfor example lets compare the top and the bottomrevelation2149645 ehp5477 dps sustained tank  lasts 6 minutes while firing  6317 dps outgoing  6580 with sentries  very much cap stable while firing  11277  fits with almost 30 cpu and pg free1700m2 sigradnaglfar2091306 ehp1348 dps sustained tank  10577 burst  lasts 2mins  4020 dps outgoing  4283 with sentries  requires all faction lows to fit plus a 13 cpu implant1850m2 sigradnote that this is with similar care to fittings both have faction lows though only the naglfar requires it both use faction ammo  though only 2 of the naglfars guns can use faction ammo  there are no faction torps   both are done using an all5 characterbut i guess its okay because the naglfar can align a full 27 seconds faster wootah minmatar agility  304s277s  
everything minmatar from battleships upward need a boost but this definitely gets a please visit your user settings to reenable imagesthe split weapon system on the naglfar is a sick joke and a poorlythought design
chiming in for my support here i trained right up to dreads  then realized the naglfar was basically a complete waste of my time killing a highslot and converting it to pure projectile would be a good start although as yorda has pointed out thats still not putting it in the same realm as the revelation isill probably end up crosstraining to amarr caps which is a pity since i really like the unique look of the nag
yes
ive never had a problem with mini being the jack of trades master of none race armour or shield tank turrets or missiles in fact i like it but what i hate is that most of the ships have undefined roles in terms of there tanki mentioned this in another post in ships and mods forum make the ships more specific give a slot layout that suggests a shield or armour tank dont give it 5 mids 6 lows and higher shield hps in the case of the tempest give the extra mid for low and let it be a shield tanker or vice versa or whatever let them do both but tie down the ships to a specific tank is all or if you do want to make it optional for a ship to choose balance the slots and hpsas for the naglfar its a joke somebody really fcked up there longest training time for a dread laughable tank and lets be honest didnt the fact you had to add another weapon slot not alert you to the fact there might just be a problem with the shipalso the ragnarok sig radius bonus when you guys do fck it up you do properlywhilst some of the criticism may seem a bit on the harsh side i would argue the point that obvious and stupid mistakes should always be highlighted and the perpetrators constantly reminded that in some cases theyd come a poor second to a house brick in an iq test
what setups where you using i plugged in the standard goon fitting for the nag and it had 113mil ehp also i think my revelation setup is out of date
confirming this i was an allminmatar pilot until i reached the bs level  which also needs work   and saw how crap their cap ships were i then switched over did months more of training so i could fly the gallente cap ships insteadboost minmatar cap ships and bss
give minnie caps some love man love even theyre not picky
after looking at the capital ships i decided to start a new char for capitals amarr this would suggest something is wrong i think

probaly happened to anybody beforeyou forgot to update your overview settingswent on a breakcome back and overview settings all gone yes ive 5 accounts so thats 5 times fixing the overview settingsbut ive also 2 computers so thats 10 times the overview settings  i went on a break came back overview settings gone  old backup doesnt work because of the number of updates after i took the breakso would it possible to export the overview settings to a dunno excel file    and then import it on another characterother computerapart from it saving me about 5 hours work  complex overview settings   i dont see any downpart
sounds like a good idea to me and hopefully very simple to implement supported
this sounds simple to code in a small importexport button export will export the current overview settings into a small file heck even making it a text dump wouldnt be so difficult then you could import that filenot only useful for people using multiple accounts and computers but for corporations and alliances that want to offer efficient overviews for certain operations or for inventive pilots to make their own settings and post on the forumsdoubleplusgood
not a problem i face but i can see why that would be insanely aggravating if the game isnt going to preserve your ui settings     you should be able to for yourself
yesalso stop breaking my settings with every patch so i wouldnt need to back them up in the first place
yep i like it and id also love the ability to customize overview settings at the alliancecorp level so that everyone in the alliancecorp has the option to load alliancecorp default from the overview settings tab rather than having to individually customize
actually i think a simple standalone app could do this if anyone has a bit of programming knowleged if i recall correctly all those settings are kept in config files somewhere in the application data that said adding it as an ingame feature wouldnt hurt
an official feature to do this rather than manual backups would be great as well as saving time having to reload the backup after every major patch which insists on changing the settings location to some other random location which is less convenient that the previous one

oh yeahboth transport packaging or just allowing assembled ships in cargo  although being able to carry for instance only one hyperion is a pain   are both valid but some way of moving rigged ships short of having someone fly them or stick them in a carrier would be very nice
assembled ships into freighters  yes please
give freighters a slot hi mid low dosent matter and allow it to fit 1 type of module only that module in effect making the freighter hold a ship maintenance baysay it only allows you to transport ships and nothing else or something along those lines

dear poster thank you for your response i can see it used up all of your capabilities in return id like to add better to be a well known sometimes moron then a totally unknown forever waste of spacefare you well may you troll another and i hope gtc prices arent too high when you reactivate your datacore farming expired accounts
i would agree with op if it was only about acquiring assets  eg research points   and research was something the player participated inas it is it is an npc driven function and therefore has no bearing on whether the character is active or notso not supporting this idea
why is gaining sp with an inactive account such a problemthe training to battleship v is useless without the isk to support the next purchases if you have the isk one presumes youre contributing to the game in some way  paying for someone elses gametime or having a fleet of mining alts etc  
some people go away for military or work meansso they decide not to pay but set a long skill trainingalthough it may be hurting ccps bottom line they are likely to lose more people if they stop rpsp gains why cause coming back to after being away and having a few more sp is good for player moral
turning on eve online and opening your character sheet to click once over it is not playing the game also very few people have the godly patience to be waiting 46 weeks for a single level of some skill to finish people play mmos game with achievement being primary fun factor if you force people to train all the long skills while they are subscribed and playing they will have to go long time without achieving anything skillwise and this will subtract from the fun of the game
i disagree1   expired account rp  cheap datacore  cheap t2 stuff  more players can afford to use good equipments2   expire sp benefits a lot of ppl and does not affect others
congratulations on torpedoing your own argument in your final paragraph well i suppose a midway solution would be acceptable  instead of leaving it like it is instead of making it how you suggested you could have both sprp gains halved while not activethis leaves in the incentive to return but puts the inactive farmers at a distinct disadvantagestill dont like the idea all that much though i agree its mildly unfair
well you know me im not afraid to face the fact that i might be wrong even if im the one who shoots my own idea down of course equally you know i dont care if an idea is unpopular either  and it was obvious this one would be  still thought it worth bringing up even if it goes down in flames what im most pleased about is the general good nature responses people thought about the matter respond yea or nay with good reasons either direction and there was little trolling or flaming aroundme shrugsthats enough of a win for me especially for me
when ccp introduced the research agents we had to talk to each agent every day or wed get no points until we did so very annoying that was after they nerfed research points to give crap  datacores   instead of t2 bpos i guess they felt that removing that annoyance and letting us get some rps without having to micromanage that crap was justified considering the rewardsi agree all things considered daily income from 4 highstanding agents is like a couple hours mining veldspar
i can understand their need to raise price due to our  dollar but i dont like paying more isk for the same thing

only becuase getting a kill mail with capital mining lasers would be nearly as entertaining as razors falcon loss mails
this would be funny and uselessits just a shame that the rorqual has no turret slots so you cant fit it on the one ship it would make sense to mount it on
i support a change in the processhowever i think limiting it to the installer is a bad idea i believe it should be a grantablerevokeable role
great proposalsigned
i agree
check that you support it then   
especially in pve where minmatar ships relying on either arti or mixed systems are dependent on something that works about as well as a rail combining the big alpha  low dps approach of arti with reloading all the time ist just plain badso yeah im absolutely pro artillery rework also the sound and graphics of subcapital arti could use some love
to clarify i fully agree that the current ui has more than a few issues and would benefit by a fullyrealised intelligent redesign at the moment though  and whilst we  csm  everyone   are pushing for that  these are a few quick hits that there should be little difficulty in fixing  speaking there with my writing code for over 35 years hat on  active window is already used for fleet selfinvites sfaiaa so shouldnt be too difficult to add either though ill take what i can get in the short termiz

easy peasy
a small change but one which will make everyones lives a little easier  supported
ive wanted this ever since i begansigned
agree 100
the only way i could ever support this would be ifa   the best ideas and improvements get regularly moved back into the standard interface  even then many will keep their changes private  b   a system is in place to quickly switch between specialized interfaces so a focused interface modification doesnt result in less flexibility  its just terrible when players have to choose between an interface that allows them to do one thing well or an interface that allows them to everything a bit less well  generally i am against excessive customization because it detracts from the real problem  the interface needs to be improved   and adds unnecessary complexity which can actually make it harder to implement real improvements  and it definitely makes it harder to get into the game not just because you might have to at least download a more efficient interface but also because not everyone may be on the same page regarding ui documentation  
by play more i mean spend more of their time actually playing as opposed to fighting with the ui and its not that i want to make a christmas tree out of my ui  wow pastels arent really my thing  its that i want to be able to do something with it to make it not like beating my head against the wall im not a fan of wow gameplay and i love eves but on the ui front my opinions are completely the opposite eves ui is an abomination in so many ways whereas wow has done just about everything right that i can see tbh id say youre nuts i cant comment on gw unlike wow it hasnt eaten the life of half of my friends   but this insinuation that people only want scripting so that they can cheat is insanity i dont cheat ive never cheated in any multiplayer game ive played and i dont intend to start no matter what scripting is added to eve and while none of us can be sure i imagine myself to be pretty typical most people are here to play not to rack up bigger numbers and even if most of the worst fears about scripting were realized a large majority of players wouldnt abuse the new system also the go back to wow bit is provincialism at its worst i dont like the game but it didnt get to 10 million subscribers because the devs were stupid and implemented a game with no redeeming features ive never heard of a game company doing badly by picking up best practices from blizzard and wows ui is definitely one of the best things blizzard has produced that ive ever seen dont ignore them just because of the deep inferiority complex everybody on these forums seems to have with regards to our local 800lb gorilla

im not in favour and have not used bacon or any other similar applicationsin defence of those who introduced bacon they were copying what others  goons   have been doing for some time and did make ccp aware so what ever changes ccp make i hope the will also target other applications and macromining bots equally
not signed
i would like to throw my 2 cents in about bacon as far as im concerned this program is only an enhancement to the existing interface to those that claim this program detracts from eve think about this dont you think that in the future that onboard ships computers would at least be able to make audible sounds imo this is only a natural progression and this sort of program should be encouraged rather than stomped on just because a few people take issues with it the program isnt foolproof but its somewhat effective since this tool is now available to everyone everyone has an equal chance to take advantage of it so to those who say its not fair i say quit your whining and use the program too then this program clearly does not violate the eula and is one of the more innovative programs ive seen for eve since it doesnt use macros i believe this program should be allowed to operate with eve
local doesnt work correctly anyways if a cloaker enters a system and immediately cloaks it should follow that he is cloaked and therefore should not be visible in system or local until such a time that he decloaks or decides to break tactical silence in that channeli dont use bacon i havent tried it yet but my understanding is all that it does is basically read the logfile for you in realtime so its a helpful 3rd party app its not macromining macroratting or cheating in anyway that i can see i say fix local first and then fix the rest of the buggy ass ui before we go picking on small apps it would go to reason that if bacon gets the axe for being a 3rd party app then maybe eft evemon and the plethora of other tools should too maybe the api should not be availiable to players maybe the game shouldnt have the ability to be alttabbed down like many other mmos have been in the past make it an exclusive client to the foreground of the computer its running on and disable alttabnot signed
death to bacon the gots that developed it and the gots that use it
boosting the pain of sentry guns would be a nice start towards decreasing the imbalanced higher risk of low sec thus encouraging people to go there imo
i disagree they hit pretty hard and thats in a t2 fitted bs
afaik sentries do 176 dps per gun so in lowsec with two guns per gate 352 dps damage type spread is quite ok  17 em 17 ex 33 ki 33 th iirc   they have a 100 hit chance and an optimal of 150km or so which makes their dps a good deal higher than the comparable dps of a bcbs id say theyre at nongank bs level comparatively which is ok you need a dedicated tank on your bs to actually permanently tank them  or you spider tank but theyre not meant to pwn your bs when you get flagged theyre meant as a nuisance and antitackler weaponthe biggest problem that makes sentries easily tankable is that they do not combine fire and cycle targets if you have a few people in your fleet you only have to survive 176 dps for 20 seconds thats ridiculously low and a spider tank can easily keep everyone alive that is the problem with sentriesdo not give unnecessary additional bonuses to large groups make sentries shoot every flashy at a gate at the same time then their current dps is just fine and they work as a nice force mitigator

agree i want to be able to fe set a 2 hour skill before i go to bed and have it continue on to either the next skill that i have selected or by default start on the next level of the skill it just completed  if it wasnt finishing level 5  
i support emergency singleskill queue that would kick in any time you miss some skill training
its not a isk sink its a faucet drake platinum insurance costs 12m and pays out 38m injecting 16m isk out of no wherethis will only lower the amount of ganks able to be done over time but not change the low riskhigh reward just use a few alts and again you can do it 72 times a day with 2 alts with a 1 hour global countdowntank gates in lowsec not relevant at all to high sec gankinglow sec ganking is a completely different subject reallyand how is letting pirates shoot people and be free to warp to another gatestation without getting shot at by those sentry guns going to attract the carebears more i think thats what you mean i hope if they didnt shoot at all it wouldnt be good all this would attract is more pirating
to hammer home my earlier point asking for a change in the game is all well and good if the problem cant be solved because the game is broken in this case it isntlets be honest here its about greed people dont want to interrupt their isk flow taking a little bit of time to counter the problemall together nowthe solution is simplethe solution is simplethe solution is simplerepeat to fade
i agree with the ops concept of not providing insurance to criminals when they engage in criminal activity so basically if you perform an action which flags you as a criminal and your action directly or indirectly results in the loss of another persons ship and you lose your ship within the agression timer your insurance payment becomes null and void
voiding the insurance wont solve the problem believe me it wouldnt stop me what does stop me tho is my targets showing a little bit of savvy and realizing how easy it is to counter a gank
it solves the winwin situation that currently exists which i think is what this is really about i dont think anybody is in favor of removing the ability of the suicide gankers as they play an important role in the game
not signed you seem to be missing the bigger picture and are focused on your paticular playstyle pimped mission runninga few points1   it already takes 6 battleships to take down a raven if we void insurance that will cost 400m600m making a break even gank target 8001200m in modules with a large risk of a massive isk loss if you fly your mission ship in a 07 or 08 with a dc ii you are looking at probably 18b isk just to break even when you factor in the time costs of waiting raising security organising the gang selling the loot and fitting the ships up then you will want a target of at least 3b so is that the point at which you should become a target to suicide gankers seems awfully high to me2   you are ignoring how this change will effect the suiciding of haulers and miners the question is is there a problem at the moment do we need to make ganking more difficult because it is unbalancing the economy are price differentials between different regions huge because of the extreme risk of hauling goods are traders and haulers claiming they cant make a profit because their goods get vaporised the second they undock are meta loot prices skyrocketing because it cant be safely brought to market is the isk faucet of high sec ganking and the wholescale destruction of loot causing hyperinflation no at the moment smart haulers are making money those who arent aware of the risks or arent competent to deal with them are losing money this is good no3   you want to void insurance for successfull ganks which encourages a scatter gun approach to ganking and rewards sloppy gankers4   you completely ignore the major cost of ganking which is the security status hit even with good 00 access a freighter hit takes upwards of 7 man hours of ratting to raise a battleship hit 4 and a hauler hit 051 hour these are not insignificant time costs and whilst you do earn isk when doing it you earn a lot less when you are concentrating on raising sec status5   insurance system is broken because the market is flooded with cheap minerals this is a problem for all eve not just ganking how do you break a corporation that can just undock one throwaway bs after another how do you clear out low sec pirates who camp in cheap fit bs so why is the market flooded with cheap minerals and arby siege launchers maybe we need less people running missions and high sec mining and more people getting cheap ships blown up to drive up the prices of minerals6   ganking is a self balancing system there are no npc haulers who ram tech i haulers full of nice loot and then afk to their destination there are only so many mission runners with pimped ships to kill and only so many xtype boosters to be destroyed whining that some gankers can make billions of isk is like whining that traders can do likewise it is pvp and if it is extremely profitable get your slice of the pie until it is not so profitable anymore  either from competition from other gankers or victims wising up this has noticably happened with cnrs in the last few months imo   if you do will probably find that good gankers work hard and show teamwork to make a decent hourly return
supported
i support this proposal
i support the op where he said insurance doesnt get paid if the ship being targeted gets blown up first
are you a miner dray
a if you are taking it upon yourself to do ccps job then you take the risk upon yourselfb ive never actually killed a mission buddy by firing on thembeen ganked by concord for sure but never killed a mission buddy that i accidently fired uponwhich is why you only make it so that if you participate in a kill for someone and then die by concord either before or after the kill happens then you lose your insurance payout stops the accidents from killing your walletc seems to be a lot of suicide ganking of freighters and industrial ships when i fly through space
it is obvious those farming in concord protected areas hope for peace and quiet to go about their merry business it doesnt matter if you think it is wrong or right  it is how it is it is part of what makes eve evethe problem with things such as no insurance payout is that they are one sided solutions they cater to the miners and nobody else it doesnt address why a miner should have this special protection for the sake of their fun or profit but a pirate or suicide ganker does notsuicide ganking does cost people something the fact that they might come out on top of the loss  maybe even by a hefty margin does not change the fact their was a loss you invested in your cargo holds your mining lasers mining drones your hauler whatever they invested in a ship capable of ganking a target in less than 30s those are your investments and you are suggesting that only the mining investments should not have any risk what you are suggesting is that people should be so afraid to gank a perfectly legitimate  and juicy   target so that you lose nothing and they lose everythingyoull argue no no they can still gank us but it is going to hurt them a lot more but that isnt what youre saying you want no insurance payout on successful suicide ganks you may want concord to respond even faster to prevent the gank in the first place you want this so that suicide ganking becomes unattractive to anybody afterall who is really going to suicide gank as a business initiative if it only results in a net loss and you like that idea  mine in peace you get to make money for nothing but time no risk wannabe pirates100 risk to the point that they arent even allowed to pirate for profit but only for s and gigglesand this seems fair to you there are only two answers yes or no if yes then you boldly admit that your idea of fun  the idea that is not supported by eve itself is somehow the golden rule if no then there is nothing to actually discuss because if you say no but want to entertain unfair ideas then you really meant to say yes now didnt youyou engage in mining which you know could cause you to lose your ship and cargo to a pirate so i guess you will be ok with not getting any insurance out of it eitherif you want to discuss whether or not something needs a nerf you need to look out how widespread the phenomena is and how it is actually affecting the game do you believe that the majority of haulers are ganked do you believe even 30 of them are ganked 10 how many suicide ganks a day would you estimate occur how many ganks fail how many total hauls occur without being killed what sort of net loss on the economy of eve do you think there is  please note this is for eve not for youwhat you lose and what is not destroyed is still on the market or in use and therefore is not a loss for eve only for you   if there is a net loss is there a noticeable impact to the economic system  negative or positive and if so what are those impactsyou cant simply say i feel this is wrong just because you dont find it fun somebody is always going to find nofun in what somebody else does if you feel there is truly a gamebreaking issue then treat it as such instead of saying i feel
i think this sums up most of the posts for change in this forum there is very little supportive numbers on anything no one has ever stated how wide spread this is and how often it actually occurs majority of all posts and or responses is based of an emotional protest rather than logging out of their respective character and really look at it logically rather than emotionally unfortunately i see this in some sense on the csm board and that concerns me as to the true objectivity of the decisions being made or if some one takes up the cause to write up a proposal to ccp how much of that csms bias is injected into that proposal and how much of the responding player base is ignored because they do not feel it is right ank has taken this on to present to ccp and we all know her stance on the issue and how much she wants to wipe out this kind of play she has stated it in her video so will ccp also see the objections from the player base that do not want to see the change in an issue like this or will it ignored because it does not support the current proposal to make the changethere has been and always will be player groups that want nothing to do with pvp or anything of the like and that same player base will do what they can to change the landscape of eve to mirror other mmos that have no fight zones stating that if ccp wants more of the market share this has to happen well hate to break it to all you players that think this way but suicide ganking has been going on a very very long time and with much more veracity than what you see now and ragequit post after ragequit post was thrown in cp and yet the sub base grew now why do you think that happened
well the csm members have not exactly tried to hide that they are just in it for their personal agendas but so far they dont seem to be more than a glorified suggestion forum so does it really matter time will tell if this has any merit but cant say it looks promising atmhopefully those that really matter  the devs   can make their decisions from a more objective view of the game
i would support this but i would also like to be able to assign hotkeys to each of my groups so i can setup things like squada ctrl1 to launch alt1 to return   squadb ctrltilde alttilde  
agreed though id also suggest that we allow for overlapping groups as well  i fly a kronos among other ships and the 125 bay75 bandwidth means i use 2 heavy 5 medium and 5 light drones sometimes i want max dps 2 heavy 2 med 1 light   sometimes i want just a boring flight of 5 mediums or 5 lights right now i have to set up my groups for one or the other and switching is a pain the ability to mix and match more easily would be very convenient for basically any ship that has 3045 or 55120 bandwidth nope whole voting system needs an overhaul but theres a few threads up on that already
i approve this
i endorse this product andor service to be implemented
no it isnt ive been in  and know many others who have been   in a position where an account is shared this is against the eula but commonplace an ip log already exists for your api info so why not for login attempts if nothing else you could spot people attempting to brute force your passwordeve has a very high proportion of very techsavvy users alot of people would use this feature id certainly use it for example as i know of several people who know my password or who could easily obtain it however i trust them enough not to bother changing it because that would just annoy me
unplayable lag should the developers be adding to this game when large fleet battles and small encounters get a heavy amount of lag   winners dont lag  losers seem to always lag   shouldnt resolving lag issues be priority what does it mean when a gm said without solid verification in each individual case when it is clear that in every major conflict lag occurs how do you prove lag the reimbursement plan needs better understanding of the players good games drop players when they lag and redo it when you relog bad games act like there is no lag ive been with this game almost 4 years each year on a new pc i am qualified to determine that lag occurs its becoming harder and harder to support a game which doesnt face or addresses the issues except with hollow works as without solid verification in each individual case what is ccp doing to address these issues it seems they have convinced themselves that lag do to connection points doesnt happen
you want to know how to cure lag in eve donate about 10 million to ccp for them to upgrade their servers its not that they dont want to its that the hamsters needed to make 1000man fleet fights and 2000man trade hubs work  and dont kid yourself theyd get that big if it was possible  are way too expensive for ccp to buy as it stands theyre working around the edges as best they can  you may notice a few billion fewer cans were anchored around highsec a few months back for example  but the sheer servercrunching power of blob fights isnt something that can be addressed short of a whole lot of millions ccp doesnt have
the biggest fight ive ever been in was 30 vs 30 and i didnt notice any lag that was ccps fault in itas far as i know only systems with hundreds of people in them cause lag and gigantic0rz battles between large numbers of pilots and carriersps  why didnt my spellcheck catch gigantic0rz but is telling me that spellcheck should be two words oo
lol ccp had the nerve to tell me on a petition about the lag the couldnt reimburse ships due to the lag could have been caused by a large fleet battlehmm something seems wrong with this pictureif you cant stop lag due to large fleet battles then why not limit the size of fleet battles to something they can control lag in until as what time they can hope to have a playable gamealso why not stop all the crazyness like factional warefare and such until as what time you can make a playable game as you have it currentlyotherwise give us what the h we pay for ccpalso there were approx 400k accounts that could vote on the csm election lets suppose that just half those were paying accounts so 200k x 1500 per month is 3 mil dollars per month or 36 mil a year do you really think they cant afford decent servers if they wanted to buy them roflcome on ccp you stated in your post about the 60 day time cards a fact that raises the rates to play almost 35 that you wanted to stay with industry standards industry standards is not a server so laggy that end game content cant even be played as designedand its not customer service that ansers petitions just whenever they feel like it every mmo game i have playedand i have played since ultima answers petitions in a matter of hours bu game contact you dont have to chase the answers in a my account on a websitein short you wanna keep up with the jones you have to act like the jones
atm ccp is working together with ibm microsoft and some other corporationto build a supercomputer this will spread 1 system between different servers to get better performanceit is however hard to build but its gonna be in the top 5 best super computers in europe and top 50 in the world  if im correct  they are working on it but this cant be done over night
still if us can uses write this as a reply to a client without solid verification in each individual case there has to be a system to verify or document lag or your calling your customer indirectly a liar and by all industrial standards that is not acceptable this lag is clear at the server if 64 plus people all agree that the lag was unplayable
who cares about the server the issue here is customer service for know problems and how ccp gm handle the problem if the server is the problem than all lag issues should be reimbursed but ccp gm are taking the position that there is no lag and not given a client s   a system to document the lag if they are going to denied us base on there reply listed above they are calling their customers liars and dont provide a way document the problem as it occurs so that comes back to the customer is lying that is not acceptable by all industrial standards  dont replay if youre a alt  
true the real issue her is customer support something ccp knows nothing aboutits kinda ironic to tell me the lag may have been because of a large fleet battlesomething eve is all about but the major fail is they wont admit that it can in any way be thier faulti find it hard to think its localised isp problem when 65 people from all over the world have the problem at the same timethe lag is a everyday thing in this game in large capital ship fleet battles i find it hard myself to understand why they even have lag say in jita for instance and yes i know your gonna say well there is 5001000 people therewell fact is other games have major citys with massive graphics inviolved in rendering the citys details then add ontop of that 500600 or so people and there is no lag lets face it the graphics in this game really arent that intensive so whats up with all the lag anyways
jade what is the best way to defend a station system no but it is your job to rationally examine issues and quash ones that would damage the gameif you think that only large alliances should be able to hold sov and everyone else should be flying in lowsec then i dont know what to say more people flying and fighting in 00 is a good thingeditcorrelary if its so easy to just hold stations and get them back later why dont you go and enforce neutrality like your rp dictates you should
griefing is the practice of destroying something someone else owns for the purpose of causing them pain and agony with no regard to personal benefit you do it cause you feel good making the other guy suffer and not because it in anyway helps you lots of isk was lost on jihadswarm for nothing more than laughs some people made isk because of insurance but many did not also insurance is an entirely seperate issue
are you saying that we are going to not destroy stations we have no intention or way of holding or sellingwe are just going to sit there with empty useless stations waiting to be taken
hi goum i am trying to resist trolling here but we are clearly not capable of seeing this massive problem we think we see soon only bob and the swarm will be in 00 and there will be nobody else to shoot jade is obviously right no matter how many holes we shoot into the argument or ways it would hurt the game and the swarm long term goons are mostly pvp so we like targets in case anyone cant figure this out when there is only bob and titan blobs to go fight we are just going to have to jihadswarm more for funi dont but as i already said i am very atypical goon
i have to admit i only read a small portion of the opi could support this but its all down to implementation i dont think alliances should be able to destroy outposts willy nilly if this was implemented destruction of the station should only be possible by the alliance that holds it and has a sovereignty level of 3 in the system ccp could implement some sort of self destruct button that becomes available at that sovereignty level that way the alliance that captures the outpost would need to exert its control over the sovereignty for a good period of time before blowing up the station it also gives the alliance that just lost the outpost a chance to regroup and perform a counterstrike it would also allow a defending alliance to blow up existing outposts under their control if they believe they cannot hold on to themsuch a situation would create bargaining chips never seen in the game before a defeated alliance could use the outposts it still controls as a bargaining chip and the invading alliance could hold the assets in the acquired outposts as hostageone serious problem with this is that a deep cover spy who has attained a position of privilege could destroy the outpost say what you will about spying in eve i dont think a spy or spiteful alliance executor should weild such power as such i think the self destruct should take 2 days during which any ceo in the alliance can veto it of course a spiteful alliance executor could still boot corps and enact self destruct so some measures would be needed there as wellhonestly though jade i dont think the outposts are the problem its the regions that have outposts intermingled with npc stations i dont know how ccp allowed such a situation to exist but you get regions like curse syndicate and venal where the npcs have total sov over the region and then the other regions where sov only applies in npc station systems the outposts in regions with no npc stations change hands far more frequently and the system seems to be working there
jade i voted for you in the elections in large part because i liked your vision of how this game should work  still do actually but seriously man youre being really cavalier here about an issue that cant take it what gou is saying is perfectly reasonable and i can think of no reason to discount it some space does suck and a lot of alliances would rather burn bad space than have to extend their reach to include it goon seems high on that list  this isnt exactly a group known for their infinite patience and methodical approach to territorial expansion after all i have no doubt that this mechanic will serve as much to clean out 00 space as anything else and that goes double for the space that isnt valuable enough to hold youre up against a really hard conundrum in implementing this on one hand i dont think anybody wants to promote scorched earth tactics  they suck both for scorcher and scorched as such an outpost has to be destroyable by enemy action not merely by the owner scuttling it on the other hand you need to make it so that theyre hard as hell to destroy by enemy action so you dont just lose control for an hour and see your station pop i think its possible to finesse the difference there and create a system that will make station destruction a relevant part of this game without inadvertently making griefing too easy for anybody but its not going to happen if you just ignore your opponents or brush them off as liars looking to advance their own alliances agenda dont  this up
and how do you know that youre not a goon and i doubt you have any real experience with the goons instead you have multiple people here who are worried that the goons will do this and you even have a few goons saying yeah well do this and you say it wont happen yet ive seen nothing in your proposal or responses that would stop them from doing what everyone says theyre going to do time to take the blinders off and look around jadeyou cannot consider an idea in a vacuum you have to look at how the people the players will respond to it here you have people worried about goonswarm using this idea to negatively impact the game you have them telling you theyre going to do it and you think that shouldnt matter thats a bit like paroling a serial killer after hes told you hes going to go out and kill the members of the jury that convicted him just because you dont believe itno your job as csm is to listen to the community which youve just proven youre not doing  unless they agree with you of course   you are not an advocate you are not a lobbyist you are a representative someone with your lexical knowledge should know the difference
destroying more things is awesome
agree wholeheartedly and it would be nice if the explosion went on for some time with neat secondary detonations etc
the whole small alliance will be hurt the most argument is just a canard imho it makes an implicit assumption that the attacked small alliances will take no action other than fight or flight no evolution of the political situation of that alliance or the large griefer alliance take placeid say if the goons did embark on such a crusade they would rapidly consolidate opposition to themselves by encouraging smaller alliances to form counter blocs dedicated to defending or counter attacking themand id argue that truly destructible stations including all your stuffs stored there would mean that large alliances would have to take outpost building location and defense very seriously indeed as unlike today where they could abandon vast amounts of materiel ready for when the counterattack comes they would have to consider that their opponent might instead destroy the station to destroy this materielalso the self destruct option works on the strategic defence as well as the offence an alliance like bob could have destroyed stations as they fell back to delve leaving a logistical nightmare for a following force rather than a ready made home for their continuing attacksa smaller entity with a more compact group of stations would have less trouble mounting a serious defence of them and have a better chance of mounting a successful counter attack  or stuff rescue mission with jades mechanic   due to its compact nature than a group that has to defend 20 across 3 regions from simultaneous assaultswould they build stations in the first place it comes back to the oldest rule in eve only fly  build   what you can afford to lose if someone feels that it would be beneficial to build them then they will get built probably byin agreement with coalitions of smaller alliancesit certainly would slow or stop the construction of outposts by tiny alliances operating in splendid isolation but i dont see that as a bad thing
i think thats down to you to make sure of not any representitiveby politics or military might if you cant thats just tough its the nature of the brutal selection pressures that exist in 00 and the currently indestructible outposts are a discordant note in the symphony of destruction that 00 should be
no it isnt because you can conquer them and who are you to tell us what 00 should be anyway00 is the emergent endgame making outposts destructible encourages stasis because of immense power consolidation through superior forcei dislike stasis
page 4 textwallso instead of having small alliances in isolation youd rather have everyone in 00 be the protectorates of someone like aaa ra goons bob you know someone that can stop aaa ra goons or bob from rolling in with 20 dreadnoughts and blowing their outpost to pieces for lolsheres a situation to help you wrap your head around it i am leading an alliance of 5000 people that controls 4 regions from which i can harvest massive amounts of money i have across from me 10 alliances of 500 people each who combined also control four profitable regions that they harvest massive amounts of money from i have 10 outposts each minor alliance has one all things are equal except that we have one large group and ten smaller groupsthese ten smaller groups are independent of each other and may have their own internal sets of politics lets assume theyre all neutral towards each other this already places them at a massive disadvantage against the big guy  they dont share intel and theyre not sharing forces now i am the big guy i mark one of these alliances for destruction assume a 10 turnout rate for both sides and i have a fleet of 500 to use against their fleet of 50 thus i can outnumber them three to one and still have enough people  350 or 35 people per outpost   to defend my borders from any counterattackwithout destroyable outposts i have to take over their territory and capture their outpost then figure out what to do with it i want to keep the other nine alliances in check so i have to protect it this means my space expands and i have fewer people per region than the combined forces of my enemies now now i attack the second alliance with the same numbers i bring 150 to blob their 50 but now i only have  about   32 people per outpost because i need to defend the one i took from the first alliance i kick out the second alliance too and now have 12 outpostslets assume that once ive taken out four of these minor alliances the other six band against me they have 3000 people in their coalition against my 5000 i attack alliance 5 with the same turnout numbers i have 500 they have 300 i can match them evenly but then i only have 14 people per outpost watching things and making sure nobodys hitting my poss while im on campaign or i can just throw everything at them they lose and are reeling but i cannot comfortably extend my reach further to take their space i have too much space to hold already a stalemate developsadd in destructible outposts instead of holding onto those four outposts i captured i will destroy them suddenly i dont have to worry so much about that space i can ignore it and hit the remaining alliances with full force i can do this quickly with a capital hotdrop when the other alliances are not online in force thus destroying their ability to resist a push on their poss  after all they will have to recover all their assets from the destroyed outpost if it survives at all in order to use it against me and they now have nowhere to put it meanwhile the other six alliances have banded against me and destroyed four of my outposts to keep it even i still control all my space though so i can afford to replace them plus i have 6 other outposts to move the stuff to i retaliate by blowing up the other outposts belonging to the sixalliance coalition one by one with my superior numbers until the individual member alliances have lost so much that they break up surrender flee or become my pets in this way i can force the coalition to break up one member at a timeget it yettldr version  a single large entity can cause a coalition of smaller entities to break up a lot easier with destructible outposts by hitting the coalition members who cannot replace such losses as easily as the large alliance one by one
the whole small alliance will be hurt the most argument is just a canard imho it makes an implicit assumption that the attacked small alliances will take no action other than fight or flight no evolution of the political situation of that alliance or the large griefer alliance take placesmaller alliances will have to ally with exisiting powerhouses or get steam rolled we want new entities not new petsid say if the goons did embark on such a crusade they would rapidly consolidate opposition to themselves by encouraging smaller alliances to form counter blocs dedicated to defending or counter attacking themalready explained how this doesnt help much large alliances have more concentrated firepower than groups of smaller alliancesand id argue that truly destructible stations including all your stuffs stored there would mean that large alliances would have to take outpost building location and defense very seriously indeed goons would sell more regions or torch them on the way out simply to deny them to others as unlike today where they could abandon vast amounts of materiel ready for when the counterattack comes they would have to consider that their opponent might instead destroy the station to destroy this materiela small alliance would value the outpost much more than a large alliance they will have less isk and fewer other outposts already this would only work for fighting amongst the big guysalso the self destruct option works on the strategic defence as well as the offence an alliance like bob could have destroyed stations as they fell back to delve leaving a logistical nightmare for a following force rather than a ready made home for their continuing attacksagain only works on the big guys if a small alliance managed to come in and take out a goon outpost they would get put back into empire by the counterstrike not lowsec but empire we might even deck them to continue the attacka smaller entity with a more compact group of stations would have less trouble mounting a serious defence of them and have a better chance of mounting a successful counter attack  or stuff rescue mission with jades mechanic   due to its compact nature than a group that has to defend 20 across 3 regions from simultaneous assaultstitan jumping or jump bridge networks make the big guys far more able to respond across space than you seem to realize it is about 10 minutes to go the equivalent of 50 jumps atm and mostly safe unless someone wants to tank a pos to try and shoot people taking the highway big alliances have more mobility structures in placewould they build stations in the first place it comes back to the oldest rule in eve only fly  build   what you can afford to lose if someone feels that it would be beneficial to build them then they will get built probably byin agreement with coalitions of smaller alliancesit certainly would slow or stop the construction of outposts by tiny alliances operating in splendid isolation but i dont see that as a bad thingif they didnt build the outposts in the first place then they already have a huge disadvantage no market for 1 thing all production is kept to pos no loot melting and poor ore melting unless they haul massive amounts a long way denying smaller alliances the ability to reasonably build outposts is a sure way to make the current powerhouses stronger
i am me with my opinions thats whoif you dont like them fine i dont imagine that i will persuade everyone with my points of view onto your pointswhy does making outposts destructible encourage stasis i cant see the logic here in what you are sayingdestruction by definition is the opposite of stasis continuously redrawing boundaries by conquest and destruction will not be stasis whatever else it might be bob thought they had control of 00 and were pushing outwards perhaps with an inherent assumption of core stasis and stability to their empire and then you guys came along and forged an alliance capable of pushing them back into a very tight boxyet thanks to indestructible stations you were not able to inflict the massive amount of damage that you might have been able to had you been able to utterly wipe out all their fixed infrastructure and supply dumps leaving only those stations needed for your tactical and strategic advance into their holdingsif you had and all the stuff belonging to their pilots had to be moved or face total destruction imagine how much more pressure that would have put them under how much more intense the fight for these resourcessuperior force is transitory it has to be consistently and constantly renewed in order to maintain or expand itself there is no real endgame in 00 possible because of the constant emergence and renewal of alliances and powerblocs this is a result of the open nature of the eve universe and consequently the red queen effectunless you have a perfect closed system then you as well as everyone else who reaches a position of power will face it with indestructible stations this plays a lesser role than it might because ccp  or god or whatever   has magically protected assets from the total destruction that a lack of fitness might mandatedont get me wrong brmble i am not against outposts remaining the way they are now i simply think that the game itself would be more fluid and dynamic with the possibility of total destruction and consequent economic damage being inflicted on the enemy than it is currently removing the invulnerability from outposts would expose those who use them to the full effects of natural selection i think that would be a beautiful thing
all this assumes a closed system where the small alliances and corps cannot bring in new allies mercs etc and larger predatory third parties dont intervene to take advantage of overstretch on behalf of your 5000 man alliance its unreasonably simplistic even with the current game mechanicsand jades proposal is not that 20 dreads could roll in and lol pop the outpost theyd have to conquer it and hold it for days first against whatever counterattacking force could be wielded by the initial ownersas for becoming pets etc larger alliances would have more difficulty holding pets in place when those pets could visit huge amounts of destruction whilst the masters head is turned elsewhere the big boys would have to be more compact and less flabby or they would present easier tasty targets for treacherous allies and petsif anything after an initial consolidation period and weeding out of the currently unfit but space holding alliances it would result in strong pressures on the existing powers forcing them to continuously be at their best or risk losing out to the newer and hungrier alliances i dont think it would make a gigantic change to the way things are right now but it would weed out the weaker faster than today  and produce more and larger explosions   
oh i am well aware of how handy titans can be for rapid movement and all the other handy tricks like jump bridgesand i know that initially these would give a nice head start to alliances like your own none of these will help one bit if you make enough enemies that you can be attacked from multiple directions at once though as bob found outtorching or selling regions would have one effect reducing your own holdings and increasing the space for others to move into as once torched it could be rebuiltyou are of course totally right about the reasons to build an outpost a new 00 territorial power would have the choice to remain distributed and harder to hit or somewhat centralized and more efficient but also providing a more focused target for enemy aggressionno different than now really other than the higher economic and consequent internal political cost of failure
the issue with small alliances would not able to survive argument is null and goes to the old eve quote dont fly what you cant afford to loseadapted todont build what you cant afford to loseagain though this idea has to be done right and in my eyes will go though a lot of discussion within ccpfor selfdestructing an outpost if sov 3 is a must only displays 2 scenarios1   the defender destroys the outpost so the attacker get nothing to show2   the attackers take the outpost and wait the 3 weeks for sov 3 to destroy iti think wed see more of scenario 1 play out than number 2mainly because the longer you do own the outpost after invasion the more likely you are to find renters or even someone who wants to buy the outpost
first point assuming no outside interference most outside parties in eve are hyenas not knights they will not step between the huge bully and the tiny victim they will slowly circle the carcass and steal whatever they can from the moldering corpse youre unlikely to get a lot of small folks that will help someone against one of the major powers  theres too much loss thats almost guaranteed and gains are fleeting and sometimes nonexistentits worth noting that all the outposts in eve today have taken years to get there this proposal could easily see entire reaches of 00 scorched back to betatesting in a couple months something tells me thats not what ccps vision of 00 is  if they wanted outposts to be destroyable they would have made them that way in the first place dont you thinkas for not building what you cant afford to lose that limits outposts only to the select few that can afford such big losses therefore again the biggest baddest alliances will be the only people that will have them and how will you compensate the smaller groups that put up an outpost that is now suddenly poppablemy last point this proposal would require a massive redesign and restructuring of the entire 00 formula in order to be implemented fairly there are many other better less disruptive issues that i see on this forum that should be discussed first particularly the dead horse idea for poss even though i know this is chairmans pet project lets work on the minor things before we go trying to tell ccp to rewrite the entire game
i am sure that this is the case but what i am saying is that it applies to both sides of this equation third parties might intervene to attack the major power simply because it is entangled elsewhere and wont be able to react fast enough  debatable   to prevent them raiding or stealing territoryalso the hyenas might well fancy that outpost for themselves and fight to take it from the majorno i dont think that what i think is the design decision was made to protect the first outposts in such a way as to encourage them to be built but further to this i dont think that a couple of months would see most or even large chunks of 00 scorched the economic imperative to have outposts would still be as strong even if they were destructible no it limits it to those willing to risk such losses a small but significant difference imho people still build them today even though there is a risk they can be captured within days of construction i dont think they would stop building them simply because someone could theoretically capture one and possibly destroy it and hence there is no more need for compensation from this prospect than there is for the current situationi dont agree all that would be required for it to be fair would be to affect every stakeholder equally and if all stations became destructible then this requirement is met by the nature of the change
outpost destruction via kamikaze attacks only regular outpost requires three mothership crashes or one titan crashfirst tier improvement requires five mothership crashes or one titan plus one momsecond tier improvement requires seven mothership crashes or one titan plus 3 moms or 2 titansthird tier improvement requires ten moms 1 titan and 6 moms 2 titans and 2 moms or 3 titansthere you go
i apologise in advance but this is going to be quite a long onethe reasons why destructible outposts should not be implemented in the game  currently  1   they are not really an issue  we have more important things to discuss  firstly i think there are many many more important issues that we as a csm should be discussingi do not see the issue of destructible outposts as being one which will dramatically improve the game play experience for the majority of players  indeed i see its potential implementation as something which will damage the game experience for an even larger group we really should be giving other issues prioritythe fact is that contrary to how the op wishes to portray it galactic politics is a fluid and dynamic thing over the past few months we have seen gigantic galactic wars in all regions of space outposts are being lost and recaptured left right and centrea few examplesthe great war  bob forced back to one region and now expanding againthe mc collapse in period basisthe goons vs smashkill warthe triumvirate collapsethe a assault on catchbruces adventures in fountainthe drone region warsthese are just a selection of some of the epic happenings that make eve live and breath as a game  that add spice and interest and capturing and then holding outposts plays a large part in why 00 is as dynamic as it isthe op would like to present the case that that there is no risk to building outposts anymore is he serious one glance at the rapidly changing galactic map demonstrates the falsity of that arguementthe fact is that outposts still require gigantic investments  not just in isk but also  and probably more importantly  in the game time required to maintain and defend them this means that space holding alliances cannot simply be pure pvp organisations but also have to industrial wings with the capacity to maintain and all the supporting defensive infrastructure 237  356 days a year and this in itself creates interesting dynamics within alliances  as the recent triumvirate split and forum drama revealedas far as i can tell 00 politics is amazingly fractured fluid and dynamic as it stands will outpost destruction improve the situation or will it  as i believe  in fact lead to a marked reduction in 00 diversity and dramai really do not see why csm should be giving priority to this issue when as far as i can see we are proposing fixing something which aint really broke there are many more issues we should be focused upon which will make a positive impact on the eve experience for the majority of players
2   it will not enhance the gameas outlined above the op starts with a completely skewed concept of 00 working on the assumption that there should be a cost to failure and defeat in wars empires need to fall as well as rise and in order to keep eve fresh for new players and future generations of allianceeffort we need to ensure that 00 doesnt become so secure and dugin that it disenfranchises all incoming effort and aspiration to overturn existing power structuresnot only is that statement factually wrong  there is a cost to failure and defeat in wars  as demonstrated by eve 00 politics every single day    but the proposed solution destructible outposts will not solve the ops percieved problem of disenfranchisement but will indeed make it worseask yourself  who exactly will benefit from the introduction of destructible outposts will it be the upstarts seeking to overturn the established order  or will it be the established order itselfas it stands well organised upstarts can  if they put effort into it  which they should   sieze their own pieces of 00 either capturing existing outposts or establishing outposts of their own indeed if they are well organised they even  under the current system  have a chance of defending and holding onto their space in the face of hostile invasion if they are dedicated enoughunder the proposed system upstarts will have no chance of becoming established whatsoever  unless they are already accepting the protection of an existing 00 superpower the fact is that alliances such as goonswarm red alliance and bob have the capacity to crush and strangle infant 00 alliances at birth why dont they do so because they then have to worry about the logistics of maintaining and defending new areas  or finding tenants   and in the process stretching their own logisticsindustrial capacities  and pilots   beyond breaking point after all who actually finds refueling poses fun however under the destructible outpost scenario what we will see is the upstart alliances infrastructure and outposts destroyed if one of their members so much as farts in the megablocks direction db preacher sirmolle fred in the upstart alliance just accused bob of being bullies on caodsirmolle hmmm did he now where do they livedbp they have an outpost in cursesirmolle okay summon the fleet operation cleanse catch is now underway inform all our pilots it will be a two week operation we go in blow up their outposts and then head back to delve for some dyspro moon mining rnr job donedbp thatll teach emokay  a slightly tongue in cheek example  but certainly a serious scenario if smaller or upstart alliances cannot defend their holdings against the superpowers then there will be absolutely zero incentive for them to put their assets at risk in 00 when they can be destroyed on mere whimsif people think 00 has too many napfests and mutual protection agreements now then just imagine what sort of self protection agreements people will seek in the future if their infrastructure could be at risk at the whim of the megablocks  we can kiss relatively independent or neutral alliances goodbye as i mentioned above the superpowers of eve already have the option of crushing those who oppose them but are held back by logistical considerations they are also held back by the fact that deposed alliances have the opportunity to regain and recapture their former holdings when the occupier has turned to focus on other things currently the loser has the option to harass and harry those who have vanquished them in an effort to regain their former outposts what incentive would they have  apart from revenge   if those former holdings no longer exist
as we saw when mc went on its rampage through the north  about a year ago   many of their conquests eventually returned to the hands of the people they had originally deposed i know that on occasions mc  in its heyday   turned down contracts to assault smaller alliances because the contractor had made no plans for the space once it had been captured these sort of considerations will not protect upstart or smaller alliances if outposts were destructible and could simply be griefed as part of a scorched earth approach3   it completely ignores the risk vs reward balancethe op possibly because he has never been a sov holder himself does not seem to realise that sov holding alliances invest gigantic amounts of time in maintaining their defensive assets and infrastructureyes there are rewards to living in 00 but those rewards are by no means shared equally across the 00 regions people in regions such as providence or syndicate can only dream about the rewards of regions such as delve or fountain and to implement destructible outposts on the premise that all 00 holders are making huge amounts of isk on the back of minimal risk is both incorrect hugely inequitable and agenda driventhe simple fact is that in many regions of eve 00 the potential rewards are not outweighed by the risk in fact quite the opposite hell i can earn more conducting level 4 missions in ziriert  low sec empire   than i can npcing or mining in providencebut isk is only one element of investment and i have already highlighted a much larger investment is made in the effort and game time that needs to be put into building the outposts and then maintaining their associated pos networks anyone who has had the appropriate roles within a sov holding alliance will realise exactly how much of an effort and strain it is to keep poses refueled armed and operating around the clock the stack of evemails from poses squacking for attention must have to be one of the most unfun things anyone ever has to log into yet people choose to do this because they are doing what eve is all about  building empires the investment of these players into their empires is huge yet people do it because they percieve the current system  flawed though it may be  is reasonably fair they can build their empire and have the chance to defend it they can build their outposts and have the opportunity to make back the isk invested the destructible outposts option removes that fairness it removes the balance between risk vs reward and removes the incentive of all but the most dedicated  or connected   to put the effort  isk and time wise   into developing 00if people really do want to see outposts go boom then at least one or both of the following things have to happena   the effortisk required to build and maintain infrastructure is significantly reduced by ccpb   the attacker seeking to destroy an outpost has to put in significantly more time into the process than is proposed by the op  reflecting the time invested by the sov holder in its upkeepmaintenance
4   it will increase barriers to 00 useas already highlighted the introduction of destructible outposts could have some seriously negative consequences  particularly in limiting the ability of newer smaller alliances to establish footholds in 00it will also effect how 00  particularly its markets   develop while most 00 alliances currently operate nbsi not all do and even within nbsi groupings you will often find corpsindividuals wo have bought blue standings in order to access 00 space its resources its markets and the opportunities that outpost provide for research industry and productionoutposts are the basis on which 00 is developing they are the basis on which economies are developing in 00 do we really want to restrict all economic activity to empire or to the megablocks who have the ability to defend their outposts from random attacks from groups of pvpers who cannot be arsed to put any real effort ini will talk about providence for a second because that is the 00 region that i know best providence is to some extent a special case as it is an nrds region  however it also provides a blueprint for how 00 canwill develop in the futureover 17 outposts have now been constructed in providence by alliances such as cva lfs paxton  sev3rance these outposts have resulted in a dramatic rise in the number of residents in providence  not just in the sov holding alliances but also in numerous neutral and friendly corporations and individuals who have come to the region as a result of the infrastructure that is availablethese new residents are using the facilities provided by these stations to develop industry to develop a proper 00 market to research to build and to have a home yes they are taking a risk these outposts could be captured and their docking rights revoked and more importantly they are having to fly around in 00 where sentry guns or concord arent going to come to their recueas other 00 regions develop to a similar or more advanced state i see this trend continuing to a point where 00 does become a viable alternative home for eves industrialists but will these people come if the outposts from which they do business from the outposts in which they store their assets were destroyable i think notwe should be looking at ways to enhance and grow the populations of 00  for any number of reasons  and i do not see that destructible outposts will do anything other than encourage industrialists to stay in empire or join the megablock alliances who can reduce the risk to acceptable levels
5   it will reduce pvpsome people seem to think that outposts offer some kind of security blanket for 00 residents that all they do is encourage dock monkeys  however if we really think people being able to dock to seek protection is a good reason for introducing destructible outposts then we may as well ban logging off and poses toooutposts attract people to 00 they encourage trade and industry this means that more people are in 00 and more people are potential victims yes some will dock  but would you rather be raiding space crawling with potential targets or raiding devastated regions devoid of activity apart from the occasional npcer who will simply warp to their pos the moment you enter localoutposts give people a reason to fight they give people a reason to defend space and fight for it they give people reasons to form gangs to fight raiders interedicting their outposts and their trade making outposts destructible will simply reduce pvp opportunity  not enhance it 6   it damages the history of eveas an eve rper i love the fact that outposts have histories that every outpost has its story the changes in ownership the battles and wars fought over them take fat or 9uy for instance these names resonate with me because they have over time been home to epic encounters battles sieges and counter siegesthats why in my mind destroying outposts is the same as destroying eve history outposts offer the one true player footprint on this games history and i would be extremely saddened if we throw all of that away simply for a bigger bang
alternativeswhilst i do not support the concept of destructible outposts as outlined by the op i do so based on the games mechanics as they currently stand as i have mentioned above i could potentially see fit to support destructible outposts if the requirements to build  and more importantly maintain   them were signifcantly reduced  but that is for a separate discussion   or if the attackers were required to invest significantly more time and resources into making them destructible to reflect the time and effort that has gone into buildingcapturing and maintaining them in the first place for example attackers could be required to hold onto the station for an extended period  ie two weeks   during which they have to pack the station with specific resources  reflecting the original isk investment in the station   in order to create a giant station destroying bomb and initiating a destruct countdownanother nondestructive alternative which could give attackers a slightly more affordable and less demanding way of inflicting pain on existing sov holders would be to offer attackers the ability to decommission outposts when they are captured  making them derelictunusable for a specific period  ie two weeksmonth   if the original sov holder  or anyone else   manages to regain control they they would then need to make an investment of their own in order to recommissionrefit the outpost and return it to active dutyconclusionas outlined above i do not believe the current system outpost is significantly unbalanced and believe that there are many more urgent issues which require the csms attention which will have more impact on improving this gamei also believe the proposal as outlined by the op would have significant negative consequences on 00 its residents and anyone thinking of moving or working in 00 in the futureunder the current sov mechanics it will completely wreck the risk vs reward balance and significantly reduce 00 politics drama excitement and interest turning 00 into an environment populated only by the megablocks and their petsi wholeheartedly recommend that people reject this proposal and that the other csm members have the commonsense to prevent this proposal from moving forward to iceland
i support destructable outpostsinvulnerability devalues them player built objects should always be destructable in 00 space its maintaining continuityemersion and doesnt lend to visions of outpost extinctionthis overstates the gameplay varibles you say the amount of outposts in 00 have taken years to colect ofcourse it has but now things are established we dont need the growth fast track any more eve is designed to be a long haul game where gameplay must be robust to suvive many years in balance outpost growth is far too asymeteric and will cause problems later actually alot of things in this respect are broken take capital ships for example but thats another discussion
i havent read your post yet hardin but i am going to comment on a few things from aboveactually the large alliance does not lose a single station in the above scenario this is because its not in the others best interest to attack the larger entityunlikely smaller alliances have as much to gain by allying as they have to lose allying leads to more power and blocks but allying has less costs than fighting hence the small alliances and large alliance all team up on one small alliance at a time because they dont get redrawn continually they get redrawn once any continual redrawing will be large alliances moving the 00 situation back to the status quo that it settled atno if those stations were destructible bob would have destroyed them and we would have had no easy forward logistical base to attack them we wouldnt have even got into delveafford is a relative term ships and modules and stations all have costs ships have insurance to offset the loss stations dont explode leaving them as a foothold for any future alliance which wants to play the game dont build what you cant afford to lose isnt the issue the issue is that some parties want to increase the costs i suppose you also support removing insurance for all tech 1 ships because after all dont fly what you cant afford to losethink of outposts as part of the gameboard of 00 if you can destroy the game board then new players cant join in there is no where for them to go you have increased the costs of entering into the game but the risks are all relatively the same losing access to station until you take it back more or less equals having station blown up since for all intents and purposes its now useless to you   this isnt a problem if the game has a set ending point where one side hits the win conditions it is a problem when the game does not
for those championing the status quo id ask two questions1   if outposts had always been destructable would it make sense to argue that they should be changed to be invulnerable2   should poses be indestructable and instead just be captureable
destructable outposts quite simply will lead to far far fewer alliances and corps in 00 and not more super alliances will roll into an area and destroy thier enemies and destroy the outposts they do not have to consider securing and defending the space they conquer this change in mechanic would introduce an entire new concept of outpost griefing to eve this griefing wont be done by small corps and small alliances as they currently cannot do it and changing this mechanic will not alter that particular aspect of gameplay outpost griefing will be propogated by the very alliances that this change is intended to make life in 00 harder for small alliances who spend weeks and months building outposts and setting up a defense network will see thier assests elimintated by the swarm or bob or aaa and will never again return to 00 and never again attempt to build something in null spacei find it terribly amusing that the most vocal and rabid champion for outpost destruction is from an alliance leader that has never built one never defended one never maintained a defensive network and never been a part of a corp or an alliance that was even remotely capable of destroying onei support dynamism in 00 but unforutnately we have a zealot with a pet project with no actual experience trying to force feed a solution that doesnt solve anything on the eve community
it could work if it took more than a month or two this would represent a serious commitment in manpower to hold the station for long enough could be done by retreating alliances to deny them to the enemy as a valid tactic if they do not feel they would be able to retake it for some time or various other reasons anything less than a month is certainly going to cause grief
1   yes2   nobtw i am not arguing for the status quo if you read my post you will see that i have suggested some alternatives certainly the current system  particularly the amount of effort that goes into maintaining pos networks is insane and i do agree that attackers do need other options to inflict damage on sov holding alliances i simply do not believe that destructible outposts  within the constraints of current gamesov mechanics   are a proper solutionthis leads me back to my original point why propose a change that will require gigantic balancing and effort from ccp on an issue which appears to have little appreciable benefit for the majority of eve players when we could be focusing on the numerous little  more achievable   changes which will incrementally and collectively make eve a better game for us all
1   yes im not championing the status quo i just disagree with jades predictions about what will happen in a few months when goons have blown all the small fish out of 00 and even less people go there we will still want 00 to have more people and thus more things happening im a carebear infrastructure brings people is my motto dont really care who holds the infrastructure as long as exists2   i would say yes wed see more fights over them i think with the expense for the wars coming from the pewpew guys pockets  all the dreads  bses being blown up   and less from the logistics  industrialist guys pockets  cost of setting up poses   and perhaps even more traffic to 00 andor small alliances taking over some of these things temporarilythe moons are static lets face that so why not call the pos part of the moon  site and just let people take control and  or abandon if they so wish whats the point of a moon are we trying to preserve the pristine beauty of the eve landscapeyes were dotting the landscape with hardware how about this any pos will rust and selfdestruct its tower and all its components if unfueled and unused for 30 days just like cans any outpost will blow itself out too if its not used  claimed  visited by anyone for 30 days let the things rust into nothingness otherwise indestructible you can conquer them and use them if you so wish but not destroy themi would support that
nothing really to add to what hardin said but to agree destructable outposts does nothing to improve the situation in 00 it does nothing to help the smaller organizations succeed  over the status quo   in capturing outposts it does everything to help larger organizations bail out of having to secure captured spacewith current seige mechanics theres little a smaller alliance can do in the face of a larger alliance once a larger alliance decides to conquer that smaller alliance skill is rarely a factor in the inherently laggy environment of seige warfare so sheer numbers tend to rule the outcome with that in mind the best a smaller alliance can do is maintain a powerful enough presence to fall into the category of not worth the trouble the trouble in this case is not just taking spacebut retaining space take away that retaining requirement and theres nothing stopping a larger alliance from rolling right over a smaller alliancejust becausesmaller alliances being forced out of 00 because larger alliances can blow in and wreck outposts for no real reason other than to just do it doesnt strike me as a dynamic result maybe dynamic for the couple of months it takes for all the smaller alliances to lose their outposts to the current powerblocksbut then a static pattern of smaller alliances trying to set up in unclaimed space meeting the requirements for constructing an outpost constructing said outpost and then getting beat down by the first large alliance to notice and going back to whatever it was they were doing before they decided to take part in 00 politics  that they heard were now dynamic because outposts are destructible  now going back to another point hardin made address other issues first if the current state of seige warfare  he who brings the most capssupercaps wins   can be altered somehowmaybe this is something that could be readdressed but seriouslyif the only feasible means to keep an outpost alive is the ability to tactically defeat  rather than strategically deter   whomever the current superpower s   might be then folks are just gonna stop building outposts to begin with and 00 will become more static than ever
second point first i already suggested that a possible alternative in one of my other postsfirst point i have to disagree because i see that as massively assumptive assumptive that once the larger powers move to sweep aside the smaller groups that a   they will succeed unmolested and b   once they do so nobody else other than existing 00 great powers will be able to force themselves into the area later due to the larger powers interventiona   is debatable b   is wrong because there are plenty of nurseries for minor powers to learn their trade regions with capturable stations like cloud ring and npc 00 regions these have traditionally been staging posts for young alliances to springboard into 00 in some cases forcing older groups out and taking their outposts in other building their ownalso major powers some times fall apart all by themselves with no outside intervention
to me it seems the point of the proposal is about financial attritioncurrently if an alliance loses an outpost only to regain it later theres no financial loss because the initial investment of the outpost was regainedbut if an outpost is destroyed and rebuilt isk has been drained from the economyfor the same reason that on a smaller level poses can be destroyed instead of simply captured it makes sense for outposts to function the same way  the stakes are just higherwhat am i missing there
youre fudging in a part of the equation that is highly unlikelynobody is going to build outposts if the only way to stop them from being blown up is to have the most capable capfleet if theres no path to power simply because the current powerblocs have any easy way to prevent anyone from taking that paththen nothing will change the only way to compete on a 00 level will be to have the same level of power as the current powerblocs who have been building that power in 00 for yearspower that was gained because they were actually able to start from scratch without having their efforts erased by somebody else without consequencenobody will have the desire to build  and certainly not rebuild   an outpost just to see it blown up because x powerbloc was bored and decided to do it knowing the only responsibility tied to conquering the outpost would be blowing it up
outposts cannot defend themselves and teh proposed time frame to take an outpost is a week to switch sov that could be a long holiday in one country affecting alliance strength to come back to all their stuff is crapped something that took a month or more i am not opposed to most alliances would need an actual purpose to seige a region for 1 or 2 months to blow up outposts from upstarts to prevent having to deal with them latermake it take a month to enable the option or let outposts fit tons of guns and such that make it a conquerable objective and an amazing amount of shield regen not just shield strength and why not as it is i dont think the mechanic is so broken it needs this much attention to improve this aspect general 00 lagfest and captials online seem like more worthy efforts
everythingtheres no such thing as financial attrition where outposts are concerned theyre not  and havent been for about 2 years   money makers theyre not transferrable the isk is lost the second you put it up financial attrition is all about mining pos destruction nothing can compare to the impact of losing 23 dyspro moons inside a couple of weeks  and lets face it  even small alliances can throw 20b away every few weeks without batting an eyelid  outposts are absolutely and entirely strategic assets theyre a place to safely shelter repair and restock both your capital and conventional fleets they provide a base from which you can push forwardagain to use goonswarm as an example had outposts been destructible there would now only be the poorlyplaced conquerables 3 per region between delve and cache bob could have retreated back to delve happy in the knowledge that anyone who wanted to realistically attack them from that front would have to spend months and months attaining sov 3 in every strategic system and reerecting outposts so that they had the infrastructure to attackinstead the infrastructure was left in place and bob were left stretched across a dozen regions they simply could not defend that space but they still had to you cannot allow your opponents to gain the security of a well placed outpostdestruction of the infrastructure allows you to exert a hold equivalent to holding the outposts under current mechanics long after youve left the space then simply through the virtue of being the dominant power whenever anyone even thinks about putting up new outposts you can crush them as you hold the monopoly on secure space
cant this argument be made about poses on a smaller level
yes and it does how many people do you see putting up individual poses in bobs space however its not stricty relevant poses arent as effective as strategic tools as outposts are they dont allow you to exert the same kind of influence an outpost does
is the objection then just about the price of the outpost i would think that simply bringing down the cost of erecting an outpost to suitably balance the loss of invulnerability would be all thats needed to allow it to be brought in line with everything else in the eve universe that is destructible and shouldnt be builtflown unless you can afford to lose itif the cost of outposts were rebalanced along with the introduction of selfdestruct capability what objections would there be at that point
assests stored inside outposts can easily equal teh cost of the outpost in long held systems2 or 3 builders can have assets this size i am normally dirt poor but we can have a billion in ships on the market and mineral stockpiles that could not be moved out in the time frame implied we are small timers though others would have significantly bigger losses the issue then becomes dont fly what you cant afford to lose but instead dont put stuff where it could be permanently destroyed at least with current outposts it still exists even if you cant get to itotherwise if an outpost is say 3 bil instead of 20 bil and easiser to put up then go for it if it is a less crippling blow to lose one then it could be balanced
cost doesnt and shouldnt come into any balance discussion in eve its really not significant at allthe value of outposts exists in their strategic importance but more importantly the denial of strategic control to your opponents that an outpost grants you to access that denial of strategic control you must commit to holding and defending the outpostif you can destroy the outpost rather than having to defend it you can attain the same level of effectiveness without the same level of investment  that is investment in terms of pilot time as i said cost doesnt come into it  it just isnt balanced and gives too much power to the established already dominant powers who would no longer have to extend themselves to control dozens of regions at a timeed again by control dozens of regions i really mean deny control of the regions to potential opponents its just as if not more important
if you lowered teh requirements for an outpost across the board it would be fine just expect every system tha can have one to have one like a giant pos then become more like corp outposts instead of alliance outposts why build a pos when an outpost will let you store more ships or melt oreice faster
so long as people can later retrieve whatever was in their hangar then thumbs up
this isnt an issue with the example solution i proposed in the op personal hangers would still be accessible from the derelict outpost post self destruction
the objections would then likely change to flavor of the game type objections eve becoming fastpaced capture the flag in space or whatever instead of a politicalstrategiceconomic simulator where building something that lasts actually mattersbut yes what you propose would at least be balanced
okay that makes sense so lets focus on the flavor argumentthe charge of capture the flag in space actually applies far more accurately to indestructable outposts rather than destructable oneswhen outposts are destroyed and rebuilt economicpoliticalstrategic factors come into play  when they are invulnerable its just a game of king of the hill
currently the considerations for taking an outpost are can we take it and can we hold it the former is usually a more tactical consideration the latter bears almost all of the economicpoliticalstrategic weightyour proposal removes the can we hold it considerationhow does that make the game more economicpoliticalstrategic if we have learned anything with eve its that there are a whole lot of players and organizations who do stuff for no better reason than because they can if people are given the option to take out outposts because they can without having to consider much else at all how does that improve gameplay and atmosphere
i see what youre getting at but the balance of what youre laying out is thrown out of whack by the fact that new outposts can be constructedsuppose we were having this argument about moons and someone was proposing that players be able to field a moonbuster weapon to destroy high value moons in order to deny them to their enemies then all of the arguments youre fielding would ring incredibly truelikewise if outposts were seeded throughout 00 and new ones couldnt be built then it would make sense to treat them like counterstrike capture points and argue that to destroy them would lead to a scorchedearth empty and lifeless 00however that is not the case  outposts are analagous to poses not to moons destroying an outpost is not tantamount to destroying the gameboard its simply destroying a piece on the board in a linear game with an end like monopoly the board can eventually be covered in hotels  eve is not like that it needs to live and breathe and grow and crumble and grow again
i dont think that the proposal does it simply adds another variable if we cant hold it permanently can we hold it long enough to destroy ityes the lulz crowd certainly exist but every age has had its barbarians i would expect though that an organized alliance would be both better able to defend itself against such and better able to recover from their assaults however i can understand that a hard working alliance who have put everything into gaining and maintaining sov and building their empire from nothing would be more than a little ed off at the prospect of a gtc fueled lulz fleet descending like a pack of locusts simply to destroy stations for the bang for that reason i am inclined to say that hardins prereqs for destruction being an equal or greater cost than the construction of a station might be necessary to make it prohibitively expensive to do it just for kicks and because you can it would also i think be a requirement to isk sink that purchase by making the demolition tools npc sales onlyin such a case destroying it for tactical or strategic reasons may still make sense regardless of the huge cost but only fools will buy enough gtcs to do the job for kicks
the case most folks are making that do not support outpost destruction is quite simply that destructable outposts will not serve this function the reason doesnt change if people can blow up outposts without having to plan for any considerations beyond the destruction of the outpost itself then no rational person not belonging to a powerbloc is ever going to build an outpost againone particular function destructable outposts would serve is for empire based organizations to potentially cause crippling economic and strategic damage to a 00 based organizationwhile leaving the 00 organization completely without strategic recourse  taking out the stations the empire based organization stages out of   that might also strike people as a problem
one of the most well known lulz crowds currently in existence is love em or hate em one of the most powerful organizations in the game i suppose when goons start knocking over outposts because they can now do so without having to care what happens to the system it will be the fault of the victims that they were badly organized and unable to better defend themselves against a 5000 strong alliance
i dont think you can make that blanket statement  after all does it not come down to risk vs reward if a 00 organization reaches a point in its rise to power at which it feels it can both benefit from an outpost and defend it against attackrecover from its loss it would be rational to build one if outposts were destructable this point would still be reached it would simply be another factor in the calculations of risk vs rewardthis is an interesting point  however does this not also apply to pos an empire organization can currently strike at 00 pos and the pos owner is in an identical situation if it is okay for pos why not for outpost
partly because the comparison between an empire station and a pos is a weak one and partly because a lot of empire based folks can and do have poses anyway at least that possibility for recourse exists or perhaps more clearly if you take out my pos in 00 and you have one of your own in lowsec i can take it out if you take out my pos in 00 and dont have one of your own in lowsecyoure not benefitting from it anyway howeverif you take out my outpost and dont have one of your own it might be because youre based out of an empire station and are benefitting from having an outpost without actually risking one
this for me is the strongest argument against we all want to leave our mark and eve uniquely amongst mmos gives us a single contiguous history from the first pilots to log into the game to the latest noob when i first began to play eve i was awestruck by this even things like anchored cans in empty high sec systems giving tribute to fallen comrades gave me a certain feeling of awe this i told myself was a game with real history yet sadly to me at least all those cans those little marks and scratchings that previous generations of pod pilots had left to welcome my noob self to this universe have now been tidied up to reduce lag when i first began to run the odd mission and came across ones with wrecked and ruined stations i wondered why they were there what was the history of this burned out caldari station in gallente territory only to be saddened to realise that there was none it was a randomly generated mission location that would despawn once the mission was overi really can see where you are coming from with the history and story of the outposts but i dont think that has to go any destroyed station should leave a permanent ruin something for noobs to stare at in awe hearing that for years battle raged between two implacable foes until the holders fell and the station was put to the torchid even go so far as to demand that ccp allow players to build and permanently anchor expensive memorials nearby with the ability to enter an explanation of what happened there all that time ago
would you think it fine if capital ships or just supercapitals or just titans were indestructable why have assets that can be destroyed at allwould you think it fine if pos were indestructable or only capturablegetting your capital fleet destroyed certainly doesnt lead to growth or selfreliance it has exactly the same effects that people are arguing against destructable outposts for the fact that they have something to lose is what drives people to form powerblocs and huddle in the blob together they are minimizing risk this risk is also the vital compotent that makes eve what it is big fat bloated powerblocs are already happening and adding outposts to the list of things that might explode if you use have them will not change this one little bit superpowers griefing smaller entities will happen anyway they dont need to hold what they conquer they can choose to sell it abandon it or install a petcare to list the independant space holding alliances they dont exist and the closest you get are in the armpits of claimable 00outposts shouldnt be forever nothing players build should be
im going to disagree with this simply on the point that its bloody unfair to change the rules of the game 34 years down the line from when alliances first started building outpostsmany alliances when they first considered building outposts had many considerations 1   cost 2   difficulty to build the outpost egg 3   getting the resources needing to be placed in the egg to the target system where outpost will be deployed this requires effort team work and massive commitment over an extended period of time then hours need to be spent filling the egg in target system  especially back in the time before freighters could be used at poss so hauling to eggs had to be done with regular haulers  that is a serious amount of time and effort just to build on top of that they have to deploy multiple poss in the system before hand and spend weeks building up sovereignty and defending those poses and contiunously fueling those poss which in itself costs significant amounts of isk on a regular and sustained basisthe decision to build an outpost is based on what it takes to build it to haul and deploy compared to what it can bring you for that reward that reward was a permanent outpost there no matter if you got kicked out of there laterthese are the variables allince took before building outposts it simply is not fair to change the rules after they have made the decision it destroys long term alliance planning and it makes a joke of the effort and time taken in deploying itthis goes for all things reallyccp set 00 with a certain set of mechanics people have played for 5 years based on those rules and based what they have done on those rules it simply is not fair to change the rules now have the investment of hundreds of billion of isk has been made unless you keep those outposts permanent and change the rules for outposts deployed after a certain date people should know the facts before making an investment
but the outpostdweller also has access to empire stations so thats a wash isnt it and really its the space that the outpost is in that is valuable  the rats the belts the moons and those are still there noi see what youre saying about the true benefit of an outpost being the strategic advantages it gives  but i dont see why those advantages cant be factored into the riskreward equation in balancing destructable outposts  including how difficult they are to conquer and explode
i am going to disagree the powerblocks will keep whatever space they want for themselves rent out what they feel is a good return and burn the rest abandoning outposts why would that happen if you could destroy them so only the very finest areas of 00 should have outposts and encourage growth with the mechanics as they are considering this now is quite premature
if you put yourself in the firing line then i suppose you have to take some of the blame i dont think we should be playing in safety blanket mode simply so that small alliances are protected from the depradations of the wolves there are 250000   a few   other players the goons regardless of their notable attitudes might well be able to knock over a smallmediumlarge alliance or two but they have already burned up a lot of the good will people felt towards them for taking on bobi think that going on an epic escapade across 00 blowing up every station they came across would see a rapid coalescence of opposition to their particular brand of humour it might even turn into a truly epic war that the last great war could have been but in the end failed to be  from my perspective at least  
well you shot your own argument down now that freighers can do the job there isnt a lot of time or effort involved and the cost isnt anything astronomical eitherby the same logic titans would need to be invulnerable because they also require a lot of money and a lot of hauling
make every strategic staging location destructable and im out of arguments frankly as it stands everybody who does pvp risks something in the fight however zooming out to the strategic picture not everybody capable of destroying an outpost were it possible risks an outpost themselves that might be an interesting concept actually but a whole other discussion right you are contrary to the ops opinion that it mightthey need to do something with what they conquer they need an ally a customer a plan to hang onto it themselves something but if they can just choose to blow it upthen they need nothing they dont need to consider anything they can just do it and then suddenly instead of fighting for outposts and space for strategiceconomicpolitical considerations you have people blowing up outposts just because the current considerations for strategic conquest in eve is a fairly defining part of the game i figure
what does that matter they certainly should be able to burn the rest it changes nothing for the little guythe fact that parts of 00 are entirely worthless is a whole different problem altogether and has nothing to do with outposts space of value will be taken and not left to whomever the independant little guy is every bit as much out on his ass
i think that we are arguing in circles at this pointthe two main opposing points seem to be1 everything that players build should be destructiblevs 2 destroying an outpost should take as much time and cash as it took to build itthe devil is in the details specifically how much time and effort destroying an outpost should take there have been several proposals that seem to want a 1 month hard coded minimum time limit opposing jades original proposal of 72 hoursim opposing the 72 hours thing it is a laughably short period of time considering how much effort and hardcoded waiting time it takes to build one of these things if you want to have a 30day countdown during which you can hold the outpost and defend it so you can blow it up while the previous owners attack it so they can take it back be my guest 30days though
how about a week
now they can yes but many of those outposts when deployed did not have this option my simple point stands it is unfair to change the rules after the fact super caps have never been said these are indestructable outposts have and have been built for that reasonif ccp change it so all outposts which have been constructed are destructable now they lose all credibility if they want destructible outposts draw a line in the sand and all built already remain so the cost of outpost construction reduced and difficulty in deploying reducedit is the only fair way to do it in light of people who have deployed already
thats why i have come to agree with hardins caveat make it cost a load of isk to destroy outposts so much that an alliance would have to decide between blowing that outpost building an outpost of their own in their own space or another mothership and fittings etc
heh heh how about a year and we can negotiate and reach a compromise of 6 months ill throw in the stuff inside it can blow up along with the outpost
i dont see how assuming destructable outposts outpost dweller can lose outpost empire dweller with sufficient means can kill outpost outpost dweller cannot strike back at empire dweller on an equivalent level outpost dweller ends up back in empire having riskedlost outpostempire dweller continues living in empire having taken out outpost and riskinglosing nothing of the sort yes during the fight both sides risked ships and lost shipsbut once all the risking and losing of equivalent assets is all done if the outpost owning organization losesthey further lose an asset that the empire dwelling organization never risked to begin with  
the ops opinion on what effect it would have has no bearing on whether this is a good idea or notand by choosing destruction they lose out on a potential source of income there isnt exactly a shortage of pets as best as i can tell its for this very reason that outposts arent just abandoned all over the place they have value destroying them comes at a costconquering outposts isnt something you do just because as it is already pos warfare isnt exactly considered fun and obviously someone shouldnt be able to just rock up at your outpost with a roaming fleet one night because they are bored destroy the outpost and then skip home for tea and medals this should be taken into account when balancing the actual mechanic
i am clearly all for 1as far as 2 is concerned destroying it might just cost more in terms of losses sustained in the process of this however isnt a constant and shouldnt bewe dont need to concern ourselves with the detailed balance of the mechanic in terms of time its a complete waste of time ccps game designers will do this themselves anyway and arguing about these details are entirely pointless the question is simply should outposts be destructablebut just because i cant resist id say a month is much too long if it is timed from the moment the outpost is conquered
and then the question is was the reward the outpostdweller gained from living in 00 worth the loss of the outpost just in the same way that taking a ratting battleship into 00 is a risk but could result in some rewardall the other elements of eve follow this formula  i think it makes perfect sense to bring outposts in line with it and there needs to be a convincing argument why outposts should be an exception
fair point why do you think its a good idea then what benefit to the game would be brought about by making outpost destruction a reality
worth remembering that while 72hours may sound like a laughably short period of time  this clock doesnt even start ticking until you have won a conventional sovereignty battle and already own the outpost further there is another 48 hours on the clock till it blows up  during which time it opts out of sovereignty and can be recaptured by any friendly fleet that cares too   now this was just a rough example illustrating how the destructible outpost concept could be delivered its not our job as players  or csm reps   to design this detail  thats up to ccp but what it is our job to do is to ask questions on the principle here  as i stated in the op   i would like to ask ccp if they see a role for destructible outposts in the 00 game many players of eve online would also like an answer to this question  if they tell us in reply they dont see a role for destructible outposts thats pretty much the end of the matter   so id like to pose a specific question now of anyone opposing this issue getting a place on the agenda why are you against the principle of simply discussing this why dont you want us to talk about it why do you believe that destructible outposts in 00 space must be a taboo issue
i realllllyyyyyyyyyyyy want this to happenps i just doomed this thread again
this has been done several times in the thread
outposts are an exception to the rule in eve loss is an important factor of what makes eve tick i see no reason for this exception to exist its not a sandbox if the sandcastles cant be stepped on and i worship big explosions
well youve said why you think it would be bad for xyz reason which may or may not make sense from your own perspective but you havent said why you wont trust ccp to make a sensible decision on this score if its raised as an issue for formal discussion
and this
this is what i absolutely agree with
this process is to decide what we feel is important for ccp to look at not something else many have said no and given reasons do not turn this into something it is not
i think a big concern is that outpost destruction would make sandcastle stepping a much more attractive alternative to sandcastle buildingwhich can be equally destructive to the funfactor of a sandboxjade i think hardin addressed your question quite directly in his far more thorough post there are hotter issues to the balance of the game for instance if sovereignty and seige mechanics can be addressed to a point that seige warfare is a lot more funplayable then 00 would become more dynamic without introducing a new mechanic that could be far too easily abused  and make 00 a lot less dynamic   as things currently stand
yep and many have spoken and said yes i guess ultimately itll be good to ask ccp the question right
in that case theres no reason not to bring it up with ccp alongside those other concerns  they can tell us if they are already planning something else that they think would be better to try first and come back to the destructability question lateri agree with jades point that theres nothing to be gained by not asking about it
jade i have no issue with destructible outposts being introduced as a different kind of outpost to currentcurrent outposts should not be destructible my main issue is that it is not fair on outpost owners to have the rules changed on them after they have weighed up all the pros and cons and decided to go ahead with itcan you honestly think of a fair way to make current outposts destructable without screwing up hundreds of billions of isk invested by people in something which ccp says these cannot be destroyed
well options are better than no options right because at the moment these is no option beside conquering and becoming outpost holders a true sandbox game should not restrict gameplay to only one optimal path it should allow players to use creative solutions and decide how they want to play the game why do you think its a good idea to force roving pvp powers to become territorially rooted if they want to hurt their enemies for example i dont agree of course i think at the moment 00 territorial warfare and stagnation and lack of balance  ie massive defense advantage   is one of the single hottest issues in the game i believe destructible outposts could go a long way to redressing this imbalance and i would like to hear ccps opinion on this and i think a lot of other players would also be interested in hearing this opinion and about ccps future intentions in this regard
ccp has enough problems distracting themselves with new features before fixing old ones lets not complicate things with csm also throwing in new feature ideaswhat id like to see csm approach ccp with is a unified front of the playerbase wants you to fix your game first
ccp rarely does anything right and destructible stations would be used for completely different reasons than you are thinking about name one time where a large alliance lost a station because they ignored it and then retook it in 47 days the closest i can think of is a large alliance losing a station for about 23weeks and taking it back and even then there was major fightingas i stated earlier the only purpose this would serve would be large alliances walking in and destroying smaller alliances outposts because they dont want the logistical nightmare of running it even then theyd probably rather sell the station and make some isk off iti think it be pretty fun thoughoh and they probably wont ever do it because of the programing nightmare it would become with clones  ships and possible exploits etc
wrong at this stage the reps will have to decide and vote on it as i understand if it achieves enough support from he reps then it goes to ccp they can then decide to take action on it or blow the idea off
how seriously reasons have been given why this would very likely lock out a lot of folks from 00 how do you think destructable outposts will fix the stagnation of 00
i think with the current sovreignty mechanics we are safe from that one but yes and thats a balance issue i would agree that fixing pos warfare should be a higher priority but thats very much up to ccp this is however important enough to get on their list tell you what implement destructable outposts at the same time as fixed pos war
rules change balance is adjusted there are winners and losers in this process but the game goes on i liked doublemwd calvary ravens back in the gnw with the best of them  but ccp decided that was unbalanced and changed the rules perhaps titans will be changed in the near future  they already have been once    point is that ccp is within its rights  and our interest   to address unbalanced mechanics on the live server i really dont believe that your argument holds water since outposts today have been buffed immensely since introduction in dozens of ways  simply removing the indestructibility training wheels is not an unfair counter adjustment i believe the example i cited in the op would be a fair way to go about it when outposts were introduced you had no jumpbridges titans cynojammers and all the rest to do the logistics for you today erecting outposts is a task many many times easier to achieve that when they were introduced and they are much cheaper in relative terms than the earliest prototypes 00 today is massively more secure for the territorial holder than it was destructible outposts would be in my opinion a reasonable counterbalance for a situation that has been skewed in the favour of the defender for far too long
well that is one way of looking at the csm  but just looking at the topics up for votes and issues posted by players on this forum new ideas are a pretty big part of what players want from the csm i think thats a much broader argument that perhaps should be had but its not directly pertinent to this issue
again how just to use an example what would you have done differently against say sever3nce if right now outposts were suddenly destructable how would that have changed the situation for star fraction and ushrakhan at all in that warnow lets turn the tables and say star fraction had an outpost or two  not talking ideology here just size comparison   and cva wanted to come knocking now cva have plenty of crap to take care of in our own spacebut it sure would be nice to take out some sf outposts yeah if we dont have to hold on to those outposts if we can just roll in execute a monthlong campaign push a button and its all gonewere gonna be a lot more likely to execute that campaign than if we have to try and figure out a way to include 2 new outposts into our logistical scheme as well as provide adequate protection destructable outposts allows us to take on a campaign that under current mechanics isnt worth the trouble  or more to the point would overstretch our capabilities  so the way i see it destructable outposts does nothing to strengthen smaller alliances in the face of larger alliances and does everything to allow already powerful alliances to actually overreach their grasp and improves their ability to push around the smaller allianceshow does that improve the situation at all
lots of the folks that agree with jades obsession site the if you can build it it should destroyable if that is the reason for a yay than i reckon the reasoned approach which balances the builders investment with the destroyers investment is fineas long as in the end you can still make it go boomi propose a modification to jades proposal to reflect hardins point of making it cost as much to destroy as to build andor a modification that after holding the outpost for 60 days you can at any time make it go boomif the driving force behind support for jades obessision is the fundamental principal that that which shall be built shall be destroyedi suspect that many of the yays would favor such a price for destructionand i certainly echo the sentiments of many of the goonies and others that there are more pressing game breaking issues in eve than taking outposts and making them destroyable but alas our chairman is more interested in shaping eve to jade fractions vision than he is in improving the game or more likelyhe is so convinced that jade fractions play style is the right and proper way to play and therefor we should all be forced to play as he and his merry men doa very big  although not surpising disappointment in the csm process rather fascinating to me that the two alliances that outpost destruction would benefit most bob and goonies more or less oppose this certainly thier members on the committee are responsible enough to the csm program to put the good of eve ahead of thier indivudal agendas and play styles can you imagine this process if each member was vigorously and self servingly proposing and defending agenda items that only served thier corporation and alliance interests as jade continues to do in virtually every post and thread
there is already so much risk involved with living in 00 why should someone now risk losing all their station assets if they go on vacation for a week as it is now you can always sell what you have stuck in a station or retake it or join a corp that does have access youre now discussing eliminating the assets permanently or making them unreachable until someone pays an excessive fee if you want to increase the risk of living in 00 so dramatically then the reward should be larger much larger of course this would cause inflation but oh well you empire squatters can only think of the epic loot cans and big explosions because you live in areas with no risk you want to harvest the loot and tears of those who live in 00 while taking no comparable risk yourselves having destructible outposts is a surefire way to decrease the population of 00 and reserve it only for large power blocks is this what you want large powers will raze undesirable 00 for the luls force out everyone who is small and unaligned to a major block even if assets are still available in some form  eg salvage   the area becomes unlivable living out of a pos is unacceptable to most of eve  its terrible   have you actually lived out of a pos im not talking about basing out of one for a week while you  up someones territory im talking about producing ammo mods and ships from one and flying back to one from empire if you happen to get podded i must say that im not surprised that an empire hugger would come up with these ideas and become attached to them like some aspergers patient living in a station 5 jumps from lowsec in providence is very different from living in one 35 out you have no idea what you are talking about do you want to discuss the advantages of running level 4 missions in empire against that of maintaining and sustaining a 00 empire do you know anything of fueling all those poss or organizing a defense against aggression do you know anything of the political forces that threaten 00 alliances internally and externally do you even know how profitable 00 space is or what it costs to run it or do you just sit in your armchair dreaming of popping a dread with 50 stealth bombers to reiterate my main point you are suggesting that 00 residents should accept more risks and more threats for something that is not much more advantageous and profitable than highsecpiratesec you want them to accept this risk  for no gain   while you accept none
sounds great
larger alliances being able to take and destroy smaller alliances outposts simply because theres no longer any politicaleconomicstrategic reason not to doesnt sound so great to me doesnt sound like something that will stimulate dynamic 00 either sounds like something that will further encourage naptrains and blobs and discourage smaller alliances from participating in 00 at allexcept of course those that exist solely to destroy outposts from the safety of empire
when outposts were introduced and soverignty was introduced based on pos warfare how long did it take to destroy a single pos how many capital ships were around how many dreadnaughts were around they were a limited factor designed to help pos warfarenow it is possible for 100 dreadnaughts to be fielded against a pos it is now faster and easier to destroy poses than ever before and harder to defend againstto combat this and help alliances stop being steamrolled new mechanics were introduced did this make living in 00 easier possibly were they intended to be used as an outpost buff no they were introduced to make pos warfare more managablenew features should not be looked at in stand alone situations cyno jammers and jumpbridges make logistics easier lets remove them shall we we now have a system where dozens of dreadnaughts enter a system at will reinforce all towers in very feasibly under an hour to reinforce as many poses as seige cycle allows then 2 and a half days later they return and destroy those poses even faster  whats the record for a pos being destroyed out of reinforced i believe its under 5 mins  so an alliance does this and next down time sov drops lets look at the time scale on this 3 days from initial suprise strike to sov deadoutposts have not changed their value has not changed the effort in putting one up may gotten easier but this is in balance to the effort neccessary to defend them the mechanics surrounding their defence has changed in a response to the changing circumstances of the eve environment in which those mechanics applyyour argument is flawed becaused it is basing the argument to make outposts destroyable based on the development of pos warfare which developed in a way which was neccessary and although not neccesarily balanced has not impeded 00 warfare to a great effect in a way which was not intended to boost outpostscyno jammers and jump bridges are not restricted to solely outpost systems reliant upon the existance of an outpost if they were then i might just let you look at outposts in relation to these mechanics in isolation to the rest of eve however just because you cannot drop 100 dreadnaughts and destroy a system does not mean that someone or hell even everyone else in 00 cant do thatgive outposts defences give them a major major major boost ie 20 corp offices each all services at a good quality and then you can trade off these boosts against it being utterly destroyablewhat annoys me most about this is that you are looking at these mechanics and how they compare to other mechanics in isolation of the wider circumstances simply answer this question considering that outposts were given destructible station services which means they can be effectivly made useless which in essence for outposts was a nerf in what way are outposts unbalanced and needing to be made destructable how have they recieved any buffs that are not simply in response to another issue where any bonus they recieve is a side issue of the bigger picturewhen they were introduced they had a purpose and have the exact same purpose today they have not changed you say they are cheaper in relative terms how are they just because time has gone on and people have made empires the way ccp intended using the mechanics they intended to make living in the valuable parts of 00 profitable doesnt means things are any cheaperwhat concerns me most though is that if you the person making this thread had any experience in pos maintanence pos networksbuilding and owning and operating outposts then you would not be making this thread you are looking at 00 mechanics and saying this is how this works and this is unfair rabble rabble rabble instead of actually going out and experiencing all these things you are complaining about
nobody reads the last post on a page so i quoted for you
this sounds more like a laundry list of bogeymen than anything that actually relates to the topic unfortunatelyi dont think theres anything wrong with abiding by the eve philosophy that everything built by players can be destroyed and if you cant afford to lose it dont undock isnt bringing player constructed outposts in line with everything else in the game a valid issue to ask ccp for a response on these small alliancelarge alliance arguments dont follow logically at all  there will always be a costbenefit analysis and a riskreward ratio to considerafter all if what you suggest about the fate of destructable outposts were true why havent the goons swarmed across eve destroying every pos a smaller alliance has out there
im not picking on you here ikar but youll find it much easier to build a compelling argument if you avoid making it about the person raising the issue especially as in this case when your conclusions are so completely flawed as a result ive told you why i believe this is an issue that should be raised to ccp and why we should seek their answer on the issue of destructible outposts in 00 its your task  if you wish to debate productively in this thread   to tell me why you dont think it is sensible to raise this issue and ask this question illjudged attacks on the eveexperience of the op wont convince anybody but to address the point that youre trying to make  no ikar i dont believe that boring and repetitive tasks should be rewarded with increased defense bonuses and invulnerability ingame if pos and outpost management is a terribly boring gameplay element then by all means raise an issue to discuss that alongside potential solutions
good question
no its a dumb question youre equating killing some insignificant cheap tower in bodunk nowhere with the grief caused by destroying a station its a worthless argument grats for quoting it
hold on so on a post i wrote in a response to the points you raised about why this should go ahead your telling me to just argue why destructible outposts shouldnt be discussedlast time i checked this was a discussionyou have made claims about outposts being buffed in over a dozen ways as a validation for why they should be made destructable but you havent explained why this isyou are seizing upon the same issues and twisting them in several ways without putting them into the wider eve picture looking at why these features have been introduced and for what purposethis is your case to defend not mine to attack especially when you dont respond when i do attackand i think that it is a valid point about the op experience in something they are suggesting be changed especially when just because you are posting it means that it comes up on the agenda
because this is not what you were elected foryou were elected to be a check on ccp a way to bring actual issues to ccp and force them to respond on a personal level this is entirely something you want that will further your personal agendayou have not established how this would help the game nor how it would help the common man youre abusing your illgotten position as csm chair to bring your personal agenda into something that should have absolutely nothing to do with what you thinki dont understand how this has 7 pages of discussion are outposts an issue no theyre not theyre a point which causes and promotes extreme levels of combat in deep 00 if thats an issue in this game then  me whatve we been doing for 4 years
how is it a good question a pos requires a flat fee from an npc station it can be taken out and deployed in 12 hours and ready to go an outpost takes weeks of planning deploying of poses collecting sov hauling components building of egg securing travel to 00 system it is a much bigger target and much more egoinflating to kill and you can only have 1 per system
what its a terrible question and one ive already coveredposes and outposts are not comparable poses are not strategically significant but outposts are does a pos allow an entire alliance the ability to project their power across multiple constellations no does it take weeks of planning and building to construct no and as ive already said the isk involved in an outpost is fairly insignificant on the alliance scale  so how significant do you think poses are in the grand scheme of things
give the man a medalabsolute nothis entire issue has been twisted away from what is should be aboutno one here needs to defend why they should be indestructable people need to prove why they should be destructablefrom everything ive read its1   i want big bangs2   i think it would improve the flow of 003   i want big bangsand all of this created and cheer leadered by people for whom by there very nature hate system holding in all its formshonestly  its not about balance its a personal agenda plain and simple if people from the major 00 alliances suggested it  fine  they really know what its all about  they live it everydayare major alliances asking for thisno  they are asking for less lag and sorting out capital blobsthis post is really not a personal attack at you jade at least no more than your creation of this thread isnt to forward your own personal agenda
this is a great suggestion if you want more people in jita and less people in 00lowsecthumbs up for star fraction
now i know what a good number of you may be thinking stop napfesting in my case the lobby is in the other direction we need more reds yes this is a proposal that is of direct and immediate benefit to those of us who practice nrds  not red dont shoot  the game has grown substantially the standing slots  which i believe stand at 300   are simply not adequate for the current population or the growth rate of the game hostiles who hide in npc corps all need separate standings corps and alliances that drift in an out may require standings the numbers add up you may want to set someone  as well heaven forbidi freely admit this proposal is a bit selfish the cva is nrds imperial dreams administrates many outposts for those unaware you use corp standings for docking rights pricing and other factors more slots would enable more considerations more use of standings other than 10 0 or 10 there is no loser by supporting this changewhat does this cost nbsi groups or others who simply do not care nothing at worst you ignore the extra slots at best perhaps you embark on your own standings experiments this proposal does empower those groups who like to play at the politics or manage territory or enrich the game with years long grudges to exercise more control there are thousands of pilots in eve who stand to benefit from increased standing slots i ask for your support at bringing this to ccps attention double triple  or more   the standings for a corperation
more slots are definitely neededin the past its been possible to use alliance standings once you run out of corporation ones but with the advent of faction warfare thats not going to be possible for a lot of us
yes i support more standing slots
yes gimme moar
im guessing that there might be a need for speed angle to this in that each time someone enters local their corpalliance needs to be checked against the standings table of your corpalliance  and multiplied by the number of people in system   unless it is cached in some way to the 35000 or so pilots in pod at any time either way there might be an issue with implementing itsaying that though i can see nothing special about 300  it isnt a power of 2 for example and doesnt have any good hash qualities   so a higher number is almost certainly technically feasible  511 at least   and i would support this proposal the game has moved on from when the initial number of slots was set iz
you know i had totally forgotten about the faction warfare aspects if faction warfare is a success there will most certainly be a need for more slots i know this does not seem like a hotbutton issue but it does have the fortune of being fairly simple and quick to discuss hence it would not take much council time  i would think anyway please support
please make it an option for us to opt out of the profanity filter its rather annoying to have to try and figure out what was said because someones definition of profanity happens to be a standard part of a nonprofane word
clearly i support this issue
are you suggesting cracking the profanity filter you should know that ccps profanity filter is uncrackable erthe funny thing about the profanity filter is that its just a difference in how the text is rendered  you hit quote and all the same    ass dildo boner   butthole barbara streisand is still there its not like profanity filtration has ever been especially logical but thats a really odd hole in it
edit a configurable ingame swearing filter would nice so that you could swear all you like in local and people could activate the word filter so that their virgin eyes are protected
a configurable toggleable profanity filter would be jolly good fun  its ing about ing time that we can say    and not offend the seven 18 year olds that play evenot that i have ever tempted the profanity filter here or swore ingame im innocent od
this is a ing good idea
id also like to add that t2 ammo needs to be boosted so its actually worth inventing as well
i support fixing the obvious lack of pg in nighthawk
if all he wants is 4 or 5 powergrid can you tell me what percentage that is or how many powergrid implants you would need to get 4 or 5 more powergrid out of the craneits not that theyre the only blockade runners allowed to use implants its that hes completely ignoring the fact that ccp allows everyone a chance to bump the powergrid or cpu a few percent without losing any lows or rig slots by the way you can use lows or rigs
please visit your user settings to reenable images
a 3 powergrid implant is sufficient to shoehorn on a basic fitas i mentioned higher up a pds ii ancillary current router or micro auxiliary power core will too but yknow almost every ship out there can fit the basics to do its job without needing fittings mods were not talking a full rack of top tier weaponry a full tank and a cap injector here  not that the crane doesnt have the same problem fitting a heavy missile launcher ii mind   were talking mwd 3 shield hardeners and a cloak not a hefty ganktankneut fit the list of ships that cannot do that is really very short its barges t1 haulers but most importantly of all its very definitely not the other blockade runners
he has said no to searching assets inside cans i didnt even know you could search for remote assetsthat seems very differnt to this proposal which is to be able to open one or two remote cans so im not so sure he has said no to this proposal
thanks for the alt post also you might want to check a sov map goons have far from a few systems
nope
plus 1
you really hate goons huh shame you fail to realise this isnt just about goons it will effect goons just as it will effect everyone else  if anything changes   maybe if you actually read the thread you would see all the support from people in other space holding alliancesha who am i kidding youre the alt of someone with a chip on your shoulder who has been following every thread that might be related to goons at all being as negative and unconstructive as possible at the same time you try to label us as disruptive youre not fooling anyone stop posting if you dont want to have a reasonable discussion dont stop us having one
disagree with the intent of this a cyno jammer shouldnt in any way prevent the owning and friendly forces from deploying any assets into the system so while letting capitals use the jump bridge may seem odd it is at least a way to give some advantage to the defender
 intented mechanic or accidental flaw cant believe some of the issues posted this one is also a jaw dropper what a fair fight not
support  caps  pos vs support is a little too imba in favour of the defendersif you want to get your friendly caps into the system drop the jammer and provide a window of opportunity for the opposition to do the same being able to pick that window is still enough of an advantage for the defenders
yes to every one of the ideas
racial fonts to choose from its not like the standard font of the ui is really awesomebut totally supported
the amount of screen realestate needed for an effective eve overview hud is indeed already overkill i want to see the new  and very useful   icons made visible though and that means being able to position them on the ship line where the pilot chooses not just as the righthand end personally i feel that if they overlay any existing column they become messy such that you cant clearly see either the ew attacking you or the information being masked by the ew icons hence proposing that they are treated as a separate columnnow merging some of the icononly columns might work though i could imagine that coding that and ensuring it was as fast to display to the pilot might not be so effectiveiz
we could theoretically get rid of the ship type column if they could somehow make the ship brackets reflect the types of ships better although with the advent of t2 ships a hac isnt a hac isnt a hac anymore so i dont knowbut we currently have 4 ship brackets  frigate cruiser battleship industrial   and yet many more ship classes stealth interception ew and tackling logistics dps hulls hacs interdictors the various capitals with their purposes more brackets would be good maybe if they add enough brackets and code them well we could get rid of the ship type column altogether dunno
agreed
weve been promised this is something that is coming soon
my problem with these is the same as other posters have said in that theyre waaay too gimped in the damage department especially the prometheus the ishtar is the closest thing to a ratting machine the gallente have and this stands the greatest chance of being something similar id like to see the slots as something similar to the ishtar with 3 turret points 5 total highs  prober and tractorsalvager in the non turrets   and a full 5 heavy drones deployed so my ideal would be 547 layout with same drone bay and 125mbs bandwidth yes this means its viable in pvp about time we get a drone boat bigger than the ishtar but thats only peripheral to it actually working for its designed purpose of being able to solo small exploration sites and i think the example of an explorer someone was looking for was like indiana jones not columbus  
i could see the caldari being left 2525 on drone bay but at least let the other guys get 2550 or something for a spare dronei love caldari and drones it leads to a terrible double life  
the enterprise mission had a 7 years durationon a historical level you are paragoning eve exploration to sea exploration  mostly   a lot of that was done with single ships with a crew of some hundred so similar to eve pod cruiser but eve exploration is more similar to the gold prospector or trappers expeditions we are not there to cart new route or explore new unknow systems we are there to find and plunder whatever riches there are in already partially know locations the fast way then if we find some resource that can be exploited in a constant form we return with a larger force to do that so we need soemthing that can plunder the exploration location reasonably fast if it is possible to solo them or capable of returning home fast to get a small fleet more appropratie for the reource found
id like to see this happen
id like some opinions on this pleasewhen looking over the different ships in all available classes you can come to a quick conclusion concerning faction ships they are only in tech 1 classes and there are only 3 different classes of them empires  outlaw frigates  5  5 cruisers  5  5 battleships  5  51 of each for each faction not counting special faction ships but only those readily available through the lp store also not looking at posseswhen i look then at the list of tech 1 classes i can see there are more then 3 only destroyers battlecruisers industrialsthere for i would love to see faction version of those 3 classes for all factions both empire and outlaw it would in essence in one go double the amount of faction ships available in the gamethis would be a good thing because youd have something in between the dirty cheap frigate okish cruiser and insanely expensive battleship because itd add abit of extra flavour to all factions because it would double the amount of outlaw faction ships because you can get a special hauler then opinions pleaseedit 1 extra faction cruiser for all empire factions as mentioned
two things one empyrean is adding a few new faction ships  navy versions of the omen exqueror osprey and scythe if im not mistaken no piratefaction ships though two im not adverse to this per se but some things need to be established first up faction industrials are pretty pointless unless thats how you want to implement the minifreighter class and i dont think it is since the goal there is smaller freighters not bigger haulers  action in space is inappropriate for them   secondly i dont think the destroyer class has much of a role certainly not enough to justify factionalization third whichever way you went on battlecruisers would  off somebody  the caldari and gallente especially have two wholly different bcs and youd anger one half of the split or the other no matter which one you decided to implement also create some pirate faction ships that arent just the same old all the time  three of a kind if ine but we dont want all of them to just be identical im not really sure that more faction ships are needed at all but those are some things that should be watched for if you do
what i would like is for the factional ships to be reduced in price not too much of a discount but enough so that they are still viable to use in pvp combatt1 frigate 500kt2 frigate 10mtf frigate 40mat least thats how it was a year or so ago when i got my amarr navy slicer we cannot change the base cost of these ships but we can reduce the lp and isk cost of the blueprint somewhat maybe an empire faction frigate costing 1520m total and a pirate faction one 2025m due to the extra bonusalso while i would love to see faction destroyers mmmm lasery lasery coercer with the current cost scheme they would cost about 80m and wouldnt be that much more powerful than their current incarnationfaction battlecruisers probably around 500m while you cant say that faction frigate costs 40m you may as well get a cruiser the same cant be said for the halfranked ships destroyer and battlecruiser faction ships would easily be outshone by their larger brethren in cost effectiveness at leastas for faction industrials i dont see the amarr navy having their own haulers though adding in logistical faction ships would be quite niftyeach of the navies has a logistic branch and an industry branch so you could use those logistic one uses the t1 support cruiser hull for their first ship and the industry one can give a faction hauler
it would be pretty tricky to implement something faction like i agreeim not going to put it any way other then it is i like shiny toys even if those shiny toys arent all that useful or cost effective like a faction industrial probably would bethe cost of faction ships is for me at least a minor issue there are only so few of them particularly if your desire is to fly an outlaw factions ships
the optimist in me hopes that at least some of these will be sorted out with the empyrean age expansionhowever the realist in me knows that weve had dozens of false dawns and broken promises in the past and i have a nasty feeling that ccp will be sitting on these once againfor those of you who arent aware of what im talking about eve has a wonderfully detailed backstory but a lot of ccps production values relating to that back story leave a lot to be desiredhere are some examplesin 2003 after a wonderful frigate tournament and associated events the unsuccessful amarrian heirs all committed suicide four out of the five were replaced four and a half years later house sarum still does not have an heir of the four heirs we do have only three have a biography on this page why no biography for the ardishapur heirthe timeline mentions that the current emperor was selected in 22762ad this was accurate back in 2003 but given that both that emperor and his successor have died since then its now a little out of datethat same entry suggests that it was the selection heideran vii that precipitated the khanid seccession however this chronicle contradicts this saying that khanid rebelled against heideran viis predecessor then was have the wonderful year 105 overview this was a great idea and a boon to eve historians everywhere but where are the overviews for years 106 107 108 and 109and dont get me started with the kind of confusion amongst players that the introduction of the khanid bloodline caused please dont get me startedand last but most certainly not least we have that story arc the assassination of emperor doriam ii were still waiting to hear for some news about the hunt for his killer nearly three years later we still dont know whats happening amongst the empires leadership is having a major faction without a head of state for three years without explanation really conducive to having an immersive backstory longterm readers of my rants on this subject may recall ginger announcing in december 2006 that there would definitely be some sort of progress on the amarr leadership arc in 2007 and that the storyarc around it would really rock well here we are halfway through 2008 and no sign of any rocks except for what id like to throw at ginger youll notice that these problems all relate to the amarr there are issues relating to the other factions backstories too but theres not enough room to describe them all there are also countless unfinished smaller event arcs from way back that were never finishedtherefore i would like the csm to put pressure on ccp to produce the kind of consistent and dynamic background that this game deserves to clear up the contradictions in the backstory and to make every effort to resolve the many unfinished storyarcs as soon as possible

i love to read the backstory artickels and everything and so on so it would be nice to hear something new and to update the oldnon actual stuff

i also agree with this it is something that ccp could correct and improve with relatively little effort particularly if they got the playerbase involved in highlighting specific inconsistencies
i support this even as a quite new player ive had time to notice that the most influential stories have lacked more and more in support since the game started  the year 105 thing

i have read about a number of other price capping items being in place i cant say i have a list of them off hand but i know that they do existaside from the price caps what do you think about the idea of a dynamic marketit was pointed out earlier that implemnting it the way i explained had the oppertunity for somone who had control of an entire regional market to take advantage of it and use that control to tip the markets unfairly so maybe my idea of completely regional based prices is not an idea solution i had actually thought of this ahead of time but didnt want to detail all my ideas as i wanted there to be some room for others to think about it solveing this particular problem might be accomplished by only weighing the regions price of end good based on local prices but the root be based off of eve wide price averagesthat being said i like the ability to create a situation where one region could be underpriced and another be overpriced this would encourage interregion tradebtw i love your corp name herschel
like i said im against price caps  my complaint isnt about your principles its about the relevance of them if there are any that come up i think ccp should eliminate them but from what i can tell thats what theyre doing already

while i support the inititive to improve industry and trade i think that too many things are bundled into this thread to effectively discuss all of the suggestionsi would like to see seperate threads for key areas ie a thread for the proposed improvements to contracts seperate from the proposed changes to market mechanics
these are all one issue i count 60 issues here they all are in the science and industry scope but thats are far as the connection goesare you seriously suggesting that it is alright to bundle a heap of issues together under one tenious connection such as pos warfarepirate gankingaggro timerskillrightsblack ops because they all fall under the scope of pvpthey need to be seperated so we can discuss the pros and cons of each one and inform the csm reps of the arguments especially as only a few of them have industryscience leanings of any degree take carearithron
items that appear to be fine as listed public production and science ability to contract shares the ability to bid on auctions in different region increased dividend amountthe others need further development these two i think are in the most need of further discussionout of your list this item stikes me as being an odd one outi fail to see how this would take market pvp to the next levelwith combat pvp the objective is simple kill the other guy before he kills youwith market pvp the objective is also simple offer the best price in that locationif you remove that victory condition what is the new victory condition for market pvpwhat exactly do you suggest that we do about it what would vary between different ravens having lots of otherwise identical products on the market would not improve the market what would drive demand for these superfisial variations you can already sell customized ravens  ie with rigs   via contracts but there seems to be comparitively little demand in contrast with the standardized raven for a most wanted feature this one is poorly defined

i have some friends who develop games as a hobbyextracurricularetc and intend to go into the game development industry when they finish school i have gotten the impression from them that it is simply nicer to work with directx than opengl that said i have not worked with either so i dont know any of this from personal experiencehowever i have a dualboot system with an ati card and i will support any measure which advocates looking into making this stuff work better on ati cards as well as nvidia ones  on the other hand it is worth pointing out that ati hated linux at least before they were bought by amd and my particular card has  other issues as well which mean my windows driver is dated earlier than when i bought my computer  
the current mac version of the client is horrible suffers from much lower framerates graphical glitches and instability compared with the win client theres also the fact that were stuck with the nonpremium graphics for the foreseeable future im paying the same amount in sub fees as the win players yet getting a vastly inferior gaming experiencei understand there are major technological issues that need to be overcome but it seems that the open source community is solving these at a faster rate than transgaming this needs to be looked into and it would be nice to get some communication from ccp on this issue
i am just a couple skills away from flying one but havent gotten them because they seem to be not worth it they need their combat abilities and jump abilities increased some other way than mentioned by the op might also work  jump into jammed systems  greater damage rather than increased range  covops cloak possible  
tbh i think they wouldnt be any more overpowered if they could warp cloaked than coop recons are now and probably less so since they hardly have the same speed and agility as a cruiser especialy the way they are nanod up frequently
i agree with blackops needing a serious overhaul
i changed your emphasis around a little bit hopefully you can see it now i sure hope you werent voting for someone to make second place or worse that would be rather silly wouldnt it when i vote i vote to win in regards to 2 i think a lot of americans were surprised when jades position was announced it wasnt supposed to be a surprisemy position is still the same i dont want the council to have more power i dont think they should be managing themselves i think that should be left for the people to decide their job is to present ccp with issues that the people present to them i want as little overhead as possible  did you see the log from the first meeting   
you guessed wrong besides this thread is about what should be the case also my comment was on your assertion that voting for a candidate means that we want that candidate to be the chair  which is not the case at all
i think the highest vote getter should be the acting chairman until after the first couple of meetings at which point an internal vote could decide
the roll of chairman is to facilitate discussion and other such administrative duties he is not some sort of dictator with power over the massesas such i fully support this amendmentthe council should decide based on the social dynamics of the group who among them will best moderate discussionjust because someone was the most popular at the polls does not mean they are the most effective at administration
i dont agreethe person with the most votes is who the voters want to be the headso there should not be some sort of bypass on thisthe person with the most votes should be the head of the csm if the person with the most votes doesnt want to be the chairman he should be able to step down and a new election started to see who gets the most votes this timehowever if this person doesnt do his work there should be a way to make a vote of notrust
i think you are spot onchairman is the chairman unless they step down  council then elects a replacement   or they are unable to do the job at which time they can be removed from the post by a super majority vote of the remaining members  6 or 7 of 8  by the same token with a super majority vote  and ccp approval   council members should be able to be removed and replaced by the alternatesin both cases the votes should be public and require posts explaining why the vote was taken and the voting members need to explain their votes in that thread open government

im pretty sure the csm has already decided to present it to ccp still having the piles upon piles of supports cant hurt

as a semi new miner my advice is to relocate to the ass end of any minmatar or amarr area preferably next to low sec the belts stay full and if your in a corp you can get a gang together and jumnp over to low sec for an op very profitable
this is what im looking forward to frome ccps drawingboard probably will be years before it every happens but itd be great

ive wondered on to sa again havent i
i support this
so lets remove the falcons jamming range bonus for a 5 rof per level and jamming strenght bonus by 5 damage per level give it 40m3 dronebay and its fine and balanced because its got the same ew capability of a arazu now with roughly the same dps yeah sure ok i guess falcon pilots would love that and yeah rook is underpowered for solo needs the same bonuses
it has nothing to do with me being happy i am just looking at this from a distance comparing whats out there especially if this is supposed to be balanced for the player base in generalthats fine about the losec issue but how does that effect 00 if you change the effect of the falcon because of the losec issues how does that impact the other part of the player base in 00 is it a good thing or bad you and capt blanko seemed to get on your respective ears about it and i am not sure why i am just bringing out a point for discussion what makes these issue threads useless is when we have multiple players with a single minded focus and the unwillingness to compromise
falcon is as it should beif anything the rook should be buffed as there is no reason to use them over a falcon these days maybe give it the firepower of a cerb to bring it into line with the hugin having alot more dps than a rapier
while i agree the rook needs a small buff to give it a purpose that isnt already done by the falcon give it too much missile firepower would make it not worth flying a cerberus right now a rook with 5 hml iis and no damage mods does 120150dps i can see that being upped would be nice but not too much
wtf if you fit it anyway else you might aswell bring another kind of shipall other recons dont get primaried every single time they appear on the battlefieldif you want to nerf the falcon in lowsec please come up with a way that does not make it totally useless in 00until that day dont you dare touch it
ah i did
i fly a rapier and when we run into nano gangs im pretty much primary its not easy staying alive in those fights pretty darn hard tbh and sometimes its impossible to make it out alivestill i dont use the argument that the rapier should have 200km range because i cant fit a tank because i need 6 webifiers to stay alivefalcons cant have a tank because they need full rack of ecm because they cant fit a tank etc i think this is circular argument and it does not validate its need for extreme rangei understand that the falcon might not be the fastest and most agile ship but it shouldnt be a impossible task to fix it so it would be able to operate within 100km range as the rest of the reconsthe arguments you are using for the 200km range sounds to me like our falcons is so dangerous for the opposing gang that they will instantly primary it therefore we must be allowed to move it out of the combat area i would have understood it if you said you needed it for sniper fleets but then again wouldnt a rook do that job just as good
there is one difference with your rapier you remove a ships defensive capabilities  at least in case of a nano ship   and help get it killed quickly a falcon only removes a ships offensive capabilities so if the falcon pilot dies early it hasnt done a whole lot of good ecm ships are pretty much allornothing they may be overpowered if they work but if they dont they are just uselessi dont need a range of 200km as thats not the way i would fly it but this is also not its natural range i am just afraid that if you gimp its range too much  its already limited in locking range compared to a rook   you would make range rigs and sensor boosters almost essential to stay at a reasonable range  100km with a buffer of 50km or so   i probably wouldnt mind a reduction of the ecm range bonus to 15 or even 10 if the jamming strength stays as iswith regards to fleet warfare it might be arguable that it wouldnt be harmful if the falcon would be the ecm recon of choice for small gangs and the rook the ecm recon of choice for fleets
disagree re falcon overpoweredop forgot additional solutiondampsthey work the falcon parked at 150km wont be jamming much with a pair of damps from virtually any ship capable of targetting to that rangeyou just need to lock them first a script of some sort would not be out of line
i do not agree with falcons being overpoweredcva faces falcons on a regular basis and there are several good counters1   sniping apocs with eccm  can hit out to 230km and kill jamming falcons very quickly2   eccm generally significantly reduces falcons effectiveness3   a good nanoship can reach a falcon at 200km in under 30 seconds the falcon then has a choice run and warp back in  if he has another prepared sniper spot   or try and keep the nano permajammed in most cases the falcon will run or diethere really is no need to nerf falcons
rsd with max skills optimal 45km falloff 90kmwith 2 sensor boosters 1 rsd and 3 particle dispersion rigs on a bs you have 50 chance of dampening a falcon at 161km if it stays out at 200km youll have around 25 chanse thats when you have used all 3 rigslots and 3 medslots id rather fly my vaga then
nice to see a response from a csm member although im a bit surprised you didnt take the time to read the thread before you replied
as useless as the arazus are wouldnt that be a better counter than having you bss fit rsds i mean if you are going to actually take the time to reconfig all your bss would it not make more sense in asking for a celestesarazu or a keres even in your support group think about the gang you are going to put together obviously the gang with the falcon thought about it
there is no ship with a rsd range bonus so they will all have the same chance for dampening the falcon the t2 ships will actually be even worse since they can only fit 2 rigsi dont have any problems with composing gangs and thats not the issue either
i read the thread but do not agree with you that the counters are useless probably shouldnt have bothered repeating them though  which is due to me reading the thread in the morning and then replying to it in the afternoon and focusing on some of the responses rather than the original post sorrydespite that my view stands i do not think falcons are overpowerededit i would just like to add that i do accept that falcons can tip the balance if employed properly against unprepared opponents and they are certainly being used much more frequently than before  but they are by no means a win button
im personally happy with where falcons are the other recons need to be significantly boostedhowever ccpnerf so thusly falcons need scripts either you get a strong strength and a short jam length or weak strength and long jam lengtheasily fixed
read a bunch of points most of them absolute rubbishrook for fleet for reasons that if you cant figure out then you dont know how to fit for fleetfalcon for gang for all the obvious reasonsi can see how the falcon could be more of an issue in lowsec demanding you bring counters with you  but its no different than having to bring rapiershuginns or neutrr bs to stop nanoin the end this is nothing more than a i dont like having to bring a counter to x threaddisclaimer this point of view brought to you by 00 big gang influence may be present falcon is perfectly balanced for 00
tell that to huginn and rapier pilots they have to get to 3040km to do their job same went for the arazu before it sucked the curse doesnt exactly find itself at the bottom of the list when it comes to priority targets eitherget real while i am against a falcon nerf your statement is ignorant and speaks to a lack of experience
any sniper works nicely but its not an option in lowsec which was the problem described above the problem here is that falcons do not scale downwards they work nicely in 00 fleets and have the appropriate effects but they get more and more powerful the smaller the fleet becomes especially the falcon at 200km is almost impossible to deal with for small fleets they can not bring a sniper bs because that would lower their dps by a good third usuallyfitting eccm works nicely if you have mid slots to spare it reduces the jam chance by  a bit below   50 if all ships in your fleet fit eccm a falcon will be able to only jam 1 ship more or less permanently possibly a second one at times instead of 23 and you have reduced the effectiveness of your ships against the other opponents but yes eccm is a good counter to falconswe recently had an engagement in lowsec 2x bs 1x bc on our side vs 1x bs 1x hac 1x falcon on the other we got the bs because both of our bs were tempests with 2x best named eccm in the mids we had to bump the enemy bs to keep it from warping because at one point we were both jammedthe normal noninty nano ships i fly with reach speeds of 45kms pushing this more to 4555 seconds in engagements with 23 bs on each side you usually have already lost 33 of your dps  one bs   by that time and the falcon can still jam the incoming nano ship and warp off leaving you with no falcon kill and a whole bs kill to catch up and your nano ship at this point has done nothing but to scare off a falcon on the other hand the falcon has caused you to lose a bs without much you could have done and taken out a nano cruiser of the main engagementi still think the falcon needs some balancing not to be made useless not to reduce his jam efficiency or anything like that there have been nice ideas in this thread that keep the effectiveness of falcons for 00 fleet fights intact just as it is right now but balances the small gang  lowsec combat
yeah good point although falcons is very good for breaking up spider tanksin my experience this seems to be the new standar range  180200km  
its not really a new standard it is flown normally at this range the ones that dont or feel its not natural will fit multispecs instead of racials actually you can squeeze out 20 or 30km more optimal if you focus your skillsif you specialize and with good skills t1 rigs and racials you can target out to about 240km with 0ne sbii with target range script about a 250 scan res 22841km range on your racials 15227 with multi specsthat might be why yuki sees that 200km in not natural for the falcon because she might be flying with multispecs
bad wording perhaps i merely meant the range of a falcon without range rigs and mods personally i dont need more range than the standard 150km at the moment because i rarely camp but if this range would be drastically reduced i would pretty much have to fit for range too  not complaining just saying  
wait so it shouldnt be a job but it should be
wouldnt that require a huge amount of work coding and scripting that could be betterused elsewhere its essentially writing an entirely new fromscratch sovereignty system there are many more thoughtout proposals that could use this sort of attention right now
ccp is already looking into changing the sovereignty system and devoting resources to doing so  its simply in the playerbases best interest to get the csm asking questions about how that is progressing and finding out what impact our thoughts and ideas can have on it
look at the mechanics in 00 yes considering them in the method suggested by this proposal noi will touch on point 2 and 3 raised2   allows small gangs methods to impact sov warfare in a meaningful way i love small gang fighting i really do but the specifics proposed will not correct the problem whatever your small gangs can do my big gangs can do better even if you concentrate your forces on the minimum number of points needed to take an objective your opponent needs only focus on one or two that you attack and destroy you problem solved i see a great deal of pointless chasing back and forth cloaking and waiting for the right afk moment etc in other words not actual fighting the fact is you can wear down alliances with fading tactics without changing a thing3  remove tower logistics from sov warfare sorry attacking logistics should be viable while i can agree that tower logistics should be streamlined as to make them less of an absolute burden they should remain important to the sov system it is a weakness that your opponent can exploitgroups that have been willing to sustain a long and determined presence in enemy territory can get results we have seen it the tactic may not be as effective against various entities but it is viable creating artificial victory conditions will only add unwanted dimensions to the game players logging in at 35 minutes till downtime swarming gates to flip sov or knock modules in system offline because these victory points cannot be defended 247 will not improve the situation or somehow make small gangs magically superiorthis system actually decreases the risk of attacking forces and increases the risk of holding forces either hit the logistics hampering the enemy  this proposal wants to remove the sovlogistics link   put up the forces needed to get the job done  this proposal creates new artificial goals that can be effectively sniped by fewer people which would give even larger groups greater power   or maintain the battlefield presence and wear down your foes most of us do not labor under the illusion sov war should be easy and it does need corrections but under no circumstances should we be narrowing down the choices to ping pong and first person shooter like beacon holdinghopefully we can convince the representatives that this specific suggestion should not be considered by ccpno support
let me point out that the example proposal is just that  an example the topic at issue here is whether the csm should get involved in ccps reexamination of sovereignty
i confess that i dont know a whole lot about sovereignty and the dynamics of pos warfare myself but i do hear a lot that the current megaalliances holding sovereignty over much of 00 have used the existing posbased sovereignty framework to create very high entry barriers to new alliances attempting to cut themselves a slice of territory it seems reasonable to reexamine iti like the idea of having to maintain a player presence in claimed territory to maintain the claim which will promote more efficient use of 00 territory by pilots by increasing the number of alliances with territory and shrinking those territories to more practical and defensible sizes naturally megaalliances have a strong interest in maintaining the status quo so i hardly expect them to rally behind this idea
way overdue for revamping
ah yes another post in the csm section about reshaping eve to meet star fractions playstyle next issue making nano ships faster and cloaking more effectiveimproving eve for the little guyinterestingly enough in the two csm agenda  star fraction threads ive read so farthe goonswarm has had the most rational and reasonable posts there is no question that sov could use some improvement  much like 00 could enjoy some more dynamism   however the jade fraction agenda is so remarkably self serving its rather shocking that it is permitted to continue unchecked i do truly hope folks will continue to realize that jades role as chairman of the csm should not  jades role as head of the star fraction alliance and its specific playstylethis would be like watching the goonie members championing more blob tactics more super alliance play stayles in every suggestion or perhaps the bob member posting about how under powered titans are or watching hardin posting thread after thread about improving roleplay you folks were elected to represent all of evenot pet projects not pet play styles
one thing id like a reexamination of sovereignty to address would be guarding against the kind of current scenario we have where an alliance owns a large area of space but its generally very empty of players and the ownership is not reflected in terms of player presencethis would be rectified by devising a system where player ship presence and activity is more closely linked to the ownership mechanic  so that areas of space that are generally very empty are unowned but more populated areas are more likely to be under the control of those who populate them
actually no this proposal wants sov looked at in very specific contexts while sov should be examined i cannot support that context or agenda or the examples cited as such i cannot support this issuei hope enough reps can see the downside and not support this either
ill point out that ccp representatives are already on record as pursuing alternative sovereignty mechanics there is a sticky in the features and ideas about it i think it would be foolish to want to stick our heads in the sand and not get involved in what the outcome of that pursuit is but yes the topic does involve certain contexts  although they are broad and commonly agreed upon
if this is true then there is no reason whatsoever for this issue to be brought up if they are already working on itwhat do we expect to contribute to the discussion or are you asking for specific support for your very specific approach to the problem in a differnt thread jadeour esteemed chairman and your boss is trying to force a bad idea into the csm agenda by saying whats wrong with at least bringing it up assuming that is the point of jades leadershipto surface ideas that ccp might be overlooking i see no reason for this item to be on the agenda as you dutifully and acurately point out ccp is already aware and working on the problem
i think youre in a small minority if you arent interested in knowing how ccp is going to handle a revamp of sovereignty and having some input in the process
the purpose of the csm is to bring to the ears of ccp what the player base wants them to hear and adressif they have already heard and are adressing the issue then why exactly do they need to be told what they already know
yes please
as it is now its up to the application to grab what it needs from the database good luck getting ccp to budge
agree with op on this
this is a good idea
definitely would be nice though i can imagine it could be obnoxious to patch onto the current system
it is ironic but then ive never found riethe to be stupid in any way good idea from an always bright if twisted individual
this should be the top priority for the api developmentdefinitely supporting this
i like this idea
advertisement at login is a good idea mandatory voting is a bad one
i did not vote specifically because abstain meant i just dont see a good candidate whereas not voting  and that 26000 number   was a message that i didnt care about the whole csm thing in generali think that they can put a lot of effort into advertising the csm and making sure were aware of it and then the numbers are gonna come back to them to prove that it wasnt that we didnt know but that we didnt care after alldo you like windows vista by the way
i didnt vote as i didnt want a csm if i was forced to vote or i couldnt log in id either not log in till the voting was over and then log back in or if ccp were stupid enough not to let you log in ever again if you didnt vote then id be forced to quit eve and i dont want thatfortunately for the most part ccp are not stupid
thisadditionally you could have concord spam mailboxes in game once 7 days before voting to inform everyone and once when the voting starts
some how i hope that csm have better things to do then to figure out ways to hassle the people that play the game that they are electedpopups are one of the most annoying things the internet has ever thought upthey are considered to be adwarespyware and even incases viruses i would think eve would have more sense then to try that tactic maybe the voting turn out was because people put little faith in anything ccp trys most thier ideas are half baked like 60 day gtc for instance while doing away with 30 and 90 daysnew expansions and updates while the game they have has all kinds of problem such as lag everytime you try to have a decent fleet battlefix the game then i will consider the trivial stuff like voting for a csm
ingame voting from the character sheet or the character selection screen  winnagging and being annoying  bad
im all for more people voting and getting involved etc but you cant force people to vote deliberately abstaining is a perfectly legitimate thing to choosethe best way to get players involved is for them to see the difference that csm makes make a difference in the quality of the players experience and players will get involved when they see that this stuff mattersso kind of supporting the principle but im afraid no support for this proposal sorry jade
forcing people to vote is a nogo
id like to see more people vote yes i would not like to see more people vote because they clicked a button portrait name etc just to get into the gamelet democracy promote itself if it can convince the playerbase that its important problem solved i can not support forced democracy though even typing it sounds wrong
i think that this is a game as such it has limitations we have all faced lag we have all had things not work properly yet sometimes they get reimbursed and sometimes they dont there should be a flat no response to all requests for reimbursement that is caused by bugs or technical issues or lag you shouldnt fly something that you cant afford to lose the only time that reimbursement should be allowed is if someones account got hacked or something like that
disagree it works fine asis  players shouldnt be punished for technical failures on ccps part
i agree the reimbursement system rewards those who abuse it a flat no response would be better everybody would know what theyre entitled to  ie nothing   and thered be no more whining and crying based on the squeaky wheel gets a free raven principle
having lost more than one ship to a bug glitch or known technical problem and almost lost quite a few more to severe random lag i cant support this if its ccps fault they should replace it especially if its a known and unavoidable bug that they cant fix
not only am i in favor of compensation for players who they lose their ship when its ccps fault i am against people giving out their password or downloading keyloggers and then complaining that they were hacked and demanding recompense
agreed i lost a couple of hundred mill in a fight after a gate crashed my system couldnt log back on petitioned it logged back on found myself at a gate with 4 reds the gate wouldnt work even though i got to it and didnt aggro non of my mods would turn on and i generally got scd several others in the area were suffering lag and problems in the surrounding systems even tho there were few people in them i petitioned got turned down because the log showed no problems and that was that i didnt worry too much but then i hear about others being reimbursed for cap ships etc and it is crapand it wasnt my system either i run a far more powerful pc than eve needsso agreed if everyone gets the same treatment no one can complain too hard like the man said if you cant afford to lose it dont take it into space everyone knows about lag and what it can do to your ships so everyone is on the same page
disagree on this account if you lose an asset due to a bug in the software it should be reimbursed fully
i would think the words after issue would key you into the importance as well as how many people responded to the post no i just want this form a bit more readable maybe but as is the thread name usually is a pretty good indicator of what the issue is and discussion well what is discussed an issue balancingtweaking again an issue it is all just rather redundant in my mind
how bout not letting irrelevant and lame threads like this on the forums
there should be a list of known exploits that have been acknowledged by ccp i know that i have been a victim and an unintentional exploiter in the past on various accounts having a list of exploits as well as their effects  so we can see if we have been a victim of them   should be listed as soon as they are acknowledged the method to reproduce them should be listed as soon as they are fixed so that when the next code branch comes out and the exploit is reintroduced because it wasnt patched to other code branches they will be caught and reported earlier by the playerbase instead of merely being exploited again by the same people who found the exploit to begin with
i support this one too
i disagree  publishing full details of previous exploits can often give people the understanding of your internal structures potentially your db schema and any other sort of information that can be gleaned from readingbetweenthelines this just opens the doors to all sorts of trouble
the people that are finding the exploits to begin with dont seem to have any trouble finding them without that knowledge the more knowledge that is out there the more secure things will become as a result
signed because security by obscurity causes more security problems than it hides
in one aspect this is the open source is good argument in that by knowing what went wrong you can ensure it shouldnt go wrong again the same way thing is eve is proprietary and to make too much detail available would be more likely to make other neerdowells search for things they could take advantage ofi dont therefore feel that this is a sensible idea however making available additional information about an exploit which has been closed so that you dont accidentally appear to be trying that style of exploit in the future could in some circumstances be beneficial to normal pilots maybeiz
i also disagreenot all exploits that ccp discoveres are found by playersthere were some exploits that never been used but were fixed anyway  before someone would find out  giving information over these unfound exploits is not smart
thiseveryone will go oh look exploits i never knew that one brb exploiting
there has been all this hot are floating around about bacon and other similar applications which augment local so why arent we all up in arms about micro miner bots im sure it is not beyond the abilities of ccp to acquire these programs analyse them and implement appropriate counter measuresid real like a fix where they are flagged as macrominers and everyone can shoot them freely to add the the games enjoyment for the rest
problem is these macros dont require any communication to the server they are clientside scripts ccp can analyze them all they want and it wont allow them to detect someone using one
can someone explain what the problem is that youre trying to solve
well the flagging them part was a nice to have joke but it might be possible to analyse how these macros work and prevent them doing so never having used one i dont know what they do and can not therefore really suggest solutions but im guessing 00 ones detect hostiles and take appropriate actions they will need to target new asteriods presumeable they use the overview to do this now if its possible to prevent applications exploiting the information in local i would assume the same is true of overview yes i know they can sort overview select in squence use scanner do the same point is it must surely be worth investing time and effort into dealing with this problemmara rinn  there are people who use macros to running mining ships on eve these people are also often the isk sellers it is a breach of the eula but also to the detriment of all other players as it impacts the oresmineral markets flooding the game with isk effectively leading to devaluation eve is market based so this sort of activity is very damaging
no you can only make it harder  to the point of being impossible if it requires too much intelligence for a bot   bacon does not hack into the client but simply analyses information that is stored in plain text as a log a macro is far more involved than this  and not allowed  this issue is very similar to the issue of aimbots in first person shooters because you can only make it harder but you cant make it impossible for a bot to analyse the information  even if its just graphical   that is presented to the player and then act upon it like a player would by sending input the more predictable the required actions are the easier it is to create bots or macros
personally i love macro bots237 miner  more oresmore ores  cheaper orescheaper ores  cheaper stuff for meif macro bots are ruining your income try mission running its basically mining  lock on to something press f1f8 get money  
so you are openly saying that people should brake the eula so that you can get cheap stuff
your lack of appreciation of market economics is only exceeded by your ignorance of the eulamore ore  less income for real minersmore ore  keeper build cost for module  less income for mission runnersmore ore  more isk being traded for cash  bad

yes and dont support this thread
working as intended no change necessarythe only think id like to see if a rack 5 skill and maybe some new more advanced stat skills though again this is not necessary
what a lonely thread i will support you little guy
learning skills are a pain and yes we all know it but if ccp defaulted and gave every1 the same skills it would just turn into a numb slugfest my character is a direct result of my choices of specialization and it gives depth to that character though a speed bump in training would be nice
i know its nitpicking but i think its per se
i agree that 60 issue threads would be a bit much however there must be a balance that can be foundi agree with the settiment that you have bundled too much into a single proposal it makes it far too diffucult to address each subproposalmost of your ideas i support but it is diffucult to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the individual ideas with them so tightly bundledperhaps breaking them down a bit more ie improvements to shares improvements to pos services improvements to the market improvements to contractsthere is simply too much in there and the only constant uniting it all is that it does not involve combat mechanicsto the point contrast the level of discussion in your thread verse this more specific thread while both touch on the need to improve share trading your thread says very little about how that is accomplished and why that approach is favorable the other thread allows the idea to be developed more fullythere are pros and cons to most of your suggestions however by uniting them all into a monstrous package it limits and diffuses discussion of those specificsi would encourage the council to replace lavistas general issue with discussion of the stockmarket specifics for this meeting as we have atleast three threads  those linked above plus this one   that have been active for over a week discussing different approaches to implementingimproving this area of the game then allow development of discussion on the other areas of lavistas proposals seperately before being them up in the council
per se is indeed correcti agree with the idea of the shares being an agenda item and the rerst put up on seperate threads for better discussionas an aside i note that the meeting this weekend 8th june is within the 14 day period before the meeting in iceland does this mean that the agenda items discussed which have to be submitted to ccp at least 14 days in advance wont be addressed by ccp this timetake carearithron
as of this moment zero issues have been formally transmitted to ccp in the format of a submission template time constraints have been harsh and we are doing our best to invent this process from the ground up all parties are going to need to appreciate that the csm document  full and summary   will be incomplete and inappropriate to the needs of the inauguralfounding session in certain aspects we will be forwarding submission templates to ccp in advance of the iceland meeting but these will fall short of the 14 day specification in the documentation and were going to be asking ccp for their understanding and forbearance on the issue in the interests of making this inaugural session workas an aside im going to ask people to stop trying to play legal games with the founding csm documentation for the apparent purpose of confusing the issues and making the task of the csm harder than it should be we will get these things resolved and will have the csm documentation rewritten where it needs to be revised and corrected we are not going to slavishly adhere to the text where it needs revision and external input to ensure the csm can be all it can be for the game of eve and the community for this inaugural session its my intention that we take 3 weeks worth of issues produced in template format and provide these to ccp 56 days in advance of the first csmccp meetings yes this is certainly shorter than the 14 days specified but its my judgment call as csm chair that this represents better value to the community than simply flying to iceland with a grand total of zero issues added to the agenda after complying with the 7 day open discussion and 14 day prior submission rules in the documentationsometimes you have to bend the rules to get a decent outcome this is one of those times
the following three topics will have completed seven days of the ability for discussion by the date of the meeting proposals for ui improvements replace doubleclick in a chat channel cargo hold size of ships in hangar but not in usenot surprisingly for topics which will benefit everyone and are noncontentious there are not an enormous number of responces however they are all positive egiz
as an aside im going to ask people to stop trying to play legal games with the founding csm documentation for the apparent purpose of confusing the issues and making the task of the csm harder than it should be we will get these things resolved and will have the csm documentation rewritten where it needs to be revised and corrected we arent playing legal games these are the clearly stated rules in the csm document put up before the elections which we all were well aware of no items on the agenda for ccp before flying to iceland would be a failure of the current csm council rather than a failure of the rules nothing needs changing you just have to make sure that meetings etc are held in the proper timeframe before the 14 day period and issues are properly discussed and voted upon highlighting the rules and framework that the csm works within doesnt confuse issues it just draws your attention to something that you have to take into consideration and acknowledge afterall you can still bring the meeting forward to friday evening and get the agenda items submitted in time by being aware of the requirements you can avoid situations where you then need leeway etcthere actually isnt much wrong with the documentation that the csm has to work within bypassing clearly laidout criteria  eg lavistas 60 issues into a single vote   or overlooking clearly stated rules  eg agenda items to ccp 14 days beforehand   dont require changes to any processthey require a little more care in the application to the processif you follow this link  which btw is fantastic serenity   you can clearly see nine issues you can present to ccp and discuss as you have already voted on them in meetings
we  meaning csmccp   are altering the rules this time arithron ive told you the rationale and im confident that eveplayers will understand the intention to get more useful issues on the agenda for iceland rather than less of them you are free to disagree but this decision is made
adding them now inanna thank you
im sorry but we didnt overlook anything that must be youif you read the chat logs from the first council meeting you will see this 20080524 190315  ccp xhagen  the list of topics before the iceland meeting has to be sent 7 days in advance  an exception due to the short period before the trip  also as for my 60 issue would you leave it already if ccp finds it to be an issue they will state so and just reject to make a statement and the issue will be split up for one of the other meetings with ccp
no need to get personalthe issue with the 60 issues isnt what ccp thinks about it its what the players who want to comment and discuss each of the issues think about it thats the point i am trying to make how can we have trust in a csm that is willing to vote on 60 issues in one go without allowing debate and discussion occur on each of them in the forums players also need to follow the same rules for proposing issuesnine issues presented to ccp in a meeting aint that bad i appreciate that time is short but quality not quantity should be the aim afterall its the first time such a meeting has occuredit should set a high standard for future csms to aspire tooi did miss the 7 day submission in the first meeting i wasnt being picky by pointing out the 14 day thing i just thought someone should point it out to avoid disappointment afterall i do want the csm council to work as ill be standing again next time roundtake carearithron
nowhat seems to be the case though is that people are allowed to support issues repeatedly using the different characters on their accounts
no it was one per account in the election but its one per character on the forums the system isnt totally screwed
sorry enjia my comment is and ccp thinks faction wars will work and be lag free
well thats mincing words the strategic mistake was using the titan in the first place when we werent certain the node could handle it  it couldnt   i wouldnt fault evenews for their attempt to tell a story even if it is a partial work of fiction theyre story tellersregarding lag i agree with you that it sucks im also not going to pretend to know the source i dont believe ccp wants their game to run like garbage im sure if they could find a way to reduce it they would there are really only two possible answers to why this has not been done in my view1   they dont know2   the solution is too expensivewhile im more than happy to raise the issue at the csm and have a chat with the devs and try to at least get some form of answer out of them i dont believe that its not something theyre not already concerned with im sure it will be a long topic of discussion in iceland and it will find its way onto the agenda one way or another
artificial limits on fleet sizes wont do a thing for eve online as a whole
the secretary is lazy or something   expected them to be posted in proclamations but ankh is taking her time with the moms i guess
ankh is hardly lazy i believe the minutes both of them   were signed and shipped off to ccp im just not sure why they arent released yet i will find out guys hold on
ank did exactly what she was supposed to do she drafted the minutes got them signed off and emailed them to ccp for hosting ccp have since sent me apologies that the minutes have not yet been hosted as agreed but the delay is entirely down to their end and should be resolved soon
so we should expect to see the minutes sometime in 2010

awesome idea this opens so many more options than merely protecting your settings from ccps bumbling autopatcherexperienced players in corpsalliances can make standardised overview tabs for new playersforum discussions on the merits of overview arrangements can actually be accompanied by example scriptsfleet commanders can standardise their followers overviews thus able to ensure that everyone can see what they canplayers can download and test a whole library of setups customising to their preference instead of having to do everything from scatch for each characterso yeah supported 100

very yesthis was mentioned a few times but nothing has ever come from it i think its about time personallyoverview settings can be quite complex to setup and having them cease to exist whenever a patchreinstallsuddenactofgodunfortunatecrash happens is incredibly frustrating

yup its very important to be done ive had such problems for all time im in eve
yes on exportable overview settings this is actually the one reason i dont go to the local gaming club and use their pcs to play eve where i also might socialize with other gamers going to a strange machine wherein the one thing you dont have is your  many   overview settings is a dealbreaker
hell yeah
has it been discussed before sure has anyone ever started a petition thread in the csm forum i looked but didnt see it mentioned here so i proposeadvanced infomorph psychologycategory sciencerank 6prerequisites infomorph psychology ivpsychological training that further strengthens the pilots mental tenacity to withstand the rigors of jump cloning the rigors of having ones consciousness detached from ones physical form more often scattered across the galaxy and then placed in a vatgrown clone can be very unsettling to the untrained mindreduces standard 24 hour jump clone turnaround time 2 hours per levelprimary charisma secondary willpower
is anyone not satisfied with 5 jump clones i hardly even use one let alone the 3 that i can if this skill is proposed it should be rank 5  assuming im correct in remembering that the base skill is rank 3   and you should require v in the skill
this statement here demonstrates the issue i see daily income from research agents can equal a couple of hours of mining veldsparwe all agree that anyone doing this kind of thing afk using an industrial ship in a 10 is rather lame here we have the same thing though and the person who benefits doesnt even have to be paying to play eve they just afk gain several hours of mining veldspar everyday for as many months as the like and then just sign up for 60 days  now   and collect up all the profitsfirstly wed all be fools if we were not doing the same thing ourselves right now secondly that still doesnt make it right no matter how much some of us like it gain without effort or investment is  lameit cheapens the eve experience

ill give it a  redesign is needed but i like the idea of burst weapon more you shoot a lot then its cooldown and reaload and again shooting  for me its a nice alpha strike stays in line with alpha strike of old times
hmm you know this sounds cool i dont fly minmatar ships but i have used artillery back when it was the only good weapon system on my ancient prophecy the idea of shooting four or five powerful shots then a long reload is kind of appealing however if we did this and made their reload speed 15 or even 20 seconds one could argue that an advantage to projectile weapons the ability to change ammo types to suit your needs would be negatedartillery already received a damage boost when the hp of all ships was increased but i wonder if 10 or so more range could help outi dont want artillery being able to alphastrike something into oblivion but i do support the idea of it being very wince inducing a look into it would be worth it
either the guns or the ships but right now minmatar snipers are outclassed in almost every way and it sucks
if they got rid of one of the disadvantages it would be a lot more balanced i support your proposed change over that as it keeps the individuality of the different weapon systems
right on

yes we have reload all for projectile weapons  current ammo   but a reload all with x is needed as well for changing ammo types
definitely supportedand it would be such a simple thing to add
yeah and better start with this subforum which becomes more of a mess by the day
firstlyif you havent actually installed and tried bacon you shouldnt be posting an opinion sort of like you shouldnt say a certain food is disgusting without trying it first otherwise your argument carries no weight its simply an unfounded opinionsecondly bacon simply adds an audio queue to something that already exists as a colour queue if you watch local you identify hostiles by their colour  ie reds or neutral   bacon simply adds a beep to that colour it hardly revolutionizes the system nor does it give some crazy advantageif you are the kind of person that doesnt watch local you probably arnt astute enough to install bacon either i use bacon i use it because i like the sexy audio queue and i like hearing what alliance the reds are from without having to open their profile it doesnt make me a pvp god it doesnt make me unkillable  which is obvious from the various deaths ive enjoyed in the past few weeks   it simply adds something eve should have already anyhowthere is so much drama around such a mundane tool props to the gunfleet guys for thinking out of the box but its not like the addon has changed the way the game plays the majority of these posts are full of sound and fury but ultimately signifying nothing respect to those who have added constructive criticism
however if you read the posts of some of the ones that are fighting so hard for it you will quickly realize that players you quoted above that are not estute enough to install it are using it another words because they do not want to put the effort in paying attetion to the game they are using an aid to make sure they dont loose there ships
okso first of all im going to almost ignore the fact that not one sentence above was completely coherant ill assume its a language barrier which is fair enoughregardless they are already using an aid its called local and another called tags red tags for enemies no tag for neutrals etc bacon simply adds one more audible layer of tags bacon really just adds a sound effect to local if you really feel that makes people invincible well then fair enoughi personally havent found targets harder to find or catch than normal bacon doesnt tell people what ship im in or what gate im at it simply says im there which is information readily available through the local channelwill it possibly someday prevent you from catching someone who would otherwise have been busy eating cheatos and not watching the screen for a second yeah maybe but that encounter is so rare you wont miss it but you will probably appreciate the features bacon gives you  ie announcing the alliance and whether the target is war or just unfriendly  to each his own of course but its certainly not worth the massive amount of posting drama its getting
first damn good goon idea i have seen hereno bacon less carebears more pewpew
according to the patch notes this is going to be fixed in eaquote several improvements have been made to logging both server and client side in order to provide a safer playing experience and a better development environment 3rd party tools that utilize the client logs will no longer provide useful outofgame intel this change will not affect 3rd party programs who use the eve api  evemon eft etc  
bacon failure
can we lock this topic now that its official bacon is outsee ea patch notes
derr
got my support id like to see eve continually changing static resource placement doesnt support that
yeah im aware my proposal is a bit rough chaps id definitely like to see more ideas coming on the issue and if somebody does come up with a killer proposal that does what we want to see here then ill be very happy to support it
weird idea remove pos give us moon mining ships that have pos size shields when in deployed state put sov on a different system randomise the amount of resource in a moon when a resource is depleted it respawns in another random moon within the region  or somewhere in eve for that matter  also give us research ships and manufacturing ships all of which require some fuel in order to do their jobs in deployed statethe isk sink generated by having to continually rescan to find the good moons helps the economy by removing some of the isk flowstatic defences become useless alliances and corps have to move around as the resources move or else accept they dont have a guaranteed income from the moons in their area thus promoting roving gangs and patrols and allowing for ninja moon miningtitans could become mobile stations given a deployed statepvp increases as the migrating corpsalliances rub up against each other in pursuit of resources that move aroundexploration characters get more employment scanning a systems moons on contract or selling the results of a system scan
this would become more of a hassle than anything and i think randomizing would lead to more moon mining and the collapse of all prices think about itif a corporation wants to have a better chance of finding dysprosium in their systems they simply have to mine every moon which oversaturates the market and causes prices on nonrare moon materials to plunge even further than they are now as every moon mining company has an extreme surplusthe erosion of deposits of materials on moons is not the answer i believe i think the answer is partially going to be making the lower end materials more valuable by increasing how many products that can be made with them make npc trade goods buildable woooo or decreasing the amount per cycle rare materials can be extracted by much like how you can get thousands of tritanium from a single cycle but only a few dozen megacyte in the same span of timesorry jade not signed
i offer this as an idea for lessening the impact of static moon mining and add my general support to this issue
ok this will sound real funny coming from an antipirate but no pls dont change low sec sentry guns much they are quite fine as they are they give some disadvantage to the initial aggressor but do not turn the battle the only problem i see with them is that a large number of ships can tank the sentries by just having the large numbers make the guns concentrate fire thatll take care of it
im a antipirate and id like to see the removal of sentrys in low sec they do not help the ones getting ganked in camps all they do is act as an excuse for pirates to avoid players that actually wants to fight themedittotal removal of sentrys might be a bit drastic but having sentrys on highlow sec boarder gates and stations should be plenty rest of them could just be removed imo
having the sentry guns on your side is like having an indestructable battlecruiser on your sidean indestructable battlecruiser with perfect tracking i might addthey stop pies from using nano ships and dronesthere good enough as they aredont complain if you jump into a pvp area in a bear ship or untanked hauler and get gankedif your antipie then stop asking the game to do your work for you  whats the point in that gates are finenot signed
there are so many posts about buffing this i hope its done by the end of this year
bos need buffthere is one thing to keep in mind though bos were offered by ccp to the playerbase as cloaked hitters that is exactly why i trained it  since being a really really upset pilgrim pilot   nothing came true  as such it would be a pain to again have wasted skillpoints if the role is defined completly differenta i expect a fix for the previously suggested role which includes the ability to actually hit something  not with scan res penalty  b alternatively 2 bo lines for each race offering the previously suggested role and a maybe new roleplease make it clear to ccp that another skill point wastage is not an option
issue supported
approvedbut single skill queue only and the skill to be queued must be prechosenno automatic continuance of your current skill and the queue is not valid on inactive accounts

im not a member of ucam but i follow their activities in macrointel and occasionally help outsigned
ccp have stated in the past that they generally do not follow the isk trail beyond one hop without concrete evidence well now that the farmers know this they just move it twice before selling it the farmer accounts generating the isk are never in dangerthat doesnt mean they arent paranoid though check out those mission running hubs you know the guys storing their cnr fits in gscs while they are offline arent worried about getting banned in the next 5 minutes they are just doing it for fun
balance must be restored
this thread is so ridiculous cause you seem to forget a ganker loses his privileges in empire which means doing some mindnumbing ratting ill agree to nefing up suicide ganking if ratting is made more interesting cause its bloody boring or even more interesting ways to up your sec statusjust to show you how ridiculous this thread is i vote yes cause im still gonna gank you no matter how high you make it for me actually you will be doing me a favour i wont have to waste my time on crappy 200mil kills ill go straight for the biggies with a bil or more so more profit less ratting thanks make suicide ganking more difficult and you will give people a real false sense of security and bring out even more afk haulers while at the same time making me more focused on getting that uber kill i really love your work do it i friggin dare ya

i
stop being such a whiny carebearthe only people who agree with you are other whiny carebearsif you want a non pvp server go play wow and stfu
second this
such reasoned arguments in a discussion threadconcord doesnt protect you it provides consequences to those that break the law to my mind one of those consequences should be if you lose your ship to them then you dont get an insurance payout on top of what you pick up from the target it forces people to think about what they are doing more and to weigh the lossprofit balance to my way of thinking it introduces skill to the profession of suicide ganking
adds skill my ass all it does is make ships with less than 2 bil in mods not worth killing and they are rare enough already
if they are that rare how come you see so many concordokkens as you travel through empire space are gankers shooting everything in sight on the offchance
theres roughly 30k ppl online in eve at any time during the day or night and concord stays on the gate until after dt so it will add up and seem like a lot  especially if you include customs by mistake   but the fact is that avoiding gankers is easy unless your lazy and that is the real issue not the insurance
deffo
why not tell everyone how to easily avoid these ganks mission ganks travel ganks so that the issue then becomes null and void and doesnt have to take up ccps time
why would i want to reduce my income by doing that theres enough ppl doing it to avoid getting ganked in eve already let alone giving a blow by blow how to avoid getting ganked guide to every other muppet in eve in fact theres a few of the ways already posted on here by idiots whos brains are obviously lacking any common senseroflmao typical eve if you wanna know how to do summat in eve just post a thread about how that it cannot be done and wait for the responses from fools whos ego is not connected to their wallets
signed
supported no insurance for ships lost to concord can you imagine what the insurance company would say when they got the claim form
all true and i would love to see those statistics and if indeed suicide ganking is relatively rare or if it does not noticeably affect the economy then i will happily surrender the point from the anecdotal evidence available to me though i think the statistics side with the carebears on this one  but if you can prove me wrong im all earsthats true but there are many many legitimate players who want it too for the record as a miner i vehemently oppose macro miners and other lowlifes who drive down the prices the real miners can get for their ore and mineralswhy should an honest miner have special protection in hisec because hes a lawabiding citizen minding his own business doing something that benefits the economy why should a ganker not because a ganker is a criminal the vast majority of new eden is not policed  and in those areas pirating is a perfectly legitimate playstyle and anyone who ventures there does so knowing the potential gains and risks involved but ganking in hisec is illegal why would we protect anyones right to gank in hisecwe are advocating that in hisec punishment generally be sufficient to deter crime unless youre at war no pilot in hisec is a legitimate target thats the way the game worksyes ganking in hisec should not be financially viable if there werent hundreds of players willing to sit in asteroid belts for days shuffling cargo into a jetcan every three minutes youd be mining to build your own ships wanna try it suicide ganking in hisec is bad for the gameyes it seems fair to me but yes it is also supported by eve eves economy needs carebear miners because nobody else is willing to mindlessly sit in asteroid fields the skill system forces everyone to specialize and its a safe bet that the folks who want to specialize in mining are mostly carebears now why do gankers need their right to gank carebears protected do they only want easy meat and are afraid to go into 00 and pick a fight with someone who could actually defend themselves now who wants to enjoy a cushy playstyle still supported  
what about all the accidental concords that happen to everyone and the following petitions how do you think new players will feel when they get concorded by accident and dont receive the return on insurance they were told to pay for a ganker wont bother paying for his insurance and still only stand to lose aboutthis only serves to frustrate new players and i agree as cain mjolnir said above it will only give you carebears a false sense of security you are still going to get ganked what happens then when you remove insurance you are all still getting ganked and people arent receiving insurance for silly mistakes you are doing more damage to new players here than suicide gankers
maybe the solution is not to deny the pirates from ganking but to support those being gankedimagine at each gate instead of the billboard having a gun it has a large remote shield repair ii and a large remote armor repair ii on itif someone attacks you the guns and concord go on the hostile but the billboard starts repairing you the only way to take out a target is to commit more of a force to assault
no it is your burden of proof to show how rampant the crime is and how much it does impact the economy if you want to propose change you have to show some sort of solid data otherwise this is nothing more than emotional unqualified protestwhat you are advocating is a wow type of flag able safe zone you are pushing for absolutely no combat what so ever except for consensual flagged style show me where it states that a pilot in high sec is not a legitimate target and show me where it says this is the way the game workslook i agree that something should be done to make it a little more difficult my view is to give the prospective targets the tools to deal with it what they are might be another threadremoving insurance is not going to work you are not identifying the true motivation of why they do it they do it because they have fun doing it and its easy  has little to do with it and is a bonus if they get ithigh sec is not safe it is just safer and turning it into some copy of wow will hurt the game
billboards have guns i think not such a bad idea cant see it happening though
fair enough but the data either of us needs to conclusively prove our point isnt available on the scale we need it one interesting number i can point to is that currently this topic is the 5th mostsupported topic in the assembly hall out of almost 250the trouble with compiling data on miners losses is that on killboards its impossible to tell who is a real miner and who is a macro so i admit that these numbers are inherently flawed there isnt a universal killboard that i can point to so im going to use as an example the killboard of the jihadswarm campaign which got a lot of attention recently according to their killboard in march and april of this year they destroyed 923 exhumers 25 industrials and 128 mining barges in hisec for total destroyed value which they calculated at 107 billion isk thats just losses inflicted by a single group  albeit probably the most active group  why does eve even have a feature allowing legal war declarations if all combat is legit anyway and war declarations are not necessarily consensual theyre just fair warning ccp has emphasized that a big part of the game is nonconsensual combat  and indeed nonconsensual combat can and does occur all over the map nobody is suggesting that you not be allowed to activate a weapon module on an unflagged pilot in highsecurity spacecan doattacking unflagged ships in hisec is called a crime pilots are flagged as criminals for it that sounds pretty not legitimateits not possible to make it not fun for the attacker when thats their motivation but making it extremely expensive as opposed to in the neighborhood of breaking even will help deter it im not married to the idea of voiding insurance though and i trust ccp to use reasonable judgement in balance and mechanics if it decides to make a change
it only takes 1 very useful module if you call that pimped a gist booster 1b isk for it its extremely useful on a torp setup nowadays since you need flight timevelocity rigs this makes you a viable target even if the rest of your gear is t2 hardly pimped
and the fact that the module you are referring to has a very very slim chance of dropping is why insurance should not be removed
helloit has come to our attention that the current nidhoggur bonii are inadequate for the everevolving eve universeas such a fix is in orderthe following is proposedminmatar carrier skill bonuses18 degree bonus to pitch per level99 reduction in cpu need for warfare link modules99 reduction in cpu need for tactical logistics reconfiguration modulescan deploy 1 additional fighter per level200 bonus to fighter control range
supported this change to nidhoggurs boners will make it balanced compared to other carriers
i like this idea supporting
this this is why we have the csm
the long neglected nidhoggur boners do indeed require attention
concurred
an interesting idea and i tentatively approve but wouldnt this make nidhoggur vastly overpowered imagine a lineup of overpowered 72 degree goonfleet nidhoggurs against an alldestroying fleet of fully vertical factionfit bob nidhoggurs wheres the variety in that
i was told to support this on irc so sure why notalso nignoggur boner
signed for reasons that should be obvious to those in the know p
i approve of these boners
i agree with this post and the sentiments expressed therein
approved
i honestly do not see how anyone could possibly disagree with this proposed change it obviously should have been put forth sooner i support this idea fully
major redesign worth doing
supporting this
an excellent idea
i couldnt agree more brilliant idea
for sure
supporting this so hard its not even funny it must happen
features the ability for people to target systems like ewar reperation systems sensor system warp core    subsystem overheatingconsiderations it shouldnt be needed in most cases most of the time you wont even have to bother no subsystem should give so heavy penalties to the pilot that it would be considered overpowered ie systems which would be a must shootsystems  impact ui being more complicated server performance interesting tactical tool for smallgang warfare to be more viable could make it less viable for battle and capitalships to be solopwnmobiles
thats not truespeed tankers need mwd without it they die instantly but i fully endorse this and wish you could do things liek that that way people would actually have to limp home or become ineffective over roams instead of just need armor rep and being fine
historical wrongs cant simply be forgotten thanks to some trifling reparations offered by the state to pacify the proletariat this is unconscionable
i would support this in theory for larger ships however the combination of terrible ui and  just for one example   cap ship balance keep me from saying yes sorry no
complex and maybe not feasible just yet but id like to see this happen in some waytarget their phasers
i like the idea and support it being looked at on the other hand i do not think pilots should be able to target modules directly rather indirectlygive the option to target weapon systems which would be the highslot rack in general external systems target the midslots in general and finally internal systems or engineering which would be the area of the ship where the lowslot module subsystems would be storedwould be kind of neat to blast away at an industrials cargohold after locking it down completely and watching as the cargo spills out or trying to disable someones tank indirectlyon the counter side however these systems should not be easy to destroy or damage much like starbase weapons they merely go offline and your crewautomatic systems will be able to repair them when your ship is no longer in dangeri dunno im rambling at this point
supported but limited to capital and super capital class ships onlythis would work wonders with a boarding class ship  if we ever get one  
jesus christ this would over complicate combat and take all the fun out of it the ui already sucks in this game and i cant see this helpingone of those neat ideas that would be terrible in reality
amen to that my brother
lavista does the ability to shoot out someones mwd or ewar or weapons systems  assuming thats what youre talking about   just turn any gun into a very powerful form of ewar like why use a webber that only has a 10km range when you can target the mwd of the enemy ship with a much longer range weaponmaybe if the effects were less pronounced than dedicated ewar modules or the precision needed to target a subsystem was only available within a limited range
perhaps i misunderstood his idea but i thought it involved logging who was trying to access your account so if youre cracking it by brute force youll see a whole pile of failed attempts and it will be  hopefully   selfevident that someone has been trying to do something you dont want them to do with your accountanyway ill support discussion of security options because i know enough to know i am insufficiently paranoid but there are people who are properly paranoid and im sure that group is even greater among those who frequent the forums than eve in general   and the nature of the game means that we likely selfselect with more techsavvy people than in general  
i believe that a list of the last few login attempts is somewhat of a standard practice now and support that other standard practices are of course the secret question  secret answer stuff preventing changes unless confirmed by email and password complexity rules i am not sure that locking the account to an ip addressrange will be considered justified by ccp they can already see and log the computer name and address from which youre logging in and a simple look at the backlog will reveal a hacked account or not so its a matter of coding this extra ip address locking stuff in order to prevent a call to tech support to have your stuff restored except that theyll have to provide tech support for people who lock the wrong ip address or have exotic setups at home  elsewhere roaming laptops from hotels for examplei will however support ccp having a look and brainstorm about account security one big vulnerability is the fact that character sales force us to reveal account names which is half the information needed for brute force hacks maybe they can fix that somehow
cute pubbies ittfyi it shouldnt take a supercomputer to handle 60 ships in a system no matter what types of ships they are but the devs keep deluding themselves that stacks are the enemy when they very clearly need something more capable than python
theres around 240k paid accounts but a lot of them buy more than a month at a time so 36m a year is a decent approximation according to wikipedia their revenues last year were just under 36 million so your estimate is even pretty good but the question you have to ask is how much of that is free to just pile on a bigger server farm theyve got 250 employees  even assuming 50kyear average salary and benefits and payroll taxes of course   thats 125 million in salaries alone and depending on the structure of the workforce and icelandic law thats probably a low estimate add in bandwidth costs which are probably in the millions the normal server upgrades they are doing on at least a semiregular basis advertising costs office costs and all that other stuff and id imagine that they genuinely do not have the money to just plug in enough servers to fix the problem ccp isnt google dont expect them to spend like they are im not a mmo coder but my best guess is that the graphics on your system have no interaction whatsoever with ccps servers theyll be stored rendered and displayed entirely locally because theres no reason to stream them centrally in any form but a patch the client will just get an instruction like harbinger at grid coodinates xyz orientation thetaphi and do all the work on your machine itll be similar in other mmos  theyll stream a characters appearance attributes gear etc   but they wont tell your computer what texture to use where youd need a fibre optic line to handle that kind of bandwidth anyways  dsl cant come close
im not a mmo coder but my best guess is that the graphics on your system have no interaction whatsoever with ccps servers theyll be stored rendered and displayed entirely locally because theres no reason to stream them centrally in any form but a patch the client will just get an instruction like harbinger at grid coodinates xyz orientation thetaphi and do all the work on your machine itll be similar in other mmos  theyll stream a characters appearance attributes gear etc   but they wont tell your computer what texture to use where youd need a fibre optic line to handle that kind of bandwidth anyways  dsl cant come closeyou missed the point other games handle similar or more intensive graphics streaming similar amounts or even larger amounts of information with comparable or greater traffic and dont typically have comparable amounts of lag obviously this is based on personal experience and not any kind of study but i havent heard people complaining about dying in raids in wow due to lag let alone people dying and not even knowing that they had diedyes obviously wow has a different program structure and different requirements placed on it by the gameplay and i dont know the details of it but what were pointing out here is that in eve heavy traffic breaks the client and essentially makes the winner of a fight the one with less lag and whoever handles petitions is a  about it
i can understand ccp isnt god and cant fix everything 100 especially with limited  financial   resources though this isnt just regular lag cash warbash is talking about ive been at a fleet battle where for a period of 10 to 15 minutes you literally couldnt do anything nothing worked this isnt really the same as activating a module and waiting a few seconds before it responds this is looking at a still image for a period long enough to take a toilet break make coffee grab a news paper and read it entirely while finishing your coffee and maybe then finally your eve client will respondi am not exagerating though naturally if i see lag of this nature i wont go away setting coffee id be frantically waiting for an oppurtunity to safe my ship  waiting for the fog to clear you could saynow im very interested to hear how ccp deals with abnormal lag in relation to normal lag how this affects their reimbursement policy and if they draw a line at all where theres simply too much lag ignoring players about the severity of problems caused by lag and piling all such complains onto one big ignore itpile will result in an everincreasing number of unsatisfied players and im sure thats not what ccp wants
another lag threadallegedly  and a dev can correct me if im wrong   the reason we lag out so hard is the original code does not multithread what happens in spaceso its great they have all these nice servers and all these processors but when everything that happens in space  aka not the market or chat or eve mail   but all shipsweaponscollision detectionphysics and so on happens on one thread in the processor that node cant handle that because its not being sent out to multiple threadsrecoding this would be a btch as its not easy to rip the games foundations apart and recode itthis is something we live with until the eve engine is overhauled
you dont understand the csm thats the problem here not lag
since the mighty warbash clan has posted i will respond first of all i would have to agree that response from support was terrible there were many other far more constructive answers heshe could have given you next i would like to talk about what lag really is there are three specific components which result in what is known as lag in the players eyes the first of these is clientside lag clientside lag is caused by incapable cpu andor graphics processors it can also occur when data is loaded from mass storage devices  aka hard drives   i think we all understand this lag quite well so i will not cover it any further next is network lag network lag is a result of a large amount of data being sent over the internet from the server to the client the server sends information in the form of data packets the type of data packets all online games use are called udp packets udp packets are just sent with no confirmation if they made it to their intended destination or not as the information being sent to each client increases  during fleet battles   the server sends more and more udp packets and just expects they will arrive at their destination most of the time they do but sometimes they do not they can also arrive out of order  ever started to warp away just to be sucked back to the fight and see your ships carcass floating there as you get instapodded obviously something happened in the wrong order   additionally just because the server has a large network bandwidth  i garuntee you the eve clusters have to be massive   doesnt mean every other point on the network data packets are sent through to reach your computer has a large bandwidth in other words networks outside of ccp and your connection control the quality of service you get when playing a game over the internet one more note on network lag the current network protocols used to transfer data is archaic as far as computer time goes some attempts have been made to change this ancient system but too much of the worlds network infrastructure is built on it an improvement to network protocol standards would solve many issues we experience
finally there is serverside lag in eve this occurs when an area sees heavy player use  duuh   when this type of lag occurs the server cannot send information about the game state to clients in a timeley manner this results in your client waiting for data sometimes his manifests as the entire eve universe pausing before your eyes other times an animation your ship was executing  say accelerating   will simply continue even if something has occurred to change that state when the player experiences lag it is usually results from all three of the fore mentioned types of lag occurring at the same time more players in a sector results in more serverside calculations more network traffic and more calculations for your client to handle you are the master of your client computer you can solve this problem no one is the master of the internet ccp can do something about their servers design so this brings us to a specific question we must ask of ccp if i were to make the most powerful gaming pc money can buy and plugged it straight into the network switch your server cluster is connected to then proceeded to get in a massive fleet battle would i experience lag enough lag to make the fight unplayable if the answer to these questions is yes then ccp has a serious problem that needs to be addressed but what type of problems what type of questions what type of answers here is a miniscule set of possible questions client side  these issues could slow down even the best computers   are ships stations and other entities on the same grid being rendered even if i am too far to see them as anything more then a dot are ships at a far distance being fully rendered and fully textured even if i could not possibly detect whether they are or not is it possible to choose how many items are rendered is it possible to render entities only within a certain radius of my shipsever side  i am certain most of these have been addressed i am placing them here for the purpose of users   have the heavily used heavily spawned processes been fully optimized are systems seeing heavy usage being dynamically load balanced against systems that see little or no use are heavily used database calls being prefetched and saved to reduce redundancythis list could go on foreverin closing i would like to reiterate the main point hereyou control how much your client computer lags ccp controls how much their server lags no one controls how much the internet lags even if ccp had the computational power of every computer in the world combined even if you had a gaming computer pulled through a time warp from 20 years in the future you would still experience lag due to network issuessomething needs to be done but understand the limitations
ccp should just stop reimbursing completely rather than suffer the whines it generates reimbursing for lag would be a monumentally stupid decision for ccplag will always be an issue unless they set a hardlimit on how many people can be in a systemengage in a fleet fight
you are quite far off i thinkyou are right there is a potential for lag being manifested by network and processing power on the computer but in most cases this is rarely the case the amount of information sent to the client in terms of actual size is minimal eve as a client is a dumb telnet client the only real calculations that is done which has to be considered as a potential bottleneck is the graphics so you state that network latency will eventually be the bottleneck but even eve can easily run on a 100ms latency connection the bottleneck will never be there unless it started sending bigger packages and many of thembut that isnt what this thread is about the issue as it is now is that all things in a system is handeled by 1 core otherwise known as a node 1 single cpu core   due to the inability for a cpu to scale in speed lag isnt simple to fix instead of scaling in speed we have to scale in cores due to the stackless python architecture one cant just split tasks out between cores neither is the current network architecture of the cluster ethernet fast enough for thatccp is working on reworking the network engine for their cluster in order to enable these scenarios they have as far as i hear a test cluster with inifiband at the iceland office once that is implemented on the london cluster we will see that ccp can increase the performance of the cluster by quite a bit
isnt it embarrassing that a csm member rather than explaining csm isnt even about or in any way able to deliver on some generic and silly advocacy instead encourages the lag issue and the csm misunderstanding with it the only answer to this is not in our purvey
the message was quite clear but let me summarize it just for youcurrently the main bottleneck is not the computer the client is running or nor the internet connectionthe server software is based on stackless python which cant make use of several threadsthe cluster architecture cant handle moving the cpu load between several cpusccp is working on rewriting the software to make use of infiniband which allows them to scale the performance
lag is a known issue and occurs in generally predictable conditions ccp has a plan to deal with lag via two methodsa   code improvementb   hardware upgrades  in the form of solid state drives faster 64bit chips with more cores and perhaps most importantlyinfiniband replacing ethernet on the cluster  in terms of the hardware aspect csm can not run the procurement office at ccp these are all business decisions on ccps part that would have a material impact on their financial statements in terms of the code improvement ccp is working on thisfurther the idea of developing something that would be granular enough to specifically log and track all player actions to the point that some would like would result in two thingsa   wasted time and resources as some of the issues are already being worked on via improvementsb   additional overhead and processing power resulting in more lagand lastlyif you feel the desperate need to be reimbursed for the evils wrought upon you and yours as a result of this thats truly unfortunate that you would think ccp gives handouts every time some guy swears up and down that lag killed him wouldnt have money left for upgrades once people view ccp as one big atm every time their connection fartsanyway there are other games at the end of the day play the one you enjoy is my best advice
in your haste to rebut me i dont think you understood or read what i wrote
first of all i dont respond to alts who act as hacks for this provided please reply with a character you truly use no ghost reply should be give weight and they should be consider a hack for the provide dont let them take us off topic this subject is for real players with real lag issues regarding customer service responses and denial by the provided that problem exist when you are in a fleet of 65 people and all of them tell you they are frozen the game is frozen or that they are getting 1 frame each minute its is clear to me there is a service provider problem first of all ccp doesnt acknowledge that there is a lag problem and doesnt provide a system for documentation for problem and customers service chooses to blame the client and tell them indirectly that they are lying which is unacceptable on any level of client customer service interaction so up grades will not work with that type of position maybe there is a multiple stream problem as stated by one of the replys above but i have been playing this game for almost 4 years large fleet battles always pause and remain slow its not my connection point or my computer for i have played on many different computers plus the people im in voice chat with confirm there is a fleet wide lag problem winners never lag  losers always lag 4 years of research here   that tell me that its not anyone single players computer but instead the interface server provider this is standard industrial knowledge if my web page crashes i dont blame the customers first of all farrah is a hack secondly ccp doesnt admit to lag 4 years of playing and speaking with people of the community it is clear this lag problem is unique to this game most other games drop you if it lags saving your character from unfair loses in eve if you lag you character stays online in a combat zone so most players do not disconnect and try and ride the lag out until they can take action within the game however if you lag you die so no action is possible if you dont lag you win i have 9 accounts and i only lose combat if i lag some lag is understandable but this lag issue is years old now and im not sure i can keep investing in a game that i cant triumph do to these issues poor customer service and no documentation procedures to address a problem that is on going i yet to here a player say hey man i had 20 minutes of lag and came out of lag and killed 20 ships and routed them all laggers always lose and with no way to log off and no way to document the problem other that the petition through the customer service i feel i am not playing a game but instead gambling eve should address these issues before expanding this summer i only write on this topic because i do love playing eve but the lag issues make the game not as fun knowing that you have to avoid gang fights with more than 5 people involved in the other fleet
lol this is a funny thread
i think two different things are being addressed here1 eve customer support i found the gms to be copying and pasting replies to almost any addressed topic and to generally favor complete inaction in regards to almost any issue this pertains not only to lag but to any aspect of customer support i find the gms in this game much less helpful than in any other mmo ive played  which is a shame since this game has the potential to be a better mmo than any of them  2 lag  large fleet battles are infamous for lag this has to change if this game is to remain on the market unfortunately ive also noticed more lag in missionmining systems recently  dodixie anyone    hopefully a way of handling lag will be implemented  cap system population perhaps  
i agree with lavista on the proposed causes of fleet lag and that said you need to understand that although lag happens for each of the players in the system  who end up waiting for tq to send their client instructions   the server could be operating at peak sending an immense amount of data out to each of the clients in a system even though each of those clients would receive updates once every 10 seconds or so the problem doesnt usually lie in client when you receive a message along the lines of an attempt is underway to activate that module etc since if you were having client side lag your pc wouldnt have effectively registered the attempt to activate the module in the first place to whine about ityou need to step back and look at the entire picture of whats happening during a fleet fightclient side computers are sending multiple requests to activate modules steer their ships and target targets sometimes also controlling drones although miniscule in computer numbers the data travelling between the server and its 600 or so clients in a huge fleet fight would be at least 4800  worst case all ships have 8 turrets to activate the at least is thinking about tracking computers mwds and the like   sets of packets that need to come in be interpreted by the server and then sent back to each of the clients each client needs updates to everything thats going on in the current grid this means that everytime somebody else in the fleet activates their 8 modules steers their ship or targets someone every client on grid usually gets informed in some way or other that information would total around the same as how much data the server receives when it activates the modules it would need to send that amount out to each clientyour client needs to then interpret this which it usually does in a timely fashion modules get confirmed as active and damage starts to happenits not that ccp has set the server dial to lag and stepped back laughing maniacally its just that theres a buttload of  happening at once in one of these fightsnow on to what shouldcould be done about itccp should investigate the load ability on their servers and post it somewhere allowing players to have the choice to whether engage knowing therell be huge lag the reimbursement policy could then be focused around this saying that if you engaged in a system with 300 people  if that was decided to be the limiting number   then youd get no ship but if lag happened  and dont be silly about it ccp its as simple as seeing how often each client gets sent an update   reimbursement could be considered based on other factorsdisallow systems to accept new players past a certain limit it makes sense since someone would be controlling the stargates and have information relating to how many people are in system this however will lead to people filling the system up with your players to prevent others from getting in although currently the other players would just get in but then crash and die losing their ships and not being much better off than if they were just disallowed access to the system in the first place
whatever ccp decides to do they need to accept their customers claims on whats going on with their servers although we all know lag happens it should be more obvious when 50 people yell about it at the same time or at least start making ccp investigate itif lag was brought into the reimbursement policy thered be a big issue ensuing with players calling in lag left and right with claims since there is no easy and foolproof way to measure that lag happened it would be a hit and miss reimbursement idea where some people in an engagement would get reimbursed while others didntas it stands right now big fleet battles bring losses if you cant afford to lose your ship risking the fight dont go
i believe ccp has said what the issue is the network code and the way the game loads system data and sends it to the clientremember they are still using network code designed for dialup and the loading is still designed for dialup they said they are working on the network code but if they change that they will also need to change a great deal of back end code that loads the data to send to the clienti agree that they should stop with the new stuff for a while and finish the need for speed changes

the guy got 2436 votes on a platform of outposts going boom thats over 4x the amount of support as the thread asking ccp to roll back a proposed subscription fee increase if your position gets 4x as much support as we want to pay less money id say youve got a pretty solid right to enact your platform face it man  this is exactly what jade was elected for
or you could argue instead of making things up 2436 votes for jade is not 2436 votes for destructible stations i can make up some numbers too 22215 people voted for other candidates therefor voting against jades destructible outpost plan  the only plan to feature destructible outposts   further 2436 votes is not a mandate as it only represents about 1 of eligible voters and about 10 of votes
if were going to bring up vote numbers i would like to point out that hardin who is opposed to this idea and made a very compelling case against it got only 43 fewer votes than jade did jade has no mandate whatsoever despite what he may like to thinkits also entirely possible to say that with exposure to how jade really acts some of the people who voted for jade might not have voted for him if they knew this is what they would get the same goes for any candidate in any election election campaigns are all spin and no substance and if theres one thing star fractions always been good at its spindoctoring this thread is good evidence of thatso lets not drag voter numbers and mandates into this as theyre both meaninglessas for jades why shouldnt we suggest this to ccp argument simple its not the best solution to the problems of 00 as anyone that actually lives and fights there will tell you its not even in the top five by my guess what concerns do i hear about fleet lag capital blobs pos warfare never have i heard a complaint about outposts why try to sidetrack ccp with a nonissue when there are so many other things you could work on that would help immeasurably more the only reason to do so is if it were your own personal mission which weve more or less concluded this to be
no he got 2436 votes for being a windbag no one actually read the candidates proposals they just went ooh theres a name i know he seems smart and voted the vast majority of people who voted had no clue whatsoever what their respective candidates stood for it was a pure popularity contest that came down to how many words you could throw at your voterseven if he was elected on that issue  he wasnt  its something ill be issueing about next week   it doesnt matter being in the majority does not make the majority right it just makes the majority ing stupidyoull notice theres been very very little actual discussion on this there have been alot of very very good highquality posts as to why this is a terrible idea yet nearly no responses to them instead jade the chairman of the csm and the mighty master of words has selectively responded to the poorest criticisms and massively overplayed the agreement hes receiving in this thread which apparantly comes entirely from his corpmateswhy do you think that is ill tell you why  its because when you actually put jade constantines positions and statements up for scrutiny you always come to the same conclusion theyre there to further his personal goals over the goals of the csm and of eves populace he said it himself in his campaign many many timeshe has never held 00 space and never intends to he wasnts to shift the advantages in 00 warfare away from territory holders to the nomadic powers that he has always been a part of from this theres 2 simple conclusionshes got absolutely no experience of what hes talking about and all his proposals just happen to be advantageous to nomadic powers  they lose nothing from outposts being removed or hey what about the statement that nanos arent a problem thats totally in line with real eve balance and totally isnt just another statement to prop up his personal goalsthough at this point it should probably be pointed out that these proposals would hinder more than help nomadic powers they rely by and large on lowskilled peons in large alliances for prey with the occasional large fight reduction in outpost count would seriously depopulate swathes of 00 leaving them very few people to fight except those powerblocs they so despise its obvious this proposal hasnt been considered past a cursory thought from any perspective theres so many flaws its unreal
i have yet to see how invincible outposts are unbalanced when you can always take them over it seems to be an idea solely because you think it would be cool and damnit eve sandbox whatever should be that way your support of your conclusions has been rather poor as wellgo ahead and do it though just exactly like you want to as long as the devs code in some easy way to turn it back like now after everyone realizes how ed up this became personally i think way to try and fix blob warfare would greatly increase chances for little guys who cant throw 500 capitals into a fight
im going to ask people to be a little more respectful in their tone when responding to this thread please and do make an effort to address the op post certainly interested in hearing fresh opinions too  i think weve heard enough from the usual suspects how about some opinions from other sources on the issueso lets address the nature of eve here dont fly what you cant afford to lose why should anything in 00 space be indestructible can people who oppose raising this discussion issue answer that question please
i consider im actually supporting the sandbox here and promoting alternative methods of warfare beyond simply playing the territorial holding game i honestly think its a mistake to have invulnerable structures in 00 on a fundamental level and its been directly responsible for a lot of the stasis in 00 and development of capitalshipsonline  combined with overwhelming defense advantage and broken sovereignty tools of course  as for supporting conclusionsim obviously not going to reply to personal attacks or questions of my experience ingame on this issue  these are not constructive posts and ill simply discount them neither is there any point addressing repetitive posts that are simply repeating the same argument endlessly without introducing anything new into the discussion once ive answered a query im not going to repeat myself ad infinitum such posts are pointless and a waste of everybodys time im posing questions in the op post answers to those are what im interesting in hearing and im certainly happy to pick and choose through the background noise to reach the interesting points for debate
oh god this is ripe bring back any memories i believe that falls under both categories both questioning a pilots experience and a personal attack hypocrisy and lies just like real life politics eha sandbox has to have walls darlin or it all floods outand also  if your point is that correct youd respond to all posters regardless of the manner they decide to respond there are plenty of good posts in here thatve seen no responses  hardin alex shurk ikar kaltin for example   and itd be interesting to see what youd think on those before i pitch in the rest of my opinion you could as you say pick and choose through the background noise after all you of all people should be used to filtering through walls of text
the reason everyone is ting up your pet thread is because you keep asking questions that have already been answered go read hardins post and shut up
aye i will try and keep it simple i completely support hardins post i can cut and repaste it if it makes you feel better you have yet to respond to hardin and since this is your pet project and as your defenders saythis was what you ran oni do believe that the burden is on you to represent your case i dont think the burden is on the eve populace to convince you why you shouldnt the position of csm and chair dont carry with it the mandate to champion your own personal poorly presented issues to ccpso as my official position i say no to your proposal and i reference hardins well thought out and well presented posts as my official position i will further reference various goonie posts as my secondary and tertiary positions you ran on a populist platform of dynamism antilarge allianceyour poorly thought out proposal runs counter to that it will help the huge alliances and hurt the small ones and interestingly enoughwhether its accepted or not jade fraction will still never dock in station that they siezed and will never enjoy the thrill of pushing the destroy button if by some horrible turn of events the current insanity sees daylight the fraction lacks the vision leadership organization and ability to achieve thischanging the game mechanics wont solve that problem
because the status quo is far more balanced than the proposed change thats the short version the long version is the pages and pages you continue to ignore probably hoping that the short attentionspan audience hasnt read those pages and you can paint the picture that were not answering your questionseditand to echo vants sentiments id be very interested to see a rebutal to hardins post or any of our posts where we go into detailed reasoning of our position rather than repeatedly asking us for those reasonsedit2actually its a laundry list of what jade refers to when he says that 00 has stagnatedso im pretty sure it relates directly to the topic just to restate the point destructable outposts will have none of the positive impacts jade states indeed destructable outposts will make all of the problems in 00  that jade does agree are problems   even worse
thats not really an answer is it though you think its reasonable that out of everything in 00 outposts should continue to get a free pass from destructible status because the status quo is better than the alternative by whose measure and better for whomas for the rest yes i have ignored pages of personal attacks and flames and ill continue to do so
lets go rl for a second im a canadian and the last canadian federal election had four serious parties of which the conservatives won 40 of the seats on 36 of the votes its a minority parliament and the three opposition parties all of whom despise at least two of their five main promises could easily have blocked those promises from being implemented but they didnt  they respected the conservative win and allowed them to go forward with the platform that won them the election raising only token opposition when it came time for the vote why two reasons  one they respect the publics choice and two they know the public sure as hell wouldnt respect their choice if they decided to asset that they knew better than the voters and this is a pattern repeated pretty often in all sorts of political systems  the person who wins by however small a vote total gets to implement their core platform you know how many votes you need to win an election one more than the other guy you talk small margins of victory i talk about jade having 42 spare votes as for his voters im one of them and i read every word of his 13post manifesto for that matter i read most of the other players manifestos too now im a geek of the worst sort but given this games population i doubt theres that small a number of us dont assume voters are stupid or even lazy  if they were all that lazy they wouldnt have voted and im relatively happy with what ive gotten  i wanted to see his bounty hunting scheme come up first but this works too and all this talk about how the sky is falling is fearmongering of the first order if its really that bad an idea ccp still gets to tell the csm to go hang regardless of their decision on this matter i dont mind hashing this all out or even suggesting that hes just doing it as a sly plot to further the goals of his alliance though i generally think conspiracy posts are silly   but this is a perfectly legitimate topic for discussion and it should go to ccp for further discussion there the whole point of this process was democracy lets not throw that away this soon
you are not addressing the objections of those who say no valid points have been raised and supported by various groups with their own statements no reasonable argument against the points raised has been presented or defended talk about it anyway is not valid we have fault with the position of this proposal and have substantial evidence support your position address what has been saidwe say no
hardins post while a decent summary of the anti outpost argument brought nothing new to the table its all been said and debated before  we didnt agree then we wont agree now for an account of the original discussion id advise a look at this threadi am interested in discussing these issues with hardin face to face and in the context of csmccp discussions as part of the formal agenda but i dont see a point in rehashing old debates with exactly the same material as previously presented
yes actually i think a proposal that will fix none of the problems its proposed to fix and indeed makes those problems worse is a bad proposal i think the status quo is certainly better than a bad idea i can really only speak for myself same as anyone else in here so i suppose by my measure as someone who has participated in campaigns to successfully defend and successfully conquer outpostsbetter for smaller alliances and the folks your idea supposedly champions actually
and youve said no every time the issue has been raised in exactly the same way for exactly the same reasons we had this discussion when it was first raised on chatsubo and nothing in your point of view has changed you havent persuaded me i havent persuaded you we agree to differ  hence there is absolutely no point to me addressing the identical points of view you express in every thread on the subject pezzle you are heavily invested in the pro indestructible outpost lobby  you believe your personal gameplay will be damaged by any change that obviously makes you viewpoint heavily biased and pretty emotive now i can  and have   calmly explained the position and proposal to you but nothing i say is ever going to convince you that your gameplay is not going to hurt by thiscomes a time when we simply agree to differ and we appeal to a higher arbiter and ask ccp if they feel 00 is ready for destructible outposts that is what this thread is about
but that doesnt make him wrong
dont pull that  dont even think about pulling that  if this is a proposal worth a damn you can defend it on better grounds than all my opponents are whiners who just think that the change will be bad for them personally admittedly the crap theyre claiming about you is just as bad and just as stupid but youre the op here and your job is to explain why the idea is good not why the opposition is bad do so or give up the debate for lost because if this is your best defence then it already is
you say  in your opinion   it wont fix the problems i  and many others   say it will we will agree to differ yep many of us have gotten involved in 00 campaigns many of us know the state of play the problems and the issues this is a difference of opinion between equally informed parties who wish differing things for the future of the 00 game its inevitable there will be disagreements  some of which will never be resolved and well have to trust to the good judgment of ccp to make the right call you say its better for small alliances to keep the status qup i believe its better for small alliances to break the status quo plenty of folks agree with you plenty of folks agree with me its a hot topic and an emotive issue all the more reason for it to be raised as an issue so we can get ccps opinion and statement of intention for the future
im not going to get sucked into the personal attack game that a lot of folks who agree with me     seem to be going forbut until you jade and star fraction have had to go from zero to outpost to defending outpost to conquering outpostyou are not equally informed no moreso than someone who has never flown nanos is equally informed as to the capabilities and weaknesses as someone who regularly flies them except on like a hugely grander scale
that was the point i was making herschel everyone can allege bias and invested interest what we have here are people arguing from partisan selfinterest of course im every bit as biased as they are  i would like to see a more open combat environment in 00 with territorial alliances taking more risk to claim space i believe that suits the objectives of enhanced dynamism in the territorial game i want to see 00 alliances taking horrible losses seeing their outposts burned and being bankrupted back to empire i want to see an end to indestructible capture the flag gameplay and some real consequence again  i want to see the rise and fall of empires and opportunity for new powers from the ashes of the oldbut dont think for a moment im the only one biased here this is why im saying there isnt much point debating with people who have already made their minds up long ago on the basis of raw self interest lets hear what ccp thinks  im actually intensely curious as to where they see the territorial wargame of eve online going in the future and i know for a fact a lot of other players are very interested too and would not be happy to see the opportunity to ask these questions pass because the proinvulnerable outpost lobby wish to defend their own position at all costs
again well agree to differ garreck you will believe your involvement with an outpostpossovereigntytool reliant power will give you a special insight into the argument ill say that my involvement with roving pvp attackerraiderforces gives me a special insight into the argument we both play the same game we both know how these things work its an invalid debating technique to claim that only outpost owners can correctly critique a problem with unbalanced 00 outpost mechanics however and that is the route that leads to nonsense personal attacks that must be disregarded by all rational people this really isnt just about outpost people its also about raideraggressive alliances that are currently denied the opporunity to hurt outpost people at the moment the outpost alliances have everything their own way  in order to fight them an aggressor needs to commit to become just like their enemy and transform into a sitting territorial power and im saying that i dont think this is right you can certainly disagree with me but you cant say i dont have a fair perspective from the point of view of the people i am speaking for in this argument ultimately id like to hear what ccp think
myself among many others have brought the argument that disproves this statement weve presented it in a civil manner and ive stayed as nonpartisan as is possible in this if youd be so kind as to respond id be much obligedbut if you missed it here it is again in shortoutposts are not just methods of holding territory they are methods of denying territory to project power across a region you absolutely must deny your opponents strategic bases of operation the only way to do that is to hold the outposts if you allow destruction of outposts you do not need to extend your forces in the same manner to strategically control space  tactical control in the smallgang theatre is irrelevant   this means that the advantage goes to the entity that gains most from denying space without extending their forces that is the established power blocsif bob could have 3 regions either side of delve simply filled with dead ground why wouldnt they do it same for ra and the east in an environment with depopulated barren 00 with no infrastructure smaller alliances cannot flourish and larger alliances can be even more secure in their space safe in the knowledge no one has the strategic infrastructure to challenge them you say this like the two are exclusive its not like poses need bashingdefending 237 what do you think sov holders do the rest of their timea pity because judging by the approval count  30 at time of posting from well over 200 posts   the people you represent do not itd be irreseponsible of you to raise this issue as a csm representitive remember you sit on the csm now you are no longer jade constantine but a representative if the people youre representing dont want you to raise the issue you dont raise the issue
as this very assembly hall demonstrates there are plenty of issues many of which look to be comparitively popular and easy to implement and will incrementally and collectively improve eve as a game for all of usi do not see why we are bringing forward a proposal which has no real consensus and which would require significant research and input from ccp when there are many more other worthy proposals that may not even end up being discussed becuase of the time we spend debating issues like thisin business we are encouraged to go for the lowhanging fruit to provide instant wins i want csm to be seen by the eve playerbase as a success and i do not think that will happen if the first csm ignores doesnt produce resultsyes there is a place on csm for longer term thinking  i am just not sure it is necessarily in this first term  when there are so many other things we could be focusing on and improving short term
respectfully alex no you havent you have argued a point of view you have told us your opinion you have made best guess assessments of what might happen and youve given an insight into your thought process you havent conclusively proved or disapproved anything however we are all intelligent people here and we can reach our own conclusions and often its sensible to understand that we will agree to disagree i havent been persuaded by your arguments this doesnt mean i think you are stupid or foolish it just means on this issue im not finding your logic compellingalso you need to remember that i have proposed consultancy with ccp in the op i want to hear their point of view and intentions for future 00 territorial warfare i would like to know  as would a large portion of the 00 player base   whether they would consider destructible player outposts part of their long term plan since im asking a question here im not interested in the minutiae of skyisfalling eve is doomed if xyz happens debate im not interested in endless circular gametheory goons will ruin 00 hypothesis i am interested in knowing whether people think this is a question that is worth asking now hardin has answered no  on the grounds that he thinks there are more important issues fine i disagree with him but i respect his point of view and he has at least addressed the principle im seeing good approval posts healthy discussion and its an issue that deserves an answer from ccp its my role as a csm rep to ask the questions that need asking and by consequence i will be asking the csm committee to recommend this issue for formal consultation if im outvoted im outvoted im not going to sulk about it weve signed up to a democratic process and well see where that takes us
it sounded more like you were adopting their tactics than mocking them to me but ill let it goi guess ive got a few questions here about your fundamental assumptions i think i know where youre coming from but just to be sure1   do you believe that it should be possible for the biggest bestorganized power bloc to lose a war under normal circumstances assume here that biggest bestorganized refers to actual combattested strength and ability not how good they look on paper 2   how much are you worried by the prospect of there being fewer stations in 00 space and the space presumably becoming less amenable to residency as a result3   in a war between a small spaceholding alliance with one outpost and 200 members and a large spaceholding alliance with ten and 2000 assuming equal levels of overall competence who do you think will benefit more from this change how will the end result of the war ie the small side presumably losing   be different as a result 4   would you be proposing this idea if you were a member of a major spaceholding alliance how about if you ran one  and if yes how would you justify this to your membership i know im stretching the counterfactual a bit far there given what i know of your play style something about being a nomadic hooker   and im pretty sure that your answer has to be yes but id like to see your explanation
well first youve ignored my points yet again good job thereand second youve ignored my points again good job thereif you raise this issue on the csm council you will be flying in the face of everything it supposedly stands for  supposedly keeping ccp in check and on track for what the players want  right now this topic has the lowest approval count out of any of the seriously active topics you have the same count as the change titan models to monster trucks issue if you raise this issue at council despite the massive amount of negative feedback  that youve pointedly ignored   all you will be proving is that the csm is an experiment that should not be repeated againyouve consulted the players come back with a fairly resounding no  14 of posts in this topic showing support and those are the ones whove bothered to post   to take this further would be sheer egotistical prattery youd be ignoring your consituents and going for personal views over what youre supposed to be doingremember this these are your words ask yourself in all honestly deep down is this a question that needs asking over the thousands of bugs issues errors and discontinuities that plague this game day in and day out is this petty personal crusade really worth asking you might not take your role seriously enough to consider that honestly but remember its other peoples money youre playing with
why not i have the decency to at least provide reasoning when im discounting your points the very least you could do is provide me the same courtesy otherwise your respectfully means absolutely sod alled this just in this topic now has less support than replacing titan models with monster trucks
this is the most debateheavy of the big threads too  theres actual discussion here unlike most of the others discussion implies posts but it doesnt imply support because the same person cant vote twice im not saying its a huge support ratio but its a lot higher than 14 if you measure thumbsplayers instead of thumbsposts
what special insight do you have and how is it relevant to the argument not a sarcastic snipe its well out on the table what special insight i feel i have and how it relatesbut a vague claim that you have equal insight doesnt just make it so im seriously wondering what it is youve learned in your roving gangs and patrols that provided you with the vision of destructable outposts fixing the problems you perceive in this case i think its relevant actually if an individual who has no history of claiming sovereignty and also has a loudly proclaimed intent of not ever holding sovereignty  for valid roleplay reasons   starts throwing around ideas that will effect those who do hold sovereigntythe validity of that persons argument needs to be scrutinized carefully as does perhaps the intentraideraggressive alliances are not denied the ability to hurt outpost people theyre simply denied the opportunity to force a strategic level of risk on outpost people without claiming equal risk themselves thats the very definition of balance raiders risk their ships to hurt other peoples shipsin the case of star fraction and other raider alliances quite successfully however the status quo forces alliances who wish to hurt folks in a deeper greater senseto ultimately assume the same risk themselves
confusing question im going to say yes because even the biggest and best power should face defeat by a wellworked multiple front attack  they should face loss of holdings certainly if the cost of war was properly represented in the 00 territorial game this would go a long way to breaking the static logjam that plagues the pvp endgame in eve at the momentnot worried at all outposts are far cheaper and far easier to build and defend than they were in the initial rollout  for all the bluster i honestly dont believe that alliance officers will  or could   commit to large scale outpost destruction for the lulz when a power has been through the hassles of pos warfare required to take these things they will find it hard to simply press the button and deny any potential renterresale income form the outpost outside of particularly bitter feuds and significant wars eve is isk rich today the population increases competitive pressure will ensure a steady pattern of outpost settlement the same mechanic that prevents wholescale pos destruction for the fun of it exists for outposts you need to win a pos war that means you need to deploy a cap fleet that means you could be counterdropped cap fleets dont do anything for the lulz difficult to tell and wars rarely work like that itll be the larger power vs the smaller power and its friends  or rivals of the larger power looking to gank capitals    ultimately it takes pos work to gain sovereignty in the current state of the game once the pos war is one the outpost will flip and the defenders have lost it forever  along with docking rights   potentially with destructible outposts well in the example proposal in the op defenders would have recapture possibility if it was being selfdestructed and if it was blown at least theyd have access to their hangers plus of course while the large side is committing to bully a smaller neighbour  whats happening to its own outpost systems  are its rivals moving to take advantage if i cared only about maintaining my own advantage and nothing about the general health of the 00 game in general id be utterly against this  it will shake up the status quo and lead to many more exciting and costly wars if i was counting on stability and a quiet life this would be the worst idea ever if on the other hand i ran such an alliance and cared more about war and space operatics and hurting my enemies significantly and wanting to change the landscape id be for it id much rather play a part in a dynamic campaign setting than be fixed in amber
there are 63 unique characters in this thread so less than 50 support as for how many players well i cant say however well over 10 of the thumbs up come from sf members and a fair chunk of the rest from roaming alliances with a vested interest oh and 2 goons taking the  discounting those 2 youre left with 28 supports from 63 characters 44 support in the democratic system that jade has sworn to uphold thats a no sounds high but considering other threads have a 90 poststhumbs ratio thats pretty damned significantstill waiting for a response as to why granting the ability to project power without physical presence is a good thing
i have to disagree again an attacker risks more isk in a single pos attack than the average outpost owner stakes in the destructible proposal in the op lets be sensible about this garreck at the moment to hurt an outpost owner you need to commit to a dreadnaught deployment and campaign of pos replacement to take away sovereignty to make the outpost vulnerable to conquest then you need to garrison and hold the place and put up your own towers to keep it from being recaptured thats a huge investment of time and effort and you only hurt your enemy while you are maintaining the conquest garrison current situation is entirely slanted in favor of the defender and the moreso since it is only possible for a raider power to hurt a territorial power if it ceases to be a raider power and adopts the defeated targets ideologynow with the example i gave in the op you still need to conquer the outpost you still need to deploy all the dreads you are still putting more isk value into harms way than the outpost owner does only this time you have a light at the end of the tunnel  if you successfully siege and conquer the system and make the outpost vulnerable you have the chance to blow it up and make the defender pay a significant cost to balance out the significant risk you have taken in the deployment of capital and conventional ships and expense of your own pos this represents a rebalancing of a current situation that is badly out of kilter garreck but lets not be silly about relative risk and isk values
im going to have to disagree with your point here i do not believe that the majority of people are intelligent i also believe most of them will come to faulty conclusions
come on alex dont be silly if you are going to play that game then one could just as easily say that a huge majority of the negative posts are from territorial alliance members with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo we also know how the system of support works here  many posts in the thread shows a robust and interesting discussion the bigger the discussion the more interesting the issue is but you arent going to get away with dividing supports by discussion posts and coming up with funky numbers we all know this one is a big issue and its an emotive one  it will hurt some 00 alliances if this ever came into the game we all know this some people love the idea some people hate it so dont act all surprised about it when the discussion attracts extremes of point of view and perspective
are all irrelevant you said it yourself eve is iskrich the only scarce resource is pilot time to stop someone retaking an outpost requires siginificant investment in terms of pilot time over a long period of real time to stop someone retaking an outpost via destruction of the outpost requires minimal time in terms of pilot time and real timehowever to resecure that space to the point you could reerect an outpost would take a much more significant amount of pilot and real time than it took to remove it also youd have to do the resecuring and reclaiming of sov under the eyes of an enemy with an established strategic and industrial base while youd end up operating out of poses in deep spacehow that increases combat dynamism i have no idea
yes and they are two of the main detractors in this case are cva and goonswarm however these two entities are probably two of the most wellversed entities in the galaxy in pos and territorial warfare their opinion while vested is far more informed than many in this threadthat isnt what i didcorrect the small ones who currently rely on being too small to bother having their space taken take an alliance at random say smash fairly small fairly low average sp fairly typical bloated giant 00 ratting alliance why do you think it has taken till now for someone to attack their space
alex you are making points and asking questions that have nothing to do with the op post or proposals on the table please calm down
whatthe risk v reward balance in terms of pilot time invested has nothing to do with outpost destruction eh
calm down hahahaha coming from you
what i was getting at with 1 was that as far as im concerned the stronger party should win the war not that they shouldnt get battered in the process but at the end of the day they ought to be victorious and if they dont theres likely something wrong with how the game is set up this is mostly aimed at your suggestions about how this will make the game easier on smaller alliances  frankly if smaller alliances want to play with the big boys theyll get pounded into dust by them and rightfully so the best you can really hope for is switzerland  make yourself a tough enough nut to crack that they dont want to invade since youll never stop them if they really want to but they shouldnt be able to win  the star fraction should not be able to take the fight to bob unsupported and do bugger all your comments through this thread seem to indicate that you feel differently and that worries me a little 4th alliance tourney aside  artificially leveled playing fields dont count no matter how much fun that match was to watch re 2 if you dont believe goons boasts about popping outposts for the lulz might i suggest you inquire at your local hulk dealership about their extended warranty offers more seriously do you not acknowledge the possibility of an outpost whose potential revenues are lower than the costs of defending it and as such where it is worthwhile to pop it instead of keeping it as for cap fleets thats rather irrelevant to your proposal since you suggested selfdestruct only as such destruction only comes at a point where youve won the cap fleets are put away and you have to decide whether to defend the space i cant imagine that decision will inevitably be prodefence re 3 im aware that i oversimplified horribly unfortunately such is often required in the realm of thought experiments  the real or real   world is too complex for simple analysis also does it worry you that youve just said a destroyed outpost makes a better logistical base for the losing side than an intact one thats a massive flaw  the defenders actually have a huge incentive to pop the outpost as soon as it even starts looking like it might fall because it shortens their supply lines for after it falls thats a really big problem re 4 that was pretty much the answer i was expecting  not like you could really have said anything else and maintained your plausibility here im still curious about how youd justify it to the members though  yeah you know the outpost you guys just spent a few thousand manhours mining and building im just going to go ahead and make sure our enemies can take it away from us more easily id love to see the corp mail after that one
and it doesnt take a long time to shoot pos shields down now seriously stop acting like outpost establishment is a big deal in the effort stakes it really isnt any more takes far more effort to successfully siege a system against opposition than it does to establish an outpost in the current state of the gamebut like i said please calm down have a reread of the op post and if you want to address those points feel free but lets leave all the nonsense partisan politics and accusations of bias and csm faulty procedure at the door okay were all biased your biased im biased the goons are biased cva is biased if we werent biased wed probably not care so accusing this stuff is pretty pointless
another really good way of rewording what im trying to get at this is about so much more than upfront onpaper isk risk
it takes 10 minutes per pos its not the significant part of the fighting thats the fight over the cyno jammer once that is down it comes down to who has pilot superiority fighting over capitals once the jammer is down is incredibly rare weve seen it maybe 2 or 3 times out of the dozens of outposts that have changed handsshowing your inexperience here jadedo you know why it is so much easier to deploy an outpost in the current state of the game sovereignty tools you can jump a freighter in complete safety straight to its destination youll note the key part of reconstructing an outpost after destruction is the fact you have no industrial or strategic infrastructurehow do you propose they build an outpost with such ease without access to sovereignty tools jump freighters cant carry an egg youd need to deploy a titan or run freighter convoys through hostile space either way youre putting disproportionate assets at risk to the effort your attacker put into removing your infrastructure and all the while theyve probably got a jump net right across the regionthis is also discounting the time it takes to ship the parts to a single factory and construct the egg which is pretty significant parts total 20x the volume of the egg iirci havent accused anyone of anythingbut yeah good job responding to my points again instead of just posting meaningless rhetoric and implying im an idiot ohwait
there is winning and there is inflicting damage nobody is saying that a small power should be able to win a war automatically against a larger power but there should be cost for both sides and if they get involved in asymmetrical offenses its entirely reasonable that some outposts get burned for both parties before the war concludes with the expected consequence yep of course or maybe it gets ransomed back to the original owners maybe we get to see a renaissance of 00 piracy with pandemic and friends flying round the map and conquering outposts and threatening to blow them up unless the original owners pay a bribe harsh scary but definitely eve my point was that to get to the stage where you can selfdestruct you need to take sovereignty and that takes cap fleets that means deploying cap fleets against the small alliance and taking on all the risk that entails of one of your other enemies hot dropping you at the pos while you are taking the system well they pay a price for it and im not envisaging corporate hangers and fitting tools literally the hanger is a giant can and you can lever stuff out of your hanger to a cargo bay or dock with a ship from a pod its not exactly optimal and the attacker still gets to deploy large bubbles and camp the place but i guess if you consider multi billion investment reasonable for a derelict super can base then fair enough  does raise the question of what happens if the other side decides to rebuild the derelict at a discount with a new outpost though  thats something i havent thought of well i guess our goon delegates are going to have that experience with titans soon serious point is  there is personal advantage in game and there is the good of the game i want to be successful with my character in game sure  but if the game itself dies then whats the point of that success eve needs to be thriving to truly keep my interest i cant think of anything more sad than to be ruler of a pos empire in a declining eve that is dying because the 00 game is just too static for anyone to enjoy
whatthere are more alliances in the game now than ever before there are more younger pilots in 00 there are more older pilots in 00 00 space has actual worth through its moons its more populated and has more fights than ever before from day to day nanogotry to the recent 50 cap death a day fights up north between nc and insrg space ownership has swung around so many times in the last months its nigh on impossible to track the west is full of neutral entities not one but two northern superpowers collapsed the east fractured and splintered and the south is gearing up for another epic confrontationhow on earth is this game dying its only as dead as you choose to make it the magic of that sandbox you hold so dear
lets see if you actually respond to points raised if i remove the point questioning your experience on an issue as it actually relates to what your saying and whilst your choice to ignore it is unsuprising its hardly how a csm rep should act instead of complaining about bias and refusing to answer points that question your experience and position to talk about these issues try actually debating the issue if you want to follow the actual csm ruleswhen outposts were introduced and soverignty was introduced based on pos warfare how long did it take to destroy a single pos how many capital ships were around how many dreadnaughts were around they were a limited factor designed to help pos warfarenow it is possible for 100 dreadnaughts to be fielded against a pos it is now faster and easier to destroy poses than ever before and harder to defend againstto combat this and help alliances stop being steamrolled new mechanics were introduced did this make living in 00 easier possibly were they intended to be used as an outpost buff no they were introduced to make pos warfare more managablenew features should not be looked at in stand alone situations cyno jammers and jumpbridges make logistics easier lets remove them shall we we now have a system where dozens of dreadnaughts enter a system at will reinforce all towers in very feasibly under an hour to reinforce as many poses as seige cycle allows then 2 and a half days later they return and destroy those poses even faster  whats the record for a pos being destroyed out of reinforced i believe its under 5 mins  so an alliance does this and next down time sov drops lets look at the time scale on this 3 days from initial suprise strike to sov deadoutposts have not changed their value has not changed the effort in putting one up may gotten easier but this is in balance to the effort neccessary to defend them the mechanics surrounding their defence has changed in a response to the changing circumstances of the eve environment in which those mechanics applyyour argument is flawed becaused it is basing the argument to make outposts destroyable based on the development of pos warfare which developed in a way which was neccessary and although not neccesarily balanced has not impeded 00 warfare to a great effect in a way which was not intended to boost outpostscyno jammers and jump bridges are not restricted to solely outpost systems reliant upon the existance of an outpost if they were then i might just let you look at outposts in relation to these mechanics in isolation to the rest of eve however just because you cannot drop 100 dreadnaughts and destroy a system does not mean that someone or hell even everyone else in 00 cant do thatgive outposts defences give them a major major major boost ie 20 corp offices each all services at a good quality and then you can trade off these boosts against it being utterly destroyablewhat annoys me most about this is that you are looking at these mechanics and how they compare to other mechanics in isolation of the wider circumstancessimply answer this question considering that outposts were given destructible station services which means they can be effectivly made useless which in essence for outposts was a nerf in what way are outposts unbalanced and needing to be made destructable how have they recieved any buffs that are not simply in response to another issue where any bonus they recieve is a side issue of the bigger picturewhen they were introduced they had a purpose and have the exact same purpose today they have not changed you say they are cheaper in relative terms how are they just because time has gone on and people have made empires the way ccp intended using the mechanics they intended to make living in the valuable parts of 00 profitable doesnt means things are any cheaper
you are going to have to read the context of the reply i made to another person rather than just snipping quotes and asking silly questions alex
it was in context if you think its out of context and the answer is the game isnt dying  then why the need to revitalise itmore to the point what logic have you used to come to the assumption that removal of infrastructure will give a more vibrant 00 surely itd mean 00 can support fewer pilots giving a much more dull gameoh and you still havent explained how the ability to deny space without physical presence is a good thingstill havent replied to hardin either just sayin
destructible station services is largely a joke nothing that can be done in a reasonable timescale by anything other than a full pos sieging gang outposts are unbalanced because they cannot be destroyed its that simple everything else in eve 00 can be outposts cant now perhaps you can tell me in return why an outpost should be the exception to the rule given that players are currently flying and risking super capital ships that represent far more isk investment and construction difficulty every night in eve everyone has more money 00 especially the cost in real terms is much lower the cost in effort is much lower there are significant infrastructure advantages that make outpost establishment today much easier
again with the isk its been established that its not relevent in your own words from this very post everyone has more money 00 especially the amounts of isk here are irrelevant the only things involved are pilot time and strategic impact the strategic impact of supercapitals is negligable i cant operate an alliance to the point of dominating a region from a mothership and a titan isnt much better while theyre comparable isk wise theyre nowhere near the same league in terms of strategic mechanicsoh and constructing a supercap is alot easier than constructing an outpost i can tell you that outpost requires managing a system of poses construction of the egg  20m m3 of mats   and all the other construction materials supercap is mostly just hauling components to a spot and hitting the button that is unless its youre first time but then who hasnt built supercaps these daysand how does one gain access to these infrastructure advantages when say goonswarm has just rolled through your space with scorched earth set to 1
same reason they didnt emulate restricted docking in the fw model presumably they are making this decision informed by the experience of 00 and with an eye on enhancing the 00 experience the vision of eve four years ago and the real eve today are very different ccp has grown more pragmatic and interested in preserving a threshold of basic playability rather than committing to some rhetoric of harshness that is largely untapped and exhaustingsee 00 roaming and all pos gameplay im all for more concrete victory conditions but i suspect the real effect of this is unpredictable doing away with that in the form of destructible outposts seems like it serve more rhetorical interests than it would genuinely enhance gameplay at the sovereignty and territorial level especially when alliance spies can more or less undermine pos and sovereignty within existing gameplay mechanics
you might be right so lets ask them then we can settle the matter of this discussion and get on with other topics
a   not really unless you believe that making it harder for smaller alliances to gain footholds and become powers will somehow increase the amount of times that lines are redrawnb   plenty would be fewer than there are nowbesides pos fuel guns capitals time effort planning yea that is nothingexcept there is no mechanic by which we can capture pos imagine if you could capture pos when conquering a region you wouldnt have to put your own infrastructure down it would be a lot easier and the only expenditures would be in time effort and possibly capitals it would be easier to attack a regionbut in the end pos are not nearly comparable to stations they have no personal hangars they are not buffered by a siege they offer no repair facilities and no true sanctuary from enemies you can not easily manage fititngs ships and assets you cannot trade materials there are no contracts no market no offices no clones you cannot only have one in a systemit might make sense if pos were that type of asset but they arent and no comparison to their destructibility and inability to be captured can be madeno it may not be reached whether or not it is reached is determined by the ralative power of the institutions which it borders but even if it is reached it will be reached later and less often its a matter of risk and reward and you reduce the reward and increases the risk this doesnt produce more action to make sov change hands it produces lessbecause an outpost is an operational goal and a pos is a strategic goal just as we dont have the ability to destroy dyspro moons the static resources give structure and goals to be achievedcapital ships are not captureable operational goals they are tactical goals something you must remove in the way to achieve strategic and operational goalsif they burn the rest there is even less space and less valuable space the little guy thrives by keeping these less valuable spaces as it grows in power fewer places to go the more often they are out on their ass your argument is akin to saying we should get rid of the homeless shelter because it sucks to be homeless
or lets not and lets ask them about far more pressing issues say for example the removal of 3090d gtcs or the abandonment of the api development or the gashtastic ui or the constant prevalance of desync or the seeming lack of accountability for gms or the absolute lack of working bounty system or the constant disparity of speed or the subpar nature of minmatar battleships or the farmer infestation of empire or the imbalance between mission and ratting rewards or the fact cloakers are still invulnerable or maybe even cyno jammersso theres a round dozen issues that are all far more important and far more pressing than your personal crusade against territory holders youd be failing in your role as a csm member to present this petty crap before those other issuesand also still havent responded to the questions i posed pages ago why is it that you want to implement a system that will allow effective denial of control of space  as important as control of space   without a physical presence despite the fact youre opposed to people exerting influence across the game without pilots there
you may try to twist my words in whatever way you like my track record is actually for the little guy the 5 man corp that wants to try 00 the individual who wants to mine the 30 players wanting pvp i want others to thrive exploding outposts is bad for everyone save except those who do not want space we have demonstrated through all methods available why this is so the groups most capable of such path have said we are right continue the personal agenda if you must but at least answer the challenges you are failing to defend your position against valid pointsand you know what even if you swindle enough csm into the proposition we will still take our case right to ccp current mechanics do not support this idea it is bad for every catagory of player except those wishing to impact 00 without investing in it that is the bottom line and it will be realized
no what your failing to see is that yes is everything in eve is losable  not neccesarily destructable   outposts do not in themselves provide the ability to attack and destroy your enemy super caps are offensive tools and can be used to kill other players outposts cant they can barely even be called a defensive mechanism as once they are deployed you can still lose them based on mechanics that have nothing to do with outposts as i have said before i have nothing against destructible outposts being introducted people will have the ability to make an informed decision based on whether they want to deploy them on that basis but outposts in their current form should not be destroyable because you are essentially talking about undermining hundreds of billions of isk investment in unmovable assets which require hundreds of man hours to build and even more to defend and in maintanence ccp has never made a decision which can affect the player base on such a massive scaleand i dont see your point with isk everyone has more isk i dont my wallet is consistently under 300mil what your saying is that due to the investment made earlier on its now easier for entities in deeper 00 to make isk easier  though still not in a safe way well apart from dyspro and prom moons   outposts still require a major investment and by your logic it means that the more isk people have the more expensive outposts get to build well if that were the case then people would complain why should they pay less for the same thing people build on what they invest its how life works just because they have put their own isk forward and put in the effort doesnt mean you should undermine their value nowyou mentioned outposts have recieved over a dozen buffs in an earlier post please can you list some of these with a reason why they were introduced as an outpost buffand furthermore have you even considered how easy it will be to destroy outposts under your system you can with relative ease destroy an outpost in under a week especially if your other suggestions put forward in your manifesto come to the fore  which i somehow think they will  what really matters is what is eve should it remain what it is now or will it become something where it is impossible to make a tangible effort to build up your own territory and simply became a destroy everything that everyone has game thats an issue that should be raised what is the future of eve if you want to destroy the very essence of eve then what your suggesting is a good way to go
in my opinion the cons outweight the pros 9010 on this issue i cant support an idea that will make it harder for the little alliances to get their own space in 00
when outposts were first introduced it struck me as odd that they werent destructible i support giving the players the choice to destroy the outpost i also support giving alliances the choice to selfdestruct the outpost as wellfor all those saying it will be worse for little alliances if you truly believe little alliances should be able to compete with larger alliances than sure this change would actually be bad but implementing this change and then other changes to correct the problem of small alliances competing with larger alliances is the best direction to take
look at the op jade gave that system as an example only not as a fixed and final consideration of how outposts should diethe distilled question is this should players be able to construct things that cannot be deconstructed no matter who later controls themoutposts are merely one facet  though a large one   of that question if ccp were to consider that yes all player constructable items must be destructible in keeping with the sandbox principle then what sort of balancing that would be needed to take place in order for it to be reasonable that outposts could be destroyed given the costs and efforts of construction would need to be thrashed out in detail
a   doesnt necessary follow allowing player built infrastructure to be destroyed will not automatically prevent smaller alliances from gaining footholds the fact that something is destructible does not ipso facto result in its destruction it will be more difficult in some but not all cases and i dont think that this is necessarily a bad thing anywayb   how allowing outposts to be destructible would not shut down entire regions where preexisiting npc built controllable structures still existgoons or bob or insert favourite large villainous alliance crushing alliances nearby to their controlled space would not empty out syndicate or other alliance nurseries if anything it would simply ensure that those who do move out to the now empty regions would need a greater degree of preparedness than they do today and that the new breed of alliances would probably be a tougher existential challenge to the sprawling existing powers than is currently the case
yes it does necessarily follow here is one example of how it must necessarily follow any station that is destroyed will increase the value of all other stations more value means more competition more competition means costs increase costs increase means its harder for smaller alliances to gain footholds just as in any situation when competition forces out the inefficient its the small that get pushed out first unless there is some major failure in a larger systemsee triumviratehere is a second wayits to the benefit of large alliances to consolidate space and remove stations which are strong logistical tools near their space stations facilitate player activity and player activity is the main thing that allows alliances to push into areas where another entity is overextended or well any push at all   this scenario is not beneficial to the larger alliances especially since density is an advantage for alliances such currently its in an alliances interest to hold as much space as possible to create a buffer that must be sieged through or set with friendliespets   if alliances can instead remove the infrastructure that buffer becomes even betterpower is a zero sum game and so anything that increases the power of the larger alliances by giving them better and larger buffer zones must necessarily reduce the power of smaller alliances who do not have that advantage and must overcome itto put it simply rational play on the part of large alliances mean that if a small party wants to get into the game they have to build their own stationirrelevant what is relevant is that the number of possible nurseries increases lets imagine for a second that we could destroy stations for the past year if this were true fountain would have been purged of stations as well as geminate why am i mentioning fountain and geminate well instead of smashrkatlas trying to make their way in geminate they would have tried it in syndicate bruce would have been unable to move into fountain in the wake of one of bobs pets failing and would still be in syndicate now instead of alliances growing in alliance nurseries we have alliances competing for the ability to grow in nurseries this reduces the ability of those alliances to compete against the larger and again as above more powerful   established alliancesless nurseries is still less nurseries whether or not you think its plenty and less nurseries mean less alliances getting to the point where they might be able to make a move less alliances getting to the point where they might be able to make a move against established alliance means more stagnation
an interesting read
actually ikar what im failing to see is your answer to my question i answered all the questions you asked  i asked one question in return it would be simple politeness for you to reply your alliance does though your individual wallet is irrelevant to this discussion incorrect im saying that since alliances have much more isk available and establishing outposts is a less significant effort today its reasonable to increase the risk of their useim proposing a rough example where you need to take sovereignty in order to conquer a outpost and rather than holding that outpost you have the option to initiate a self destruct after x periodsame straw man argument repeated many many times through the course of this  and every other discussion between outpost holders and would be outpost attackers   on the issue it is certainly not established that destructible outposts would make it impossible to build up territory i understand its a convenience scare tactic to filibuster the debate but really neither the proposal on the table  nor the example resolution   support this rather extreme conclusion at some point we have to accept that ccp will take a look at the problem with 00 warfare and make a decision on whether its currently too hard to actually impact existing 00 alliances and whether this is good or bad for the future of the gamei got elected in first place in a popular election on a platform of promising to ask ccp about the introduction of 00 outposts ikar id like to do that thats what this thread is about
as far as i can see of this thread pezzle all counter arguments have been answered in a robust and engaging discussion the fact you may not like the answers doesnt mean they havent been answered and offered to you dont you think the word swindle is a bit ridiculous in this context lets look at the result of the popular vote in the recent election hardin and i came top of the polls he is resolutely status quo on the issue of outposts im arguing for rebalance and dynamic consequence i topped him by 43 votes  yep thats tiny   but it represents the fact that the informed and passionate voting community is split 5050 on this issue and the way to handle such splits is not to muzzle and stifle the debate by refusing pointblank to have it on the agenda it would be very silly to disenfranchise a large slice of the voting electorate by stopping this question being raised at the csm level lets table the question and ask the question i phrased the question in the op in a particular way i would like to hear the answer to that question from ccp so i can report the outcome to the community if they dont see a role for destructible outposts in 00 then fair enough im not going to sulk or stamp my feet about it but its a question that needs to be asked and attempting to prevent the asking of that question when thousands of players have voted for a candidate advocating that question is shortsighted and pretty antidemocratic
guo i dont see how increasing the value and consequently the competition for something like an outpost makes it more likely that the borders around it will change only once unless they are forced back to the previous state by other great powersi may be being dense but i really need a better explanation for that because i think what you are saying does not make sense if anything it should make outposts continuous sources of friction even more so if destruction leaves a shell that can be rebuilt at a lower cost than a new buildsecond point you seem to be agreeing with me by disagreeing with me si said if anything it would simply ensure that those who do move out to the now empty regions would need a greater degree of preparedness than they do today and that the new breed of alliances would probably be a tougher existential challenge to the sprawling existing powers than is currently the case which is not to dissimilar to the point you made though we seem to disagree about whether this is a good or bad thing i supposeand whats more i think to the extent it would be a problem would only be due to the huge standing advantage that presently existing power blocs have and time and combat would erode that or the larger powers would continue to earn their place versus the upstarts the temptation to use ones ability to cut a swath through the existing regional infrastructure could be balanced by having a very high cost attached to taking such a path by implementing costs such as those hardin has suggested then regional destruction operations might come at such a high price that engaging in them could in itself pose a real problem
all this blubbering about small space holding alliances is a load of bull goum knows it toothere are no small independant space holding alliances they do not exist because they cannot exist if they do provide an example as i have said before the closest you get are in the utter arseend of 00 and no one else wants it destructable outposts will have obsolutely zero effect on whether a small alliance can or cant take space and hold on to it the entire argument is bull
though ive already handled hardins arguments comprehensively in the chatsubo thread on the same issue ill give a brief rebuttal here for the record too potted answer to hardin 1   they are not really an issue  we have more important things to discuss  disagree balance in 00 is a very important issue and one of the most critical issues in endgame content at the moment this thread for example is the biggest and most interesting 00 gameplay issue thread in the assembly hall and the issue of destructible outposts attracted a huge amount of discussion and commentary during the election campaign2   it will not enhance the gamedisagree it will definitely enhance the game by introducing more options for the disposal of conquered territory options for ransoming outposts exciting new conflict opportunities in nailbiting countdown battles large wars will have large losses dramatic scorched earth retreats and critical showdowns at hqs these are all enhancements to the drama and beauty of eve3   it completely ignores the risk vs reward balancedisagree it still costs more isk on the line to siege a defended outpost system than it does to establish an outpost  with the example on the table its the outpost itself that is under hazard not the contents of player hangers game time  read grind time   is not a good measure of balance we shouldnt be balancing the game by promoting the defence advantage of boring activities  thats just bad design4   it will increase barriers to 00 usedisagree and i would say the opposite bringing real consequence to war for territorial holders will make them reduce their borders and concentrate defence a new alliance with a single outpost will find it easier to hold since existing predatory powers will need to take their own defence far more seriously than at present contraction in the safe zones and defensible holdings of overextended powers makes for more debatable space that new powers can colonize and since the buy in for an outpost at the moment is less than the buy in for a properly fitted mothership wed see a lot of this happening arguably it would be worth even conflict orientated powers putting up destructible outposts simply to get fights  would certainly make for some excellent fleet battles around the selfdestruction cycle countdowns5   it will reduce pvpdisagree it will increase pvp around the contested stations because there are more options for the victor at the moment it makes a lot of sense for outmatched defenders to simply go away and come back later and just retake a lost outpost when boredom takes the wind from the aggressor with increased victory options for attackers the defenders will need to take defence more seriously since there is more at stake currently indestructible outposts are a disincentive to pvp because frankly  why bother unless you intend to take the space yourself nothing is achieved by the process of sieging an outpost system unless you undertake to hold it long term significant portions of the 00 pvp community have opted out precisely because of this 6   it damages the history of evedisagree and since the example being proposed has outposts being rendered down to permanent derelicts  with names   and which could be rebuilt again at a discount by a power so moved to do so this history is preserved adding reduced by x power at y time rebuilt by x power at y time would add to history not remove it i think you can see that each and every point is fairly easily contested from the other side of the argument reality is that we all have ingrained bias and interest in this matter  the territorial outpost powers have become reliant on the indestructible nature of outposts the roving pvp raiding powers have become frustrated by the inability to cause lasting harm without changing their playstyle its no surprise its a passionate debate
this is why im starting to worry about your outlook here what exactly should they be destructible by in your mind it seems reasonable to me that outposts should be harder to kill than poses but youre saying you need a full pos sieging gang like its a bad thing what should be able to offline an outpost in your mind
well im not entirely sure the idea of vulnerable outpost facilities was a very good one in the first place is the simple answer damage required was always going to be either so much it rules out meaningful impact from smallish gangs  and here im going to cite my 30 ship tech2 rr battleship force that i once tried to hit station services with and decided not to be bother after seeing the ridiculous amount of time it would take to achieve anything   or so small that anyone could do it and the services could be kept pretty much permanently down by dedicated small gang operators point is if you have a full pos sieging gang why would you want to be shooting down services when you could be sieging pos  since at least that way you could be inflicting lasting fiscal damage    things might be different if it cost isk to run capital rr armour reps but thats another story but this is aside from the point really if you had to ask me to choose between offlining station services and indestructible tag  id go with with sorting out the latter i think there is balance in allowing a force that conquers a outpost through coventional means being able to set self destruct after x period of time and trade its advantage in victory for meaningful damage on the foe
its a joke because we have to mount all that metal to take out a station service that isnt lasting fiscal damage
1   outposts should be destructible2   there should be limits on how much space a larger blob can defend but thats quite a different discussion
how come when there is a silly topic under discussion we can put a symbol for support but not for disagreementdisagreethis is just a whine from the dont haves that others shouldnt as every sensible person can see this would result in the larger alliances wiping out the smaller ones and prevent any new empires building
nice that the leader of a large and established outpost owning alliance can so easily dismiss the gameplay aspirations and interests of a large portion of the 00 player base aralis but there are people out there would like to destroy outposts to inflict lasting fiscal damage on their war enemies through actual hardcore pvp battles and showdowns without being forced through the same hoops and fixed territorial pve paradigms in the aftermath to make the results stick  this is about options its about open pvp and its about the most dangerous areas of eve actually being dangerous this is not about making it easy to destroy outposts  its about making it possibleyou might be able to justify diminishing the interests and gameplay desires of thousands of eve players in roving pvp alliancescorporationspirate outfits and mercenary groups in a throwaway pat phrase about whining aralis i think its unwise and hence i would like to ask ccp the question in the opi think weve established the partisan lines on the issue silly posts about whining add nothing to the quality of debate at this point
just to throw a curveball into this ideathoughts on the ability to dismantle a captured outpost for partsmaterials similar to the way a destroyedofflined poss modules can be lootedactually even if its the original builder they might want to disassemble and reassemble somewhere else if fortunes change and they need to pull up stakes and move somewhere elseits not as flashy as a selfdestruct
i can only show my support for this note i didnt read the full thread  eve is a brutal game anything that corrodes this should be considered as a candidate for change and i believe indestructible permanent assets need to be consideredas a sidenote recent wars wouldve been very different if the defenders could use scorched earth tactics or if attackers could leave behind husks of outposts instead of having to secure another area
if the alliance that takes over the outpost invests as much isk in blowing it up and shows that they can hold it for 3060 days i think this would be a more reasonable argument as it stands now there is no extra investment in eliminating a 30 billion isk asset  and months of work   required and 72 hours is comicaljade why dont you support the conquering alliance actually having to commit real resources and invest real time in holding the asset before they can blow it up your solution seems customed designed for griefing blitzkrieg the space take the outpost lock it down for three downtimes and blow it up hard to envision a system more built for griefing and interestingly enough your corp mates are on record calling for changes to sov to make it actually easier to take sov from the holding allianceso if we combine jades current lets blow up outposts in 72 hours with jade and his corpmates calls for making it easier to take sovremoving poss from sov equation posts we have a bit of a trend here jade fraction is doing everything it can through jades unforunate term on the csm and his corpmates vigorous support for other issues to break sov and break outpost holdingi dont think jades agenda should be looked at in isolation it must be looked at in totality there is a steady march toward eliminating empire building outpost building region building in 00 jades play style doesnt match it and his alliances repeated failures to make an impact in the grand political stage have led to this frustration i ask you to take a peak at the chatsubo forums over the past two yearsafter each jade fraction failureyou will see a manifesto emerge from jade regarding how broken eve is most of these were either debated out of fun or ignoredas after all it is jade however nowwe have him as csm chair admitting in this post that he will take his issues to ccp regardless of votes regardless of processlook into the mans history before you support his propogandaand despite how you chose to spin it jadeit is about you you indicated in this very thread that you got elected on this platform and you will take this issue to ccp so as painful as it iswe have to focus on you and your motives as you have stated on several occasions that your term on the csm is designed to foster your agenda and not the will of the players in eve
i think jade that aralis is at least as entitled to his opinion  and that the opinion is every bit as relevant to be posted here   as your opinion that a stunning 36 supports in a 10 page discussion somehow constitutes something that thousands of folks are interested in seeing come to fruitioni mean if were gonna blur the issues by attacking statements and argument presentation yeah
is the ratio of supportsposts really relevant considering nearly the entirety of the opposition is a handful of cva posters i dont think you want to go down that line of argument  better to stick to the merits of the issue itself
apparently it doesnt matter jade has indicated that he wants to and will take this to ccp regardless of support he seems to believe that since this was a part of his platform and since he received x number of votes it is both his right and mandate to carry his specific election agenda to ccpi suppose we could eliminate this and all other issue threads and run the council based on jades overwhelming mandate to carry forth his election platform to ccp i do believe as evidenced by his own words that jade believes this to be the proper courseand if we eliminate jade fraction voteswell
nice to see the leader of an established alliance with no interest or experience in 00 ownership or development so easily dismiss aspirations and interests of a large portion the of the 00 player base jadewe have stated other issues are more important and should be considered before this issue we have offered examples members of large alliances that live in 00 have said this is a bad idea and explained why the best defense you can muster is essentially it might not happen what a startling analysis that certainly trumps others saying yeah we would have done that last week actually groups will destroy outposts that are inconvenient because it is easier than the alternatives this is a powerful tool to reinforce the status quo 00 markets will not grow 00 populations will shrink power blocks will still remain and have even greater power lets be honest this is your issue three days after you posted the issue and with what 16 yes votes and some no you decided to put it on the agenda this is not counterstrike you should not have the right to mess with the board if you do not play the game how you can fail to see this smashing the chances of groups not already well established is beyond me i think you do see that but there is no downside to the issue for you so you do not care in eve you must be commit to succeed i will give you an example i could make money running missions but i find it boring i get bored shooting npcs i do not mine or manufacture much i am not a market trader i could be rich but because of my unwillingness to spend the time on these activities i remain poor this does not mean i should lobby ccp for new and easy ways to make me rich to the detriment of others who are willing to do what it takes destroying outposts will leave a wasteland maybe your idea of 00 is a near vacant expanse with few encounters outside a few strongholds where warlords muster forces but others have a different view empire building growth progress conflict destroying outposts will hasten stagnation end of story

well pezzle if you combine the destroy outposts agenda item with the make sov much easier to breakyou begin to see where jade is coming from what jade fraction could never do on the battlefield  a record of repeated failures is available on various campaign threads   he is attempting to do with his role as csm chairone way or another this is an attempt to make 200 roaming nano pilots somehow as relevant as 5000 folks who have committed years and 100s of billions of isk to a region what cannot and should not be doable on the battlefield jade is attempting to alter from a mechanics perspective we have all watched this position evolve over the yearsits just a bit more obvious as he force feeds unpopular and poorly thought out agenda items into the csmccp processstand by for the speeding up nanoships my fight for the little guy issue followed by cloakingwhy it needs to be buffedfairness on the battlefield for all 
hello 500 man space holding nonaligned alliance reporting incorrect were in the arseend of 00 cloud ring bob to the south of us rairon to the north either of those entities could probably take our space but they probably arent going to try because there is no reason to overextend their forces securing another regionif they could blow up our outposts they wouldnt have to secure another region theyd simply move in for a week blow up the outposts then move outin effect destroying the outposts does the same thing to your enemies as holding them does under current mechanics except without the requirement of forcelogistical commitment how anyone comes to the conclusion that is balanced fair or vibrant for the game im quite curious to know because so far it has perplexed me
so to paraphrase garreck a stunning 28 oppositions in a 10 page discussion
goes both ways but oppositions are far more significant due to the need for reasoning and the lack of a tickbox poll swayed by alts i believe someone posted earlier theres only 60 unique characters in this thread so to attain less than 30 real supports  once youve discounted goons   isnt really that goodhowever it really shouldnt be brought into the discussion all that matters is whether its a good idea  it isnt   and whether the rest of the csm think jade has the mandate to take this further which going by the stats posted earlier he doesntits also surprising to me that some of the most vocal opposition to this is coming from goonswarm theyd certainly have the most to gain from this scenario lower delve pb and q would all be absolutely bare of stations right now and bob would be wasting an ungodly amount of time rebuilding them
this is a terrible idea
precisely its a special interest issue that passionately interests a fraction of a percentage of eve population the change would effect everybodyis that what csm is really for to push special interest items to ccp that are important to a vanishingly small number of players but that effect everybody
after reading this thread i still havent seen any solid reasoning as to how destructible outposts would promote or develop 00
and just to demonstrate how little support this topic really has titan monster truckscurrently has the same number of yes votes
opposition is more significant than support is a pretty baseless and uncompelling statement as i said earlier going down this line of reasoning isnt going to clarify the issue of whether these questions should be asked of ccp all it really does is highlight that outpost owners are sensitive about the possibility of their invulnerable assets exploding  which is a perfectly reasonable position to holdthe issue that is going before the csm is whether or not they will raise the issue of outposts indestructibilitydestructibility before ccpa compelling argument has yet to be raised as to why this question shouldnt be asked  the answer is still up to ccp
precisely what they have to do to actually conquer the system and make the outpost vulnerable to capture in the first place can i ask you to explain what you are talking about when you say jade fraction by the way
yep he is certainly entitled to an opinion other people are entitled to discount that opinion if it lacks substantive debate and boils down to an unhelpful accusation of whining
bare in mind an awful lot of the oppositional posting is repetitious hardin pretty much summarized the whole of the opposition argument in his posts i answered hardin in detailso a lot of a back and forth aside from this is simply restating points getting in partisan supports and cheers and whatnot fine you think its a bad idea i disagree  so do many other players   id like to ask ccp what they thinkthat doesnt surprise me in the least actually goons are in a very similar position to cva at present with being quite reliant on existing indestructible outpost mechanics to maintain their power in 00 goons have a huge amount to lose potentially if outposts could be lost band of brothers would have a field day lets face it goons and bob would be embroiled in a brutal grueling attritionfest to the death and one side or the other is going to run out of isk and be completely slaughtered it makes sense that a side who arent confident about the outcomes of this kind of brutal warfare in 00 would be a little wary about the question on destructible outposts outposts do not take an ungodly amount of time to build and as ive said to earlier posters  i completely discount this skyisfallingall00wouldbevoidofoutposts canard for the reasons already stated through the discussion in this thread
holding my breath for a huge  and terrible post  
yes its called democracy the rules of these sorts of processes are fairly simple and fairly universal in every democratic system ive looked at and were talking dozens of nations here   the winning faction typically gets to implement their core platform with a fairly minor amount of opposition and then everything after that is fair game but the core platform is typically unmolested the only exceptions to that i can think of are systems where there are multiple coequal elected branches of government such as the us where conflicting mandates lead to power clashes  see bush vs pelosi et al and clinton vs gingrich et al for the most notable examples
like i said its an issue that attracts strong emotions because its a big decision and it would undoubtedly make life more difficult for the people currently used to indestructible outposts hardin and i pretty much finished neck and neck in the csm elections on completely opposite viewpoints and aspirations for 00 he supports the status quo i want big changes he has a very substantial support group behind him so do i so its hardly surprising that this thread ends up being split down the middle pro and anti is itultimately though its going to have stood as a discussion topic for the required seven days and well put it before the csm for voting nobody can claim there hasnt been robust debate nobody can claim it isnt a very important issue  based purely on the level of spirited and passionate discussion it is inspiring currently and in the election campaign itself
no what ive quoted is baseless and uncompelling to have a support counted you simply need to post a contentless post and tick a ticky box needs no thought and any character can do it to oppose it you need a constructive post with actual content  which will likely then be totally ignored  so as a result the statistics for the supports should be totally discounted theyre flawed easily manipulated and have no basis in reasoning therefore the only valid analysis of this issue is one that goes point by pointthe argument has been raised several times your judgement of the argument as not compelling  a term nearly as ambiguous as dynamism   does not invalidate the argument the csm have a limited time and a limited mandate lets take a quote from a recent dev blognote that ccp have not committed to providing answers to every issue so to flood them with nonissues such as this would be a failure on the part of the csm this is the csms first term the priority should be going entirely to the important issues the ones that have garnered multiple hundreds of supports without any coersion yes this is a nonissue so far only 3 people have been posting in serious support of it yourself jade and dinique all of whom have made their personal position towards territory holders perfectly clear  if this goes in front of the council its simply a mockery of the csm jade has come in raised the issue ignored multiple valid arguments against the issue and against the validity of the issue and is simply going to raise it at council anyway what exactly is the point of these forums when there is no obligation to actually follow their recommendations i stand by my comments on shc that this entire thing is a farce that will get nothing done bring on the third csm term when weve got unknowns on the councilaside from that its a terrible idea
you can ask jade but with imitation being the best form of flattery i will not answerandif you succeede in your other agenda item and reduce the cost of taking sov that will decrease the cost and assuming the systems are defended the cost to the attacker should be roughly the same as the defender in terms of ships lost this still doesnt factor in the 30 billion isk and months of work to build and protect the stationnever mind maintaining the post network pos fuel etc i understand having never realistically attacked a station built a pos built a pos network fueled a pos defended a pos defended a station transported an egg filled an egg defended an egg defended a region patrolled a region shuttled supplies to a region held space defended space conquered spacethat this stuff might be new to you but please if you dont mind as chairman and champion of wholesale changes to sov and outposts pleaseplease do some reading on how its done and the effort and expense required
and fwiw i dont see hardin supporting the status quo in his well reasoned response to your poorly reasoned topic i can understand that it is important to paint this as a change vs status quo issue but just stating it over and over doesnt make it so
but the way the debate is leaning at the moment is that it is only an important issue because a small ish   group of people are pushing a stupid idea really hard and the larger community is trying to make sure it doesnt happen
i would not really call this a spirited debate lots of examples of this being a bad idea lots of the pro lobby ignoring anything that damages the credibility of the issue a representative should be open to the possibility even their own ideas may be wrong not closed the pro lobby cannot consider themselves wrong not a debate at all actually
im referring as much to anything as the election campaign and results opposition in this thread is fairly limited to cva and goon interests and as weve already come to understand  you guys are as biased on the issue as the roving pvp and raiding force players are everyone is biased  partisan statements of loyalty to the cause have come to eclipse genuine debate in some quarters  but thats fine its understandable this is an emotive issue and it clearly divides the 00 player base roughly 5050
disagree obviously lots of good questions have come from neutral people here those questions have been addressed plenty of back and forth between the partisan camps also you do need to step back a bit though pezzle and realize that just because you disagree with something it doesnt automatically make the opponent wrong i respect your point of view i really do i see where you are coming from and can understand the issues you see with this and i can agree that this would make your gameplay more difficult and less secure if it ever did come to pass so i understand your emotion also but im asking you to look beyond selfinterest really and see the problems that exist with the static onetrack 00 game the results of the election should show if nothing else that with pro change and anti change candidates pretty much splitting the winning vote there are a lot of vocal people on both sides of this issue
again what makes you think these two are exclusive people dont sit in their outposts 237 they go out and kill things they go and do roaming pvp and raid their opponents they likely have the same experience in roaming pvp as you dothough im curious as to what insights living as a roaming entity have given you that those who base from outposts do not have really honest question theresecond just because someone may be biased does not make them incorrect it simply makes their testimony less reliable so far there has been very very little testimony based on opinion just about every bit of opposition ive seen so far  especially goums economical analysis   has been based on empirical analysis in such a case bias makes no difference60 players most of whom have contributed nothing and a fair number of whom are blatant alts do not provide sufficient basis to make that statement there are less than a dozen actual contributors to this thread again not a sufficient sample youd do well to not state such baseless facts it drags potentially legitimate arguments downnow if you could do me one thing while you ignore the rest of my postwhy does this issue deserve to be raised over other issues in the first term what pressing concerns do you have that outpost saturation will become a problem and more importantly what evidence do you have what gives this issue more legitimacy than the 3090d gtc topic or the issue of nanoships which afaik has not yet been raised
with respect elmicker you are not telling the truth here i will direct you to my detailed rebuttal of hardins summary of the anti argument reply to hardin
im a neutral party  i live in empire and get by through industry youve yet to answer the question i posed you on page 3 page 4 page 5 and well just about every page since thenin my view outpost destruction allows denial of space without physical occupation why is this incorrect or why is this a good thing
i wasnt referring to hardin youve ignored my arguments  both my arguments why the proposals are crap and my arguments for why the issue shouldnt be raised even if the proposal were a good one   and im sure theres other quality posts youve ignored in favour of selectively responding to crappy alt posts
to be fair herschel there werent any stipulations like this in the csm document so it would be unfair to the cva members in this thread to simply railroad something through on the basis of the idea submitter having won the election on the basis of this platformhowever the process for bringing issues to ccp is very clear  since an elected csm member supports this topic there will be a vote by the council on whether to bring the issue on to ccpif anyone has been reading the transcripts of the council sessions theyll see that so far all issues have been moved on to the present to ccp phase because to roughly paraphrase councilmember darius theres nothing wrong with talking about itnow maybe im reading this wrong but it seems like the consensus among the cva opposition is that there is something wrong with talking about it and they think the debate should be stifled before it gets to ccpi think its great to talk about the merits of the idea itself but given the track record of votes so far youve got to make quite a case to argue that the csm shouldnt even talk about this with ccp
you really need to stop labeling people as prochange and antichange just because people dont support your idea it does not mean they are against change just this change
nice attempt to polarize us jade but you are wrong again we  cva   have come out in vocal favor of the little guy time and again the very function of the cva promotes new groups in 00 edit let me add that we come up with and support ideas that would make our lives more difficult we also look at issues that do not impact on us and offer suggestions for others concern for eve is more than just your pet projectwe want well reasoned changes we want to encourage growth not atrophy with growth comes the conflict what we will not support is the eve 00 first person shooter objective this agenda is based on change is good but not all change say whatever else you like less people in 00 will not result in more conflict the proposition would harm 00 growth and 00 pvp
are you actually aware of which issues have been raised so far 3090 gtcs is the first issue on the agenda you can see a list of topics that have been discussed meeting 2 topicsyou can see this weeks topic meeting 3 topicsnanoships is clearly not an issue that people care about much since nobody has raised it if you can see other issues on this assembly hall forum that are more important than the discussion of destructible outposts then your option is to go and get supporting them go convince csm reps to advocate them go get busy but simply saying there are more important issues that havent been addressedmade the agenda is not currently accurate
that implies theres actual debate theres been a minimum of pointbypoint responses from the yay lets blow up outposts camp but a wealth of arguments both general and pointbypoint from the oppositionthe csm have limited time a mere 6 months ccp are not obliged to respond to every proposal as a result longterm proposals such as this that would require significant research and investigation should be left until later terms simply to allow pressing issues that genuinely concern players to get a proper response
4 feasibility of outposts going boom  jade  
i disapprove of jades ideaimplimentation of destructable outpostsas vantras i can only see such an idea being viable if it puts a stiff cost for the attacker both in investment and timeif its openeded with todays pos mechanics it will reduce 00 into pre outpost wasteland fairly quickly outpost griefing thru capital blobbage and you will have a empty wasteland to show for iteven if outposts do present the owner of them some advantages  logistics   they also let neutralsnewbiesnon pvp aligned players get familiar with 00 in a semi safe way as they can dock like in empiretake that away and you will be back to 00 filled with a whole lot of nothingdead wastelandso much for creating a sprawling world with identity and longlasting history
yes i know thats why im asking you what makes this as worthwhile as that topicwhy should the csm and ccp spend their time discussing this when the only vocal support for this topic is coming from yourself one of your corpmates and dinique all the other support posts have been contentless the simple virtue of csm advocacy should not be enough becuase that gives you carte blanche to put forward whatever tripe you feel like while ignoring 11 pages of overwhelmingly negative feedback from multiple parties in multiple areas of the gamethough that links nice goum raises very good points you do have a track record of consistently ignoring arguments  for example youve chosen my questioning of the point here and ignored my questioning of the proposal   and then your consistent track record of just ignoring people outright for things like swearing in an adult environment if you were as mature as youre trying to make out youd simply ignore them put down their arguments then move on its a stupid strategy for the chair of a council to have as youll end up ignoring large amounts of good argument
ccp said that on every issue theyd either answer csm inquiries or explain why they couldnt which is why they have a 714 day advance notice requirement on csm submissions while respect for ccps time is something we should be mindful of it shouldnt be a reason to kill a topic
i have just read back through your posts on this thread elmicker and you havent made any substantive arguments except to say the op is crap so there isnt really anything to reply to the one thing you have said is that this topic is less important than 3090 gtcs and shouldnt be on the agenda in priority to that i have replied that that other issue is already on the agenda so your argument is a bit void its a bit rich for you to be accusing other people of selective responses when you havent actually brought anything to the table yourself
i agree i was clutching at straws really however the fact that this is still a terrible proposal is a very very good reason to kill a topiclets try a paxman strategy a straight yesno question to the politicianjade will removing outposts improve the ability to reside in 00 as a neutral entity
i dont think theres anything wrong with this sentiment elmicker but you do understand that what you say is entirely contextual right i think youll have to show what issues are being ignored in favor of this one and why they deserve a higher priority to make your argument sticki recall the question of how many issues can the csm bring before ccp being asked during the campaign and if memory serves the answer was as many as time allowsso i think you need to show that there are more issues of more importance than time will allow which you haventit would be interesting to have someone  maybe you   create a thread that analyzes the issues before the council and gives an opinion on how they should be prioritized but without something like that your argument falls flat no
absolutely rightoh except for this post the back end of this post and as i recall i requested your responses to alex shurks points on about page 4 unless im missing something you havent responded to those eitherthey were all points and arguments as to how destruction of outposts would negatively impact 00 space so all extremely relevant to the argument
well it was a centerpiece of my csm election campaign and 2436 players voted for me im guessing quite a few of those players felt it was a worthwhile issue to discuss with ccp im now doing what needs to be done to ask that question would you suggest i should ignore all those people that voted for me and sweep the issue under the table because 3040 enthusiastic detractors are posting against in this topic i refer you to the answer above you havent questioned the proposal you said  and i quote   its crap that doesnt count as debate round our way old chap i stand by that stance absolutely i really dont care about your point of view if you cant express it in an adult and respectful fashion in my line of work i wont stand for disrespect from work colleagues and im not going to stand for swearing and bad behaviour from fellow eve players either if you cant behave i will ignore you and discount your opinion its my right just as its your right  i guess   to act the fool and swear and shout on an internet forumill restate it for you i dont believe its possible to have a good argument from a person who cannot control their temper well enough to post respectfully on an internet forum
erm no without something like that my argument is just entirely theoretical as this thread has proved the csm is entirely for purely theoretical thread as theres zero empirical evidence in the op or any subsequent posts in support iejade outposts are detrimental to 00 life let us blow them upexperienced 00 dwellers no thats stupidjade careelmicker outposts blowing up is detrimental to csm efficiencyexperience csm council members no youre stupidelmicker caresee how it works
your first point is just repeating what hardin  and many others have already said   and i  and many others   have already responded too your second point was covered also in responses to other posters i have absolutely no intention to repeat myself 100 times addressing identical repetitive points that have already been covered
the only way i can see making this viable is if you created a mod for a titan that was capable of destroying an outpost it would also make the titan vulnerable for a short amount of time this way you introduce risk versus and reward and give titans a new role that i have heard it needsif they were capable of being destroyed by a bunch of partisans in comedy fleets stealth bombers then i dont think it such a good idea i still believe the head of csm is pushing his own pet project here i have been saying that since word go glad so many people agree with me
yes those 2436 people dont care enough to hit the support button so its obviously not the issue they care about if they cared that much where are they nowbawwwwwww selecting responding look up ive pointed out where i expanded on the arguments  mostly arguments already made by other people   though if you really need me to i can write them out again in full i can even use longer words to make you feel more comfortablecolourful language is not necessarily an indicator of anger words are words are words theyre simpyl a tool respet cannot be conferred via internet spaceships so what does it matter how the words are framed its whats inside the frame that matters
the problem is elmicker that is essentially your argument and no thats stupid isnt going to convince anybody
if you cant debate with respect im not interested in hearing what you have to say clear enough if you dont like it feel free to vote for somebody else next time im very happy standing as a candidate for people who can control their emotions and post respectfully in debates on matters of internet spaceships and the balance issues surrounding themsorry if you feel this disenfranchises you elmicker but im not going to pretend to care about people slurring insults on an internet forum  csm rep or no csm rep
jadewill blowing up most outposts encourage unaligned empire dwellers to fly into 00if you say yes how can they comfortably live and prosper in deep 00 without the safety of a posoutpost  beyond logging off at safespotcloaked  does outposts not present a viableeasy possibility for many unaligned to live and prosper in 00 where as in the past they had to joinalign themselves with established groups in 00 to survive  again beyond roamingsafespottingcloaking  
it would probably be more shocking and an all round better reveal if i didnt have a link to a film showing an destroyed outpost in my siggy line beside an essay on the benefits for destructible outposts and enhanced dynamism in 00 yep of course its a pet project it just happens to be one that 2436 fellow eve players seemed to agree with who else gets to make that claim really
hey jade this thread is now 11 pages long and only has 36 supports maybe you should take the hint and shut up 
im not sure id pick comfortable as one of the first adjectives to describe the intention for 00
a vote for you means the voter supports all of your ideas that is very convenient hey here is an idea why not skip the discussion of topics all together and just have the reps vote up issues they want to push after all they got the votes so naturally that means everyone agrees with everything they say right
im going to refer you to another posters reply earlier in the thread there are no unaligned outpost owners in 00
cva seriously dont make arguments that cva fights for the little guy because you encourage them to setup in providenceeveryone knows you do this because it increases your power and influence as does hardins alliance creation scheme and thus increases the numbers of potential allies when a fight comes
i hear theres these stations in 00 space that are owned by npc corps can anyone who actually undocks cd this for me
he said outposts not stations
well pezzle would you agree a fair degree of the people who voted for me supported a fair number of my ideas how about that otherwise why do you think they voted for me
i get exactly where youre coming from with the problem of 00 and the sov system as well as the impact smaller organisations can have on an area of spacebut this just aint the right solution because it has a lot of unintended consequencesthe most important is that lack of security when someone logs off to go on holiday for two weeks they want to know that when they come back even if their alliance collapses and they lose all their pos space etc their assets will still exist in gamebecause it is just a game even if you lose an outpost and docking rights you still have the opportunity to recover those assets you have stuck in station through hard work or whateverthis change basically completely devalues outposts there isnt much you cant do cheaper with pos but guarantee security is one thing and security is one of the cornerstones of any civilisationsecurity is already a lot worse in eve than irl itd be even more unrealistic to make it worsea better idea would be to improve the system whereby outposts are damaged and subsequently repaired
this post wins the thread warit is one of our longest running jokes in the cva that if hardin makes an alliance prepare for the war dec pirate infestation move to red on the settings board someone can probably take the time to make a list but its quite shocking how many hardin created alliances are our enemy
lol you really think being popular makes you rightbut like i say i think you got the wrong solution to the right problemedit the reason you got elected is because you changed what csm was all aboutsetting the agenda right before you were even elected was a stroke of genius not only would it give you extra leverage and power once elected as you had been given a mandate on specific issues that then could be pushed legitimatelybut more importantly people want to have an input and make a difference in the game they all love and your whole campaign basically revolved around politicising the thing making it from players auditing ccps processes and gms to players directly affecting how the game developed through you the players become the devs
spoon this is both a great idea and actually already part of the op
except your responses were invalid consistent references to isk and no references to force projection strategic importance or denial of spacethough if thats the only response youre going to give its the only response i can in turn respond to absolutely so if you could clarify which aspect of outposts is currently unbalanced that would be rectified through addition of destructionas far as i can see you need to take the outpost to exact destruction on it so nothing would really change for the original holder  rather there are now more advantages to taking itthis isnt necessarily a good thing most of the things youve listed probably wouldnt happen for example outpost ransoming outpost sales have happened in the past they cannot be guaranteed youve already taken the outpost once theres nothing stopping you to do it againcountdown battles already exist  ref insrg vs nc was decided by a totheminute fight to take sov before sov 3 kicked in   adding a secondary postsov countdown battle wouldnt do much if someone has taken the outpost and sov you arent going to take it back inside the same theatre of battle and if youve got sov outpost construction is a doddle so it simply adds more risk for the defenders and more offensive options for the attackersoutposts are not large losses isk wise theyre large losses only in terms of strategic control and territorial denial the attacker is fighting to remove the outpost the defender to stay in the outpost adding the ability to remove the outpost outright again gives more advantages to the attacking side  remember fights are rarely over a single outpost  scorched earth retreats would be interesting but if youre at that stage youve already lost your opponent has sov and reconstruction is no major barrier however reconstruction for the defender after a forced scorched earth  ie goons scourging geminate   would be near impossible again the advantage lies with the attackerand showdowns at hqs why would that happen the station has no tactical importance fighting occurs at poses because theyre the only static combat point with tactical and strategic importancetheres a consistent correlation between all of those scenarios that enhance eve in your mind they all give significant advantages to the attacker once the fight has donethis moves away from eves current balance where the attacker must hold the territory if you remove that aspect the requirement to hold the territory no longer remains you can enact a scorched earth policy and effectively hold the space without the requirement to defend any static points  taken outposts are as much a vulnerability as an advantage that is an extraordinarily big bias in favour of the attacker and something that if implemented and enacted upon would be the territorial equivalent of having hg snakes mwd boost rigs and istabs while your opponent is ing about in battlecruisers
isk is irrelevant remember eve is isk rich the only scarce resource  im sure this has been said   is pilot time the time to defend a conquered outpost is comparable to the time your opponent expended defending it if you dont expend that time youre going to lose the outpost which is fair if you can destroy the outpost you accomplish the objective of denying your opponent the outpost without expending anywhere near the same amount of pilot time how is that balancedyoure half right half dead wrong youre right that alliances will concentrate their defence but not through any requirement enacted from warfare but rather through personal preference as it stands you must hold the space to stop your opponent retaking it and being in a position to assault your own space  why do you think bob and goons have bothered to each conquer omist its a terrible region   if they could wipe that space clean of outposts theres nothing for your opponent to base from youve got your concentrated defence thowever you are wrong in that a new alliance putting up a single outpost  a situtation that wouldnt happen at this point in the game   would find it easier lets use bob as the example and fountain as the region assume fountain is empty  bob have rolled in kicked out pl bruce and sot and destroyed all their stations young alliance comes in and starts claiming sov to the north of bobs borders what do you think bob are going to do say what ho good chum have fun up there no theyre going to roll on up and clean the space again reenacting the scorched earth policy no one nothing will be allowed to build up in the vicinity of the larger alliances because theyd pose a massive security risk putting up a new outpost under fire with no sovereignty backup is near impossible compared to simply taking the space from a dying alliance like bruce or like tri in the north or like the dozens of nameless pets in the southi disagree with both of you on this point it wont change the amount of pvp initially the process for taking the outpost is the same shoot jammer shoot pos shoot station all youre doing is appending hit button receive wreckage on the end of that bearing in mind once sov has been taken from the defender pvp generally reduces to a minimum this wont change the level of combat over outpostshowever once the outpost has been destroyed youve removed the ability of that system to effectively support pilots in the future you would not get roaming gangs basing from that system you would not get ratters there as a target for roaming gangs so while hardin is initially incorrect hes right in the long termcouldnt care less about this aspect history is written by the victori suggest you read my response to that unnatural selection is unaligned and holds the outposts in cloud ring there are others also
the only measurement tool we have for support of specific ideas is the support check box  or people posting on the specific issue thread and saying yes or no i suppose   at this time the centerpiece of your campaign has less support than monster truck titans that seems clear and measurable you do not have the support of those voters on this issueso i am going to have to disagree   
2436 is about 12 of the player base go team jade
thats actually the way it works pezzle check the csm document  if a csm member supports a topic it goes up for a vote
why dont you change the op i want to crash my mom into an outpost causing irreperable damage cause i saw it in a ccp promo video so therefore it must happen
sure half of the alliances made are for pirate types which would be enemies anyway and the others are potentially new buddies
i think this all needs to be brought back to the guiding paradigm of eveif you cant afford to lose it in seconds dont fly it buy it or build itand you ladies say carebears cry about having their factioned blinged ravens suicide ganked
damaging an outpost is already possible by disabling station services if you want to allow attackers to damage them more  such as perhaps knocking out dock control so ships cant dock there   then id like to see an organized thoughtout proposal regarding that which i could support a lot easier than this perhaps something like thistenminute outpost proposaloutposts will be given four additional subsystems communications power core hangar bays docking control each one does somethingcommunications enhances pos attack mails  they will tell you the identity of the attacker as well as the number of people who are in local at the timepower core all poss in system get bonus powergrid say 10hangar bays poss will draw a small portion of their required fuel say 10 again from a special hangar on the outpost reducing pos refueling runs if the hangar is empty they will use fuel as normaldocking control no benefitat the beginning of the attack everything is as it is now attacker begins disabling station services which generates a help im under attack message to the outposts ownersonce all station services are disabled station subsystems will appear and become vulnerable communications power core hangar bays these subsystems are more durable and difficult to disable than station services are and destroying each one has certain benefitscommunications poss in the system with the outpost will not broadcast they are under attack if outpost communications are offlinepower core all poss lose their power bonus and get a penalty to their power output equal to the bonus  so if the bonus were 10 that bonus would be removed and a 10 penalty applied instead  hangar bay if the hangar bay is disabled items in the outpost cannot be moved until it is repaired poss can no longer take fuel from the hangars and must supply it all themselvesonce these three systems are offline docking control will appear as a target disabling docking control means that ships cannot dock at that outpost until it is repaired docking control is the toughest subsystem to destroyafter this station capture will work as normal i havent done enough research on how to flip an outpost to know how it actually works because its never something ive had to worry aboutthis will effectively render the outpost useless and even make it a liability to the people that control it as now their poss are penalized however the outpost is still there and can be repaired back up to operability if the controlling alliance still controls the system if an alliance doesnt want to deal with controlling the outpost they can always leave it in its wrecked state but their poss will be penalized for doing so making the system easier to takeend proposalin my opinion that proposal makes 00 more dynamic to use a favorite word in this thread than the one were arguing over it gives a conquering alliance a choice  scorch the outpost and render it useless but suck up some nasty penalties and risk losing their system a lot easier or repair and defend the outpost thus possibly overextending themselves
absolutely
for you maggot buddy   stay on target
damaged  destroyed
the problem with disabling station services style solutions is it isnt permanent fiscal damage attacker is at a net loss on the exchange the moment they spend strontammo etc to make it happen defender just reps it all up with carriers in the attackers off time and nothing is achieved if the attacker is going to put the kind of gang together that is needed to kill outpost services in a reasonable timescale they are better off hitting pos because at least if they put those in reinforced they do actually cause  some   fiscal impact and set up the potential for more
you have a policy of not responding to anyone who makes a personal attack the least you can do is distance yourself from the support of those who do the same
isk is not a balance factor this is not a fiscal issue
werent you suggesting it would be great if assets in the station were recoverable
and if you wanted to you could make subsystems require stuff to be repaired  other than docking control since youd have to get the stuff into the station somehow   if they disable station services but get run off too bad no dice if they take out a few subsystems or totally trash the outpost then they might have to pay to get it repairedsee how flexible my proposal is
appears as though we are back to the actual isk exchange of attacking vs defending can we factor in the cost of maintaining and fueling pos networks to the cost of a station can we factor in the build cost transporation costs and defense coststhe cva has had an outpost in xr for over a yeari reckon the cost there is in the 100s of billions of isk when you consider the poss have been fueled non stop 100s of ships have been lost patrolling and protecting the areaallowing for that fuel to be hauledif we are making it about the isk  i thought it was about dynamism   then lets set the definition for cost
cant it be about everything why put blinders on the discussionin the end the big picture is that every playerbuilt object in the game can be destroyed  except outposts why not look into bringing them in line with the spirit of eve
because when the spirit of eve makes for a crappy biased and boring game it should be secondary to actually having fun fun in 00 requires combat to guarantee combat in 00 requires static combat points as it stands those are outposts and high end moons  and to a lesser extent choke gates   the ability to remove outposts removes static combat points logic dictates that this also reduces fights in the long term there is no way reducing static points of strategic value can increase combat thats backward logic there should be more static points not fewer
because other issues are more worthy of attention in addition it would cause harm in terms of stagnation in 00 as we have said the big picture really is getting more people to fight less outposts  less people less people  less fighting
make it cost the attacker 30 billion isk in explosives and make those explosives actually require some logistics to move in place make it take 3060 days and perhaps youd have a proposal worthy of consideration the current topic as outlined by jade is built for griefing and for quick blitzkrieg type strategies if jades reason for being so passionate about this andor the reason many of his supporters are voting yes is because they believe in the fundamental principal that everything that is created should be destroyable then i puzzle as to why making it cost 30 billion and take 3060 days would be objectionable interestingly most of the 33 people voting to support jade would fall into the everything that is built should be destroyable category they dont seem to cite that anything is wrong w the current system beyond thati would be more in favor of these issues if they were posted as does ccp envision a time when outposts might be destroyable rather then these obviously slanted proposals favoring specific play styles and specific agendasthe unforunate thing about the entire csm process is its turning into each csm championing thier own pet projects i dont believe this was the intent most of us can recall the scandal that spawned this ideai dont think the purpose at that time was to create a lobbying group of special interests it was to create a body for the people by the people to interact provide some transparency and oversight to and with ccp
okay   well if allowing them to be destroyed causes an huge devaluation of an existing asset then the solution is simple  give them additional bonuses with value
well you know it sounds crazy  but something that could be considered as a general balancing factor to all kinds of structure warfare would be to actually make it cost isk  some substance in the cargo hold perhaps   to run armor reps on physical structures rather than ships ie make people pay to repair the damage to their pos guns and kit rather than simply running capital armors reps on them just a thought and not really part of this specific discussion
now this is an idea that has some merit its certainly not complete but its a good start and i think something that faces few if any of the problems outlined in this thread one amendment id make however dont make docking rights destructible make hangar access destructible and say that everything has to be repaired with nanite paste this means you can have a bunch in hangar for repairing ancillary services but you need to have it in your ships cargo hold to repair hangar access which means itll take a fair bit of work and solid control of the space in order to restore the station to good working order and if you like put a reinforcement timer on that  some period of time where you can use items in hangar and remove them but not add any more it gives attackers the ability to inflict real cash and time damage on defenders without depopulating 00 of outposts
you say this but we havent had any examples yet pretty much everything worthy of getting attention on these assembly halls forums is getting attention this is contested and definitely not accepted as a universal statement of fact its your opinion and the opinion of the antidestructible outpost people the other side of the argument views it as an unsupported canard of deeply questionable value
you keep forgetting the immense investment in dreadnaughts carriers and support fleet  aggressive placed pos that are required to actually siege a system in the first place before you can actually conquer an outpost these assets are placed in harms way at the beginning of the siege and represent the attackers investment since ive in no way advocated a short cut to existing siege mechanisms as part of my example solution in the op  its blatantly untrue for you to present this as a blitzkreiggriefing proposal  even if the term griefing did have meaning in 00 freefire open pvp  which it clearly doesnt  
generally when one questions anothers arguments they provide evidence and potential scenarios to support it simply saying we think your arguments are flawed does not mean they are actually flawed
were kind of going in circles here but these arguments you outline are what i find lacking1 other issues are more worthy of attentionbeen over that it seems theres plenty of room on the docket2 destroyable outposts would stagnate 00as long as there is an advantage in owning an outpost people will build them fear of an outpost boycott is pretty fanciful and what this comes down to is the relative risk vs reward of constructing an outpost destructability can be part of the riskreward equation3 destroyable outposts would lead to depopulated  and peaceful   00see 2if you want to argue that theres no way to balance the destructability of outposts in the riskreward equation i can only point at the pos as an example of where it was done before if it works for the pos it can work for outposts
just one little nitpick there those are capturable stations not outposts in cloud ring
the time invested in this pales in comparison to the logistics of maintaining a new outpost potentially regions away from your home bases to keep it going you need to maintain equivalent logistics to conquering it but 237 for months on end this is the limiter that prevents megapowers conquering all of eve  its simply an impossibilitydestruction of outposts at will allows you to prune the excess logistics at best minimising the extent to which your forces and logistics become extended at worst scouring a region to the point no one can establish themselves there both of those give significant advantages to the conquerer that are not matched by anything the defender can dogive it time weve only been there a fortnight anyway doesnt really matter it was a secondary point that had no actual relevance to the matter at hand
so from you answer then i am to assume you support the hauling of explosives and the 3060 day period of time that the station must be held by the aggressoralso i cite
no human being could possible supply the string of insults required to balance out this stream of tears and thats all they are sweet emo tearstheres no difference between an empire mission runner who autopilots a 3b cnr afk and an alliance profusely delivering the waterworks over the thought of a pos getting blown up in a system they visit only to refuel and restart queues they are the same thing i will mock bothid even go further and say that suicide gangs of cheap stealth bombers should be able to kill a pos
were this thread about poss id find this reply fascinating
eep wrong character i always wonder why it defaults to this one
edit now posted with the right characteras to not derail this monster any more my idea can be discussed and hashed out here
im actually heading out for dinner now but ill leave you with this the whole if this happens 00 will be a burning void because goons  and cva   say it will argument is not anything i  or many others   find convincing i have a lot of experience in 00 warfare and alliance managementpoliticscampaign planning  and while its easy for the footsoliders to talk about a griefing agenda  lets burn all those outposts for lulz   it becomes alot more difficult for the organizers fcs diplomats and planners to commit to an expensive risky and timeconsuming program of destruction without a payoff at the end of it destroying all outposts  no payoff ransoming outposts maybe settling in friendly renters maybe but i am assuring you elmicker that nobody is going to want to commit a large capital fleet night after night in outpost sieging without there being some isk at the end of the rainbow maybe they even do think its a good idea at the beginning  that idea dies on the vine the moment the first enemy power hotdrops a counter cap fleet on them while they are kicking over the sandcastles of a smaller alliance people lose caps that hurts itll be a dash of cold water as i said this argument is a hypothetical doomsday scenario that doesnt hold water for anyone with a background of alliance management and arranging offensive pacts and maneuvers in 00 space its being presented here as a childrens story to scare people  it doesnt hold water and in my estimation it is absolutely not what would happen to the 00 landscape should destructible outposts become a reality you can disagree  im sure you will   and well agree to disagree but dont pretend for one minute that the other side of the argument hasnt thought these things through and presented their own opinions and analysis of the impact of this potential change
uh a few pages back a number of goons said this is exactly the sort of thing goonswarm would do i think they know better than you the sort of stuff they might doedit now with quotes from the first four pages  the rest is mostly arguing  
hehe yes i can believe you lot might say hi to that mighty carebear heikki from me however if you are saying that you are an unaligned outpost owner when you do infact own no outposts im gonna feel free to nitpick p
so yes apart from the fact that youve been there for all of 10 seconds you dont own anything a powerbloc would want to take from youif they wanted to just kill you they can do that now they dont have to secure cloud ring  where the hell did you get this idea from anyway   they only need to do that if they intend to do anything with it no one is forced to secure a region they conquer they do it because they have something to gain either way whether they want to destroy your outpost or not they have to spend time and their resources in conquering the spaceyour argument can just as easily be extended to pos and from there its just a hop and a skip to any asset because at the end of the day thats all an outpost is an asset its time invested by a player or a group of players just like everything else in the game outposts arent even expensive or difficult to buildhow is destruction of anything in eve fair having your outpost taken from you and sold or rented is every bit as unfair as having it taken and destroyed are you upset because victor doesnt have to fuel a couple of sovreignty pos how does destruction of anything lead to a vibrant game your argument is inherently and entirely flawed and based on the notion that destruction is bad for eve it isnt destruction is eve without it eve is nothing without it eve is sisiwhat game exactly have you been playing missions in empire want your tech 2 ships insured as well
allaria i think youve fallen for what we on the internet refer to as trolling
no destroyed is very different from damaged there is a big difference between repairing an overheated module to salvaging something from a ship wreck was implying that if anything should be on the overheating side of thingsbut i still think that this will cause more problems than it solves even if watered down and there are much better ways to try to solve the same problems this attempts to
this would be what goumindong so affectionately calls an ad hominem youre effectively stating youve got no experience in this so youre automatically wrongcomical on a few levels because you spent multiple paragraphs posturing about questioning a posters experience oh and also because ive got extensive experience in that area ive worked in for with and against just about every entity in the game in just about every situation going both pre and post sov changesso lets critique your argument i could criticise your record but ive actually got a decent argument so i dont need to yet again showing your inexperience the payoff is denial of space ive already adressed this point when bob were pushing goons back and goons returned the favour there was a small lull in the fighting as both entities paused to conquer omist omist is a terrible terrible region no significant assets crappy moons yet it needed to be conquered it provides a supreme example of organizers fcs diplomats and planners committing to an expensive risky and timeconsuming program of destruction without a payoff at the end of it but thats because you are again simply focusing on isk isk is not a factor the payoff is in the denial of territory for your enemy under current mechanics youre already forced to commit to conquer everything in your path so theres no need for me to prove that alliances commit to these endeavours because the evidence is there in every conflict staring you in the faceonce theyve conquered the space which we have already established as a requirement theyre committed to holding it even if they dont want the spaceif they dont want the space what possible reason do they have to hold it when the alternative to simply wipe the region clean exists if theres no infrastructure there the region is of no strategic importance so does not have to be occupied the only place you therefore need strategic infrastructure is on the front line and in your home since the infrastrucure everywhere else is of no use and is a risky drain what sane alliance would ever leave it in place when all they have to do is hit a button and maybe spend some isk
except that it fits with what goonswarm historically did and even the concept they were founded on perhaps youve heard of something called jihadswarm
youre suggesting making outposts into giant pos do you know why there are so few outpost upgrades because you get more value for money building 3 new outposts than upgrading one fullythe same would happen for outposts if you made them like giant pos why put all your effort into one megaexpensive destructable outpost when you can spread risk and arguably do more with lots of posoutposts really arent that great and a fully upgraded one cant compete with an npc station their value is a large part in the security they provide by their nature as indestructablelike i said earlier this would seriously devalue them in realterms usefulness to 00 alliancesedit also pos are thoroughly borked in every sense so it doesnt work for pos either p
elmicker youre trying to make an argument for why the goons will sweep across the map destroying all outposts just for fun and as an example youre using an occasion when they conquered an outpost to use as a strategic launchpad to continue a campaign against an enemydo you see how the example you give doesnt support the scenario youre defending
that would be the fact ra and their new found friends in the north are established half a dozen jumps from us and are posturing for war anyone who holds cloud ring needs a secure base to prevent them rolling through into fountain and the southern regionsyes they are what would happen if bob didnt secure q and pb with goons on the doorstepcompared to the time you have to spend defending the space once youve got it  thats mostly fuelling poses unfortunately   thats barely significantno it cant weve been through this read the threadcan you operate an alliance to the point of dominating entire regions from a pos or from a supercap no you cant they have nowhere near the same strategic importance so arent comparableno it isnt if someone takes an outpost from you you can always retake it later once theyve assumed the burden of holding the territory around the effort required to maintain outposts increases exponentially with the amount of territory they cover if you remove them instead of hold them that effort no longer increases exponentiallythats partially one of the reasons yes the ability to deny someone access to a region without deploying pos infrastructure to secure the outposts  assuming the previous resident had to have poses up   is simply imbalancedplease visit your user settings to reenable images
just to add my 2isk to that i wouldnt see it as a problem that all currently invulnerable outposts remained so until a power that has held them for at least 60 days enabled a flag that would then be permanently set allowing the outpost to be popped or that there could be a new type of smaller easier to deploy and necessarily limited and totally destructible outpost added to the gamefor me its the principle that neither you nor i should be able to produce utterly invulnerable objects that provide some kind of permanent benefit to ourselves or otherscurrently an alliance that loses its outposts almost always has the option of leaving a number of jump clones in that outpost  or conquerable station   that can engage in some nifty market pvp against the new holderselmicker how many jcs of former holders turn up in xzh and 94 and play around with the market etc these days
aye i suggested above already a new turret that you can fit to a titan  similar to your explosives idea   that takes a certain amount of time to activate meaning you have to defend the titan during this period on an open plan battlefield thus giving titans a viable role and adding the risk versus reward to destructible outposts
err no im not  theyre not going to destroy outposts for fun theyre going to do it for serious strategic reasoning contrary to popular belief goons dont just ride bikesomist isnt a strategic launchpad to anywhere you can base with greater ease from c and detorid into tenerifis and immensea omist is only a strategic platform if those options dont exist thats why leaving it unoccupied is not an option if you could remove it as a strategic location altogether itd have been done when bob passed through and goons would have been thankful for it omist is the one case in eve of authentic didnt want that region anyway having lived there for a time it really is a terrible terrible region in a horrendous location
i agree  and thats what jade is saying in the post you were disagreeing with go check it out again were talking about the goons will turn 00 into a wasteland hysteria
if they dont secure the region after destroying your outpost you could just put up another assuming your organization survived the assault not to mention that apart from the drone regions stations are everywhere anyway if they bugger off to assume those terrible burdons you can just build another one its just iskand no once you have conquered something you are not commited to holding it where the hell do you come up with this nonsense you choose to hold it or you dontisk doesnt matter right thats what you yourself statedand id not throw myself behind goums ad hominem whines if i were you considering that you are as guilty and that goums definition is based around whether the poster is in agreement with him or not hes the worst of the worst when it comes down to it
ok i have alot of better things to do right now so ill point out less than 50 votes no other csm support other than the op and its on the csm agendaenough said
every issue on the csm agenda is there because a csm rep supported it thats how it works
very well said i thought the csm was supposed to be a stopgap between the player base and ccp jade mustnt of read that part
you say but i ask you this what isk at the end of the geminate campaign for goonswarm what rich isk awaits us in geminate the single promethium moon nobody sees any actual isk from taking a region apart from the corp  alliance sure we get fancy reimbursement programs jump bridges etc but geminate sure as hell isnt providing it for us if its fun well do it fighting smash is fun so were doing it blowing up entire outposts just because we can would be fun so we would do it
so because a csm decides to push hishers opinion despites the general opinion lacking even the support of other csm members  and drawing the oppositiion of some   should mean that their opinion is more valid than anyone else they suggest an issue then they should have to go through the same process as everyone else op should not be enough validation for prpgressing to agenda
ikar everyone voted in the csm election knowing how the system worked and jade won while being very upfront about this proposal being part of his campaign  you dont go and change the rules afterwards just because you dont like the result
youre right its a complete waste of time but if its one thing jades good at its wasting time with long drawn out posts  issues everyone who voted for him should of seen this coming
csm members can put their own issue on the agenda and we dont need to vote on that however the csm council members then vote on whether the issue should be forwarded to ccp as part of the official list of issues a majority vote is needed for this to win  5 for 4 against basically   we will see on monday probably after this weekends meeting which issues have made it and which have been voted downi dont think every csm member has a personal issue only a few do those csms who pick issues from what we the crowd suggest and forward them on should be commendedbut basically the docket will contain the pet issues plus however many playersuggested issues seem to have high support numbers and thats the way it is i dont think any of the csm members are willing to go as far as compiling all the issues into some giant wellorganized document and presenting that under the title ccp fix your game itll just be bits and pieces and fotms in a tabulated formedit its unclear what happens at the meeting with ccp i imagine jade and each csm will get the opportunity to argue as heatedly as here for their own issue and whatever was picked from the crowd will just get a nod and a next would have been nice to have him push something like fix the ui or other universal issues as heatedly as this but i think ianna will do a good job with that so maybe something good will come out of it after all
so your saying because someone had the rl time to commit to csm elections that someone else didnt that their opinion counts less than someone elses doess everyone in eve is equal heck if neccesary jade should have gotten you to post his threads for him to support in lack of all other support instead of posting on his ownwait this already happened
i never read the part in the csm draft that they were allowed to push their own personal projects against the face of popular opinion cite examples please or you and your arguments become ignominious
i dont know if we get to veto any csms issue i rather doubt itthe issue however must pass a csm council vote before it can be submitted to ccp we will find out after this weekends meeting logs are published i think itll pass btw we move on ccp gives their answer and thats that good luck to everyone
page 4 linkageas for popular opinion  its pretty split in this thread but jade did garner the plurality of votes with this proposal as part of his campaign it seems people are pretty open to it
as you said the goal is to gain the support of a representative not be posted by a rep to instantly be moved to the agenda this thread has recieved no support from any representative other than the one which started it  which invalidates that person ability to pass it on or at least should as it implies their idea of eve is somehow superior to those they were elected to represent  this thread has neither gained 5 or a reps suppport apart from the original poster and shoudlnt be on the agenda until one of these conditions is met then again that would imply this system was meant to be representative of the player base and not of individual people
2000 people voted jade in on the basis that this was a key issue i am sure one of us can post the issue if he likes and then he can support it thus meeting the criteriain my viewmake them destructablemake it hard to destroy themgive outposts extra bonuses to compensate for the additional vunerability
theres nothing in the csm document that says this any player may post a topic and it has to be open for discussion for 7 days before a rep can bring it to the council i suggest reading the csm documents
and over 10000 people voted for other candidates over this issue but as ive said in this thread current outposts either need to be immune to this change or need to receive a massive boost to compensate for being made destructible especially as jade has still to specify the 1 dozen  ways they have been buffed which he claimed earlier
and you dont think that it is an abuse of position to move personal agendas through without going through the same mechanisms as other threads that a single person can take through their idea without the 5 player base consideration or other csm candidate support required by other threads
why should current outposts be different than future ones if theyre all hard as hell to destroy but even harder to take intact those who put lots of work into maintaining them should still be able to do so if you build something but get to the point where you can no longer defend it you can take it away before someon else does if someone else is militarily stronger than you they can come take it away from you not like a weaker alliance can realistically hold territory against a much stronger one now but destructible outposts will be more realistic than permanent ones i think it would make the game more interesting overall but thats just my opinion
i feel i should put my own voice in to request outposts are made destructable it will give 00 warfare another challenge and make 00 that bit more excitingbut they should be able to sustain an extended attack from multiple dreads
yes yes yes
definitely without an investigative body it doesnt make sense to even attempt to disallow suicide fraud  maybe prices and payouts should take this into account though  on the other hand no payout for suicide attacks makes perfect sense because no investigation is necessary  the event is already recorded by concord   and its not possible to game the system furthermore this isnt just insurance fraud but insurance fraud used to gain profit in the process
actually it is still allowed unless specifically excluded it is instead vandalism and propety damage possibly arson depending on how it is done and that is jail time stilllawyer got insuarance company to to pay for smoking his expensive cigars and losing them in series of small fires judge ruled insurance did not specify he could not smoke them himself and his claim was awarded insurance counter sued for arson against insured property
approve  no insurance payouts for concord kills or self destructim not as sure about how to rebalance insurance payout amounts though i do feel that t2 losses should hurt
i agree with improving t2 ship insurance somewhat but no matter how much you higher t1 insurance ur still gonna get suicide ganked also you seem to forget a ganker loses his privileges in empire which means doing some mindnumbing ratting ill agree to nefing up suicide ganking if ratting is made more interesting cause its bloody boring or more intersting ways to up your sec status im not gonna waste my precious sec status on a t1 hauler with 4 im gonna wait for that dumbass afk with 200mil or if im really bored ill go with a 100mil but everytime i gank its a few hours of mindnumbing asteroid hopping so i vote yes cause im still gonna gank your lilywhite ass no matter how high you make it for me actually you will be doing me a favour i wont have to waste my time on the crappy 200mil kills ill go straight for the ones with a bil in loot more profit less ratting thanks pal
remove insurance
yes insurence needs to be fixed people  out isk much quicker now compared to 3 years ago insurance should be removed from the game not increased to benefit t2 ships
insurance ideally would cost a bit more for all t1 ships but should still be payed on self destruct and concordokent2 ships no fine as it is noone seems to consider what will happen if you start handing out t1 level insurance on t2 ships demand will boom as people start losing them and i doubt the moon mineral market could keep up most of that extra isk injected into the economy will probably end up in the hands of the big moon holders as prices will undoubtably rise
this is correct if we want to avoid t2 being the new standard then leaving insurance payouts as it is goodfurthermore theres a fundamental difference between t1 and t2 production t2 production relies on moon mining which is a rather finite source anything which drives the demand upwards will push prices up as wellso a definite no to doing anything with t2 insurance payouts
i support the removal of insurance for konkordokken that said i cannot support the upgrading of insurance to fully cover the loss of t2 ships  not until t3 becomes prevalent anyway   flying the shiny ships is supposed to be risky it has consequences t2 ships have benefits the drawback to flying them is that you cant get adequate insurance on them to be fully covered if you could no one except those that dont have the skills yet would fly t1if the t2 ships are fully covered by insurance it would also mean the suicide gankers would fly t2 instead of t1 and use less ships giving each individual a bigger payouteverything in eve is supposed to have risk concurrent with rewardnot supported
againstt1 ship insurance values should be reviewed on a monthly basis and adjusted the current values are definitely out of linecapital ship insurance should be removed or greatly reducedt2 ships should be not be insurable at all
t2 and capital ships shouldnt give any payouts concorded ships giving a payout is finethis forum isnt fine
removal of insurance for concord actions i like to a point itll stop clowns who are suicide ganking for the lulz will do exactly zero to stop the pros from hitting high value targets when you hit a multibillion isk target useing a few 100m isk ships the insurance payout wont matter in the slightest common brutix only needs a 50m isk drop to turn 100 profit wo an insurance payoutmeanwhile t2 ships are not ment to be disposable throw away assets loseing one should be a painfull experience i see no good reason to alter the currrent t2  ie dont bother   insurance structure if you study the market in detail you might discover many many cases of players selling t1 ships under the mineral value theroy being is that the idea of i mined the minerals myself so theyre free has become entrenched in the general industral mindset that is why the t1 insurance structure seems wacked at this time

issue supported
a drone damage mod is definately needed
i sense this is a gallente controlled threadas a member of the caldari race i am heavily angered that their race will get a boost and mine wont pin all fairness yes these mods make sense i support
yea i definatley like the idea the only thing is that being able to increase bandwith might become a bit overpoered but i can definatly see small damage increases and drone bay extenders that would allow some ships to carry multiple drone types
of the 12 t1 battleships 11 have as many or more weapon slots than they do high slots and the 12th the armageddon already has 125 m3 of bandwidth those are the only ships that can fit 1000 pg easily and the module will be displacing a weapon for those that do if you want to give up a large turretmissile for a heavy drone i think thats an entirely reasonable thing for you to be able to do of course all five marauders and the widow would gain more from this but theyre giving up pvp nosneut pve salvage cloaking or some other useful ancillary activity to do it and none of the other black ops or faction battleships have utility from it battlecruisers and cruisers of course would gain from it but they have to tear their fits apart to find 1000 pg for a single module  i dont mind the dps gain if they do so

yea i also remembered recently that if you die before the killmail is generated  if youre fighting someone and you or one of your gangmates die before your gang kills the target   theyyou end up on the mail in a pod although you still get on the killmail it gets confusing at times when people have their previous kills page with 10 kills or so in a pod  i wonder how many points on griefwatch you get for that   
i actually have a theory that if you use certain types of weapons missiles acs on the hurricane for instance   you will either end up with unknown weapon or even hurricane as weapon

right now exploration just isnt interesting to me it does not seem profitable enough  at least without safe access to 00   to make it a team effort and solo its sadly more hassle than fun so i wouldnt do it unless it would be considerably more profitable than other activitiesa more versatile exploration vessel would go a long way at making it more fun so i would love to see this happenalso i wonder if it has to be for exploration role only it seems to me that a bc  or bs   class ship with astrometrics bonus could also be a nice boon for solo bounty hunters should that profession ever come to life

as to the quote above i was trying to say that as for battleships they became more like dreads being used for shore bombardment rather than ship vs ship and as for carriers in my opinion what made them more versatile was the piloted planes on them ie dive bombers fighters rescue and recon in addition the usn never sends a carrier anywhere without a support fleet mainly due to their value and vulnerability more carriers were destroyed by dive bombers and torpedo planes than by anything else though looking at rl navy issues could present a solution if we introduce the rl worries of fleet combat which in my opinion was more of the fast attacks crippling the equivalent of a cap ship and allowing the luxury of time to gain reinforcements to destroy them so a possible solution would be to introduce the ability to cripple a cap ship  jump drive off line speedagility reduced weapons off line or warp drive off line   this can be done either by having certain weapons that do damage more to systems then to shieldarmorhull piloted bombers could be really effective in doing this i believe this might also solve hot drops by forcing a capital fleet to think twice on whether or not the gang they are trying to hot drop on and omfgpwnage has these capabilities and would make they pay for such a move now before everyone gets up in arms about this and say that nerfs caps an easy solution to prevent ships with these abilities from crippling your cap fleet would be to have support there to either intercept and destroy repair caps if damaged or to be there for general support until repairs are made or reinforcements arrive this will still allow caps to be used but would encourage a more well rounded fleet with subcapital support

to me the cause of most of the problems in eve is the failure to think through what is actually happening in the world of eve instead of thinking of the background and the logic of eve there is too much thinking about nebulous issues like game balance  not that that doesnt have its place but its overplayed this creates three problems  firstly an excessive requirement for suspension of disbelief with phrases like yes but its just a game secondly it makes it harder for ccp and others to work out what should happen next and thirdly it makes the game unstable  ill explain that later  ill get straight in with an example what is a blueprintwell in realworld its a bunch of diagrams and instructions for building something  on blue paper traditionally  fancy that   is that what it is in eve ok joe i need 20 copies of this blueprint  pop down to the photocopier will you hmmm problem what the hell would be a bpc be this blueprint will self destruct after 5 uses mr phelps well you might say that the limits are legal ho diddly hum how does that work who enforces these limits  i had at one stage thought this was how ccp would make tech 2 more common by allowing bpc to be used without limit in 00 but the illegal product wouldnt be allowed to enter empire space thats logical development   how do you invent t2 bpc and once youve done it why do you have a limited supplyok so how about an alternative logic for manufacturing suggestion in eve manufacturing is done by nanites drop the appropriate nanites in a manufacturing bay along with the materials and they produce the required product a bpo is actually a device for producing the nanites a bpc is a collection of stored packages of nanites bpc take longer to make than the product because storing these things is dangerous and tricky invention is a process of taking a batch of nanites and trying to slightly alter their programming  also dangerous and tricky and unpredictableeveryone with me so far now some people will be here going whats the point youre not suggesting actually changing anything oh but i am and in any case thats only part of the point keep going please once you know whats going on and why you can think more effectively about the whole gamesecond exampleccp decide that a ship is overpoweredunderpowered a change is brought in in the next patch your character wakes up wtf my ship had 7 turrets yesterday and today its only got 5 wtf happened  talking the eos here   eve reality and sense shot to hell but they needed rebalancing you say doesnt matter there are other ways of doing things sometimes ccp do it from a roleplaying point of view motherships grossly overpowered  able to jump out in low sec and nothing anyone could do to stop them but this time ccp handle it well  new technology introduced of warp disruption field generators with focussed beams now the mothership pilots may be going damn but they arent going wtf new technology is a part of eve life  and very sensibly and believably so those mothership pilots in eve may be annoyed but they arent wondering what happened to the nature of the universe and they arent finding they cant undock because their ships are now a nonsense  ok ms cant dock or undock anyway gimme a break  
this is what i mean by making the game unstable in reality if you buy the worlds fastest car you may wake up tomorrow to find someone has a faster car you dont wake up to find it has a new top speed 100mph lower for no reason at all if things need rebalancing new stuff can be introduced to balance it and sure sometimes that wont be enough and the nerfbat or boost may have to be brought in  but that should be an emergency measure not something done casually it gets you  youccp   in big trouble and ill get back to that also you have to accept that no matter what changes you make some ships will always be less popular and some be more you cannot make everything equally useful it just isnt possible the big one what on earth is going on in eve what is a pod pilotall sorts of things in eve dont appear to make sense  and yet can easily be made to do so let me run through some of the problems1   why do empires let pod pilots run around the place doing what they will with barely any attempt to restrain them even  let alone force them to serve in the empires navies or whatever as you would expect2   why are npc ships generally so much weaker than the same pc ship3   why do npc ships almost never warp out of combat4   where are the billions of crewmen coming from who die in pc ships every day why do they not have to be paid5   why do the empires happily provide pcs with free newbie ships if they have nothing else6   why are pcs able to be cloned when they die but npcs are not and frequently die permanently  sometimes with weak explanations of we found and destroyed all their clones  7   why do the empires let weak pirate ships roam their own belts normally youd think that only the strongest pirate ships would make it deep into the empire not the weak ones8   why do pcs do all the weird things they do9   why do pcs frequently know next to nothing about their own world and how things work i mean if theyve just had years of training to become pilots surely theyd know more than they doi could come up with plenty more too but that will do for nowok suggested explanation  i can think of others for the record but this is my favourite and this is my post   pods are jovian technology  given originally to the caldari as per the background story   that enable one man to control a ship all on his own from a sensory deprivation tank unlike a normal ship a pod pilots ship has a crew of one however being put in a sensory deprivation tank and essentially becoming a ship is more than most peoples minds can take 80 of pod pilot trainees become mad and by mad i mean gibbering idiots who fail the course those who do pass are frequently psychotic and at the very least a bit oddto answer my own questions1   the empires find themselves unwilling to get their own navy personnel to go through such an effectively suicidal procedure only volunteers are taken and they can come from any station in life if there was only one empire the procedure wouldnt be allowed but each empire needs its own pod pilots for the hope of military power and for the enormous improvements they bring to space business they are just too nuts to be fully controlled so the empires dont try but instead hope to benefit from their economic achievements and their support agents are setup to encourage them to follow any given empires line2   the enormous control that a pod pilot has over his ship makes them more dangerous than a crewed ship instant responses no orders being passed3   crewed ships have to shut everything down and get their crews in acceleration couches for warp travel  of course pod pilots are always ready4   there are no crewmen5   each empire is hoping for the support of its own pod pilots when trouble comes
6   anyone could be cloned  but to be cloned you have to be wired in to the middle of a couple of tons of high tech machinery not a problem for a pod pilot but not a way most people can live their lives7   empires know that pod pilots are frequently psychotic and start out looking for something to kill they are happy to let pirates provide weak targets and let the pod pilots do the fighting they are channeling the pod pilots the way they want them to go8   they are frequently mad i mean just look at player names how sane are most of them9   pod pilots are volunteers from any background not trained navy personnelin summary  im asking ccp to create a more consistent background  perhaps following the above examples perhaps not so we know what is going on so we can judge whether something is logical in the world of eve so the game can be stable  which doesnt mean no change it means not randomly changing the things that are already inlast point  i said failure to follow these rules can get ccp in trouble well an example  cargo expander 1 bpos were changed overnight into cargo expander 2 bpos this was obviously completely unfair  and spectacularly stupid it gave unfair advantage to some people and hurt others massively and the reason it was unfair was because no sensible thought could have predicted it the world of eve changed overnight in a way no sane person could have predicted  for no reason whatsoever i could give you dozens of other examples and this is the key thing  stop doing this
im in full agreement a lot of the changes are immersion breaking and very irritating one way out when nerfing ships would be to grandfather the existing ships of that class and have all newly off the production lines varieties be of the latest greatest design
i sort of see what youre saying but theres two major problems one this is a game before its a universe and it has to be treated as such while its nice to swear off certain changes for roleplay reasons its just not feasible two a lot of your proposed fixes actually violate your principles what pod pilot would wake up tomorrow find out his entire crew had disappeared and shrug his shoulders
are you asking for a retcon of the lore to explain game features better or are you asking for more stories and roleplayed patch notes from now onps blueprint  the complete programprocedureset of instruction and the chip or computer it resides on that allows you to reconfigure a car manufacturing factory to produce a different kind of car in volume its millions of processes that must be recalculated and controlled in detail so that the robots dont make a 1 micron mistake and weld the wrong thing not to mention supply flow work flow safeties testing and so on dont think joe can make 20 copies of that easilyi agree with your other example though and with the questions and answers posts not sure what you want  they can do though
as i said on cva forumsnaming conventionsa lot of the problems are to do with naming conventions in programming when you initially code something often the prgrammer will pick a name for a class  object or game concept but slowly over time it will evolve change or youll realise you cant really do it the way you envisioned thus what you end up with isnt either what you had in mind or what you originally called itbut the names stick because no one can be arsed to go back through the code and change it in every place and the devs have already talked about this or that in the dev blogmagical changesthis is really rather dangerous as one of star fractions arguments is that the sov system is unrealistic as overnight you magically gain the ability to anchor and online cyno jammers and jump bridges or whatever else with no logical or realistic explainationthis is why ive suggested having sov based on fulfilling the needs of an npc population and developing a system to give legitimacy to a basic sov claim made with towers the system needs just a little changing and explaining so that changes made by devs fit in with the storyline betteriicr there is a backstory about blueprints and it says they are actually specifications no two blueprints are the same and the reason you can do me research on them is that you can improve the actual design and still have a product that convorms to the vespa medium drone specification and thus has the same stats for less inputthe real crux of the problem though is that there are various legacy and design flaws in evefor example the whole economy will never develop beyond a certain point since there is no way to differentiate two different products on the market aside from price and location you cant get a more durable or more reliable or cheap and cheerful made in a sweatshop kessie as whoever makes it it is exactly the same identical item but if you let people make their own items a   balancing issues b   explosion in the number of items in the database devs have said before itd be nice but not likely this decadeedit ive given up on eve just playing it till something better comes along and blows it  and every other mmo   out of the water
disagree i like the idea that ships have crews
pod pilots do not replace ship crews entirely they merely replace the bridge crew ie the never centre of the shippod pilots dont suddenly have the ability to do all the manual internal ship abilities such as actually storing the cargo loading the ammunition changing out your equipment cleaning etc  they are stuck in a pod while flying and not all the time contrary to popular belief that once i a pod youre stuck ther forever pilots do get out of it when doocked   the pod pilot merely picks what they want done  reducing command time to virtually nothing   the crew still has to make sure its all doneon a side note but related to immersion clear skies would not work a three man crew on a tempest no way three people are running everything on a ship that is actually bigger then portrayed they forgot they need a large crew  in the thousands   especially with no pod pilot  er but other then that tidbit great movie  i reckon most people dont get immersion though they completely ignore things that have no physical numbers for them to minmax or effect the gametake fw for instance they see no value on anything ingame visible only that has no modifications to any stats or attributes such as ranks or medals they just see blowing other ships up as the only benefit to something and gettign useless killboards running  which arent even helpful in the least themselves so why they complain about ranks is beyond me  back to the blueprints thoughyeah ive always been meh at why blueprints have a limited run of copies as far as immersion goes but i reckon thats immersion that had to go out the window in order to get them working in the games ecnomoy  we made the copies out of substandard digital records that degrade if read too much  for the magic changes yeah that stinks as well personally sometimes its up to the player to do the work on his onw  which is an almost impossible task for the kids without a shred of immagination in most online games as none have ever roleplayed in their life with pencil and paper and seem to have no interest beyond shoot em all dead   we the players just have to assume perhaps the mechanics made some tweaks to the ship design in order to make it work and it went fleet wide technically it was a free hull upgraderefit i wouldnt complain if a station did that id just go ok what did you all fek with this time oh shiny ok thats differentnow give me a list of the changes and ill see what i can doso in some ways its part of the gamers responsibility to get things done and the games as well to give a great backstory and show what mistakes the gamers have made to whats been written for the backstory before pod pilot issues and crews is the number 1 common mistake in eve because some cant be bothered to read the old ingame stories and old diagrams and why should they they dont give a rats arse how many ship and crew they blow up because its not a game stateffect i blame ccp for not doing more on that subject though but thats another topic thats ben discussed and never given a direct answer from ccp about its futureuntil then well have to take all the changes in stride and do some immersion on our own perhaps if we make it work enough  more stories that are correct and inline with whats been set and that actually used some common sense and immagination to make it work rather then ignoring it   then ccp wmight go hmm ok lets make it part of the ingame mechanics  since it seems to be the only way to get some pilots to acknowledge it  
would be difficult to pull off since balance changes mean nerfs and nerfs mean making something worse how can you icly explain that your sensor booster which worked great three hours ago now needs a script to work less than half as wellid love the idea of keeping game changes ic i really would however i think its impossibleother than that i like the idea of making as much in the game world as possible make ic sense and because of that im going to go ahead and support this just to see how much of it is actually possible without violating prime fiction gotta keep the writers busy and besides i miss the old technicalhistorical chronicles
theres very simple rl example of how something can be made worseits called regulation its how i think of nerfs
nerf focused fireif i had to pick one issues with eve to fix it would be this my suggestion is to nerf it in correlation to the weapon size of the attacker to the attackedhow this would workexample 1 frigate vs battleship frigates would be able to attack in groups without being nerfed until their dps is roughly equivalent to that of a battleship to avoid complex onthefly server calculations and to endure proper effectiveness of quality configs this would need to be a predetermined number of attacking frigates based off standard t1 configsexample 2 battleship vs battleship 2 battleships attacking 1 the second would be nerfed by 50 a 3rd attacker by 75 4th by 875 and so on still providing an advantage to focused fire but not making it as much of a i win button as it is right nowas far as storyline goes the nerf is attributed by conflicting targeting data as generated by multiple ships and static caused by the volume of fire thus degrading tracking accuracyalso this is probably how it should work the nerf numbers arent set in stone but rather a ever increasing chance of missing as attackers are stacked  nerf to targeting speed or sig rad  
i can appreciate the sentiment but this is really against the spirit of cooperative gaming not only that it would be exploited p no thank you   
dont think so
incredibly bad idea
you actually like the way it works right now or is it that my suggestion is technicallytactically unfeasible
if a was a muggle i would post something like epic failbut im not so how about you get some friends and learn how to call primaries and stop whining
not supported i just dont think this is workable also its already in the game to a degree the implementation is found in the higher tracking of small weapons the speed differences between large and small targets the size dependent target lock times the decreased damage large missiles do to smaller targets etcbest regardswindjammer
both actually big fleets arent a bad thing and i dont want to force everybody to go capital to dodge the nerf similarly implementing it in a way that is both technically feasible and easy for players to understand without producing perverse incentives or stupid outcomes is nearimpossible
the last thing this game needs is more capitals on the contrary to your point i think this would insure less capitals by making smaller ships more viable defensively we already have tracking penalties which balance large vs small what was overlooked is how easy it is to alpha one target and simply eliminate it ive done this myself and had it done too me its just not fun outside of controlled conditions like the tournament also im not against large fleets although ive never participated in one myself id imagine my idea would work even better there with squadrons and battle groups attacking in patterned formations rather than everyone just eliminating 1 or 2 targets at a time then moving on to the next its just lame combat imo
against this personally
this would be a terrible idea because motherships can hit 200k dps tanks and could just be completely indestructible solo  not to mention rr blobs  pretty terrible troll imo
this just in more damage  more damage
actually focus fire is a integral part of combat you focus on the target that will hurt you the most and work your way down
a   if you were fc and there was 1 recon of each race who would you primary firstb   both gallente and minmatar recons can fit a buffertank and nano so if they get targeted they can burn out and warp away falcons must dedicate all their midslots lowslots and rigslots to be competitive
features  ideas threads concerning proposed changes to productionnow this thread isnt for discussing the merits of any of the individual ideas in the linked threads thats what those threads are for if you have comments on any of the individual ideas there then post them up on the trhead as theyre currently works in progresshowever this thread is to ask the questiondo you believe that the production process in eve should be made more complex in order to introduce new niches in the market for new players to exploit
my personal take on this would be that it is necessary most people thinking about production changes are suggesting to go bigger and better in terms of longer term goals for evehowever im more of the belief that the current pinnacle should be the long term goal it should just take longer to reach that pinnacleat the moment production outwith capital ships pretty much goes minerals  completed productdepending on the complexity of the item being built i would suggest that the process should gominerals small components finished product  modules  or minerals small components larger components finished product  ships  much like the current model for capital ship production
t2 shipsmodules  well actually the t2 components need components too so its closer to the second one  t2 stuffminerals t2 components  t2 itemmoon minerals  reactions  t2 componentsof course there are t2 capitals too which are even more complicated due to production of t2 capital partswe already have this
this is true however these ideas were focusing more on t1 productionfor t2 it would become something like thisminerals  components  basic t1 itembasic t1 item  morphite  advanced components  t2 itemhowever this isnt to discuss the merits of an individual idea the statement at the end of my first post is what this thread is to gauge the support forif the consensus is that we do want manufacturing to be more complex then we need to propose ideas at that point as to how that could be accomplished
yea this another one of those i heard from the grape vine things i want to actually know what they are addressing i could not find anything about this topic by the devs could you please link the sourcealso your proposal seems very tedious and scripted bruce tried this patrol bit and the players got over it pretty quickly it becomes a grindi have read other threads like this and a lot of the push comes from players that feel they are entitled space that the big alliances are not using i am sorry but g one foe m0o bob lv rise tri goon pl razor smashkill and many others started small and in empire that developed a plan had some set backs and followed through with hard work and determination from what i am reading you want to lower the bar for corps that do not have the will or effort to try to make it work the alliances are special because they all had a plan and succeeded on the hard level i would be interested in seeing what the devs have on the board to address the pos issue because you are eluding to the fact that they are working on the issue to give your proposal some kind of credibility
one idea id like to bring up the csm because unlike a goon i know who thinks they arent reading they areanywaysive had one idea ive really liked and i want to see what the csm thinksbasicly make it so you can build planetary bases this bases run pos logistics with the basic idea being that you have to build hualers and you have to stock pile fuel at the base  the base is in space and can be attacked by the way  so basicly you build this base you build ships you stockpile fuelnow the hualers you built become npcs that refuel poses for you even when your off line using the stock pile meaning you have to stock pile just one place not 40they only refuel within system or only that planets moonsthe other thing is those hualers will be attackable thus you could get a small gang and take out hualers thus hurting that allainces pos servicesthe only other thing i want to bring up is removing poses from sov would be the best idea imo replacing it with planetary control
oh is this the issue then my opinion is gtfo csmfirst reason how come no one really knows the definition of dynamic  except goum   anyone who has taken a basic physics course can tell you that dynamics is the study of objects and energy in motion or continuous change so when you say something like you dont want station pingpong you want something dynamic you do realized that having a station change hands many times in a week would be very dynamic and that you look like you dont know what you are talking about rightsecond reason the almightly chariman of csm  jade constantine   gave a simple i support this answer are you aware of the discussions on other forums like mothermoon copied here are you a massive sov holding alliance do you have any ideas what are your thoughts a simple yup ok repsonse is a slap in the face to all the people in csm who want to take it seriously many more people like mothermoon give out lots of helpful ideas in the appropriate place and do so without being asked or elected and knowing that their ideas probably have a snowballs chance in hell of making it into the game but they all add in much more thought and time and effort than the csm chairman nice grats all grats alli gave the csm a fair shot but all these terrible reponses by csm members gives me the attitude of gtfo out my game you whinersalso ibtmitnal
i really think the whole sov issue needs to be looked at using pos as the sov holding tool allows the big alliances to run around the whole map grabbing profitable moons and being able to defend them with capital and supercapital fleets thanks to jump bridge networks at some point the big alliances will own all the profitable moons and control who gets what in the way of t2 ships by controlling the t2 product market while the specifics need to be discussed in depth the issue needs to be addressed
please see the dev post mothermoon quoted a couple posts after yours
well hey maybe i should run next time
there are several definitions of dynamic  one relates to physics as you mentioned the others are2 characterized by continuous change activity or progress a dynamic market3 marked by intensity and vigor forceful see synonyms at active4 of or relating to variation of intensity as in musical soundclearly 2 is what were talking about here  the antonym of staticwhile i recognize that a certain level of dynamics would be so chaotic and back and forth as to be labeled ping pong  that doesnt mean the only other option is trench warfarei am aware of that discussion and if you read it youll see my posts in that very thread  in fact i referred to it and linked to it at the start of the example system linked in the op   frankly i dont see why either of these reasons you cite support not inquiring as to what ccps plans are for sovereignty and how much input the playerbase can have via the csm
ok lets put this simply ccp put a thread in general discussion i believe it was asking for suggestions on improving the sov systemccp have understood their is a problem they have asked for an opinion they are considering this this thread is copletly unnecessary and if brought up in iceland ccp will say well we have asked for player opinion we have recognised this is a problem we are trying to fix itwhat more do you expect
yup and this thread suggests that the csm inquire as to where that revamp is headed so player input can continue to be a part of how it is fixed definitely something the playerbase should be represented on
perhaps you could repost the issue then check with ccp to follow up on thier stated intention as outlined in a previous dev post to revamp sovthat appears to be the standard star fraction reply when thier agenda gets challenged whats wrong with just bringing it up this of course only surfaces after thier very specific star fraction friendly suggestion is assaulted and picked apartwell why not phrase your issues as just going to bring this general topic up its your specific approach that every problem must be solved with a star fraction play style friendly solution that is the real concern add to it that jade gives blanket approval to such ideas and we have ourselves a problem
id be happy to update the op to clarify this pointhowever i think the only biases youre revealing are your own im very happy to have a vigorous discussion about the positives and negatives of the current sov system and how they might be improved upon especially in light of what weve seen from the devs so far about what theyre thinking but you have to get past your ingame political views to really have it be productive
my in game views the only changes i see star fraction and jade actively championing directly benefit star fraction gameplayi am perfectly happy to see change that makes life tougher on the cva we do what we do and will adaptalways havei do think bad ideas are just thatbad ideas changes to sov are fine with mebut i disagree with your changes destructible outpostswhile not my first choice of things for the csm chair to become zealous about are fine with meas long as the changes balance both the investment in constructing and maintaining the outpost vs taking it  ie make it tough to blow it up cost isk cost 3060 days   time if you can take it and you can hold it against counter attack for 12 monthsblow it up i think its an awful idea and will erode 00 settlement but if the majority of the populace supportsque sera seraand i am glad you will update the op i look forward to the clarificationnow lets see star fraction get behind something that works counter to star fractions playstyle
range and dps have always been a trade off when youre at distance and using long range weapons you do less dps but youre protected from a lot of weapons by that distance when youre in close with close range weapons you do a lot more dps but youre vulnerable to every weapon there isjust looking at the dps of the prenerfed myrmidon is insufficient to fully analyze its abilities compared to the other ships of eve its like saying all gallente ships need to be nerfed because they pump out too much dps when in close rangewindjammer
no its saying that it was overpowered compared to the other races battlecruisers
i think it would be awesome if player made contributions could be included in the eve universe in a smiliar way to deadspace areas that show up on the overview im talking about things like entitys museum and the graveyard of cans they wouldnt need to be too complex maybe in the entity example would be a station type thing that had a link to his website in its description maybe we could even have jrs movie theatre  they would add alot to the roleplaying and adventure in eve in short theyd be like landmarks in real life that are just something fun to visit
in fleet fights it is fairly common for fcs to have people sort their overviews alphabetically so that its easier to find primaries its also pretty common to call off primaries in alphabetical order this means that characters with names starting towards the beginning of the alphabet tend to get primaried a lot character names are immutable and generally chosen before the player is even aware of the significance this can have on certain play stylesthis is all well and good but what we really need is something more simple and intuitivesince we have filters for all the vital player ship stats velocity signature transversal distance icon etc it is only logical that we have one for character age as well this will considerably speed up larger engagements and allow new players to travel from 00 to empire more readily  bleh  
and my axe
this idea has nothing to do with another thread on this forum about focues fire this is a separate discussion in which players can support this ideabasically i propose a simple fix to focused fire not a hard limit or something like that but instead an incentive senor strength distortionfor each target lock a ship is locked on by its senor strength is increased by 10 not stacking nerfed thus you can have 12 ships all target one ship but that ships senor strength will become so high ecm will become useless on the target giving the incentive in small gang to not just gang up on one target based on your fleets tacticssig radius distortionfor the second part of my idea there is a huge exploit i cant think of a workaround for but ill post it anyways for each target lock on a ship that ships sig radius is lower due to interference this results in a slightly longer period of locking time and makes the target harder to hitthis decease in sigradis is 10 stacking nerfed for each ship locked on to it past the 1st targethowever this idea means gang mates will just lock each other before a battle any ideas on how to get around thiswell ok discuss   
there is no irony to a confirmed scammer requesting this featureit actually makes a lot of sense for someone who may find it difficult to earn the trust of others  whether new or dishonest   to want access to a more restrictive api keyit settles the fears of those who are concerned they may be giving away more information than theyd like
as it seems that it is not in the rules i think it would be fair if threads started by csm members require the same as other threads started by the player base in order to reach the agenda as some members are just posting their views and moving it through to agenda without meeting the 5 support or the support of other csm members in order to advance their own agendas on the csm i propose that the author cannot be the one to endorse the thread onto an agendai would also like to propose that csm members when supporting a thread also post why they support an issue instead of saying things along the lines of i support this so that the player base can discuss with the csm why it is being brought before the council as these issues are supposed to be representative of the player base not of individuals
my favorite is losing a dread because the cable company decided to shut down a segment of the network i was on to do some scheduled work and did not tell their customersanyway i was 35 seconds from coming out of siege when it happened and my dread never warped off after siege was over all the modules shut off and the ship sat there needless to say it got popped and ccp gave me the the logs do not show anything they even said sorry you didnt warp off but we cannot give you the ship back
tactical environments could add more dynamism to combat create a greater sense of immersion through more interesting and realistic scenery and help make the different areas of eve universe less homogeneousi move they should be reexamined as a possible future expansion before the decades end
please be more specific with what youd like here after all we already have tactical environments  empty space is a boringashell tactical environment but it still qualifies as one and if this is just a parody post with no real belief behind it as i have a sneaking suspicion that it might be spam the original thread not the forum
there was a sticky about it from oveur on features and ideas forum for about a year and a half before it was quietly dropped  cant find it anymore has sunk a while ago  was basically stuff like you get in deadspace mwd not working or some mod being boosted or nerfed in different areastactical environments could also be thought as like the equivalent of terrain and weather just like you have jungles or tundra as constants you could have different set of effects such as one region having all sensor and ew related environmentsthen you have the equivalent to sunny weather or raining or foggy being how intense various effect are and where abouts in a system or region they are strongest  weakest
i think i can illustrate this idea best by examplessample tactical environmentsnebulagas cloud targeting range 50 scan resolution 50 max velocity 25 mwds disabled afterburners 75 velocity bonusscanners not used to picking up anything can get overwhelmed by gas clouds with their constantlyshifting patterns of interference severely hindering them because of the large number of energized particles microwarpdrives cannot operate effectively and all ships are slowed down due to drag however because of the abundance of fuel afterburners are a lot more effective  they can burn a lot more fuel without being in any danger of running out making them fasterasteroid field turret falloff 50 turret optimal range 25 missiles may detonate randomly kinetic resists 15 ships and missiles moving faster than 1000ms take kinetic damage in proportion to their speedfighting in an asteroid field is difficult because of all the little rocks flying around optimal range and especially falloff range are reduced by the large number of opportunities for a shot to get deflected or smack into a meteoroid before getting to their target missiles are especially effected as they will detonate on contact with a particularly large meteoroid theyre almost impossible to use at long range because of this kinetic damage is especially effective as ships already have to deal with asteroids bumping into them as they move and increased kinetic damage will overwhelm their compensation systems a lot faster things that move particularly quickly will run into trouble or rather asteroids which hurt quite a bit when youre moving very fastthat said id love some variety i dont think its technically practical but im going to support it because if it is id like to see it
i started playing about a year ago and remember discovering this really cool looking mod that suks cap out of another ship so in awe of this idea i trained energy emissions pretty much straight away then i started looking at bhaalgoorns or well drooling mainly but not long after ccp took away its awesome power and made it pretty average by comparison well trickier to use now i can see it was slightly overpowered in the first place and the nerf was perhaps needed i just think it could have been looked at more closely something always bothered me about the nos fix and that was  i hope im right in saying this but it seems to be popular opinion   that it only works if the target ship has lower capacitor percentage than yours now this seems to be a bit unbalanced why would it be  based when the mod drains a fixed integer amount based on skills mod and shipmy suggestion would be to look at making the nos drain until the target ship has have equal or lower  actual   capacitor amounts rather than percentage based
im pretty sure the reason they chose not to go that route was that itd be a nerf to large nos but not so much to small or medium  theyd have little difficulty finding a target bigger than them to suck cap out of in almost the same fashion as prenerf at which point the curse and pilgrim would still be the monstrosities ive heard they used to be
aye i see your point  but i am kinda going with the small ship idea of being able to feed off larger ships indefinitely it would be same for batleships going up against a carrierdread i can see how it would nerf the large nos on bss but is this a bad thing do bses use nos that much apart from some old school domi pilots   i mean they only get one cycle off a frig and not much more off an average cruiser so its not a huge loss in the scheme of things if you think about it larger ships  in pvp   usually live on lower cap resources because they use a lot more and can boost a lot quicker than a smaller ship which dont generally fit cap boosters   so that is perhaps where i see the imbalance in that principle smaller ships should be allowed to use nos as their capacitor input more freely
look at fittings for nosmyrmsi always had lower cap then the person i was fighting until they were outif you can suck a bs down to a full bc cap they have no cap except for maybe one or two rounds and a pulse on the mwdbring back nos
how is it that nos work nowis it calculated from  amount or  recharge rate and how do they make it so that its impossible to completely drain a target with a nos does the nos think its target is empty when it has 100 recharge rate does the amount the nos drain change based on the targets caplots of questions but i havent found any good explonation on exactly how they work
actually i do not agree nos the way it was before was monstruously unbalanced in a gang youd get about pretty much everyone and their mommy fitting medium to large nosthe way it is now works perfectly fine in fact you can now balance between nos and neuts fitting and actually have an enjoyable fight
old nos used to suck
current nos is goodhowevermake pilgrim and curse work as old nos
the problem now is not nos i hear they work wonders with high cap use ships versus ships that do not use cap very much the only problem is theyve gone from a purely offensive weapon with a beneficial touch to a defensive weaponthe true problem are the nos using ships most of the fits i have seen do not even include a nosferatu system anymore
this wont revert nos to its former glory it will give it a new lease of life though im pretty sure its based on percentage of actual cap as opposed to the recharge rate though your right there has mysteriously never been an official explanation of how it worksi think the main problem is that you are draining 120 cap with heavy nos a frig has 150 and if your cap is 50 in a bs his is 100 you only get 60 cap out of the frig for one cycle so its pretty much useless in that situation currently it only works when you are up against ships equal your size anyway so if you make the nos drain til your cap levels are equal by number the bs vs bs works exactly the same the same and you increase the effect of the nos for smaller ships versus bigger ships giving it a use again i really think this needs to be looked at or at least explained as the nos has gone from one extreme to the other
hi i expect many people to cry out against this but i think that the lack of accountability and consequences for alts in eve is a problem that should be addressed so my question is should something be doneby being able to hide this way it is near impossible to have full consequences taking certain actions ingamethere have been several threads about this already so i shouldnt need to explain furtherperhaps others can think of some suggestions but here are two i remember from previous threads with some modifications1 simply display the players alts in the player information window multiple accounts may be harder to do but possible2 implement skills and abilities to perhaps track a players activities actions travels in the past the player could then check if two avatars are linked if you are wrong 3 times you cannot scan or check that character again these could be higher level hacking skills or something so you couldnt create alts just to scan and check espionage could still be viable as if done properly a link could only be formed after discovery other suggestions are welcome but the main issue is should something be done about the lack of accountability and consequences for alts
speaking as an alt i disagree from an out of character point of view its irritating but you have to remember these are all characters why should different characters histories cross over to each other from a rp perspective theres simply no reason to ooc is the same removal of anonymous alts would remove alot of potential in the game
im surprised you didnt just propose limiting us to one character per accountno love from me i like keeping my alts a secret so i have characters i can play on when i dont want to be bothered
well im open could you tell me about the potential it would remove i am sure there would be some however removing anonymous alts may give the game more potential too in terms of rp depth the question  which i dont know the answer to  is would the benefits outweigh the costs or viceversa
a market or cyno alt is very helpful to many players they simply dont want to have to pay for that account when they no longer wish to train itmaybe offer a 2 a month charge for single alt accounts that disallow trainingthat is a bad idea i am sure btw
nope
the problem is that anything that it makes sense to have a friend with you it makes sense to have an alt with you and there is no way whatsoever to stop people from making alts under alternative player identities  you can make it a breach of eula but you cannot stop it   i am not sure if this is solvable for an mmog
nopethe only issue that would be worth discussing is the use of npc corps to protect alts but that would extend to all characters in npc corps
the problem i see is that ccp cannot 100 track whom multiple accounts belong toalt tracking will be useless if they cannot tie all characters to their mutual owners
besides forum alts having an alt is supposed to allow a player to do things they may want to do without having it tie back to their mainit allows freedom in a game that allows players to have many different lifestyles if ccp allows what youre proposing it will provide players a means to boycott alt mission runners alt industrialists and other alts just because one group doesnt like the group the main belongs to  goons finding all of bobs alts and not buying their stuffsuicide ganking more targetted  having an alt allows one to take a break from activities their main is entangled in and live freely from whats happening in another part of the galaxy as far as alt posts go it sucks but if you prevent it by any means then you encroach on this alt freedom idea
first solution to the problem by the original poster should not be to drop csm it should be next time do not vote the guys you think are only bickerersso no support  let it run a couple of terms at least before deciding
i joined eve just before the end of the voting process and was still finding my feet so i didnt vote or have a chance to view the candidates optionshowever i still stay we give the csm a chance and see what its like after six monthsnot supportedab
in fleet fights it is fairly common for fcs to have people sort their overviews alphabetically so that its easier to find primaries its also pretty common to call off primaries in alphabetical order this means that characters with names starting towards the beginning of the alphabet tend to get primaried a lot character names are immutable and generally chosen before the player is even aware of the significance this can have on certain play stylesi dont have a particular solution in mind but some that immediately spring to mind areremove the ability to sort overview by name  bleh  provide some limited means to change character names perhaps with a name change historychange the name column on the overview to list ship name instead of character namechange the name column on the overview to list a call sign that is changeable by the player
i support my own post
supporting this maybe you should be able to fit a module that masks your name
more thinking is required for your idea young whiner1   no sorting the overview by name is needed for general gameplay2   no because you can scamchange name name history would just be abused via scammersspys changing their name what happens if i unknowingly change my name to an exscammer god can you imagine the problems with this3   there is already a type and sort by type function this suffers from the same problems as point 14   call sign would be very exploitable dont you think how about everyone has a call sign of a or how about it is all is and 1s like imagine saying primary is i1ii111iii secondary is i1ii1i11ii1 get itgetting rid of name means getting rid of focus fire i believe you can sort by distance doesnt work very well sort by type is hard when there are 50 megathronssome battles are so huge that calling targets is obsolete and you simply go through a list as fast as you can not much of eve fights are 100 v 100 so this problem is very rare you can either tank up your ship buy a character with a name starting with z or just deal with it but the rest of eve gameplay should not have to suffer because you are dying in fleet battles
no support sorry you picked a name starting with a definitely do not remove the ability to sort the overview
ive seen that in other games  there was one age in utopia where one of the top kingdoms had nothing but zeroes and capital os in their names and all played the same race  trying to distinguish between 0ooo00o0oo and 0ooo00o0o0 the undeads attacking you was next to impossible even with the thirdparty tools that game had it sucked and i dont want to have to go through that ever again playermakable callsigns are a terrible idea
not signed if you dont want people to know youre piloting a ship fit a cloak if you dont want to be primaried in a fleet battle fly a prophecy
this is a fairly simple suggestion that would go a long way towards keeping the csms reputation intactreading the csm week 3 agenda i am upset to see that almost half the agenda items were apparently added by the same people that posted them in the first place this is not unexpected in the first weeks after the election when candidates are trying to drum up support for the platforms that they ran on however im still bothered a bit the two that especially bother me are item 6 which has only middling support  31 supports out of 255 posts   and especially item 9 which has almost no support  13 supports out of 56 posts   but is on the agenda anyway which was posted by an alliance member of and cheerleader for one of the csm membersfrom a players perspective this smacks of selfservice and favoritism and i dont like it at all this isnt an attack at the integrity of the csm members who have done this but it does make me worry that representation here is not equalmy solution add the followingagenda list the following items who posted an issue who nominated the issue and  optional   a reason for nominating itcsm rules a new rule you cannot nominate a thread you started unless it receives x support optionally this could extend to be you cannot nominate a thread started by you or any members of your corpalliance unless it receives x support to keep this fair x should be a higherthanusual number like 5060 this might create some problems for the goonswarm representatives but some would argue thats probably not a bad thing this will also raise the problem of altposting from particularly determined friends of the candidate but it should cut back on it at least
goonies would just use alts   in general i agree on the point that there should be some visibility on the listings about it however i am uncomfortable by the idea that there needs to be a minimum support if it was a simple vote for support procedure we would not need csm at all  ccp should just look at the poll numbers directly csm are there to put some individual perspective to it and the solution for if we do not like any particular representatives perspective would be to not vote for them in the future  and possibly tell others why they should not either  
agree with some but not all of the post particularly dont think the quoted section would help unless you extend it further to x amount of support from people outside your corpalliance which isnt fair because it disenfranchises all of those people on the other hand without that rule a large corp or alliance could probably very easily muster the required amount of support just by asking its members to log on and vote accordinglyi dont have an issue with candidates picking issues that they want to escalate and presenting them for vote  we had the opportunity to vote for the people we wanted so the theory goes that what they select will be backed by the majority of the people who voted for that person a ludicrously unpopular suggestion with the player base might still need to be presented because it has further reaching implications that forum trolls  such as me    cannot see which would better the game overallprovided that the candidates dont lose sight of presenting topics which have good support but which dont fall under their personal banner this doesnt bother me overmuch
i dont think this would solve the problem that you would want it to
oh well i just wanted to put the topic up for discussion and would like to see it thought about at some point would be nice to have some sort of check or balance though im not sure what that would be  and just hacked that together as i was posting it as an example  more discussion pleaseand kelsin in the spirit of discussion why dont you think it would solve the problem
isnt this why there are 9 csm members instead of one technically you would expect the other 8 to vote down suggestions of this kind
this point does win the argument i concede this argument and chalk it up to cynicism and paranoia and hereby thumbsdown my own proposal
indeed and also select topics of discussion that they may feel are more worthwhile of ccps attentionwhile we may not agree with the choices of other csm representatives they are entitled to bring forward whatever issues they want tothe rest of the csm can then decide if they are worthwhile or not and then ccp will get a similar opportunity
you are also going to see csm members supporting minor nofrills issues that receive hardly any support but are simple and easy to implement and will benefit the community

whiners die everyday
damn newbies shouldnt be allowed to post on forums  enter 00  shoot at me
i think what we need to do is just figure out the common whines and ignore them for example everyone has had enough about the titans  so if the mods just delete every titan thread and send a warning to those who start one we might have a somewhat less congested forum
erm if there are so many threads doesnt that indicate that people are concerned about the topic
do we need yet another drone nerf sweet jesus theyve beaten the hell out of the drone boats we dont need an antidrone ship please let the myrmidon die in peace
no theyre called smartbombs
agree with destroyers and smartbombs also caldari missile boats are very effective alpha strike against drones since they pop easy you are more concerned with high alpha to kill before they can be recalled instead of high sustained damage on the drone
nobody has troubble killing my drones as it is i go thru a few million in drones every time i undock the moros tens of millions if i launch the fighters on the thanatos both of those ships have drone bonuses but it doesnt keep their drones safe at allapearantly your frustration comes from your tactical discrepancy that these others have already planned for when they see drones they kill them generally with tacklers missile boats anything with a web and even jammers to keep me from controlling them efficientlydont change the game change your tactics
the damage bonus isnt needed at all because most drones are very very weak its bad enough that drones are as easy to kill as they are remember that drones are main weapons for some ships and this ship would be like using defender missiles that actually did their job well against caldari the ship also sounds like it could be abused for antiinterceptor purposes
i like hybrid solution what drahken said is one give the player the option to defendnot defend is wreckalso not to kill the ninja salvaging profession id like to see the wreck and the canloot be player ownedyellow for one hour giving the player the right to defend it and salvaged his hard earned kill then after the first hour the wreck and the canloot become whitenot owned for an aditionnal 2 hours or sothen the rule of thumb for the ninja becomes pretty much if you can find it  the wreck   and cant wait risk it  your ship    if not wait and seethis game is all about freedom of choices and the result of those choices
im sure this made sense to you when you wrote it how does it look now that youve sobered upwindjammer
im not going to read the whole of this thread but id like to put it on record that having heard for myself the way in which darius johnson conducts himself he is a bit of a simpletonspecial boy who thinks he is out there with his humour and likes to push the boundaries of what is acceptible he is probably bad news but boo hoo hoo who cares let him play with his new toy i wont be reading this thread again so direct any abuse to my evemail if you feel the need to care
i am sorry how are we going to get useful ideas on the agenda when you guys wont even give us official threads where we can explain the problems and concerns of changesthat is kinda like having big pharma write the medicare bill with no input from the public and claiming its been widely discussed and the public has had the chance to weigh in
god damn it man how thickheaded are you threads in assembly hall are official
where we can explain the problems and concerns of changes you cannot do that in the assembly hall threads theyre rallies not discussions
slap
you seem to have only half read official yes discussions certainly notmost of the posting in assembly is almost entirely spam in the form of signed or simply blank posts with support checkedno one is interested in asking questions or clarifying just shoring up hasty support is this me too syndrome a discussion by any measure
ive gone through this in other posts but the short answer is yes look at this thread of mine that i started specifically because gou said that there ought to be debate even on that topic  69 replies 68 thumbs and a they really should have this theres no debate there because its essentially undebatable  its a good idea that everybody supports now id love to get away from signed spam and i want to see ccp implement a system to vote without posting asap but until we do its a fact of assembly hall that said theres still plenty of discussion happening  look at this thread thats had 139 comments in the past 24 hours the vast majority of which were at least somewhat lengthy and debating the issue at hand frankly if you dont think theres enough discussion go chip in a few comments and if you dont think theres enough opportunity for discussion which is really the relevant part here   then all you have to do is acknowledge the possibility of you going and chipping in a few comments that shouldnt be too hard right
the lack of real discussion is a symptom of a whole host of problems not something you or i can ameliorateit exemplifies the worst aspects of an internet forum completely unmoderated saturated in me too posts and theres too much thread overlap just posting more or more constructively means nothing in this context because of the volume of people spamming and structural limits of the forum see also monster trucks its a lost cause
its a lost cause when monster trucks get voted through the csmthats not the same thing lucky weve got a spamprevention function eh
i really would like to bring up the simple point once more that removing the posting from the supporting would greatly increase the effectiveness of the forumin other words you either post to discuss or you just show support without having to spamin other words adding a poll to each thread in the form of support or dont supportbecuase really people im hearing both sides of the world are endingon one had you have people saying its official and works perfectlyon the other hand i hear nothing works its not a discussion at allim sorry but i personally have been discussing threads on that forum maybe people should just be less lazybut lets face it not everyone has something to add some people might just think someone elses idea is greatin other words  you need both for the system to workthe system currently is allowing for discussions trust me sure there is spam but that doesnt rule out the discussions taking place i mean even if only 5 people have posted its still a discussion lets not start judging how many posts it should take before it countsand currently players can show their support to the threat meaning i have nothing to add i like your ideathe idea is to show ccp and the csm what players want brought upthe other goal is to discuss what should be brought upthus we need both stop saying its not one or the other its both its just not done perfectlybut ccp cant remove the ability to vote for a thread to be brought up and it would be stupid for us to have another forum for each vited in topic for nothing but discussion or would iteither way we have to work with it this year and next year we can see what went wrong aka support  spam in between the discussions at hand and it will be more successful
please note what you are currently doing by posting how badly your contradicting yourself
submission deadline for discussion of issues is now closed and that part of the agenda is fixedcan i remind all csm reps who took ownership of issues last time we need the formal submission templates filled out very soon as we will need to submit them to ccp by next week at the moment im thinking of an extra meeting next week on thursday where well vote final approval on the issues from week 23 prior to getting them bundled off to ccpthanks a lot
i see that you have now fixed the agenda for this meeting so now as chairperson can you please publicly state answers to the following1 that presenting 60 issues to a csm meeting as one topic science and industry   is within the rules and guidelines2 are you going to discuss each of the 60 issues in turn3 is there going to be a seperate vote on each of the issues from the science and industry pdfmany thanksarithron
yes if the issue gets support and goes to the iceland agenda yes we will nope well be voting on whether the issue of industrial improvements is a matter worth raising as a whole and will be treating the 60 issues as example problems afflicting science and industry at the moment there will be discussion with ccp if this reaches the agenda but at some point well be relinquishing control of the document to the powers that be and trusting them to give a substantive response to the detailed issues
perhaps ccp could  or be encouraged to   respond holistically to the science and industry document so they read it over get the general pitch and respond in a more general sense at first so as not to get bogged downmaybe this is already how theyre planning on doing it but i guess well see with the first meeting
satisfactory in my eyes is that they seriously look into those things and implement the given things some which have been scream for for yearsi by no means expect an answer to all of them 60 issues some of the ideas are indeed some major changes which shouldnt be taken on lightly but as long as they are discussed im happyedit some things i do expect a clear comment on though im happy if at least the most wanted things are covered
the only way they are forced to discuss and respond to issues is when each one is debateddiscussed by the csm and then voted upon in a meeting having them all lumped together is not as far as the guidelines and rules state satisfying this requirement dont get me wrong im all for some love in the science and industry areas however you set precedents for future csms so its important that everything is done correctly from the start denying debate and discussion on separate issues by lumping them all in together isnt useful or in the spirit of what the csm was designed to do it would be good to get a ccp ruling on this issue  presenting multiple issues for just one vote without proper csm discussion or player discussion on individual issuessince how can you properly discuss 60 issues in a meeting or coherently on a thread  where do you get your definitive answer from jade regarding multiple issues being allowed as one issuetake carearithron
and in question 2 above i asked if you were going to discuss the 60 issues it appears from your answer that you arent going to in a csm meeting as required can you explain how bypassing one of the main responsibilities of a csm is in keeping with what you were elected to do and said you would do this is a question to all csm members btwtake carearithron
she said they will discuss all 60 issuescan you not read as in they will discuss all 60 issues its not the job of the 1st csm meetings to discuss anything they are only voting if the issue should be taken to ccp to be discussed
i dont know arithron i think in some cases it might be much better to address a collection of issues together a great thing about this game is how every part of it touches every other part of it so if the csm can vote on a document that addresses multiple aspects of a broad issue together it might make a lot more sense than voting on a ton of individual bits kind of like passing a package of laws in a legislature
seconded and signedas a witness of mega lag generated by the nc and trisurg wars  especially the qcwa incident  the lag issue needs to be addressed by the evedevs if at all possibleone suggestion ive heard from a tech friend of mine was eve should go multi threaded helps server end lag and user end lag for multi core processorsthoughts
then people will just fight without the fleet system no reason metagaming doesnt workalso you cant nerf metagaming
multithreading is only possible when the problem can be solved in parallel computing irrational numbers analyzing protein structures and folding behaviors and processing background radiation are all problems which can be subdivided easily and processed in multiple threads but think about it rationally how could you subdivide eves combat system when events occur in eves combat system they must happen in order for example the 2 similar scenarios are identical except for their order of execution but have 2 completely opposite resultsscenario 1titan starts warp attempthic tackles titantitan reaches necessary speed to warpresult titan fails to enter warpscenario 2titan starts warp attempttitan reaches necessary speed to warphic tackles titanresult titan gets away  hic doesnt tackle titan until it is already in warp  if you have 2 threads computing the same engagement but both threads produce different results how should you reconcile the differences which one is right which one is wrong this problem becomes much larger as you increase the number of interacting entities and the number of threadsmultithreading is not a silver bullet when you have multiple threads working on the same data you have a whole new slew of bugs and problems resource locking race conditions deadlock livelock etc and on top of this you still have the same bottlenecks that a single threaded app has memory bandwidth io lag waiting for devices etc the problem is that even if you multithreaded eve combat all the threads would be trying to access the same resources  memory   the advantages of multithreading are diminished when the threads have to wait for their turn to access a resourcenow ccp will be distributing some systems of eve across multiple cpus they have stated that when they implement rdma market transactions and station activities will not effect out of station activities this will hopefully help out immensely the thing that i want to see implemented though is dynamic node balancing iirc currently in order for a system to be reinforced they have to take the node down and manually set it up to work only on a single system if they can get dynamic node balancing working a system could be automatically reinforced when a large fleet jumps in without ccp interventionedithowever i am in full support in multithreading the client since the client performs no vital computations in itself i would really like it if eve didnt lock up my entire computer everytime i opened up the market window or tried to log in
i endorse this proposal let there be proper structures it could even be a great support for ambulation which is supposed to give us ability to walk through space stations might as well give us the opportunity to scramble for your ships as your pos gets attacked or walk over to a factory process control center to set a new manufacturing job or the likes

this should be implemented asap honestly this should have been a priority over factional warfare or some other stuff we are getting i already supported it once above so just pushing it up

i like all of your suggestions except i think that giving it a 1520 bonus per level to remote sensor dampener effectiveness would be a bit better
cool i dont mind as long as its increased   
damps need a boost now they were overpowered before but now they are even underpowered on ships with the bonuses for them
double the bonuses

no it would not a 15 bonus per level would put the celestis at a maximum damping ability of 94 a 20 bonus would put it at 107

i hate to say it but quoting dismake my three monitors work better evei can only watch ts jump around like crazy so much before i dont care whos talking anymoreof course not having chat and the scanner and the overview take up 90 of my playing screen would also be greatmonitor support

this this would be awsome to work with the piots and help them out
outstanding idea
definately a good idea its such a waste of time to have to set up the overview settings after each major build digging through eve files to get those settings is possible but should be made a lot easier
yes please ill take 2 it really freaks me out having 35 setups on couple of accounts to dissapear after some fukken patch or some cosmic radiation i dunno   i always say f it no more complex setups but as time passes i get 35 favorite settings back only to see them dissapear again
its small ideas like these that interest me the most not those stupid faction warfare stuffwholeheartedly supported ccp fix and enhance the current game instead of expanding it with new crap
dude read the skill  it reduces jump time it doesnt increase clone numbers as for the skill its okay but i think it should almost give a bigger bonus 14 hour jumpcloning hardly seems worth it for 30 days of training
i like this skillbtw i would also like 6 jump clones
totally useless rank six is just hilariously terriblejust use the existing rank one and change the bonus to 1 clone 10 jump timelevel
supporting decreased jc timer
all i would want would be level 3 log in do some stuff someone says hey lets go 00 roaming so you jump clonenext day log in and be able to jump clone already rather than wait a few hours
i support opbecause the problem is i cannot jump clone at the end of the day to an implanted clone because it would mean waiting til the end of the next day to get out
nice only edit the skill rank to a 4 multiplier6 is a little over the top considering the basic infomorph psych rank is a 1 it would still take a decent chunk of time to train up at levels 4 and 5 respectively
this would make it so that characters with leadership implants dont take such a penalty when flying solo
i also like this idea as the jump time would be less than the op
i made a suggestion for clone jump reduction skill a while back in the ideas forum definite yes
dont know if this has been raised here or if its applicable to this forumbut i really think that something should be done about turrets missing completely but grphics showing otherwiseand there should really be a missile launcher hardpoint i mean damn it loooks lousy seeing a missile spawn outta nowhere many ppl will saythis isnt very important who cares but i beg to differ just because weve got used to mediocrity doesnt mean its not importantand yes i realise that there are some programmingtechnical leaps that must be achieved to get this done but damn its been this way for 5 years surely they could do it if they really tried  which i doubt they have  other than this i think all the other graphicseffects in eve are great fix this and it wld be sweeeet

i consider this and indeed anything out of game that provides the same functionality to be an exploit i hope ccp agree
make assault frigs capable of jumping with them perhaps and you kill two birds with one stone
black ops definitely need better base jump range considering the fact they can only jump to someone with a covert cyno that requires high enough skills to be activated current jump range really hurts at the moment also even though its wise not to let them jump to normal cyno fields why its been made impossible to jump to cyno generators  because that would require ui changes
reading this thread im really glad to see so many players dedicated to weeding out macros and other lowlifes that mess up the game economy it seems feasible using not toocomplicated serverside tools to reliably detect macros i would love to see something concrete demonstrating that ccp is aggressively going after this problem and i would love for the csm to get involved to make that happen i do worry about players convoing me while im mining but not paying attention and assuming that im a macro when i dont answer and i would feel safer knowing that ccp has the tools to take this one on themselves taking potential human error out of the mix
ive been known to suck a rock or two
and the fact that a 50 chance is anything but slim is why pretty much all arguments you make are invalid
50 on what planet pal19 mod slots on a raven with only 1 worth anything and only a few of them dropping per kill is not 50and thats why all the arguments you make are invalid
so what are the chances of a certain module to drop when the ship is destroyedis there information somewhere we can actually see what ccp has used to determine how they determine what modules drop and what dont and if it is based on a random generator of some kind we can probably find out what the real chance of loot being dropped it would help to understand what is the real riskreward currently and what would be the projected riskreward based on the proposal and hey maybe we can find a middle ground it wont make everyone happy because it is not what every one wants and does not satisfy their feelings on the matter but maybe able to live with it and accept that it was a balanced proposal
from experience i can say that more gets destroyed than survives always but the exact percentage is random i think as it seems to vary but never anywhere near 50 of the mods on a fully fitted ship normally 2030ishso claiming that a individual item has a 50 chance of dropping is utter bcks
i dont understand the degree to pitch bonus please explain
theres these things called degrees theres 360 of them in a circle

dont count this as a vote against the current chairmanbut if any chairman s up we should be able to make a vote of no confidence
actually no support to this ideia in the way it is presentedyou have actually 9 members so make it this wayextend the vote to any member of the councilmajority wins the vote and the next member to take the place should be elected in the following waythe next candidates that were left out of the council have 3 days to present their ideias again   in case they still wish to run for a spot    and on the 4th day a voting is made by people winner takes the placeas to the person that got kicked inability to run for csm for the next 2 years
every board who are to be taken seriously should have this option
im not voting positive for the referendumin all relevant cases of representative democracy cited  us and parliament   it is not the right nor is it the privilege for the populace to initiate either a vote of no confidence nor a bill of impeachment that right and privilege is reserved for members of the respective bodiesthe populace in both case is restricted to editorializing to convince said members to begin that processtherefore i believe it is fair and proper to have this referendum actually stricken from the forum as entirely outoforder though in actuality it wont be individuals interested in due process and proper order will simply ignore this though as another meaningless entry from the peanut gallery
agreed
dont forget about tax when calculating ccp incomea company also has more static expenses than the employee salaries imagine the  they spend on advertising other development property benefits

so youre saying because someone had the rl time to commit to csm forums that someone else didnt that their opinion counts less than someone elses does its hardly a massive time sink to vote  took me maybe an hour or two to read all the platforms and im a political geek if youre going to get into rl time not being sufficient reason to listen to someones opinions why should you judge forum support so highly
thanks  ok so they only need another csm rep to agree with them well if thats the rule best we can do is see how ccp react if it is presented funny thing is im not totally against this idea but i feel it needs to be implemented so that it isnt just made easy for the wannabe destructors and they have risks equal to the reward again i reitirate my point of something along the lines of a titan with an outpost destroying turret that needs to be defended for a period of time until activation
although i agree with ikar i see this being on the agenda an abuse of power thus why im not voting this has had massive amount of response and reads yet only 33 supports i think the op needs to take a look at themselves its a vanity project
i dunno if it has already been said but really it comes with a bit of background with what star fraction has stood for since they beganthey believe that all space should be free space and that no one should truely be able to hold space this might be all and well and good for star fraction and other people who wish to live a nomadic lifestyle in eve roaming around and shooting at things all over the place  burn eden for example   but in the end eve is a game were tons of people from all different backgrounds and playstyles come together and play for different reasons many in the 00 alliances are more into the game for empire building and the time and investment it takes to develop a region grow it populate it and make it worth living in should not be diminished either balance changes need to be made somewhat i believe but destructable outposts is the wrong solution to the problem of huge numbers of cap ships now in game cap ships and ccps need to balance the numbers of them vs the defense of space has pushed more of the smaller raiding alliances to the back burner making it harder for them to do damage to the 00 alliances that is the problem that needs to be adressed not destroying outpoststhis gets a hearty no from house casimiand i am in no way trying to trash on star fractions play style it brings interesting dynamic to the game a flavor of spice just think you are coming up with the wrong solution to a growing problem
there are a massive amount of responses because people have had an intense discussion  its the nature of how this assembly hall works hell if somebody posts a topic nobody cares about and posts support with their alt thats a 100 record but its the task of csm to look at these discussions and cast their support and advocacy on their consciencethis current debate is an issue that will well and truly meet the 7 day public discussion rule and show significant public support  compared to the support received for the other issues on the agenda  seriously go count   further it was an issue that was prepublicised during the election campaign and received support that helped me win the popular vote say whatever you like but one cannot deny that a   this is a hot issue b   its has significant support c   it has the direct advocacy of a csm repyour allegation of abuse of power is simply incorrect its also somewhat ridiculous to describe as a vanity project an issue that is very important to the future gameplay of thousands upon thousands of eve players who took the time to vote in the recent electionyou might not like the idea but its insulting to the intelligence of informed voters to pass off the key policy of the csm election winner as a vanity issue as this thread shows most actual opposition is coming from a couple of people in a couple of particular alliances but ultimately the debate is ongoing ive clearly expressed the question id like to ask ccp and the argument as to why this should be asked what the impacts will be and why its important to the future development of the eve 00 game are on record at this stage im very happy to commend this issue to my fellow csm councilors and ask that we move for inclusion on the iceland agenda where we can hear directly from ccp what their opinion is on the issue if this really was such a terrible issue and doom and gloom to all outposts and gameplay of those verballyopposed to the idea in this thread  do you really think ccp would agree to it have some faith please im absolutely sure that ccp wont end up cutting their own throats by supporting ideas they think would be bad for the gamemaybe you are wrong maybe im wrong but enough people gave their support to my election campaign prominently advocating this issue that i have a responsibility to try my hardest to ensure this question gets asked thats all thats needed at the end of the day if ccp say no thats crazy then thats that and we have many other issues on the agenda to move onto im not going to sulk and stamp my feet if ccp say no to this but i  and every other player that wants to hear the answer   will be disappointed if we dont get that opportunityand at this point opportunity to ask the question is whats up for debate and decision at tomorrows csm meeting
hot does not mean good people can spend lifetimes arguing about the dumbest issues define significant support you pushed this issue through with 16 votes another was pushed through with 10 now the reps can apparently do this kind of thing ok the case against this was made and ignored facts ignored testimony of those with real experience ignored if this issue is that fantastic where are all your supporters pages of text saying nothing makes an issue hotbutton the game is not at a stage where this should be considered outposts offer the chance for 00 growth growth is good more people increases the chance of fighting knock down outposts and the game slides backwards i have seen the growth that outposts can bring you cannot count votes outside of this thread legitimately it defeats the purpose of this entire forum you cannot count votes for your office it defeats the purpose of proposing other votes in the first place the advocate for this topic made up his mind a year or more ago representatives should be open to ideas not pushing a pre conceived notion at the expense of all others
jade has just done what virtually every new politician doeshe has over estimated the meaning of the votes he has received and perceives them as a sweeping mandate virtually every politican that first enters office does this they wake up one morning and say i won people like me people need me people want to be led by methey repeat this to themselves in the mirror as they shave in the car on the way to work in the reflection off the elevator door in the glare off of thier desklamp they actually begin to truly believe it they propose vanity legislation they jam a specific proposal or two through the process all the while believing that if they voted for methey must want me to do this they damn near demand it of methen suddenly the shine comes off the pumpkin a bit the electorate looks at the egomaniac and wonders where did the man of the people go the electorate hears a speech or reads a post or two where the once humble candidate continues to relish in his mandate to lead and change and champion a cause the electorate begins to see signs of meglomania extreme ego issues the electorate begins to realize what they have doneand so it goespoor jade here feels that every vote he receieved is indicative of support for his agenda unflinching unwavering total committment for his specific propsals posts reasoned arguments evidence to the contrary jade cant hear it the voters spoke they believe in me the fact that most voters vote with one eye open and one ear listening is lost on jade  as it is for most ego driven politicians   the fact that folks vote for names they recognize or names that seem familiar or similiar to thiers is lost on jade the fact that most folks are disengaged and just vote for the familiar is lost on jade every vote every vote is a vote for jade and his platform his agenda he knows this as he knows his own name there is nothing that will keep him from fulfilling his obligation to deliver to his people his devotees among the unrepresented the voiceless the oppressedeither way its interesting to watch and witness i reckon we will have to place our faith in ccppersonally i believe that ccp will not quite view jades 2300 votes in quite the same manner as goodman jade does
i am sorry that no one likes your idea jade  tbf it is a v dumb one though
my primary concern about the move towards destructible outposts is balance i dont want it to be harder for smaller alliances to make a home for themselves in 00  as it is  only the overlooked or most determined seem to hold their space   i dont want 00 to be depopulated through the removal of all outposts but those owned by the super powers last of all i dont want life made easier for those who are not interested in gain or strategy but simply want to grief and destroy for the sake of ithaving said all that it does seem realistic that outposts should have a measure of destruction available to attackers  more than just services   assuming it is a hard enough task to achieve  i would support the concept of derelict outposts external and internal graphics changes to suit no corporation ownership anyone can dock no fees no services no market etc it can be reclaimed through gaining sovereignty and performing major  expensive repairs that will allow players to still access their assets and means attackers need to hold the space if they dont want others moving back into itin conjunction or instead  you might also look at different levels of outposts add a level of mini outpost or super pos basically a structure that does not show up as an outpost can be docked at  given standings   and might have one or two station like services it should be cheaper to build by a fair margin but can also be destroyed that might also encourage smaller corporations to populate 00
while i can see what youre trying to achieve i believe itd have an adverse effectas has already been said  uh oh i agree with goumindong   this would simply empower the larger alliances ability to extend their power through the removal of others means to develop if smaller alliances dont have the ability to grow for goonsrabobtcfrzrmmwhoever showing up and whacking their outposts the moment they get them up then you wont see any changes in 00well apart from less stationsitd be like changing boxing rules to allow killing your opponent  the people who win would still win and theyd be removing opposition on the waythe tools provided for defenders were put in place because attacking was too easy as it stands you can still blow up peoples ships and be a pest in 00 but you cant destroy anything significant unless you commit something yourself you need to put capitals on the line for an extended period of time and with reinforcement timers your next attack is predictable increasing risk further if the defending force can face youif destroying stations was viable what would stop bob for example rolling up north spending a week destroying every outpost in their way and then going back to delve the only thing that could possibly prevent it is that it would mean leaving delve open to attackthis would seriously harm their opponents ability to operate until they replaced those stations and if you take into account your suggestion re wrecked stations with intact hangars once this process starts youre going to end up with wrecked outposts at moon after moon in strategic systems likely removing the ability to erect a pos or another station at that moonfast forward two years of this and im sure you can see the potential for a problem to arisethat aside if youre not a megaalliance running an outpost far from highsec is not as easy as it seems once you take into account sov pos moon mining pos to pay for the fuel for those and for themselves the logistics involved in moving the fuel towers modules ammo jump bridges whatever else from empire and reaction materials back the freighters required to do so the capfleet required to defend it all it adds up to a major headache if you dont have a powerful logistic structure in placesmaller alliances cannot afford to lose an outpost this would discourage people from bothering because the potential for loss is huge i cannot see this benefitting the little guy in any way or encouraging anyone to move into 00 and would potentially lead to a monopoly of power for whoever wins the everyoneelsesoutpostsbeforetheypopours contestsorry cant support this jade
also jade if you look at the votes there are 37 yess to this and by far all but one or two are votes from alliances that do not have stations so therefore wouldnt even really care if other peoples stations got blown upbad idea it shouldnt even be on the agenda this doesnt have support with the community on a broad basis if it did you would have 100 yes votes
i heartily approve of this product andor service
one possibility for solving the pricing issue is to use one of the running averages that they calculate for you when you flip to the graph tab in the market then you dont have a problem with billionisk ravens or whatnot unless someones actually buying them   and if you sell them and then buy them from yourself even with an alt you still are out the 1 per price which i cant imagine is less than the amount youll actually get as an increase in average price unlike just putting a ton of hulls on the market  anyway in general this sounds like a good idea to discuss
broadly support but i think t2s still should involve more risk maybe the payouts for insurance of t2 ships at a given insurance level be a lower percentage of assessed ship value than for t1s
yes standings slots are horrid right now for corporations that run stations more standing slots please over 1000 would be wonderful unlimited would be better

ayealsolet alliance set standing to individual playerslet alliances be able to share standings with other alliances

i would prefer a standing list you can share with other alliances or corpsfor example the alliance put someone on their standing list all corps just say we will use this standing listother corps could use this standing list or you can make a standing list for your space or region and all people that life there can use this listthat would be save much time for example a new corp have to set 400 or 500 standings that would take hoursat least the import and export of a standing list for example a csv file   should be possible

i agree that increased standing functions are important there is still a problem with the 300 cap on corporation standings however sharing lists is a great idea but not one that is practical for all those who would benefit from more corporation standing slots
this is a partisan proposal that will only benefit a small number of individuals whilst affecting every organization in game this is evidenced by the people who are supporting it are all from cva or their allies even if it could be implemented it is an unimportant topic that is unneeded at this stage of the game and there are more important issues to be solved first like sorting out lag but seriously why not having more options here can only help rather than hurt and 300 is a small number given the thousands of political entities in game  seem to recall it was enough for leonidas though p    fully supported

i provide the updates in the thread serenity edits the post to add them to the firstpage lists since i cant do the latter half and couldnt without stealing his password or becoming a gm your suggestion that i do it myself is a bit silly  im already doing everything i can to keep that list updated as for their resemblance theyre both posts on hating afk cloakers and trying to fix the perceived problem thereof the solutions are even very similar functionally  making the cloaker scannable in one way or another after a certain period of inactivity im fully justified in calling them out for being duplicates
duplicate threads suck keep all the whines and trolls  ferenc puskas   in one respective place appreciate the updatesto opas far as the cloaker issue there is many types of war fare and this would be under psychological its not greifingand if you know for sure he is truly an afk cloaker then what are you truly worried about go rat mine whatever i mean if he is really afk you will not be attacked by him now would youhowever if you are really sketchy about undocking that means you can not for certain say that dude is afk he is doing his job set up a trap bait him something instead of sitting in the station shaking your fist
afk cloakers are of no concern as they are afk its the nonafk cloakers that cause all sorts of grief ill edit inif youve got a cloaker in your system and cant trust your corp  alliance mates to get your back you have a corporation or alliance problem not a broken game mechanic

read more carefully in the future before you critique itll leave less egg on your face i said they have few systems relative to their size ie a lot of goons and relatively few systems it points to a style of playwindjammer
my post was about the relationship between attackers and defenders whove had a chance to dig in goons and bob are a good example of this and that is why i used them its a shame you didnt realize my post wasnt just about goons i suppose you were in too great a hurry to express your angerthe recent war between goons and bob is an ideal example of the two strategies you had on the one hand a large attack force bent on demolition on the other hand you had a well dug in defender bob had a large number of systems well developed compared to the number of members they had goons had few systems not particularly well developed compared to the larger number of members they had last i checked membership numbers goons had twice as many members as bob bobs systems arewere in one area goons systems arewere spread all over the placebearing the above in mind the proposed change would benefit the style of play typified by goons and penalize the style of play typified by bobthese are not so much negative observations of goonswarm as they are accurate its amazing how you lot can recruit for practice and even brag about a certain style of play and then complain when someone comments on itmerely because some of my posts are inconvenient to you does not mean they are negative or unconstructive and thats a really funny accusation coming from a goon yeah yeah youre right that last was negative but you really earned it enjoy assuming i have the power to stop your discussion reaonable or otherwise is crediting me with far too much ability however i truly appreciate the complimentregardswindjammer

 i posted this originally in the features and ideas discussion it was suggested i get it into here too after playing eve on and off for over a year i have collected a list of suggestions which i will lay out all together here some of these i am sure will seem insignificant but i think they add up in the endsystem scanner bottom buttons should be on opposite sides  not so close to each other  accidental analyze happens to me too much   left side analyze middle new scan right view result this format moving the next button in line to a different location in a dialog is an excellent method of reducing user error by designoverview fixed sorting by icon does not seem to work between stations and stargates  mixed sort   example system aramachi overview setting seems to reset to default too easily  from saved type  edit location modifying a bookmark subject does not allow pressing enter to complete  must click ok  right click menu in many locations very bad options are placed next to commonly used options  for example remove station from overview and dock in the right click station menu these should be separated immensly grouping with a separator would be appropriate group one ship actions two travel three bookmark info four overview config  remove type   it seems that a good amount of network traffic could be cut down by adding second tier menus to the left panel buttons similar to the accessories button if i could select assetssolar system when my last assets view was all regions i can avoid the all regions querymanufacturing quote the manufacturing quote does not show the blueprint making screenshots less informative sorting corporate blueprints in the science and industry dialog by copy or me or pl doesnt seem to work properly display the current number of jobs processing next to max 8  3 active  travel reaching a waypoint manually could prompt a vocal  textual notice  waypoint reached  containersadding buttons next to the icons details list buttons for sort by and stack itemsjukebox i have music set to zero when i open the jukebox it is always in play for which i have to click stop it may effect nothing but a clear no music would remove any doubtmisc mouse over current time for full datetime  when left panel minimized   the tilde  perhaps only in my resolution   is almost indistinguishable from a minus sign solar system map when hovering over a group of items  bookmarks moons planets   the list will display in nonvisible location  upward overlapping edge of display   how about some horizontal scroll bars  for example on the scanner having to stretch the interface to see the right side is very limiting it would be nice to get the agent show info from the right click menu in journalagentsmissions  and perhaps also add waypoint can we have some ircd like commands in the chat windowjoin channel open new chat window with channel  removing the need to open the channels  mailing lists dialog etc   in keeping with my previous suggestion  a 2nd tier menu would be ideal two items the normal dialog and a text box  perhaps even a recent list   something that would help with bookmarks is to group them by region and constellation an option to have targeted ships remain in their position on the screen rather than roll towords the selected item box would be very helpful especially given how laggy some systems can be target boxes and positional lines should be a color that is distinguishable from the tactical overlay lines colore damage messages according to the type  incoming at least right   emphasize the amount of damage and attacker with bold or color offset allow damage message window in hud  not log   to be single line and fade outanyhow  thats my 2 cents for nowhope dev finds it useful   raylon

but see you arent actually hiring someone you simply have the ability to place a bounty on their head even though this enables people to hunt that person you dont really have anything to do with it youre the catalyst nothing else again you arent hiring other people theyre taking advantage of the fact that someone wants that person dead besides your kill rights eventually expire while their bounty wont  unless someone kills them   also kill rights are only against the ship so if you want to pod kill said person  who doesnt   youll need to take out a contract against them same as everyone else  unless youre in low sec

i agree that some type of tranferrable kill rights need to be implemented whether it be a contract type system  placing a hit on somebody   or simply transferring the kill rights to your friend

nope dont agree chairman should have the right to step down and then a vote thats it
the chairperson of csm is just an administrative role not a head of state theres no particular reason why it has to be the csm rep who got the most votes sounds fine by me
the csm chairs duty is to moderate and direct meetings it is only a first among equals position with no actual additional power than an ordinary council member the qualities of a good chairperson are not necessarily aligned with the qualities that get a representative elected the council should be trusted to pick its own chair it is the voters duty to pick council members responsible enough to do so
maybe it would be better to have the elections like normal then after the 9 csm delegates have been chosen you have another election for chair with everyone who voted in the general having a vote and only those who voted the first time getting a vote for chair
yes please

you can get immersed in a virtual world as well as at the same time recognising it is not a real world or a true to life reflection of that worldimmersion breaks when someone injects something from the outside or some other world into the current one creating an inconsistency that cant be reconciledwhat is truely immersion breaking and a cardinal sin is when some mechanic is left unfinished andor broken because devs never got round to finishing itno amount of rp trickery will ever explain why you cant name a pos silo even though you can name other structures and there is a set name option on silosbutnerfs are also immersion breaking because the game universe is inherantly artificial  this is kinda what i was getting at with my earlier post   in theory all blueprints should be like t2 bpos are now no more will ever be produced and as they are destroyed or accounts go inactive and they are removed from the game they become even more rare and valuable    so you start with kessie mk i and mk i bpos  bpcs and then comes the boostnerf in the form of the makers of bpos  the npcs   changing the schematics to be mk ii all new prints bought off npcs will be the mk ii variety and produce kessie mk iisthus you end up a   with a much more exciting universe with obsolete or old fashioned technologies  they dont make em like they used to   and b   a whole new set of items in the items db every time you boostnerf somethingthis point b   then comes back round to my earlier point about why manufactureindustry will never develop you cant have ppl add items to the db and risk an explosion in number of different item typeshence the conclusion that there are underlying reasons relating to the games core design that means things like this will continue ps same deal with the current generation of mmos and grinding mechanics whoever makes a game that can get around all that will clean up  
good idea the numbers are just off assuming same ship sizes90 for the second ship75 for 3rd60 for 4th50 for 5th30 for 6th25 for 7th and all subsequent ships focusing fire for bss shooting frigates it should be more like50 for the second ship25 for 3rd15 for 4th10 for 5th5 for 6th and all subsequent ships focusing firethe bigger the attacking ships compared to the target the more nerf you get
read the op properlysmaller ships  bss dreads   will be able to gang up on larger ships without penalties the nerf should only apply for samesize or smallersized vessels
yes because battleships have the firepower to take down capital spider tanks
subcapitals have a hard enough time taking out carriers in triagedreadnoughts in siege as it is even if theyre by themselves  i see this a lot on sisi  its doable but it takes forever   and if you take away or limit their ability to focus huge amounts of damage on them theyll never go down  it takes a few thousand dps just to break these tanksif you dont want to get instapopped in a fleet battle dont fly something thatll be called primary
yea she said she has never been in a fleet battle
what do you see that needs rebalancing here if youre able to outnumber your opponent why shouldnt you be able to get the full advantage  and the opponent the full disadvantage   of your numbers
no you suckthumbs down
people focus fire because a ship with 1 structure is just as powerful as a ship with 100 shieldarmstructif you are saying something like structure damage has modules being damaged and offlined then that would be intresting however current structure values are too low on current ships for that to matter
this is so incredibly stupid are you the kind of kid that got double teamed in fist fights or something if any nerf should happen it should be a nerf to the target ship ie being surounded by explosions and turned into swiss cheese by projectiles and lasers should make it harder to fire acurately on the other ships
are you reading the post incorrectly on purpose notice up there where i said dreads should be able to shoot moms and titans without penalties the purpose of the nerf is to protect smaller ships from focused firethe numbers are obviously pulled out of my ass so theres really no need to go ballistic over them
this is an awful ideafocus fire is how small skilled gangs wipe the floor with larger gangsand how a few intys can pick off bssand vice versasometimes i cannot believe this has even been suggested if you dont like getting onevolleyed in crappy 00 blobfests fly small gang ops to appreciate the mechanic you are complaining aboutas far as storylineif contemporary military forces can manage to correctly guage tot and dump it all in the pickle barreli should think things would improve quite nicely in the future as far as target designating for fleet gunsget a quality target caller and do it to your opponents 
i would like to know if anything is going to be done regarding t2 bpos currently i have zero options available to me to acquire a t2 bpo yet at the same time there are multiple t2 bpos out in the systems that under the current system make it difficult to market anything i might invent since those people that still have them can do research and provide a better product than i ever can honestly when you took the lottery away it sounded like all t2 bpos were going to go away apparently such is not the case is there going to be a way to get a t2 bpo in the future or are all t2 bpos going to go away and everyone is going to be on the same playing field as it is now certain players have an advantage and there is no way to even the odds either give us the opportunity to use a bpo to get a chance at a t2 bpo or get rid of all of them altogether the current system benefits those that have been playing forever
i give this post 95 fail for the wall of text and 5 fail for the content
i agree funny that jinx said that must be a t2 bpo owner and trying to save his butt
check contracts because they do go on sale saw a crow bpo up a while back  going price was about 14 billion as for removing them not without at least three years advance warning my understanding is that their going price is about a year and a halfs profits and we need to give recent buyers enough time to unwind their investments accordingly since scheduling any patches to an mmo three years in advance is insanity i cant support this the original t2 lottery was flawed as all hell but its several years too late to fix it
i am fairly certain that my t2 bpos are safe and are going to be safe for a very long long time invention did this thing by devaluing some bpos and actually boosted the value of others the combination factors altogether pretty much assure the continued existence of t2 bpos but just because some people are filled to the brim with the greeneyed jealousy because they do not have the t2 bpos does not bother me a bit i have my isk me pats his walletedit that was a scam you should check the remaining runs and it had 1 crow would go for no less than 2025 bill but they do go on sale yes i just sold 3 bpos myself so yea we the greedy t2 bpo holders sometimes sell our bpos as well
leave the current t2 bpos in the game there arent any more being given out so no problem
no there was a problem that t2 bpo owners were getting to rich and the prices just kept climbingthis was a big issue and the lottery wasnt able to cope with all this so they came up with invention to make the general public capable of building tech 2 stuff this used to be only for a select few now its for the general publicbut it can hardly be considered fair play if you take their blueprints away some payed a lot of money for themand you can hardly consider them overpoweredhowever id agree with getting a way of getting tech 2 bpos as in getting the lottery reinstated at least if one bpo gets lost another would come back
actually most people did not pay anything for the t2 bpos they won in the lottery others may have paid a little more to aquire them from other players the vast majority were won bought and traded early in this game years ago what the op and others like him including myself would like to see is a leveling of the playing field concerning t2 invention were not asking that all t2 bpos be removed from the game overnight instead wed like to see them converted to max run bpcs that would retain their me and pe levels after they are depleted the owners would then be just like everyone else with regards to t2 invention currently a t2 bpo is an isk making machine the owners have made their initial investment back many many times over its time to even the t2 industry out t2 bpo ownership is no different than when nano fibers and inertial stabs were nerfed because they presented an unfair advantage in the game or when privateers exploited the war dec system which was subsequently nerfed t2 bpo owners have little to no competition in the market place because they can always sell their product for less than the guy who had to invent his t2 bpc i cant see why removing this advantage is any different than the two examples above or the many examples of balancing that weve seen since day one in eve
the corollary to the falcon is fine is youre terrible
i dont believe this to be true i would like you to provide some more numbers and arguments to back this up a falcon with 1 x sensor booster 6 x racial jammers and 3 x sdas and 2 x pdp rigs jamming from 200km will imo out perform any other recon even when fitted with only 4 x racial jammers and 1 x sda it will jamm a 4 x bs gang 54 of the time on average i would say thats competitive to any other reconthat leaves 3 mids 2 lows and 2 rig slots for tank and speed mods with 2 x polys and 2 x overdrives you will reach 2400mps
yes with poly carbs and ods you will hit 2400 ms  it also leaves you one mid slot for a tanking mod like one lse2 or invuln2  sb2mwd2lse2 4 racials   at all lvl 5 skills with this fitting you will have 108363636 on your racial mods max range on your racials 16241  and still aligns like a pig in comparison  now if the enemy was so kind to bring one of each of the bss yea that would be the case of locking down each one but the  would not be as high as 54 it would be a bit lower the other three force recons with the same kind of fit rapier will hit about 3500ms and the curse and arazu will be around 3000 and 2500 ms respectively each of the three ofc will have a higher dps the rapier will be able to fit 2 lse2s and pump out about 200dps and move at about 3500 ms so the falcon comes close to competing with the three but falls to the bottom of the list out of the four force recons in this line of thinking of survival ability
compared to whatrapier and falcon alligns in 67sec arazu and pilgrim alligns in 78sec  according to eft   i used the tier 2 bs since they are the most common if you consider all bs it will be 51 the falcon is also able to fit 2 lses and it can deal dmg from 84km i dont see how the falcon have it any harder then the pilgrim or arazu tbh anyway all of the recons will die if they are primaried by a gang none of them are fast enough to speed tank  without snakes   if the falcons get called primary all the time its because they are considered the most dangerous ships and that should not be an argument for giving it a 200km range imo
possiblyif i expect falconsi fly twin webtwin damp rapier with leftover prebalance damp rig it works fine for mein facti have flown that config againstpak while not commenting on nullsec pewpew my experience in losec has been falcons are manageable with a bit of thought simply the act of targetting them preventing cloak is enough to send them warping off in many cases or charging them in rapiervagabondwhatever or having wingmen 2 volley them in maelstromslosec smallmedium fleet combat is generally up close personal and not always tied to gates or other celestials leaving the falcon pilots frequently unable to show up in favorable 150km ranges which leaves them open to counters previously discussed
an idea occurred to me recently and would like to see what the publics opinions would bethis idea was pertaining to having a special type of cyno for jump freighters and suchin much the same way that black ops ships lock onto covert cynos i would think it would be good to have something like a commercial cynosural field generator for use with commercial ships like jump freighters since jump freighters by their definition are a type of capital ship that can go into empire space but the one thing that makes them different from their non jumping bretheren is the ability to jump but as it stands now one can jump from high sec to low sec and low sec to low sec but they cant jump from lowsec to high sec or high sec to high seci thought why is this i mean if one should be able to fly to high sec in normal space why cant one jump that idea got me thinking while at the same time trying not to disrupt the current system with combat capable ships it then occurred to mehaving something like a commercial cyno that would be able to operate in empire and only jumpdrives that are commercial class such as the jump freighter can lock onto them along with what ever future commercial ships ccp puts in  in the future this doesnt disrupt the system as it is set for combat ships so that crowd should be happy and at the same time this allows jump freighters to be more versatile and gives the jump system overall a larger sense of use instead of just being the way you get that big dread from point a to b this will allow those who can afford the jump freighters and use them to use them as best they cani see no reason why this idea shouldnt be implemented it doesnt break anything and only serves to add to the game and beef up the jump system as a wholewith this we will have the horse as well as the cartkaiden
vantras the thing is it is you who are choosing to view every proposal and action on these forums through the lens of ingame corpall this thread is saying is that1   the balance of shiptype used to engage in sov warfare is too far towards capital ships and should be shifted toward the use of subcaps2   blob warfare on a single grid is annoying and lag inducing and it would be a great solution to introduce split objectives so that multiple small gangs take the place of single large fleets3   pos logistics are a grind and constructing infrastructure has little to do with military dominance of territoryyou cant seem to resist bringing ingame politics into something like that which is puzzling because these are completely apolitical points
ok what stops 150 man pl ra goon gangs hitting the same system at once each taking a gate another words each gang has 150 dudes in it and the responding force is 200
id be happy to leave in game politics out if i felt for a moment that star fraction and specifically jade was leaving in game politics out his entire platform is based on his in game failures and frustrations he is on record over and over and over indicating frustration at being unable to take out an alliance or its assets he is frustrated by this because after many attempts he has failed so now we have this csm program and noisyposting jade turns into chairman jade we have the same noise the same posts only this time he actually has an official role the issues are the same jade is the same its the format that concerns meif i saw star fraction or jade supporting with vigor issues that were not directly in its own self interest perhaps i would feel differently the fact that jade is willing to expend so much of his credibility to ramrod through the outpost destruction thing  by every measure a minor point compared to the general brokenness of huge portions of evesays much about in game vs general state of the game motives
and that is the long and short of it i cant control your feelings and perspective and its up to you not to bring your personal biases to the table if you feel personal biases dont belong theres not much more to it than that you will always see ingame politics where it doesnt exist as long as you choose to keep feeling that way
yes to the title of your thread no thanks to what you actually propose in it
well on that were just going to disagree however im sure you will agree that its a bit lame to take a drone boat like the myrmidon and nerf its drone ability to the point of hohumwindjammer
i think rick rolls should draw an instant ban plain and simple after the first half a million times the humor has been long sucked out of it and blink linking itself is a dirty net practice the other side of this practice is that it abuses people who are on metered service mind you i dont expect many of you to give a crap ass about other people given the juvenility that infests these forums but somewhere along the way someone is going to do a blind link leading to something that is workplace inappropriate some poor sod is going to wind up fired for doing nothing more than reading the eo forums from work and getting hehehe lolomfgbbqd rick rolled

great idea we should also be able to sort byisk lost if ship is destroyed  market value of ship and fittings minus the insurance payout  skill points lost if pilot is poddedwallet size  for ransoms etc  resistance versus your ships weaponspilots forum post count  so we know which ones will complain the most when killed  
while that information is available ingame already this is one convenience that combatants shouldnt have i think it would actually disadvantage younger pilots because it would immediately advertise that they probably cant defend themselves as well as a pilot with more skills there are too many potential sideeffects and abuses

why not capital ships means nothing except that carriers may be able to carrier a couple more fightersbut i support both these ideas aslong as they are put in soberly
i see what he did too not a comparable argument to make his point eithercan not support poast needz moar geddon
for us deadly who dont know how to use api to walk in journals we should have a way to show more than the last 1000 entries in the wallet if they came within this week either through improvements here on my characters or ingame
i was more speaking to tree in regards to his comment to you while giving my support to this idea and issue
and i was more speaking to any individuals who may have actually taken into consideration his statement  which was not constructive nor belongs here  
well you would think that however the rest of us think that he supported your idea and then pointed out what kind of scum you arein essence you got stole   your 40b you cant have silence on the matter too
huhthe only semblance of support was simply a minor addition to his post for the purpose of seeming somewhat ontopicjust so he could make his inane remarkfree bumps for a somewhat important featurekeep it coming
agreed some of the ideas on here arent really thought through well enough to vote on purely on the strength of the original post having the discussion on fi to hammer out any bugs before bringing it to the attention of the csm via a vote post in this forumhowever this would need to tie in with the potential to vote without posting in order to work properlyan example would be like thistitle  do you believe that ccp should implement a skill queue systempost one   link to relevant discussion thread  post two  yes without limitationpost three  yes time restrictedpost four  yes restricted to a single backup skillpost five  nothen the vote is placed aginst the option you agree with or if you have a different idea that none of the available options covers then you can add it as a post at the end of the discussionfor example  post six  yes with queue being frozen on account suspension due to nonpayment
i suggest ships larger than frigates and cruiser size can carry multiple pods example battlecruisers two pods and battleships three pods and so on only one person can control the ship but the controls can be passed over if needed i also throw in the idea of people being able to man individual fighter drones on carriers 
sorry amarr    i know you in game too but i dont see the point at all of it so have to say a big no
session changes would make this idea impossiblealso bat country
thats cool anandi just thought it might be fun escorting people but youre right might not gbe very useful
nolag desync who gets to control who is allowed to be in it what happens if the person flying it wants to kick another pod out  what happens if it isnt their shipway too much bad stuff here to even list not to mention it would be pointless anyway
multiple chances at a pod kill per ship i like it
lets give this underused ship class some love and give it a role
ccp have already stated that theyre not happy with assault frigates and that a revamp is on their todo list for further discussion please see the dozen or so existing assault frig suggestion threads on features and ideas discussion this thread serves no purpose but to further spam up the assembly hall
please dont give assault ships a strictly defined role make them combatworthy instead
how about upgrading the forums to be at least on par with ever other mmo or world class companies forumsi think eve has proved it can make it and has some staying power how about investing in new forums
some industry standard forums yes
given that the op cant even support his own idea in the first post speaks profoundly to the transparent inadequacy of this so called forum software
this is a good topic to discusspersonally i think its part of the job of the csm members to initiate discussion threads and bring issues to the council to vote on thats why we vote for particular candidates during the general electionif these people were appointed that would be different but we vote for them based on the kinds of issues they campaign on and in fact thats a valuable way for the electorate to impact the sorts of issues brought before ccpbesides which if they couldnt bring issues they post all theyd have to do is wait for someone else to post it and support it so i dont think it would really accomplish anything to prohibit this except to obscure the intentions of campaigning candidates
not a terrible idea but id allow an exception for issues raised in the reps campaign platform if you get elected to bring up a topic you have the right to bring that topic to the csm table without further approval barring that however this is a good change
i think theres nothing wrong with a csm rep initiating a public discussion on a topic they are considering raising to ccp in order to gauge public interest in an issue even though they reserve the right to bring it up anyway the number of players choosing to show support for an issue is a useful measure for csm reps to have in order to argue for the relative importance of issues when talking to ccp armed with that information a csm rep can make a case  or not   for their pet issue being a genuinely important one to a segment of the playerbase it seems very responsible of a csm rep to submit their pet issue for public comment before officially raising it at a csm meeting csm reps shouldnt be discouraged from initiating these conversations
csm shouldnt start or support threads
while i agree that it would be against the intent of the csm for a council member to personally take an issue to ccp without the support of the players or the council thats not whats happening here if a rep supports an issue in the assembly hall all that happens is that it goes on the agenda for it to reach ccp it must get the support of the majority of reps anyway if its a personal issue with no support among the council it will not progress further requiring an additional council member to second an issue here in the forums is redundant  the assembly hall process only determines whether the council should vote on something the functionality to combat the stated problem already exists not supported
i think the problem isnt csm members authoring an idea i think the real issue is ifwhen they push it onto the agenda when it does not have the required 5 support otherwise csm are also players like everyone else with their own concerns and ideas and should be able to introduce their own ideas however those ideas need to follow the same rules and procedures as everybody elses
and so far there is no reason to believe that csm will do any good no support
a while back with the old escrow system you had the ability to search by keyword for example you could type in domination and get every domination item on contractthe new contract systems mandatory item selection is something ive always had a beef with if i did want to search for every domination item on contracts id have to do a pile of searches and that would take a while as the contract system is not the most responsive in the gameid like to regain the ability to search contracts just by keyword perhaps with the option to select a specific item in a dropdown menu or something
signed on the condition that ccp doesnt think itd be too laginducing i dont think theres a single search function in this game worth a damn contracts are hardly an exception but even updating functionality to work like market searches would be an improvement
sounds functional and reasonable and probably very easy to implement supported
fine with me i would also like to see working filters in the courier contracts like these maximum m3 maximum collateral amount maximum payout
newbs need to stop cryin and tryin to get special treatmentwe had to do it and like stated abovewe had to train to lvl5 on basicsyour already saving well over a month training and that isnt good enough for yanext youll cry that you should get bs lvl4 and a free tier2 bs w a new toon
you should try it theyre pretty good at probing and tackling safespotted battleships
actually if you read the csm documents you will see that members are to discuss and debate issues put to them by players or supported by a representative  via issue thread   then to vote on each issuejade has stated that they will discuss each issue in iceland with ccp not that the representatives will discuss each of the 60 issues in the csm meetingits important to have issues seperate and not all put together so that the representatives can clearly see the arguments for and against issue and also see the support for an issue  not for 35 of the 65 issues etc  i agree that many issues touch on others however this does not mean that the procedure should be circumvented in the interests of short meetings etc the representatives stood knowing that it will take a considerable amount of their time take carearithron
lol do you think ccp actually read the features and discusions forum i dont think ive ever seen a ccp reply for anything good is why many post their annoyances in general discussion shipsmodules and the assembly hall etc so they may just may get looked at  but still probably wont coz ccp dont give a sht about important things liked crap citadel torps the pilgrim the nighthawk etc which all need love theyd all rather say wow ambulation is coming isnt that coooool   
i think the market system needs some more love and more featuresfirst when changing a market order i want to change the runtime of it too very often i use a wrong run time eg 24h i dont know why the shortest order time is default anyway most people want 90daysalso i think a 5min delay for changing orders is too long in jita i get beaten in price ten times in this time framei would like some more structure in my orders too something like the market cathegories  ships ammunition etcpp   and a search function and please seperate buy and sellorders it makes no sense to have both in one window and just wastes half of my screenalso if i see on market an item for 100isk but then i put up an buyorder for 200isk then i should get the item for 100isk but i still pay 200isk this is not how a market workson the other hand it sucks to get beaten by centpeddlers eg a price war which runs like 10000000 then 999999999 then 999999998 either limit changes to at least 05 of the volume or make changing an order much more expensivegimme

hmmphso noone cares about this coz theyve already got used to it and its not a priority to them very dissapointingthink back to when u were first starting the gameu shoot at ur target and it misses but u see the graphics show it hitur like wtf thats really lamethe same goes when missiles just come outta nowhere i think many a missile boatist would have been very dissapointed when they first saw this lame graphicthis is something that is really quite wrong with the game a proffesional game eradicates stuff like this eve is a proffesional game why hasnt it happened yetedit typos
i agree we need to see the missile hardpoints
sp gain not so sure about dont think it is that detrimental to the game even if it makes sense  or rather doesnt make sense you still train skills after account expires  but should definitely stop rp accumulating on dead accounts research points are free isk imo and break the game anyway
i dont have datacore farming expired accounts so you have stated something that are obvious lieif you want natural example of the way you want eve to go with your suggestion go play ragnarek online lineage 2 or even diablo 2  easily obtainable nowadays and not required internet connection  i may only guess how fast youll run away from these natural examples
i can understand the price change and thats ok but please give us the old 30 and 90 day gtcs back life goes on even without those yes but some variation would be really nice especially if you are running many accounts

thisll be a good test to see if the csm actually has any power or not pretty overwhelming support here on an issue that requires no coding or anything else if ccp ignore this one might as well write off the council now
you dont understand the role of csm   it not intended to be a power even if yes it is power against players not developersit is a pillow that are used to mute voices if you hold it long enough you may even kill your opponent
i agree this is a case where the csm would not only be useful but critical if they cant do anything about it or at least get a clear statement well just as well fire them because obviously then theyre totally useless to the community  im not saying that they are im saying that they are if ccp denies the subject

of the 9 kill mails i have it looks 50 is fairly accurate will check kill mail boards right nowseems 50 loot drop is fairly common on kill mails with variances of course where only 2030 survive or more then half 7080 survive
i live in eve and i actually prefer crunching the numbers the entire game is based on over mindlessly ganking and making an idiot out of myself fighting a fight based on epic fail at math on the forum and common lore as well as the killboard sampling i just did both say the loss chance for mods on ship destruction is pretty much exactly 50  and please if you sample too do not count rigs as those always get destroyed and thus would skew the numbers also do not count the lines seperating slots rigs and cargo easily done as those have the same color as lost items at least on our kb  and just to waste a little education on you how many modules a ship has fitted does in no way change the chance of an individual mod dropping it is a 50 chance either way to illustrate it you can toss one coin 1000 times and then toss that coin with 20 others 1000 times in both cases you will get roughly 500 heads and 500 tails from that particular coin this actually had to be explained to another suicide ganker not too long ago as well which does give quite an insight into you guys understanding of game mechanicsof course there will be variance and it might even be that you never get the good stuff but then that is due to you having extreme bad luck too small sample size or both personally i have the opposite if i lose something and actually get to retrieve my loot the more valuable things survive more often than not this variance phenomenon doesnt change the base chance though
fixed that for yayour coin example has nothing resembling the truth about suicide ganking and how often the high value mods drop other than on paper your point about make suicide ganking more difficult is really make suicide ganking pointless unless a ship is fitted with several high value isk items  500 mil  1 bil   or its not worth it as any ship with the standard caldari navy stuff fitted will not be worth going after at all without insurancethink of ganking like ratting sometimes you get a normal drop that covers your costs and maybe makes you a few mil each but now and again a high value faction rat comes along and actually drops a module that gives you a nice payday say 200 or so million each if it was as easy and as profitable as you claim it would be going on in every high lvl mission system every day 237 but the fact is its notin fact we have moved onto ganking freighters as its a bit easier if you go for those loaded with lots of varied items because of how the loot drops although it takes a lot more of us to do

you got that right at least i think it wrong that people should be subject to others pretty much destroying their entire gaming experience  ab  using unreasonable game mechanics unless these people really beg for it  like with 2 bil  setups  and your comparing ratting to suiciding shows how you really think to you highsec players are merely content no different from npcs and the only reason you fight for suiciding spewing forth tons of failures at math and at understanding the game  or intentional lies   is so you can keep on harvesting this content personally i find that disposition disgusting but i guess it is fairly common in eve but while eve is supposed to be fairly harsh compared to other games this particular harshness should not be promoted imhothe huge difference between earning money missioning any earning money suiciding is that the latter destroys other peoples fun while the former does not so yes imho the former should be a lot more viable than the latter at least in highsec
you are missing the pointif insurance is removed then so is the slight risk that mission runners with 500mil or less fittings have and that is the vast majority of them tbhfarming mission runners is already less than highly profitable if you add the time spent hunting into the equation unless you get very lucky and get a  uber faction spawn with no clue how to travel safe within minutes of setting up and tbh in all my time that has never happened to me in fact ive spent hours passively scanning ships only to run out of game time and log off with nothing to show for my time and that happens a lot a real lot actually your problem is you only see the 10 secs it takes to kill the ship not the hours or days it can take finding a worthy targetps got a 24 bil freighter a few days ago but only 4 bil dropped unfortunately and we were camping that system for nearly 2 days see how it sucks now if entire stacks did not all pop
i am one of the targets that these gankers target i do not relish the idea of being that special target but i do employ measures to make sure that i do not end up on some gankers kill maili am not thrilled about this what you are pushing is the removal of the edgy part of eve that makes it what is i believe i have been trying to get the core of what the true risk vs reward and wanting to prove one way or another if the proposal is fair and balanced or what the suicide gankers is doing has any real risk at alli looked at the kill mails on battleclinic random kill mails and found it ranged every where from 18 to 50 no rhyme or reason for any one module nor did i see any apparent special consideration for any faction type loot that would be what the gankers are afteri perused through about 40 mails excluding the rigs and just looking a what modules were fit at the time of destruction and from what i have found is that it is hit and miss at best but now reading your reply you have basically came out and said you are not after numbers nor really care you are not looking at balance you are looking for a one sided solution for a particular player base yours that is too bad really
signed yes remove insurance payouts from concord kills
listen to this guyjust to be clear im not against voiding the insurance what im against is people crying for a fix when nothing is broken id rather not lose the insurance as its a sign that something is broken it isnt all thats wrong is people want bailing out instead of sorting it out for themselves there is no easy mode in eve nor was there ever meant to bealso you need to understand that voiding insurance will never stop suicide ganking only one thing can stop that and thats figuring out how to prevent it which at the risk of repeating myself again is easy
well the idea is not to stop it entirely just to make it less profitable on lowprofile targets
a intresting issueone once side the ganker has already limited his risk due to insurance and on the other the victim can do nothing since the ganker will have scanned his setupsuicide ganking should stay but something should add the risk back to the gankers side just now the riskreward balance is not really there
to be fair low profile targets arent worth it thats probably a deliberate attempt at disrupting someone due to an in game dispute where a war dec isnt an option or not preferred or just straight forward griefing but figuring out which is another problem as well
a valid point but id argue the time spent waiting to find the right target is in itself risk vs reward not a real risk in the sense of word but your time waiting while you could be doing something else is already costing you isk ive spent upwards of 3 hours plus a frequent number of times in a gang waiting for the right target that ultimately never came ill still argue my point that prevention is easy though and that in itself should be enough id even live with no insurance because when you are selective even no insurance only hurts your return a little but ive already said it wouldnt stop me so i dont see as a good preventative measure the whole crux of the matter for me is that prevention is so simple
hey problem solved gankers dont generally go for low profile targets cause they risk losing sec status that needs to be regained from hours of ratting
actually it is more likely that our definitions of lowprofile targets are quite different an entirely navy fit cnr with not a single deadspace mod is a low profile target imho yet under the current system would be profitable to suicide and that is what i think is wrong
your right that our views differ on low profile targets our gangs certainly wouldnt gank that type of ship if no insurance prevented those types of ganks then ill support it theres a lot of suicide ganks happening and im not doing it atm because people are getting wise and its a lot harder to find the right target so its in my intrest to stop it asapbut once again ill argue that prevention is easy
remove insurance  remove zero cost ganking far as im concerned remove it entirely from the game
why remove it from the gamework as a team have fun finding and implementing solutions and put the m in multi playeryou can run missions solo and make isk but the game is a mmo and sooner or later youre going to have to make friends to move on in the game
this part is debatable you seem to think it is important to the gameplay lots of other people dont i dont think its important but i do think having something indestructible is incongruous to the sandbox environment this is something i agree with you on funnily enough the reason i am withholding a vote and castigating here is the methods you have used to push it and i dont think the answer to outposts should be destructable just cause is a good argument cause really at the end of all the walls of text you have presented thats been your most coherent argumenti mean i like big explosions as much as the next person but players also seem to think turning titan mods into monster trucks is just as good an idea as yours  in fact it has received more supports  
i cannot support this if youre going to conquer you must take on the responsibilities of that action outposts offer a spot to rest and recoup when youre far from a friendly pos without outposts all you can do is run run run till the baddy takes your ship keys awayas long as outposts are conquerable but not destructable the losing side can take their time to sell the assets they may have stored in the outpost make the outpost destructable and the losing side either faces the ugly end of a fire sale or wholesale loss the assumption im making here is that if the loser lost the outpost in the first place theyre not going to have the fire power to extract their stuff in one piece inside 72 hours or perhaps never nor are any of the other people who may have their stuff stored thereeve and the sandbox arent just about pew pew theyre about building things that endure theyre about pvp and about setting down roots to say this is mine and its going to cost you to take it and still more to keep it yeah even in 00 building an outpost is still not a lightweight consideration for anyone theres the initial effort to build it and also the knowledge that you could lose it to an enemy who could then use it against you strategic decisions not to be taken lightlyi should save this post to show goons some of them say i post against everything they want here i am agreeing with at least one goon to use the favorite phrase of a prominent goon this is counter intuitivebest regardswindjammer
because there are less stationswait so you shot a station service and it was taking a long time and the conclusion you reached was lets be able to destroy stations instead of hey maybe these things have too many hit pointsbecause the enemy uses the station as staging ground to get new ships fit them and then attack you with themhere is a good example when fighting smash in bwf we lost the field on a gate because smash could keep warping to the station docking and repairing if they got out getting new ships when they were destroyed or podded we took down repair services cloning and fitting podded pilots could no longer clone into that same station and get into the fight without risking huge penalties pilots low on isk could not use the insurance money to purchase and fit more hulls pilots with ships fit in subprime ways could not refit pilots could not repair their ships easily and cheaplyif they wanted to get back those abilities they needed to put carriers on the line if they tried to stage ships in the area they couldnt get them from the station they had to move them unfit out of the station to a pos to fit and leaving ships in a pos is much more risky  no the buffer zones would make attacking for either side sufficiently hard that no serious assault could be reached on either side the people who would lose are the ones who might use the interim space and anyone who wants to attack gs or bobjust to avoid the inevitable adhominem you will launch here i say this as someone who has directly participated in a multiple region sovereignty war on both sides of the conflict in v when they didnt have a buffer zone against gs and ra and in gs when bob did as well as someone with a backround in examining these types of situationswell then now that we have established that cva is not stupid why in the world should cultivation so that their corps and alliances they foster might go on to bigger and better things be a bad thing maybe if the people who want to change the rules so that they can accomplish the gaols they are unable to do without whining to ccp would engender a little good will they wouldnt be sitting in empire with thumbs up their butts they would be living in their free space utopia their inability to enforce neutrality and cvas ability to enforce their will only means that cva is stronger and better at the game not that we need to change the rulescva fights for the little guy so has goonswarm though in a different way   that the little guys like the guys that help them more than the people dont is irrelevant to the discussion
what thousands of players in roving pvp alliancescorporationspirate outfits they way it looks here its as if there are 3 of youyou dont have to you can take the station and then deny all docking rights that is as good as destroying ita note none of this has been empirical empirical evidence is evidence that comes from repeated controlled tests and repeated observations anecdotal evidence is the singular form of empirical evidence with no control what we have here is pure logic unfortunately we cannot have empirical evidence in eve until its too late though we can certainly have empirical evidence of what happens when its too latetitans motherships pos without guns outside of them etcyou can already lose it it just isnt destroyed its capturedonly if you are too foolish to exploit what the station services being down means if you know they are going to bring carriers out and rep it prepare and kill the carriers if they dont then you are causing them lasting financial damage since they cant use the station to clone rep and fit shipswhich reduces the value of the market which is financial damageimpossible the value of the outpost is relative to the time it has been around to accumulate assets and market activity as well as its ability to provide a logistics base there isnt really anything balanced you could possibly add to increase its value since its value is so hinged on having been thereno as long as there is an advantage in owning and outpost that outweighs the cost people will build them if you reduce the advantage and increase the costs you are very likely to increase the cost and decrease the value to the point its not worth buildingdestructability can be part of the riskreward equation but it does not have to be and that does not mean it should bein one of the threads i think it was jades candidacy thread   andor chatlogs darius johnson has said that this is exactly the sort of thing we would do given the chance i have no reason to doubt him
you didnt answer the comment saying that balance is an important issue doesnt make this balance an important issueall the descriptive things you mentioned already exist and introducing more options is not always good for a game a good example would be nge for swg titans in eve etc you mist make an argument for what this new feature is good for the game it is not axiomatic that it does1 no it does not establishing an outpost requires sieging a system and putting the egg down we arent where the hell did this come fromunfortunately for you destroying stations will make it easier for territory holders to reduce their borders and concentrate defense a new alliance will not find it any easier to defend their space but an existing alliance will find more value in destroying a new alliance rather than leaving them there where they can get powerfulif you cant defend it what makes you think they can take it at the moment only an idiot would run away from their space and attempt to come back later when tenants have been established and now the attackers dont even have to establish tenants who might lose the space clearly one fight is more pvp than two fights i like your logic jade
you only have a lot of experience failing in 00 not succeeding this if of large importance when you claim that this experience makes you uniquely able to judge how large 00 alliances will act clearly the way you think the would act is wrong if it were not you would be successful in 00 politics instead of a failurefurthermore security is a payoff and everything can have direct valuation in iskthough not everything is easy to value ergo any security benefit is a direct isk benefit to an alliancefurthermore darius johnson who not only has experience in 00 but experience being successful in 00 is on the record for the opposite though i cant find the quote  kelsin youre trying you exaggerate an argument to make the opposing side look ridiculous then argue against the strawman and claim youre right dont you see how using a logical fallacy doesnt support the secnario youre defendingfurthermore he is not wrong the occasion when we conquered an outpost to use as a strategic launchpad to continue a campaign is an occasion where the enemy would have destroyed an outpost to prevent the enemy from using it as a strategic launchpad to continue a campaign the discontinuation of the campaign and increased costs of continuing it would have decreased the turn over rate of space in this example we might not have ever been able to make a run at delve leaving that area in stagnationand i would like to not waste their time on the hemming and hawing of an impotent empire alliance and their dear leader
booo no way this idea sucks thumbs downand what happens when an alaince has one station left has billions upon billions of assets in said station and it gets poppedthat allaince  most likley small   gets unpolitely skullfcked gets kicked outta 00  almost permanantly for the time ittl take to get back   and many ppl may quit the game as theyve lost everything  including their clones  ive seen ppl nearly quit over losing a marauder imagine if they lost several cap ships t2 ships and modules no to this proposal
although i think youre bat crazy i actually agree with you on thisi know some alliances would roam about space burning regions at a time simply to neutralize it but frankly i want to play that eve i play eve over other mmos because of its sandbox and free nature because everything in it can be destroyed and rebuilt indefinitely i dont believe more and more outposts should crop up over all over 00 in a recurring mass orgy of stations there needs to be a control mechanismthat said it should to be extremely hard to pull off  and possibly resource expensive as well  
in the op the solution i suggest as a rough proposal has personal hangers surviving the destruction of the outpost and continuing to be accessible from the derelict that remains in space  clones would be moved elsewhere obviously  
and again the proposal in the op has personal hangers surviving the outpost explosion that will continue to be accessible from the derelict remaining no docking restrictions  this stuff will be there to be recovered at a time force can be assembled to do the recovery
if they could come back and seige the system long enough to get freighters worth of stuff out of a derelict outpost then they could have retaken said system most likely we are talking about moving freighters of stuff out you couldnt afford anything smaller as you would need everyone defending you could get
im stoopid forgot to check the i support this box
i support this too what if it would be made so that the standings list would be like an object that could be created by a corp or alliance and then be traded with the standings info in it this would enable to trade one of ur corpalliance made standing lists to a new corp in an area and they would then have the possibility to load up that standings list into their corp network they now would have adopted the standings of the loaded up standings listwould save alot of grind for corp directors needing to set standings cya in game soon

totally agree with more slots
yep
agreed it makes no sense that ammo should gimp your setup while only loaded firing said ammo may require extra inertial stabilization or thrusters to offset the recoili question why having and using t2 ammo actually is deemed to be a negative thing anyway most people i know shun t2 ammo due to the negative effects it has on ship performance and capacitorif performance while in use matched or exceeded faction ammo or even t1 ammo i think most people would use it regularly my char can use t2 missiles but opt instead to use t2 missiles for extra range for instance

currently there is a very very lucrative farming method occuring within certain constellations in eve threads have been written about it  though none i can find in this forum   disgust expressed etc i refer here to the cosmos radar site1 unlike most exploration sites cosmos radar always respawn in the same constellation right after downtime farmers who use these sites find the site very quickly after dt and run it leaving a cloaked ship inside the complex to prevent it from respawning 2 the site can be run without killing the npcs because the gates are not locked the final room is usually avoided cutting off much of eve from getting the semiuseful drug bpcs that reside there the second to the last room is the one farmed 3 because these sites rarely spawn outside of cosmos constellations the resident farmers can use the considerable wealth theyve accumulated to protect their operationsmonopoly by any and every means possiblesolutions have also been posted before  and include but are not limited to  1 disable cloaking devices within any deadspace complex2 increase difficulty of this particular complex and include the usual lock gate until all rats are killed rule that applies to the rest of the complexes in eve also move the most valuable loot drops to the last room where the drug bpcs drop also this would increase their usage even if this plex was farmed3 decrease the spawn rate within cosmos constellations to 50 ie 50 chance youd still get this complex to spawn in that constellation and 50 chance itd spawn somewhere else in eve altogether i think the current spawn rate for the rest of eve getting this plex is around 510 if this particular topic has already been brought up you have my apologies in advance but im at work and only had time to look at the first three pages
protip gotta check the support box
ya please  though i suspect that there is a db reason that this hasnt been done already  
do it
yes
i support this idea
drones modules really need new members and some upgrades plz supported
i agree
my god im caldari but i think i have the skills for all of those linksaugs except the 25m3 bandwidthalso for a t2 version of it make it use 1500 pg and give 50m3 get rid of tractor and salvager on the raven and throw in it and 1 of the others give me a reason to train heavy drones v
love your work herschel looks like you actually put some thought into the problemsupported 100
how about a microjump module select a target hit the button and your drones jump from their current location to the target shluld have a very long recycle rate perhaps two minutesand a high cap cost to use
i support this idea
oh god yes the dronebay damage and bandwidth mods might be a bit too much on dedicated drone carriers howevermyrmidon3 heavies with 15x damage  45 unbonused heaviesmyrmidon with 3 inflight computers  bandwidth expander4 heavies times 1514 damage  accounting for stacking penalties    84 unbonused heavies more than a dominixdominix5 heavies with 15x damage  75 unbonused heaviesdominix with 3 inflight computers5 heavies times 1514 damage  105 heaviesthis is especially bad when you consider that the dominix could shield tank  yes its possible   fit 3 damage mods and then fit blasters  damage mods for them toothey might be viable in a less powerful form though supported
if the drone mods are made highslot modules that gives you the option for a true droneboat fit one gun for aggro and then drone modules in the rest of the highs to improve damage etc take a regular fit but without guns and with more drone damage to match current damage output guns  drones
i think as long as there is an exchange of a highslot or something of that nature you should be able to boost bandwidth for larger drones in space i just want that 4th and 5th ogre ii on my myrmidon again    even if it costs me 2 highslots and 200 to 400 pg each that balances out the dmg from what whould have been guns subject as a whole supported but major support to anything that gets me my heavys back
helloi have spent some time thinking on this aswell i have exploration experience mainly in 00 space i came to notice that even a very well tanked battleship could get in trouble while clearing the sites i am ofcourse refering to radarmagnometric sites not combat anomalies or complexes in fact i can run lvl 4 missions without breaking in sweat but more then offen some radar sites have forced me to warp out some may say that the good stuff such as meta drone bpcs shouldnt be that easy to get  btw yes i do live in the drone regions   and i fully agree with that a cruiser sized ship would need some crazy tank bonuses to last through one of them radar sites in the drone regions hence making it virtualy worthless i havent spent much time exploring outside of drone space however i could imagine that sites are equaly dificult across 00 space however it is exactly 00 space wich demands an exploration specialst a ship that can drop the probes and find whatevers hidden but also that can survive the guardians and loot the contentsi was thinking of atleast a battlecruiser sized ship or even larger yes some of you may think a battleship sized exploration craft is bit of an overkill but i beg to differ it is only the battleship class wich offers all what an explorers heart griefs for 1 protection2 large cargoholdand 3 the firepower to clear them rats for goodin fact it is only the inherently low speed and agility that speaks against an exploration battleship and yes i fully agree it is up to the individual explorers to make sure that they are not piloting towards gate camps or warzones for that matter nothing can surpass the survivability of an nanoed stealthy frigatewhat i had in mind was what i called the science vessel  yeah i love starcraft p   battleship sized striped of most  if not all   turretlauncher hardpoints using drones to fight its way through any exploration site heavy tank and a decent cargo hold to store enough probes and valuable loot from the exploration sites
i do believe that this idea is made of much win
i would love to see a tier 2 bc hull class exploration ship bigger cargo scaning bonus and a bonus to cloak and scan probes no covert cloak

from my experience ive found that most fights occur either at close range  0km30km   or at extreme long range  150km   i think it would be cool if ccp made midrange combat  40100km   more viable since that would lend itself to a greater variety of playstyles and tacticsso far im thinking this would be presented by the csm as just a sort of an informal discussion on why it would be neat
i actually have an idea on this i will be posting it in this forum shortly
good stuff rodj this has my support id like to add that this is just one specific issue presented amidst a range of others in this thread anyone who has an interest in furthering rp in eve beyond simply fixing broken amarr storylines is encouraged to offer their support over there too
same for blakes proposalsigned
would love to see this done

i concur
so very very true and sadly sosigned
issue unfinished story arcs and inconsistencies going back to 2003this is about all unfinished stories citing only those you are familiar with is not a slight he specifically points out this pertains to everyone
id be interested to see how carriers could have their role changed
it is a problem that does needs looking at
bah had valid opinion but also given subject matter of op decided to scratch this lol
i agree with this
if all npc sources of minerals  this means gsc and other bpos would have to be realeased finally   are eliminated then i see no problem playing regional trader as in the first post thumbs up
before we get down to the nitty gritty suggestions a brief preamble on why some think roleplay in eve is important relevant and worthy of ccp attentionthe nature of how eve functions where you have one person living in the same universe as any other has had a profound impact on what roleplay actually means in eve online it is quite unique and different from almost every other mmorpg out there it has taken some time but the wider eve community i think is beginning to realize that eve roleplayers are an entirely different breed of animal to the roleplayers they may have seen in the past for their own part many roleplayers dont even consider themselves as such they reject the rpernonrper dichotomy entirely saying that in a game such as eve where everyone is effectively playing a role such a categorization is meaningless this is the nature of rp in eve various entities with rp inclinations have stood up on the big boys stage and proven that their roleplay can work successfully within the greater ingame framework and not automatically render them irrelevant this is another part of what makes it so unique there is no roleplayers shard they occupy the same space as nonroleplayers and they have to fight as hard as any other group to become successful and relevant at times due to the selfimposed limitations their roleplay brings they have to fight even harder roleplay in eve is far more than simply lounging in bars discussing holoreels  it has consequence and adds context and meaning to fights you cannot roleplay a hotshot combat pilot if you dont have the skills to back it up  people will simply ignore you or worse yet call you on it and splatter you across the space pavement roleplay in eve functions in a similar way to the political machinations of nullsec alliances there is intrigue drama and a narrative that grounds  and provides motivations for   ingame actions and everything in between the only difference is roleplay derives that from the eve online backstory in addition to player actions  which is what the usual nullsec alliance draws from exclusively   with the onset of factional warfare there is a huge opportunity to build upon what will likely be a growing interest in eves already rich backstory as the storyline becomes increasingly integrated into actual gameplay and gameplay mechanics so too will it be worthy of an appropriately increased priority in terms of ccps resource allocation right now there are major roleplay elements taking centre stage with this new expansion given this there are those who think it a fitting time for ccp to consider and reconsider various roleplay issues in their game ccp can pioneer new levels of storyline and player interaction here and become even more than it is now the envy of the mmorpg industrythere are countless ways to improve the storyline its presentation and its accessibility these range from the most minor of things to big and bold ideas the majority of the points outlined below are suggestions aimed at doing just that the list of issues below touch on some key points but the list is by no means exhaustive anyone with any further input or suggestions is encouraged to add to them these points were compiled by various people who frequent the chatsubo forum community where roleplay is discussed at length and with passion
small things  news request incorporate player entities more openly it would be nice to see npc bodiesfactionsetc reacting a little bit more to player actions for ready example the republic actually making public their stance on ushrakhan activities silly little news article stuff like that would make a big big difference to the living breathing feel of the game world ingame racial channel motds encouraging roleplay you could also ask if the empire channels could get some form of isd monitoring or at the very least an motd stating that whilst the channel is for general use ic interaction is encouraged and preferred eon chronicles made public retrospectively im not sure whether theyre doing this already but would it be possible for fiction appearing in eon to appear in the library a few months later adding roleplay as a corporate recruitment filter give us roleplaying as a filtering option for the corporate recruitment mechanic yes its an ooc category yes it encourages the mindset of a rpooc divide if you ask me that is a small price to pay for getting more people seeking rp in touch with the right people once theyre inducted they can learn how rp in eve is so different that the category is almost void of meaning
big things  wrapping up longunfinished arcs it would be nice to see some of the unfinished arcs finally finished off  tetrimon vitoc cure amarr emperor and so on events and story arcs adding player influence and making them dynamic let players completely influence the story give them the opportunity to have heth riding around in a titan some day doing fleet reviews if the people who hate heth can manage to come in and kill him then hes dead any plot that is planned has ways for players to get involved and totally rewrite the plot with their actions that would be my dream state though i know it is likely not to be even considered player influence and dynamic events  version 20   a slightly toned down version of the above let us influence the storylines the more our characters become relevant and integrated into gameplay the more roleplay benefits as a whole its looking like fw might let us do these things to some extent so i have hope even if its not to the extent where we can kill the main players letting us alter the main story in smaller  yet still significant   ways would draw a lot of interest who wouldnt like to be part of the corporation that singlehandedly ended the reign of a some local system dictator or some such  fixing the news system issues and suggestions fix the news system better yet rework it entirely at least fix it though because its pretty damn broken at this point in time as one of the more important delivery systems for roleplayfiction events it really needs it there is no igb support beyond the headlines and the stories there change so rapidly at times  like right now   that if you dont log in once every day or two you need to go to the news site oog to catch up on whats happening then when you go to the oog site articles that are weeks old  sometimes even just days when its busy   slip off the news page andinto oblivion archives are nonexistent you are reliant on an rss feed workaround which is really clunky very old articles do not even display on the eve site anymore at the very least restore the functionality we once had at the very most sex it up greatly its an opportunity to really beef up and sex up roleplay and factional warfare if storyline is going to become a focus for the foreseeable future why do we have so much of it delivered in such a woeful medium  forum reorganization reorganise the forums to better facilitate incharacter interaction have an entire roleplay  or whatever you want to call it   section with igs  cas  library  stories  that section would be new   section maybe rename the cas so that its fworiented and used for that purpose  and have any npcs you have for fw i hope do their announcements there    more chronicles more chronicles surely there are others in ccp who want to write stuff no get the community to write again then  more ingame description content more descriptions systems  planets  stations  channels  items  etcyou get the idea ccp doesnt have the time for these things get the community to
using the community to advance rp interests and enrich the game use the community more not just the rp community but really the wider eve community its a vast and almost entirely unexploited resource just because you ask people to submit descriptions chronicles whatever doesnt tie you down to actually using them make that much abundantly clear and then open the floodgates if people could add a little piece of themselves to the game it makes them feel that much more invested in eve thousands of playersthats potentially thousands of submissions dont think youll get an overwhelming response offer ingame prizes  neednt be isk just something unique even something prestigious   offer oog rewards perhaps for people who submit a lot of stuff  eon magazine signed piece of concept art merchandise you get the idea   getting some basic rp facts established how about regular dev chats were people can ask questions about pf and get straight answers or beyond this just facts about the world you dont need to detail every single tribal custom of the minmatar but giving three or four for each tribe would be lovely and there are things where player creativity has no role in things the number names and reigns of the amarr emperors past federation presidents population numbers these things are important for those who take an interest in eves alreadyrich backstory  make the universe have more influence in game terms for example an amarr  minmatar cooperation should be made more difficult given the difference of cultures with the loss of a variety of bonuses  piracy and fight against piracy need a revamp to allow roles to exist for example when an antipirate corporation attacks and hunt pirates they loose security status are attacked by sentry guns and can be seen as pirates themselves so we need better rules to order this somehow for example that attacking a lower security status than you doesnt lower your ss and so forth proposed solution bring the ded connections skill into the game but instead of paying out extra bounty for npc kills make it decrease the threshold at which an enemy can be considered an outlaw so with level 1 in the skill you can freely shoot at someone whos at 4 sec standing at level 2 the threshold is 3 until finally at level 5 anyone with a negative sec rating at all is fair game if thats a bit too tough on the minor offenders you could also make it so that this kind of vigilantism is accepted only in low security space  one should be able to join npc corporations with a good value added for example a player should be able to join empires navies he would receive missions fly alongside other navy ships etc should he not comply he would be dismissed from the navy  joining a navy have its needs  
some very good ideas and suggestions there i agree its a valid topic for csm discussion under a general heading of promoting roleplay in eve online  it probably needs to be coupled with rodj blakes thread hererodj talks about the specific problem of unfinished storylines with amarrian roleplay but its obviously a general issue with all storylinesanyway supported

cheers for bringing that to my attention jadefrankly a lot of things  like the issue rodj raised   are worthy of their own thread but in the interests of not spamming the hell out of these forums a list of roleplay issues is probably the best way to go
now this is definately a very good ideiagreat one kai
indeed descriptions that would make it a little easier to decide where my character was born and grew up or where he would like to live where i could live evenalso im playing a 27 year old but the birthdate says otherwise could this be changed to graduation dateor something and while im at it set the ingame clock to est  110 instead of 2008   or at least create an option to do so or have a place where you can find the est date easily  i had to gravedig through old threads containing conflicting information to figure it out  general support  chUFFFD biko
id like to play devils advocate and just put some across some counterpoints for the sake of balanceimmersion  roleplayto become immersed in a game does not necessarily mean that you cant recognise the virtual world in which you are engaging in as being fake artificial andor not a true reflection of some reality  made up or otherwise  many people get immersed in the social interactions or learning experience of playing a game without necessarily diving headlong into the prime fiction and background of the game that is to say i dont have to pretend to be someone else and suspend my own character in favour of some imaginary or pretend one that i control in the game to necessarily get fully immersed in what im doing in the gameprime fiction is artificialthe second argument is that the prime fiction of the eve universe the stories andf background histories etc dont actually match up to the game mechanicsoveremphasis on roleplay derived from the backstory and fiction of the eve universe has always been a problem for me how to i translate the story and background of my character into actual actions and events that have an impact on the game universefact is all to often roleplay in eve really is pen and paper writing stories and filling out characters having debates about various topics like slavery or the latest machinations of the caldari state or somethingthese things have very little basis in the actual realities of the game thus for most players the most real experience is the 00 experience of epic battles and intrigue and slavery is relegated to an npc trade good itemthe argument is thus that actually ccp are justified in having the vast emphasis on 00 pvp and conflict therein that they dothe game does not reflect the universes backstory but rather the other way around thus to try and change that would need a major game redesign and that isnt feasiblecommercial interestthere is a certain commercial interest in not emphasising the roleplay aspects of a game such as eve it can be split into two partstarget audienceeve is not aimed at the classic nerdy roleplayer  percieved or otherwise   rather there are far more people who are interested and excited about eve for what it represents in the mmo marketin contrast to a game such as wow that does not take itself too seriously and thus appeals to a wide audience eve online caters to a niche in the mmo market for something more extreme or hardcore the actions of the players have a persistant and often large effect on the game universe in the markets in 00 and soon in low sec with factional warfare eve is a cold dark place and as such some things are made unrealistically extreme such as the legal system there is no accountability nor trust in the game two important aspects of security needed to build businesses or empires and it has been stated by many both players and devs that this is the reason many playto try to improve roleplay and backgroundstoryline etc of eve would require making things more realistic  like say having customs police chase you   and that would be detrimental to the game and what it is all aboutcostthere are costs involved with writing the background fiction filling out the eve universe and creating events that players can be a part of and have significant impact on the game universethe 00 sandbox system as well as upcoming fw expansion mean that the storylines write themselves there are no artificial game masters controlling everything and everyone else being on a rollercoasterto try and put that in as a separate layer and as already described not bring that great a benefit anyway and be very time expensive  why do you think the game continued to grow so much despite having little to no aurora storylines  arcs for ages  
controlccp need to be able to exercise a certain level of control over their product if it were genuinely possible for an entire npc faction to be wiped out because of the actions of players in the game then all the work to do with that factions background and story all their ships etc become essentially wasted effort on the part of the dev teamhowever having said all that id still like to see more attention for roleplay concerns even if i think that ccp would be better off just admitting the whole thing is a farce and getting out in the open what the game is really all about
in general ccp needs to look at the resources they put towards their background as it becomes a larger part of the game itself it doesnt need to be on the scale that the pen  paper companies do it but it should probably be equal to a pnp core source book  shadowruns corebook dds eberron  forgotten realms corebooks serenity rpg corebook etc  
supported  and nicely written  
spoon thanks for the input you raise some good points which ill try to address i will say first however that most of what youve said doesnt actually contradict the majority of ideas proposed above ill get into that as i go along though on immersion  roleplay i absolutely agree i think any rational person would theres far more to immersion than simply immersion in the roleplay elements i hope you dont get the wrong idea from me questioning how this is relevant however nobody is suggesting that immersion via roleplay take primacy over those other more important elements i believe the general consensus is more simply that it should be bumped up a notchprime fiction is artificial it seems here that youre using the term artificial to mean not integrated into gameplay its certainly true that a great deal of the backstoryprime fiction elements are not manifested in ingame mechanics however prime fiction and backstory is just one part of roleplay if you buy into the mindset that each and every person playing eve is essentially playing one role or another and thus roleplaying to at least some extent then you will likely also view fiction and backstory as a minor part of roleplay in many ways it is that isnt the whole story however if you hold that player interaction and action is the important stuff when it comes to roleplay in eve then you have to also account for the role that prime fiction plays in influencing such things pf enriches player interaction and motivation if the sum total of amarrian pf to date was simply the two statements they are religious they enslave minmatar then would cva even exist at all if they did would they have chosen to expand the empires reach into providence i seriously doubt it the motivations your own alliance has to behave in the way it does are in part drawn directly from the rich backstory of the amarrian empire a group like cva could have lived in a far more profitable region that you chose providence of all places is testament to the role prime fiction  backstory can play in influencing player  and character   decisions you say that the most real experience is the 00 experience of epic battles youre probably pretty close to the mark there  at least for a significant amount of people anyhow   the thing to remember however is thata   all of those battles can be framed in a way that doesnt disassociate them from roleplaying entirely sirmolle plays the role of space tyrant goons play the role of antiauthority upstarts making the unkillable beast bleed this is stuff no content department could ever write as well as the players do each day with their actions this stuff this rich tapestry that players weave daily with their own actions it is a prime fiction in and of itself cva is as much an ingame reality as ishukone neither is more real than the other in rp terms b   some of those battles are actually overtly framed in roleplay terms your own alliance is the very best example of this youre doing more than simply fighting over territory the glory of the empire is at stake theres a more complex context and a deeper meaning to your battles than there is for most many in your alliance make a conscious and considerable effort to bring that out so yeah i see your point however a more broad definition of what constitutes roleplay means that those concerns you have are entirely dealt with  its kind of odd actually i almost dropped cvas name in that preamble when i was talking about how roleplay alliances have walked the walked with the big boys and shown how rp is more than just pen and paper stuff your alliance is a shining example of this mindset now i have someone in cva arguing it p  
this ties into your other point regarding commercial interest when you broaden the definition of what roleplay is  in a nutshell something everyone engages in on some level  then anything that benefits rp benefits everyone that said some people dont agree with that definition and even those who do have to concede the point that even if everyone roleplays many people wont appreciate resources going into beefing out the backstory when it could have been allocated to other things if people only roleplay to an extent then things that benefit rp will only benefit them to an extent as well any consideration on ccps behalf about ways to further rp in eve needs to take this into account for my own part i want to see rp and the rest of stuff become integrated to the point where any categorization is essentially meaningless and it becomes harder  for everyone involved  to distinguish between the two if we can already frame everything in a very loose definition of roleplay then there is arguably the possibility to achieve this over time anyways i hope that cleared a few things up i should probably emphasise at this point that i only speak for myself here
id not describe myself as a rper but thats because ive not had the chance i read the news stories and think wouldnt it be cool to be involved in thatthe idea of freeing a system from a dictatorkilling a pirate boss etc has been done befor by ccp i wish it was done more often and on a wider scalewho doesnt like thier name in the news
definitely signed
the cost would be okay if they actually killed thinga like they seem designed to tip the scales in a big battle where doing smallish amounts of damage to many people could give victory to the other side except that in larger battles it is impossible to use bombs effectively because of game limitations the explosion radius is stupid as well as it is i cant even kill frigates with them its hard to believe that one bomb used to cost about as much as a doomsday perhaps they are made with cruisers in mind but you cant kill t2 cruisers or drones or fighters or really anything with a bombmore varieties could be good half damage but double area of effect would remove some of the impossible aspects of precise usage perhaps wellbalanced t2 options would be okay as it is theyre just stupid
bombs are like bubbles they can only be used in 00 truly a useless anti blob tool
seems to me that the guys here are looking for a weapon that can insta pop friggies and bigger but also requires no real skill to use or deploy what would be the point of flying anything but a bomber if bombs could not be out run or avoided not a lot tbhget skilled up learn how to pvp and stop looking for easy solutions
that is not what i suggestedthe issue with bombs is that they are currently utterly useless and are not used at allbombs in theory should be another good tool for breaking up bcbs blobs but sadly they would never pose a threat in their current forumi presume ccp wanted these things to be useful and if so they need some boost but of course not an iwinbuttonfor the record i have field tested them many times and have also had them used against me
yes please
do it
fantastic idea
general lee horn upon dd activation plz
i have to laugh at this during the csm round table discussion at fanfest 2007 this was debated by experienced guest speaker as one of the key reasons why a council could only ever recommend and ccp would always have decision powerthe example cited was that players would request pink ponies guess you now have a name for your next titan monster truck  pink pony
build marauders no t2 bpos exist invent and build other items where demand far outweighs supply from bpos honestly as long as you arent trying to make something like ammo the t2 bpo effect is negligible or nearly so simply because there are more people buying items than can be made from in game bposnot supported though a better return on me and pe of invention jobs based of t1 bpo they are made from would help 8 me is frigging ridiculous shakes fist
how is living in 2006try doing a little math before sprouting sentences that were valid 2 years agobefore saying that the t2 bpo arent traded and that the current owners have already get back the investment look the sell order section of the forum you will find several t2 bpo traded every day for a cost equivalent to not less than 2 year of constant production
venkul  other sensible folk there is no arguing with people like that really all they are concerned about is the gnawing feeling they have at the pit of their stomach every time they see someone who has an ability to purchase the t2 bpo or already has one what they really want to do is bring everyone and everything to their level since they do not have it unable to get it and would not get it they feel they need to make it fairjust ignore them it is not worth arguing with people who have no concept
delete
you can buy one with enough isk when they get sold so id hardly call that not available ever and having zero options tbqh
it pains me to see people who probably own t2 bpos who probably backed the privateer war dec nerf who probably whined about the advantages the nano pilots had that will not project the same nerfs t o wning a t2 bpo while the vast makority of the inventors out there have to deal with negative me and pe its called balancing cant you wrap your heads around that concept and if this truly an argument from 2006 it is still a valid argument todayand as an owner of a t2 bpo as well as an inventor i can say id have no problem if what i have suggested was applied to all t2 bpo owners including myself
if invention builders were making no money at all then id say they have a case but the fact is this is about ppl wanting or thinking that they can make more if t2 bpos are removed and that is rubbishwill you whinning cry baby invention muppets be asking ccp to give myself and others the isk we could have made over the years we did not have invention you morons have been given a gift that myself and others never had and the first thing you do is cry about the fact that ppl who invested and have been playing the game longer can make more isk than you canyou are pathetic tbh
lol wow stepping on your toes maybe btw been playing since 2004 i suspect you of being an alt if so please post with your main and discuss rather than yell and holler like a little kid thanks
my main  mid 2003 player   is banned for posting cat pictures on caod and i do not own any bpos let alone t2 but if your a 2004 player you should see how lucky you are to have invention instead of complaining that others can make a bit more isk than you canps i do not invent either im a piwatepvper and make my isk from loot
i had to check to see that i have included the fact that i have a t2 bpo myself and would be affected by the same thing im suggesting envious that others are making more isk than i am not at all oh and to others who have posted in response to this post i do invent some of the newer t2 ship and module bpcsill not waste everyones time by repeating what ive already statedcat posts in coad huh thats an original reason i give you a 10 on that
so you think that just because you claim to own a t2 bpo and have made a rather poor attempt to discredit my point by making a alt comment   did somebody use the word original   the fact remains the anybody now can invent and make money off t2 items while for years that option was unavailable and the first thing a few cry babies do is complain that others can make morejust because you claim to have a t2 bpo does not stop you from being greedy or jealous of ppl who have more or others in fact it shows that you are a heavy builder and as such massively biasedgo away
converting t2 bpos to max run t2 bpcs  win
alt comment i am pretty sure ive been posting with my main please post with valid points versus high school debating tactics
t2 bpos are fine as they are now that they are competing with invention not supported
the alt comment you made was against me and my mains ban for posting pictures or do you have the brains and memory of a goldfish cos i do not claim anywhere that you are posting with a alt ad hominem attacks are for ppl who have lost their case tbh but its not unusual for morons to use the you are a alt get out of jail free card when they have no argument against a point personally i think everybody should post with alts at least then ppl would be forced to focus on the content instead of the poster and hisher corpalliance history like you and others whos argument has fallen apart do
im ending this you may keep posting however
good go away and post on caod thats where ppl insult instead of debate and complain and cry about things instead of taking advantage of opportunities that arise and that others over the years were not lucky enough to have hadgo play wow or summat i am sure you can get a job as a gold farmer on one of the servers
ok one more maybe by your own definition you should go play wow i thought it was funny that you posted cat pictures on coad and got banned for it i actually admire that for originality that wasnt an insult apparently thats a sore point with you at any rate fly safe ive posted in several more threads if youd like to go call me names in them too

disclaimer i am an armchair tacticiancurrently midrange combat is nearly nonexistent in eve i think that there are a few things we can do to encourage more midrange combatcurrently these are the reasons  as i see it   why combat occurs at extreme close or extreme long range1viable range of highdps weapons2range of warp scramblers3range of stasis webifiers4prevalence of mwds in pvpthings that we should do howevera create new forms of t2 ammunition designed to give high dps at moderate ranges  4060km   this would be part of a general overhaul to t2 ammunition and should not be unbalanced relative to closerange t2 ammob extend the range of warp scramblers and warp jammers like sowarp core burst scrambler 3 jamming strength 75km rangewarp core modulation scrambler 2 jamming strength 15 km rangewarp core attenuation scrambler 1 jamming strength 30km rangec discourage mwd use in pvp currently almost all ships in any pvp situation use mwds due to the lack of importance of signature radius and the prevalence of capacitor boosters in pvp  making maximum capacitor less important   goumindong actually proposed an interesting solution that would address this problem by making stasis webifier effectiveness dependent on signature radius another possibility could be to change their penalty to something that would be more painful in pvp  perhaps weapon tracking and missile explosion velocityd increase the range of stasis webifiers currently all nonfaction stasis webs have a maximum range of approximately 12km meaning that any ship fitting one must be fit for closerange combat this ties in with goumindongs suggestion covered in point c but something else that is also a possibility  create different sized stasis websfrigate webs 8090 effectiveness 10km base rangecruiser webs 5060 effectiveness 20km base rangebattleship webs 2530 effectiveness 40km base rangei realize that the above changes will affect nanoships and perhaps hurt their effectiveness a bit but it will also give them a greater operating range as they will be able to take advantage of these changes as wellyay or nay am i on to something here or am i just another carebear that thinks he knows whats going on in pvp
if chribba has 100 ore standing i would favor just giving him an ore single issue prototype veldnaught 400 veld yeild 60 anything else and his faction capital sized mining lasers that guy is funi am still hoping for better yield ore in 00 basically veld in empire stays as is and if the region has ark empire gets very crappy ark roids in exchange though 00 gets supercrystalline veldspar with like 56 times the yield in trit it wouldnt be a straight jump it would occur in 5 sec bands in that region 5 above where it normally shows up is gets cut to 6080 5 lower than when it shows up per region it gets 50 boost numbers are of course made up and not balanced but they could be
this game more than many other mmos has some fantastic opportunities for players who like to trade and get involved in science and industrywould be great to see more industrial expansion ideally see something more than a whole economy geared towards people blowing stuff up  though where you get the extra consumers from im not really sure  
have you ever tried to manage corp standing to make sure that only the right people dock in outposts or gets shoot at by your pos or have you tried to catch a hostile only to see him dock at your outpost becourse corp standing was not seti propose that corp should inherent alliance standing so that if someone is hostile to alliance he is hostile to corp as wellcorp standing should still override alliance standing as it does not but i really dont see any reason to make corps set the same standings as alliance just so their poss shoot the right people and their outposts lets the right guys dockshould be simple to do and i cannot see any downsides to this so what do you think
freindly bump kelsin i dont care what your motivations are if any i just had a question
your proposal is illconcieved and targeted towards appeasing a minority  a minority which star fraction is well known for championing nonetheless   that would rather mope around forums ing about how hard it is to get a foothold in nullsec rather than doing what every other successful alliance has done in the past and actually go out and take itthis proposal is as transparent as the rest of star fractions agenda funny that i could have sworn it was going to be the goons that would try to subvert the csm process to their own ends
castrated is about right 100mbit of bandwidth would make me much more likely to fly this ship again
even if 100mbits were given there is a need for replacement heavies  a set of lights atleast also compare it to easily the best bc the hurricane it mounts an effective shield buffer while being able to fit 3 damage mods in its lows its guns require no cap and its dps isnt drones meaning that it does not need to take time to travel to a target while also being more useful under sentry fire also giving it the capability to use ecm drones if the myrmidon fits a dual rep tank which given its bonus it will it wont really have a damage mod also it is very cap dependent relying upon cap boosters it doesnt receive a gun damage bonus as well as having its dps as a vulnerability its not like the myrmidon can just fit a rack of nosferatu to suck an opponents cap dry it cant use neuts effectively because it is heavily cap dependent it receives no weapons damage bonus while also not having a damage mod in its lowsthat leaves the midslots and current drone layout to make up for it it doesnt an extra mid while nice allows you waht eccm fine web point disrupt mwd eccm considering the fact that your weapons arent the main point of damage anyway and drones do autoaggro i dont think locking will be the biggest issue an extra web is nice or a sensor booster but it doesnt make up for the fact that the myrmidon doesnt really have a niche
drake is the best of all bc  sorry i couldnt resist  also i still think changing the turrets to larger drone bandwidth is the way to go the brutix is already a gunship like the ferox caldari switch to secondary weapon type and it makes since that gallente should too
signed id like to see more ingame mechanics support for roleplay stuff people do people can erect stupid statues of themselves irl so why not in evemaybe make them degrade slowly over time so they need a little occasional maintainance  sp  
actually i agree this is one of those areas that clearly delineates the difference between you and i i see wrong as wrong even if im the one doing it it is still wrong but just because ive never been innocent doesnt mean i cant stand up and say it is wrong eitherplainer ive never had any fear of facing the consequences or repercussions of my choices and actions that this idea would be trolled is so blindingly obvious that only moronic trolls would find win in standing up and identifying themselves as trolls they dont think about what they are doing  they are just programmed that way but unlike them i always know what i do and thus i am at that specific moment ready to own up no matter what the priceps just because you are a liar and a hypocrite does not mean others who honestly hold contrary positions are the same as you just as a bit of advice

level of intelligence attack is ad hominem and pointless with youtube links it becomes a matter of trying to remember a specific url sequence or  which is why i said blind linking   people have taken to using redirectorsfirstly i work from home thus what i read is my business secondly i know what to look for as im far from computer illiterate however in my experience ive had to determine whether some poor guy was blind linked somewhere while at work because our monitoring software detected such activity it is very very hard to some times to do so and human resources  even colder hearted people than you   are quick to terminate people regardless of whether or not it was a blind linkme sighs again you think that because someone champions a cause they must be a victim of it stop displacing your lack of maturity or ethics on the people that enter your limited awareness we the rest of the world are not like you thank god for that

the guy everyone has locked is being d and dead in a blob fight the other guys that are being jammed are not locked by a lot of people i dont see how this helps much please explain
im not very good at getting ideas across am i  oh well i have my momentsanyways the idea is if 100 people lock one ship it would reduce the ships sig radius each lock resulting in longer locking time the more people try to lock one targetso a battleship would go from lock time of a battleship to locking time of a pod if everyone dog pilesmy idea is really that simple
i hear in large blob fights with 10 minutes of lag your lock time really effects stuff
you know what your right untill they fix lag not that they just can but i mean one day make it better with whatever magic they are going to use my idea is pointless
this is a duplicate thread  see this thread for the original and see post 7 for a list of suggested modules
it appears that eve players have too much isk for example some of them buy barrage s bpos for 3 billion iski propose ccp creates a ship module that when shot at a station goes through the list of players in that station  whether logged in or out   and subtracts 10 from their walletsin the interest of game balance make it so that only tier 1 battlecruisers are able to use this module this should provide a muchneeded boost to the ship class
supported but not for me
there are words but they would all be word filtered anyway just no
arent capsuleers supposed to have to much isk
i think that the devs should give alty macalterson 100 billion isk in the latest patch with this money the economy of eve would be stimulated bypurchase of capital shipspurchase of tech 2 bposwealth redistribution within the games limitsa boost in market activitythese would also result in a dropoff in npc deaths due to no longer requiring income from bounties or loot and give other players a larger chance to make money which also helps to stimulate the economy

im in total support i dont want to spend time on training skills so nobody else should have the option to train them hell no apologies for the sarcasm  
removing learning is a neat ideawhen it comes to reimbursing skillpoints i think it could be done by setting all attributes to 10000  aka instawtfpwnalotofspinaruffy   until the amount of sp you had used on learning skills would be covered in whatever training you where training  carrier 5 lol  or you could sum up all the sp and just leave it to the player to feed it to the skillsthe disadvantage of the first is that it needs some antisuperlonglvl5skill protection the pro is that the skilltraining is alredy a part of evefor the summing up sp well i cant see a serious disadvantage besides vets not noticing that they can get their sp reimbursed and will send in a pention  aka human failage  
tier 2 caldari dreadaught could be the garudaedit 10 range and 5 damagerof would be too much you would be able to hit control towers with blasters and high damage ammo for example and likely dwarf the other dreads at the job go 10 range or 5 damage and then 5 resists making for the standard sceme of caldari railboats
uh training timeinsane costwhat about t2 titans a neat lil 500bil isk oh right sarcasm
410dont think you realize how the csm works
ive never said that the system is perfect or that its anyones fault i have said that the csm needs to take some initiative and make the threads in here where we can discuss the issues without the ed mechanics getting in the wayit doesnt take any effort except making a post that says discuss this issue in here and then reading it hell you will probably save time since you now dont have to deal with the  in the other thread
you know ive never gotten that out of what you posted in the pasthonesty here is my idea for next yearstep1 assembly hall you post an issue you believe the csm should take up with ccp people just pure and simple vote or a csm take it under their wing the way the system turned out working this topics will have no 7 day period or anythingstep2 csm votethe csm run thier weekly meeting and vote in what issues are important enough to bring up with ccpstep3 discussion threada thread is started for each issue that will make it in for players to discuss what changes they want to see on the topic the csm simply read through it and write down what the players want or suggest if so many player all have the same idea the idea has to go through to ccpstep 4 last 7 daysonce there are only 7 days left weekly csm voting ends and they send off a document with every idea that is going to be brought up to ccp the discussion threads continue but at this point only csm members can pick comments to add to document to be used at the meeting to reflect what the playerbase wants to seestep5 ccp and csm meet to discuss the topics they bring up armed with documentation from the forums of what the payers have said on each topichow does that sound i mean really shouldnt the discussion dicate what is brought up to ccp not if it should be brought up
for myself i split a number of issues across multiple posts so that each post only concerned itself with one area of eve i believe that this particular post is to some extent problematic in that it would have helped all pilots to consider it effectively if the 60 items had been split according to their subject matter into more posts however for this first time around with the first csm there are clearly many issues which we will be putting to ccp for their guaranteed response which are going to be fairly uncontentious and receive widespread even total support splitting it up fully could have just flooded a page of the assembly hall for no actual benefit in the discussions however i do feel that it would have been beneficial for ease of discovery reasons making it easier for pilotsiz
chatlog is up
i cant see how 6 and 7 would help new playersafter what ive seen 5 costs 100 mils and how many new players do you know that have 500 million for a full implant set  not including vets alts  no this would be an extremely bad idea
as far as i know pretty much all of the lol aaaargh lame  aka lag   in jita is caused by the marketi understand that it sucks to be beaten by a penny but removing the 5 minute timer would probably result in a jita where a buy order would take 30 minutes to update anyways
is it possible to listen in on the csm discussions it could be like the live dev blog where noncsm people arent allowed to talk but id like to be able to follow along with the discussions
no  theyve had some instances where theres been rl personal information mentioned in channel specifically email addresses for devs   that they had to redact before publishing the logs since a similar situation may come up in future they cant let people watch in real time
i like the interdepenance i hope they add it for stuff like missions as well a mmo needs to have interaction not be like aoc where you can pretty much cap out solo  or get damn close  
grats fordetails please very confused  as to whats going on and why its posted here  
i wish theyd put an optional update button on the market and not have it happen automaticallyi sell something then have to wait a few seconds for the client to query the server for the new price list when im no longer interested in that item sure it would only cut down a small bit of trafficserver load    but it would get rid of an annoyance at the same time
bloody oath i support the flagging ideato many times has this happened you and your mates risk your ships in battle only to watch the spoils be snapped up by someone else without any sort of repercussions anyways madboy
a lot of good discussion here
i hate the vultures
great idea no more loot gone to carebear bystanders wo being able to do anything
i broadly support this idea and wish i didnt have to type a message saying so just to give a thumbs up and if the csm only ever achieves one thing in its no doubt short lived existance lets hope this is it and yes i know how to use grammar and punctuation and no i didnt want to use any

this is the best idea i have seen to deal with poss as to the people that say we dont need a complete rework of the pos system they are wrong that is the classic ccp mistake they want to fix something 20 different times and it never works stop trying to fix something and make it fit where it does not start over and say how can we make this the best possible and easy to use that is the cheif problem with poss the are way to overly complicatedlearn from your failures dont keep repeating them

there are several current problems with starbase logistics from the perspective of anyone who regularly needs to set up new poss the two most significant of these are simplythat the process of anchoring onlining a control tower and its modules can  and regularly does  take a minimum of five to eight hours to complete this time commitment can not be reducedthat with the exception of the first hour the entire process requires constant user interaction with the game in order to progress this can not be avoidedits worth mentioning that there exist a number of laughable design flaws and bugs in the management and anchoring interfaces  but fixing those is a matter for bug reports not the csm instead i want to focus on these two broader gameplay issues with a reference to the way these flaws make them so much more unbearableissue 1the problems with setting up new starbases begin when the player starts anchoring pos modules after the tower itself has been anchored and onlined each module has its own anchoring and onlining timers before it can become useful guns and electronic warfare mods take five minutes to anchor and a further five to online while cynosural system jammers take a halfhour to online unfortunately the actual process of setting up these mods is entirely manual and breaks down like thisthe module to be anchored is launched for the players corporation from their cargoholdthe player either rightclicks on the module in space and selects anchor or opens the pos management interface selects the desired module and presses the anchor button a green box appears around the module in space which a set of silver arrows that can be dragged along each axisthe player then moves the green box to the desired location on the grid then rightclicks any of the arrows to select anchor hereafter the anchoring timer the player either rightclicks the module from within 5km and select put online and presses the corresponding button in the management interfaceive italicised the broken parts since a typical 00 deathstar will include anywhere from 20  40 modules in need of anchoring the simple process of setting up a control tower can require six or more hours of constant tedious player interaction add to this that the arrows themselves are tiny and difficult to position  only a few hundred metres long   which can make simply positioning each module a tedious and  in the case of players that suffer from rsi such as myself  physically painful processissue 2there exists no way to hasten or streamline to the process of anchoring and onlining pos modules if you want to set up a full 00 deathstar you must return your attention to the game every five minutes adding up to six or more hours of unavoidable tedium that actively detracts from gameplay if we accept that the element of risk introduced by making it take long enough to set up a pos for a hostile force to react the game desperately needs a way to reduce the level and duraction of player interaction requiredi should say that the option exists to preposition all the mods at a tower so that the player need not deal as much with ccps ridiculous placement interface  but this requires leaving them unanchored and floating in space vulnerable to theft and destruction the risk associated with attempting to step around the inadequacies of eves interface are totally unreasonable the game desperately needs at the very least a method to preposition modules so that the player can simply position every module and then find something fun to do for the next eight hoursthe original features and ideas forum thread i posted on this issue can be found here

i was too bored by the process to even read all of the op so god only knows how bored i would be by the process itg  in the game  
there can be no better summation
it starts to be alot of fun when you are onlining 3 or 4 death stars in the same system 5 to 8 hrs of warping between poss anchor online anchor online lol drive you crazy very quicklyi would like to see the ability to online and anchor at the same time anchor one mod and online another or maybe stream line it even more upto 5 mods anchor and online at the same time i understand why the time sink its to prevent mega alliances from insta spaming systems but this happens anyway and for the people doing it it drives them nuts but just because they are going crazy isnt going to stop them from putting the towers upmaybe even a pos layout screen that lets you plan your pos setup then it takes the 8 hrs but does it on auto keeping all the mods in the pos shields until each mod is moved one by one to its place anchored and if the layout says to onlined by the tower itself not a player sitting there for hrs on end banging hisher head on the desk waiting 5 more min for that next array
oh yes last time round i basically stared at progress bars for three days i think that it should take a while to anchoronline all modules but a queue of some sorts would be really helpfullplease consider
agreeing with a goonie
online pos modules killed my inner child
if thats the process then the process needs to be dragged out behind the barn and shot

i dont know why ccp bothers adding huge complex expansions when they cld fix problems like this and still get positive feedback  its not like any1 wld say ccp u suck for fixing this issue lol  
i would rather see a skills que in place then to continue getting sp during expired times the fact is that most people saying this is not a good idea are bringing up valid points but the problem is the chance for abuse  not saying that all those opposed to it are abusing it but i sure some of them are  the problem comes in when people create a second account and train up an alt to sell and make billions of isk by exploiting a privilage given to us by ccp to help with those valid reasons mentionedso a possible solution is that you can still train but at 14 the speed or with something like for every 4 months countinuous subscrption to an account you can get 1 months worth of training on that inactive account but both these ideas would be more dificult than just getting rid of it all together
you should go back to your school teachers and complain you obvious do not understand the difference between speculation and deceit and ill admit that what i suggested was an unfounded speculation but one has to wonder if you do not benefit from the system as is why are you for strongly for it the clearest bit of logic  to what gain   proves that you may not be quite honest in your intentions to be fair you might not have expired accounts  right now   but that you might just be trolling perhaps you invested in matalinos datacore farming warehouse ipo the one thing that is missing is a clear idea of why you think it is wrongso instead of trying snide personal attacks about what you think i want eve to be why dont you tell me what is wrong with taking a critical look at passive resource gaini realize that sp gain passively is an inherent facet of eve a pure fundamental that differentiates it from the rest of the mmo market however ccp already has no sp gain on expired accounts active on eve china so there is data available about the effects this can have pro and con for ccp and the playerbaseas to rp gain i think passive gain and expired account passive gain should be reviewed with a critical eye it is plainly free isk one can and has argue that it is a return on investment of skill training and standing gains passive gain should be a clearly unplatable choice in comparison to active gain of research points the doubling of return is clearly not it since it is far easier and less effort to skill up  standings grind alts on a second account then you simply let the account expire and start again with another account keep up the rotation and you have alt economy of scalethis is not working smarter or working harder its just taking undue advantage of the game by people that dont pay to play any advantage like that is a clear disadvantage to those who do pay to playi await your response and hope that you can refrain from the ad hominem or the straw man argument styles
and how is that china server doing oh 3000 at peak you say lets use it as an example of why this is a good ideai think ccp would try this again  they have already tested the waters with the accidental note in the patches that was intended for the china server  even though they have said the entities are completely separate   last time drew massive amounts of ire from the playerbase but greed is goodpersonally i dont care my accounts are active most of the time anyway however i cannot support this issue as i do like letting them lapse occasionally
half supported yes on the rp because thats messing with teh t2 marketno on the sp because its just silly to deny such an awesome game feature
i really think this thread needs to be split into 2 seperate issuessp gain while account inactive no support for stopping skill training while an account is inactive doing so means that my account will stop training even if i renew 1 minute later and i think its important for people to be able to do other things without getting significantly behind on their trainingand rp gain while account inactive definatly support if you can gain rp while your account is lapsed you can leave it lapsed until you want to cash out you are essentially getting an award for doing absolutely nothing where skill training will eventually expire rp gain does not
ummm if i go afk for like a week and my gtc runs out i dont want to lose sp ok thx
if you were smart you would of spearated the two issues
i stated early into the thread that while it maybe different points being added on the issue is essentially the same accumulation of passive resources upon expired accounts while my history demonstrates my level of smart it also shows that i do things honestly to split the issue by me would be dishonest in my bookme shrugsso youre reason for this to continue is it is a safety measure to protect you from your own faili agree it is an awesome game feature but like i said bringing one kind of expired resource gain into review should also bring the other as wellconcluding my involvement here half support is fine too csm members are not idiots and will see the value of this idea upon its own merits they will also see what is popular of this issue and what is not so the point of splitting it up is really moot just speak your pros and cons and support or not support and everything will be good in the end  just please stop with the personal attacks as it only makes the attacker look rather whats the english word for trailer park plebbie chav

my suggestion is to modify local chat so that it doesnt show who is in systemlocal chat is currently used as a tactical tool and i believe this hinders the atmosphere and game play potential of the gamethis would make space much more exciting potentially lead to more dynamic pvp opportunities and would encourage people to work together more and in new ways it would make space feel like the giant ocean it is not just a series of interconnected fishbowlsi believe that constellation chat should autoupdate rather than local chat this way hostiles can still be located but not instantly pinpointed to a single systemi think this would be a balanced change for the better as though it may benefit a potential attacker it may also benefit someone who doesnt want to engage ie a miner or someone hauling it would make fleets more reliant on intelligence from players rather than from a box full of namesdiscussif you are opposed to this idea before you post i ask that you take this viewpoint imagine what i have detailed in the op is being implemented what checks and balances would you suggest should go hand in hand with this changewould shifting scan able asteroid belts similar to the instances that can be found using the basic ship scanner satisfy you  i believe this was the way that ccp was talking about modifying asteroid belts at some stage   or do you have another reasonable suggestion
im all for this
yeah but who uses constellation chat
isnt most intel posted from local anyhow ie so and so reds in system x
everyone if this change was madesomething has to be done to stop the cloakers scare me people
if a change like this would be implemented everybody would use const chat duh
local is too powerful of a defense tool
i agree that local chat should be changed to the way that tyrrhena described however i think that local chat is useful for new characters just getting the hang of the game and would probably be better to have it function much like the rookie help channeland i know that you would say that whats stopping someone creating new players all the time and your right
actually if you just introduce the n00bs right to it it becomes second nature before the trial is up so at least by then they have one less thing to think about when they start getting into the meat of the gamesupported
lol no if local is nerfed even less people will go to lowsec00edit typo

several years ago  and all of his related accounts were banned for causing disturbances and general eula violations i believe that the csm should bring forward the issue of setting a deadline for when  will be unbanned because it is his actions and revealing the corruption within ccp that lead to the formation of the csm i think that his ban should be lifted by the end of this councils term
he hacked so he deserves to be banned forever no matter the result accepting this sort of behavior just because it perhaps produced results is a slippery slope and a bridge that should not be crossed
1331 torshin lets see if anyone replies first thoughi totally support whatever this is
supportin before the delete
no their house their rules
the hacking that occurred did not involve ccp nor did it affect ccp plenty of people have had their forums hacked from gf to correli to bruce his hacking is not the reason he was banned and it remains to be seen whether it was him or one of his associates who actually hacked the rkk forums
i support this issue not because i think he earned it because how it added to formation of the csm but because i was allways disapointed by ccps response to that matter and because the formal reasoning of ccp for his ban was something alike he put additional workload to our employees which is an eula violationadditionally while they accused him of illegal hacking they never showed any proofevidence to thoose accusations
anyone care to explain the incident in question this is one ive never heard of
he or somebody else broke the rules but he claimed responsibility for it by his posting of the results of the hack therefore he must accept the consequences
posting chat logs of what are clearly abuses of power by individuals should not constitute a life time ban once again the actions you are talking about are not what ccp actually banned the player in question for
if the case is that he did nothing to ccp then i cannot see a reason for them to have been banned ive seen other mmos ban people for items posted on guild websites and such and have always found it to be in bad form ill have to reserve judgement however until i understand the details i cannot condone anything illegal
does that mean you are interested in discussing the matter in the original post
it means exactly what i said i cannot condone anything illegal for a multitude of reasonswhatever actions were taken ccp acting on hearsay regarding attacks which were not focused on them is something i find disturbing should it prove to be true i represent people who have been on the receiving end of claims of denial of service attacks which was farcical at best and i can tell you i dont like the insinuation i dont find it hard to believe others may have been falsely labeled without merit
the results of his findings did not show that illegal hacking was involved in aquiring the information he was banned for putting workload to ccp employes a very vague formulation from ccp which also doesnt explain how a player can protect himself from accidently putting workload to a ccp employee either pin the end every eve player profits from s findings and the introduction of the internal affairs department at ccp
afaik from my limited understanding he hacked a bob forum and exposed the t20 thing then got b for something unrelated  not sure exactly what  
kug gets blown up by bob members and gets smack talkedkug uses sources to get information  illegally   from bob forumskug  illegally   finds out dev cheating helps bob and is happykug exposes thiskug gets accounts bannedkug gets very ed off because he misses getting to play evekug threatens ccp and gets no resultskug uses his sources to get info  illegally   on some other innocent gms  not devs  kug threatens again and is again ignoredkug gets more ed about his eve addiction not being satisfiedkug assumes that the enslaver stuff will get him unbannedkug is even more ed now so he will use sources to out other gms in alliances that are associated with bobthis pretty much covers it
if you dont want to get caught with mud on your hands dont play in the mud i cant feel sorry for bad people getting caught doing bad things
thats just nonsense if ccp had evidence that he did something illegal the would have banned him for that and not for workload and they would have sued him propably aswell
 cant complete my year old courier contract i have with his alt because hes banned and i want my sabres back some day also the sniggwaffe corp fenrir thanks to ccp
free kugu  he was banned unjustly
i support unbanning yes i am biased for being in plcom but i believe that therere many others who have done much worsebob ra goons all of them metagame and have their network of spieswhat he did was to out a ccp employee after he had contacted ccp about itccp had their usual yeah well see what we can do about it and then simply ignored it he risked everything by posting the proof he got banned but on the other hand some wrongs were correctedwhy did ccp ban him not for a good reason imo
free nelson maerrm yes free him
 is the only reason for your free vacation to iceland you should be thankful
for the first time i agree with torshin
unjustly banned voting freedom
supported
the way ccp handled t20 case es me off to this day and banning  was very lame on their parti support this issue
supported
we should thank him for what he did to make this game better
unjustly bannedhe exposed what is most likely the greatest scandal in eve so farfree 
free 
i actually find it quite cute that the reason for the council has gone from oversight to what it is today ive been struggling with a way to get a meeting regarding iainvestigations on the agenda specifically to learn more about how these things are dealt with and havent thought yet of a way to frame it that is my background so id be curious to see how these internal things are handled by themill try and think of a way to work it in as its certainly not an item thats been put forth as a game issue but still a worthwhile pursuit i should think this can certainly be a part of that discussion if i can make it happen
unban him
without  people would probably still get free t2 bpos and free motherships through staged events supporting this
thank you very much i think it is vital that the csm not only discuss gameplay issues that are important to the player base but issues in general as well all know there is much more to eve then just the game itself the csm should be able to debate issues like this one in particular
and kugutsmen did absolutly nothing illegal
in the very least as a way of forcing ccp to be honest with itself blaming the person that exposed ones flaws is not a healthy step to take in the process of removing those flaws and bringing it up in the very committee that was formed because of it would be rather fitting its pretty easy to demonize  but its not ccps position to police what rules or standards someone allegedly violates outside the game just the rules in the eula to put it in simpler much more drastic terms nobody in the history of the game other the kugu has been banned for allegedly breaking a law in real life and the punishment was handed out for the crime without an investigation that a real lawbreaker would getnot liking someone is not a legitimate reason to ban
fully support bring kugu back
unbanning might undo some of the pr damage this has caused ccp if ccp does this right they can put a huge positive spin on this unbanning
you shouldnt get banned for exposing unjust dev behavior ill say unban the fella

after reading the story on eve tribune i support this the council should definitely try to get some response from ccp on this from what i read ccp handled this whole matter poorly
free kugutusmen
always thought getting banned for what he did was out of order
he is banned because he was upsetting people at ccp not for any game reason dont for one second think it was because he acted illegally in any way towards ccpas a direct result of his discoveries possible lines of corruption were removed additional communications between ccp and the playerbase were implemented i think as a community we should be thanking him even if you disagree with his methods
all the dude wanted was his rug back
being banned for exposing those who cheatrd was out of order in the first place
he did the community a favor and was banned because it was inconvient to the devs
agreed however would like a clarification as to it being a special case or not  else i think there will be an influx of these cases
dude did a good thing for this community
supporting this
free kugutusmen
kugutusmen is a fighter for da ppl and ppl want him free
supporting this
im ofcourse biased due to my corp but ive also heard both sides of the story which put the press releases by ccp and the bob caodpropaganda back then in a whole different lightthe banning of  has been a blemish on ccps reputation one which almost made me quit this game the way they have handled the whole issue has been utterly unprofessional and by unbanning  they can make a gesture to the playerbase that their stance on the matter was suboptimal in the past and that they have now changed their waysthanks for starting this initiative torshin
dariuswhile i cant currently find the post ccp xhagen said in a post early on in the csm discussion that if the csm asked he would get ia to show up good luck
supportedunban him immediately and end this grievous miscarriage of justice especially given the cheaters and those that profitted from their actions werent punished in the least its ridiculous that a whistleblower took the only fall
okay my ignorance is apparently just the guys name because i certainly know of the incident in question yeah this ban is bs and he ought to get his account back
personally i dont know enough details on if his ban was just or not all i can find on the internet  including wikipedia   is that he was banned for creating workload i support that he ether get unbanned or a just reason be provided as this is a blemish on a company who has created an amasing game
supporting this
supporting this what ever happened to that ccp employee prob works in the petition deptjust quoting that cause bb is ing awesomeedited to include the stupid thumbs up thing
never ccp handed him a ban the ban stays they are under no obligation to allow anyone to play thier game if they so chose and frankly peeing in the sandbox just makes it moist for everyone
i support this product andor service
agreed its about time ccp corrects their kneejerk reaction and banning

how about you just start another skill then problem resolved anyone has anything to add
do want
considering yesterdays past events i now support this
supporting this
this seems necessary now
fiasco its quite sad that he couldnt even hide his bias while acting as a chairman i understand during the discussions but its totally not cool to be so biased while acting as chairman
after his actions in the most recent meeting im signing this
jades off the reservation and needs to be reigned in
i abstain that counts as a vote of support
i dont think i even need to say anything after the unprofessional bs that jade showed in the last meeting something needs to change wow this thread has more supports than jades big thread about blowing up stations hmm  
im fairly suprised that one even hit the meeting while i would like to discuss the options or things which could have the same effect i think that the amount of support shown is waaay too low to even justify it reaching the agendawhile i did vote aye since it reached the agenda i still think it was incorrect for it to even reach the agenda some issues were much more important and would be of much more interest to the average player
i was surprised myself perhaps there needs to be clarification on the minimum required support for an issue to make it to a formal vote
its pretty clear asis  unless one of these threads hits 11000 thumbs its a straw poll and no more its csm member support that dictates agenda appearances not public support now theyd have to be idiots to ignore public support generally but ill even accept it in the case of platform commitments which is what that issue was i cant tell you offhand what the other 8 successful platforms were but if other reps want to ram through their main election issues onto the agenda even with low levels of support i see nothing wrong with that frankly theyd be disenfranchising their voters if they didnt
as much as i think darius was also out of line jade is just plain crazykick them both and restore balance and peace to the council
jade is a useless moron with delusions of grandeur get him off my council
i have nothing but the utmost faith in jade constantine
welp he was just as delusional as i feared he would be
hes off his rocker
jade you are a total rear end in a top hat i support your removal
i agree with a gs member uh oh
thumbs up for hamlet
i dont know how this is supposed to be surprising but vov
ugh the goons are ruining this game with their skilless blob warfare and constant undermining of the csmi mean come on guys ccp try to do something new and unique and the red goon federation has to go  all over them for it
yeah
why is it 99 goonswarm members doing thumbs up in this thread and barely no others
because while most alliances have a small segment that browse forums avidely goons coming from somethingawfulcom forums all tend to do this so theres more of us than your average alliance   
maybe the other people posting in the thread are incapable of reading a chatlog
because goons dont like having anyone other than one of their own as chair of the csm and resent any attempt for the chair to act like one ie moderate the freakin meeting
i want jade constantine as well as everyone else on this council to quit the political games and get to work last night was an embarrassment and a slap in the face to all the people that voted take a look at your fancy elected governments all over the world as soon as politics get involved their productivity drops to near zero as they are bickering over nonissues cut out the politics your egos and your personal pet agendas and start serving the people honor your duties as a council member and work towards making this game better  for everyonedespite the unprofessionalism in yesterdays meeting im not going to support this thread as its yet another nonproductive political game while jade constantine is the one responsible on paper it is not constructive to start attributing everything that went wrong to a single person be it jade or anyone elsei ask of everyone to refrain from pointing fingers and look at themselves for a moment think how you can prevent this from happening next time i have taken part in numerous discussions and i have seen debates that were chaired by people that performed much worse than jade did in the last meeting turn out extremely productive again you cant attribute yesterdays fiasco to a single personlets all think about what happened learn from it and make sure well all do a better job next time
yeah everybody knows that goonswarm has a higher percentage of people that can readive been around long enough to know that goonswarm isnt biased in any way whytheyre the cream of the cropreal peachy keen individualsalways fairthats goonswarmoh look i think that pig just made orbit under its own powerwindjammer
thanks ank at least this is one thing i can agree with on this threadbest regardswindjammer
but alliance pilots are only 10 of the eve population 
get back in your corner and sharpen a pencil or something jk  
thanks for the personal attack instead of a defence of jades actions when even his own alliances alts wont defend him you know hes sunk
i was prepared to see how things pan outbut after reading the latest csm log i have to say that i have no confidence in jades abilities as chairman
i am going to agree with ankh herewhile i do believe that the meeting was poorly managed by jade yesterday particularly the blatant and biaised editorialising this is still a learning process we are in effect creating the model by which future csms will operate and that is by its very nature an interesting and painful process i do hope that jade indeed all of us can learn from this and move forward more constructivelywe should not get distracted by the bickering towards the end of the meeting when a lot of good work was also passed if even 50 of the issues we have passed on to iceland get seriously looked at by ccp and resolved then i think csm will have done an amazing job  bickering aside  
let me see i will go ahead and assume that you are intending that this message was pointed at me as well first point honoring your duties its my duty to represent the people who voted me i will assume that its in everbodys interest that people act maturely so that we work effectively i several times told people to move on and i tried to addres the chairman in order for that to happenwhat did it help nothing i was ignored until i called out jade personallyunless jade does take this critism to him i cant really help preventing this i tried several times to make things go smoother but i wil make the same point as above i was blalantly ignoredi really hope that things will be better next time but i will judge at that time
he deserved a chance but showed he is not capable of beeing the chairman
yeaand it feels a bit like ccp have put you all in a empty room and given you some ikea furniture to decorate whit but not given you any assembly plans so its gonna take some time for you guys to put it all toghterbut i think you will fix itif not get hammer and nails and some super glue
 repost from jita park   as to the general complaints about muting raised here i stand 100 behind what i did and id do exactly the same next time to any csm member who ignores 2 formal warnings on disruptive behaviour im expecting certain rules of courtesy from csm members in council and these need to be respected if this process is going to go anywhereits been established that raising a hand  in channel is to be used to indicate a desire to speak from there the chair recognizes individuals by name and they speak in order as called once weve moved to a vote on an issue it is not appropriate to continue debating against the notion of the vote  clarification can be asked for its considered respectful behaviour to listen to clarification while its being givennow text based meetings of this sort are extremely challenging  there is no verbal queue no eye contact and very little peer pressure on members of the council to behave properly yesterdays session is an example of what happens when moderation from the chair is not followed we managed to get through the agenda by pure force of will and stubborn resolve on the part of the csm officers however  if wed ended on time  items 6 to 17 on the agenda would not have been heardbut it does show there are problems im pretty unhappy with the ingame chat system and its functionality in this medium the mute function does not work as it should do the word limits mean that statements are broken up and its too easy for people to interrupt and break the flow of meaning id personally be much happier with a voice meeting or even using irc chat where the moderation functions work correctlyend of the day though that agenda was discussed and resolved and what needed clarifying got clarified i repeat im a 100 behind the moderation decisions taken and will do exactly the same thing next time if people refuse to respect the process of the meeting and keep crosstalking and interrupting and behaving disruptively
so how will you be voting on this issue when it comes up in the next meeting jadeif it doesnt come up at the next meeting id imagine that your position will only become more untenable
the institution of a vote of no confidence in the position of chairperson is integral to the ability of this body to function democraticallythis issue needs to be on the agenda as well as formalizing the powers of the chairperson to control the meeting even deferrence to an existing set of procedures  such as the procedures of the british parliament   would be desireable
well if lavista or bane wish to allege that that ive violated csm processes or suffer from obvious mental illnesses then im going to vote against obviously  unless of cause they can show precisely how ive violated those processes or maybe produce a certificate of mental illness   i guess either possibility is as likely
i have no intention of raising this issue im sure things will work out next time
actually this issue would determine if a vote of no confidence in the csm chair is allowed at all interesting that you would assume that two of your csm members want you removed as chair though
thats a sudden change in position from earlier has something changed to make you change your mind
no i just have high hopes that jade will take this seriously and not make the same mistakes next time
the motion doesnt call for a vote of no confidence in you it calls for the institution of a procedure whereby a vote of no confidence in the chairperson can be called and passed and what occurs once this has happenedyour behaviour has merely highlighted the necessity of such a formal procedure whether it is ever called to depose you is up to your fellow councillors
considering jade has stated that he feels he did nothing wrong and would act the same next time i feel you are sadly mistaken
but im not going to judge if an elected person isnt good enough for a job from 1 failed meetingim sure while jade states he would do the same that probably isnt the whole truth he will think and learn from history like everybody else
the lesson learned from that last meeting is for the chair to be firmer sooner and take a much more vigorous hand in preventing unrecognized interruptions from the representatives lavista if people will not follow the discipline of raising their hand to be recognized to speak then it is impossible to keep order between nine people in an text chat if this happens again ill be inclined to act earlier and more decisively to warn the people doing this and ensure we dont waste time with pointless cross talk and offtopic interruptions while we are trying to go through the agenda
keep digging

talking about a 180 degree turn vista
no i showed my support for discussing what options we have for removing a chairman should it be needed i have already discussed this idea several times even before i was elected i didnt show support for removing jade im still not happy about what happened and i dont agree with the way he conducted himself but i still think he should have a second chance
good people protecting bad people is the greater evil
im not protecting him i just dont think its right to even think about removing anybody at this pointim sorry if you dont agree but lets not cause too much drama if jade does conduct himself differently at the next meeting
if you think being even more authoritarian than you were in the last meeting is really going to help then the meeting was a fiasco precisely because you pulled your dictatorial routine  as the chat logs clearly demonstrate the meeting did go on a long time  but tbh the majority of this was your fault for reopening debate on two issues which had already been discussed as i said in my mail to csm members your points should either have been addressed at the time the topic was debated or held over and put on the agenda of the next meeting to imply that the meeting dragged on purely because of the disruption of other csm members is ridiculousthe more you tighten your grip on a fistful of sand  the more of that sand slips through your fingers use commonsense and accept  occasionally   when you are wrong and things will go a whole lot easier for us alltbh if someone is being disruptive it should be up to the csm body as a whole to highlight that and then the chair can take appropriate action as it was i dont feel that inanna was being particularly disruptive and from my perspective you muted her more because she dared to call you out on your editorialising than for any real practical reasonyou may disagree with my thinking but people can read the chat log and make up their own minds
hardin if you want to help curb this excessive abuse of the powers of the chair  invented or not  please support my motion to include formalizing said powers and introducing the ability for the council to call a vote of no confidence in the chairperson
just when you thought it couldnt get any worsewe have last night a true eve classic in every way can you imagine when the ceo got the chat log emailed to him last night sitting there with his morning coffeeabout 30 lines in you get one giant wtf followed by screaming banging and throwing stuff at the intern seated just outsideyes jade wield your almighty power even morelets see how that works out next step wholesale resignations from the csm board followed by jade sitting alone in a conference room in icelandoccasionally muting himself while he endlessly scrawls i won the most votes on a white board
you might want to read jades responses in the thread on the meeting
jade you should not hand out warnings to people whos message appears within a few seconds of you halting the debate its completely uncalled for in a chatroom setting due to the fact that person was probably typing their message before you signaled the debate to be halted also if someone wants to finish something or have some sort of input on the subject you should give them the floor  not mute them because you want to rush to the vote also dont plan on so many agenda items knock out the ones with little support to leave room for discussion so the meeting wont take 4 hours to complete also politics is fully a part of the csm the csm is a political system you will have to make due with this fact
you will do no such thing and i will not ask for your permission to speak thats just ing ridiculous i support this motion somewhere this went from a council to discuss eve to the jade constantine look at me hour  or 4  
if jade knocked out the issues that had little support its exploding outpost item wouldnt have made the agenda silly
after reading the chat log in all its bureaucratic power trip glory there should certainly be some from of mechanism for the csm to change chairpeople if they lack confidence in the existing one frankly im surprised there wasnt one already it is a staple mechanism of your basic comitteewhether jade should or should not be removed is an irrelevant side issue  thats not the proposal the proposal is to get some form of mechanism for no confidence votes onto the table in the first place regardless of who the chairman is
can i ask what is the difference between asking permission to speak and abiding by a system where people speak in turn
in one you ask permission from someone in the other you wait respectfully for your turn now that thats out of the way i was responding to jades statement that people should wait for jades permission to speak clear enough for you
you are digging your self a big hole for the players best interest and your own please step downno confidence in the chair
its a matter of interpretation to some extent  if people are raising their hands  the  in chat right   and then speaking in order and the chair is the one recognizing each person in turn  then that is a little of boththere was a lot of people speaking without respectfully waiting their turn and thats part of the problem
no let them serve their term and vote differently next time
they are there to fulfill their role if they cant do it competently they shouldnt be there and let others step in
the first time the  was seen was at yesterdays meeting serenity took it upon him self to start doing it i am not going to pretend i give a hoot about anything beyond jades abuse of authority it doesnt have i dont that is what was wrong with yesterdays meeting if we could all conduct ourselves without this looming air of threats and desire for epower then i doubt needing to prostate ones self to someone who isnt in any position of any authority would be an issue
but youre an important internet space c e o how dare they ps prostrate  
how dare you correct me dog sets read only on all forums
youre supposed to say you were right when you said prostate and anyone who says otherwise is either a   part of a goon conspiracy or b   wants csm to fail
i had actually typed that out and got distracted thanks for stealing my thunder
i support the vote of no confidence
csm epen power has made jade harebrained id expect more from a 38 old chapwait its jade i wouldnt
all part of the goon conspiracy to make you fail at the csmam i doing this right
once persons are voted in their positions they should be given peace to do what they were selected to do for the period especially in online environment possibility of bringing up votes for light reasons is bad it will eventually lead in to situtation where no one can do anything because their actions are instantly reversed by a vote next day or even more likely theyre voted to be banned etc instead of crying out loud for democratic mob justice how about thinking new methods so issues can be handled through more fairly and in orderly matter with less personal conflicts
i support this some people dont seem to understand what theyre voting on here were not voting on a call of no confidence in jade    were voting for the ability to call for a vote of no confidence for the chair of the csm
good idea to the op
i believe this is necessary
i move for a vote of no confidence in darius johnson he was supposed to be my black brother but he lied about his skin colour
everyone deserves a second chance
im going to quote this so hard when someone tries to institute a vote of no confidence in the goonfleet csm members based solely on their corporationwhats that you mean they did that already
please note who voted against   and why  
this idea is garbage it doesnt take a strategic mastermind to know this would simply encourage the superpowers to maintain large dead zones around their space
i love how the thread to remove you as csm chair is half as long with almost double the support
do not support
nay
the random people of the assembly hallrecognising the chairpersons responsibilities are crucial to the effectiveness of the csmnoting further these responsibilities include unbiased judgment maturity and professionalismdeeply disturbed by the actions of the current chair jade constantine in csm meeting three and during the time since including editorializing at the time of the meeting and muting an elected csm representative who spoke out against said editorializing further deploring jade constantines failure to take responsibility for said failures as chairperson as well as his threatening of further immature and reprehensible actionsdesiring a successful and effective csm1 calls upon the csm to undertake an immediate vote for the removal of jade constantine from chair2 further invites the csm to duly elect a new chairperson3 regrets the necessity of these actions4 further reminds the csm representatives that they are responsible to the entirety of the eve playerbase to make the csm a success5 expresses its hope that the csm will be more successful in the futureyeah i have too much free time aside from the manner in which it is written i think it speaks for itself the thread for csm meeting 3 with relevant jadeisms can be found here 
heres how you do it 1 get your csm reps to pass the csm electable chair issue to the constitution in iceland 2 hold the election for chair and hope the csm reps choose another chair 3 result
there is nothing indicating in the csm constitution that if this resolution were to pass it would be invalid furthermore there is nothing indicating in the csm constitution that an amendment would be necessary to replace the chairpersono legalese
i support this wholeheartedly
no can we just wait a couple meetings before we act like world is going to end
nah removing jade is as counterproductive as allowing the council to simply reelect chair and members whatever happens ccp will claim it was a success as part of their hamhanded philosophy of player content as king
i dont expect the csm would vote jade out because it would add a whole new layer of stressfulness to their positions if that kind of thing happenned
i have not read that thread but i have read the chat logs for the 3rd meeting and as i progressed i went from blinking to this is  to literally being left speechless and with a gaping mouth how can this person be chairmanalso his behaviour towards inanna zuni  which i do not know or have had no contact   is a total shame along with serenity steele trailing alongappalling and even more so when you realize this is real world behaviour and that has real life names attached to it
the fact a goon wasnt muted or warned first is going to really open some eyes i think
ill add to that by noting that there is no csm constitution its a word that was tossed out and made up at the last meeting there is also nothing preventing a chairman from stepping down as a matter of fact it may actually be explicitly written into the founding document with a vote for the new chairman as an obvious fallback i do not have the document in front of me so the above may be partially inaccurate but i find it a tad disingenuous that one would refer to the documentation in this instance when we can fill in the blanks when it comes to assigning ones self undefined powersin other words this is all possible today without a doubt as a matter of fact that was also mentioned during yesterdays meeting
no vote differently next time
why would you have to reelect anyone just give the person with the secondmost votes  hardin   the chair and give the first alternate a seat on the council
the reelect idea was a jade proposal that seems to be all the rage v0v
frankly all please remove the chair we dont like them petitions should be tossed out on principle as long as there is a mechanism for the csm itself to choose elect the chair of their choosing its silly to have endless petitions from aggrieved players to remove whoever happens to be chair at the moment
there isnt one
after reading the chatlog i support this warning and then muting people for no reason is not right unless there is a valid reasoni maybe just be paranoid but anyone notice this was between two of the rpers on the csmkeep your rp sentiments out of the csm
one person has commented to me that they wondered whether that was because i have made it very clear i am not on the csm as a representative of my corp  alliance and so wouldnt wardec jades lotyou might say that i couldnt possibly comment is all i can sayiz
whist i personally think jade was incorrect for a number of reason to mute you i would like to take this particular opportunity to ask you to leave that area well alone if the goons or any other alliancecorp represented on the csm decided to war dec star fraction for a slight on the csm i would expect most of the allaince would do two things first laugh at people not being able to keep out of game activites out of game and secondly cheers for a free war and whilst you may wish to quote a certain 80s tv show in regards to your opinion on this subject it is quite clear what you are implying by bringing it up furtheremore i personally feel that the ones at fault is mostly ccp for not providing the csm will more structure before deploying it as i think most of the arguements diagrements and time wasting of the last couple of weeks can clearly be placed at thier door for the lack of support in creating this council in regards to the procedural side of the csm if there had have been more of it in place the csm could have got on with representing the people who voted for them straight out the gate rather than it having to spend all this time bickering about simple matter of internal policy
they are not at fault they are to be thanked for not providing said structure were here for the entertainment not to watch boring meetings about pg boosting the nyxoh and a thumbs up for removing jade from the chair contrary to my vote at the election for the entertainment value 
establish a rule of law and a code of behavior before removing anybodynot supported
remove him and maybe we could start to see csm with better eyes
i second this
yeah you are having a laugh to be honest to say wed welcome a wardec from the silly goons would be understating the case there is no force in this game scares us in empire wars inanna so cut the silly insinuations  it makes you look foolish
jade brings up a valuable point in empire wars the enemies can just sit in the stations and theres really nothing you can do about it  in 00 you can blow up the pos and just take the station   i think we need to rectify this by making all outposts destructible
before jade thought he would win he said whatever chairman got elected should step down and put it to a vote after he won he said it was not within the chairmans scope to determine whether or not he could resign  wtf   and that ccp would have to rule on itin conclusion i support this measure
lol you wish
as compared to stealth bomber fleets attacking dreadnoughts
that makes us look discojealous
jade is completely out of control
i hoped he would calm down or assume a more mature posturei was wrong jade really is feeling like he is some sort of god
hey werent you the goon alt who said shed rather vote for sirmolle than me in the election smooth
jade has gone mad with a moderate amount of power its actions to this point are inexcusable
honestly is this some kind of goon campaign to get a goon as chairmanno doubt jade made errors and would be nice when he would admit he did but people act like the world is going to end this happened all after 330 hours behind eve to chat with a group others with eve chat so you have to split what you want to say in several posts and meanwhile others do the same so everything is one large pile of garbage not to mention people keep writing stuff when they should sh ut up and then additionally after 330 hours and you want to finish it people also have the urgent need to try to make funny remarks which arent funny i dont agree with what jade did but i can understand why he did itthread goes to goon level orange next level is red when red is reached ccp will initiate total forum lock down and say it has to do with expansion deployment
hey arent you the old man who roleplays a female sexslave is trolling a tread just because some people disagree with your childish posture behaves like a dictator and wants to change the game to suit your own way because after a long hiatus you found out you cant even assault any space anymore with your stealth bombers and is bitterpassive agressive enough to remember the name of every one who criticizes youhairy
yes im rather afraid it is get used to goon threadnaughts until they get their way
remove ankakarebearfail from chair 0
sir molle is the only true internet god king of eve i will not allow jade constantine to usurp his title
because im obviously a goon right let me add jade is a delusional moron to the op hang onomgi finally got it that other thread that refers to removing a chair based on metal illness
protipi actually clicked on your little avatar and saw that amongst your handful of previous posts there were ones flaming me nifty eh
why dont you mute me about it
welcome to the real world you are not everyone look arround 90 here is goon or alt  which is probably goon alt but hard to determine   now goons may have tendency to post quite much but not this much in the average topic
either that or i dunno heres a mr slippys wild ride of adventures grade idea im just throwing out here  maybe you could post with your main if you havent done so earlier in the thread already that is  oops my bad given away another goon protip for influencing the support totals there boys and girls
i support this i am not pleased with the chairman and this whole situation is extremely awkward if nothing happens i hope the community will choose someone better next time
welcome to the real world you are not everyone look arround 90 here is goon or alt  which is probably goon alt but hard to determine   now goons may have tendency to post quite much but not this much in the average topicgoons have no restrictions on their posting theres no need to use an alt v0vits certainly easier though to demonize everyone else and insinuate theres some form of organized campaign its way easier than accepting responsibility for example
which is the primary reason for this proposal its hard to have faith that someone will stop making mistakes when that person pretends no mistakes were made and its all some sort of tinfoilhat conspiracyfurthermore the trolling jade is currently doing throughout assembly hall threads is endemic of his overall lack of professionalism
goons take the blame for everything regardless of if they have anything to do with itccp really screwed up without setting some ground rules for this sandbox before they handed it off to the csm children to play in now its take whatever power you can and blame goons for anything you dont agree with because goons are bad right righttoo bad hardin didnt get the most votes at least i have some confidence in him to be a bit more mature oh and i support this motion
thats absolutely no problem whatsoever
indeedno because holy crap have you seen our forums and the moderating that goes on there a cork hat would do a better job than jade and a slightly better job than a goon
id quit eve before i joined the goons and id probably wind up disliking darius as chair almost as much as i do you bane seems like he could be okay but im hardly confident of that but given the number of nongoons in on this jades a tyrant bandwagon youd think you could at least attribute it to something other than a mysterious conspiracy and besides  even if a goon did get the chair what would happen then theyre bloody anarchists its not like the role gives them power because whatever power it does have theyd refuse to use
you are a fickle man herschel yamamoto lets see what the future brings
actually what he is expressing is a neutral objective view
not especially i voted for you because i liked your vision for the game i still do  i think theres a few flaws in the implementation but most of what you outlined i still want to see my objections are to your actions as chair not to your actions as a member i havent said anything at all against your being on the council or you bringing forward your platform commitments to the council i just find your actions as chair appalling i want you out of the chair and still on the council  i dont think ive said anything that would go against that at any point i know i stood against the no confidence topic when it was new but thats because it looked like an attempt to kick you out for reasons of personal dislike abuse of power is a whole different ball game
nope i dont this all the choises he has made are perfect but considering what he has been up against  and im not talking about the goons or anything like that rather the lack of support from ccp   i think he has done a resonable job of it biased yes of courseoverly so no not really ill happy tell him he sucks if he does   
i didnt pay attention to the csm or any political aspect of the game  00 wars and huge alliance   but im pretty sure the chairman shouldnt be posting herei thought the csm was supposed to add a political aspect to the game and now that something goes wrong instead of thinking this through everyone just start ranting over iti dont think the chairman is the only thing out of control right nowthis whole thing is gotta be a joke
wait you think its ok when the csm chair applies bais and moderating the discussion because ccp hasnt provided the best tools they could havehow in the world can you make the logical connection between those
well you and i disagree on the issue of the muting obviously i say fickle because it was one decision out of a fractious 4 hour meeting which otherwise place a lot of good issues onto the agenda for the forthcoming meetings with ccp now perhaps you are right perhaps im wrong but end of the day you get the whole package when you vote for someone  im passionate and missionorientated when i get involved in something like this i intended from day one to make a go of this process hence the major effort ive put into issue researchagenda buildingfeedback and driving the skeletal structure of the csm towards something like a working model yes yesterday was messy as all hell and lots of disagreements came from my decision to mute inanna but you know what im proud of the fact we slaved away on a hot evening for 4 hours to get 15 player issues onto the agenda for iceland despite everything id rather have imperfect accomplishments than perfect nothing over these past three weeks weve built up this process from virtually nothing and are going to achieve everything expected of us in the csm docs as others have pointed out we arent making money out of this  everyone is taking time from work were paying for our own beer and going to iceland for a lot of meetings and chitchat and pr stuff for the general good of this game so if you want to sit back and say hey jade as a chairman youre rubbish over a 30sec mute intention to get a vote done at the end of a 4 hour meeting and say my judgment is critically flawed as a result then hey be my guest but taken in the context of the huge amount of effort i  and other csm reps   have put into making this process actually work rather than simply throwing our hands up in the air and blaming it all on ccp and nondelivery of resources and promises then you are going to need to take a little criticism in return yes fickle is not unreasonable
that about sums it up its a bit late for appeasement dont you think jade you put too much effort into denial to stop now distraction wont work any better
i think it is fine for the csm chairman to moderate a discussion as that would be part of the job of the csm chairman as described in the csm document in regards to bias no i dont think the csm chairman should be biased in stating what others have said and i have said as much however the csm chairman is also a member of the csm elected to give hisher viewpoint and as such will obviously have a personal bias in one direction on every topic no matter who they are in general i feel jade has kept his neutrality in most situations with a few excpetions and as such has done a perfectly resonable job perfect no of course not but all things considered perfectly resonable as for ccp not providing the best tools they could of i think you may wish to think about that a bit harder as ccp have provided next to no tools in fact it would be more accurate to say they have provided a stick a drawning pin and a drinking straw and told the members to build a car the lack of fundamental procedural guidence from ccp has led to all of this as is perfectly apparent when you consider what the difference would have been had they provided instructions to the csm in regards to the chairmans powers to maintain order how to use them and how they should not be used  one example out of a many   however i assume you feel differently from your many many many many posts on the issue shrug flame away my dear chap

i only fly amarr and our t2 crystals arent horrible my only request is to let the crystals stack after use i know theyre used but if they could just be stacked that would be awesome
not only gun ammo needs changed but missiles as well as the owner of a t2 fury missile bpo ive been without much of a market since faction missiles came outsigned
quake javelin gleam and many t2 missiles need much love all other t2 ammos could be looked at too
why dont we add or replace t2 ammo with side effects like decreasing speed scrambling and similar that would change whole game mechanics    and put some fresh air imagine missle that prevents your target to warp for 1 second or missle that distrupt lock dont we have bombs like this with area effect anyway something should be done aside some particular cases t2 ammo is useless
the short range ammo is almost universally obsolete in front of the availability of faction ammunition t2 ammo definitely needs a look at and the cost of amarr t2 ammunition too from personal experience sometimes i spend as much on fitting the ammo as i do on the guns themselvesand you cant split one faction crystal worth 4000 shots between 4 guns you need four at least let us be able to repair the special ammunition somewhat like repair 20 reduce max lifespan of the charge by 20
t2 ammo definetely needs a look as it stands the penalties are too prohibitive to see much use
yeah t2 ammo should do something faction ammo doesnt already do i dont care if its webber missiles longrange ammo which is just fine asis   hightracking ammo lowsig ammo highdamage ammo with fewer stupid penalties like make them equivalent on cap to the highestdamage t1 ammo   or whatever it shouldnt just be picking a few higher spots on the range vs damage curve and punishing you greatly for using them
agreed something needs doing about this
keep long range t2 ammo  buff null and tremor a little bit with extra falloff  change all short range to 10 damage bonus  less than t1 more than 30 less than faction ammo   plus extra effects on your targetvoid  cap  eg 3 units for large  javelin  ecm burst effect  eg 1 strength lockbreak no 20s jam  conflag   heat or heat damage  first does nothing unless the enemy overloads second would be quite strong over time   to random enemy slotsgleam  optimal and falloff 10shail  speed 5s  eg 3  quake  scan res 10s  eg 15 e  rage  sig radius 20s  eg 20  fury  agility 10s  eeg 10  balance penlaties  need to be similar to today but more lenient in certain cases   where penalties conflict with the effect on an opponent that should be removed  eg stupid to have sig radius bonus on a torp that has a big sig radius why not use a normal torp  essentially eaech 2o effect is designed to give some advantage that the ships that usually use that weapon would like  blasteboats being able to have their target having cap trouble as well as them ac boats if they choose to close range hurting their opponents speed
nighthawk is still horribly gimped if nighthawk pilots have to use powergrid implants while other command ship pilots get to use damagespeedwhatever implants instead fail troll is fail
looking at your fits i can do naught but lawl ntypes rows and rows of fitting mods webs but no points random or no meaningful amount of hardening i dont know what game youre playing but here in eve the name of the game is opportunity cost and maximizing your strengths you want the biggest guns and launchers and think the comparison between heaviest caliber missiles and heaviest caliber guns is a fair or accurate one the problem has nothing to do with the nighthawk and everything do with how close range missile fits require more than standard heavies while the opposite is true of gunssince your fits are neither valid pve or pvp i dont know why you are so insistent on making false analogies if youre planning on using gang mods you should be using the fleet command not gimping a combat fittherein lies your problem writ large you want everything use faction gear pg  cpu implants or a different ship but dont confuse the issue youre not a victim of ccp get over yourself
given that you dont even post with your main his point is valid you either dont understand how to pvp or all your fits are comedy fitskb link please
ill explain all this slowly as you apparently cant read very well  since all this has already been explained in most cases it has been explained multiple times  1 the fits posted were as close to realworld fits as possible while remaining meaningfully analogous to one another2 the use of ntypes and other named mods was explained3 the use of rows of fitting mods  in the case of the nighthawk   was not only explained but it should be selfevident from the title4 if you have better setups to post using better hardening schemes while still remaining realistic useful and similar to other fits then please post them instead of cryingill use your ignorance and lack of reading skills as a chance to repost one of the more enlightening setups that put into very clear focus the nighthawks biggest problem explain what the above post has to do with fitting as you put it the biggest guns and launchers if you could read youd understand that the nighthawk cant even fit heavy missile iis and a basic  and rather poor   pvp setup  with no gang mod   without being incredibly short of powergridcontinued
ive already reshown with the assistance of your lack of reading skills and logic that the nighthawk cant even fit heavy missile iis the issue has nothing to do with fitting hams again my fits are meant to be as closely related to one another while remaing useful and analogous  which a comparisonbased problem necessitates  a other command ships do not require faction gear for useful fitsb other command ships do not require pg implants for useful fitsc telling people to use another ship because one is broken is inane and perfectly illustrates how clueless you are to this issue and that you are simply trollingill look forward to your posting some numbers evidence or fits that provide some actual proof of your uninformed opinion so far youve done nothing but provide a whiney and unsubstantiated opinion numbers and examples are sort of useful  sarcasm   when proving andor disproving problemsolvingas for my posting with an alt  ive already stated this and ill state it again any single individual  even one that doesnt play eve   could come into this forum and provide some numbers and evidence of a problem and be entirely correct accusing me of posting with an alt  which i indeed am   is a nice attempt at a strawman and an ad hominem but it once again illustrates that you have no evidence or proper argumentps however i do appreciate you bumping this thread and keeping it on the first page further responses from you will also be appreciated for the same reason whether they continue to be devoid of reason or not
no one is trying to convince you of anything merely give other readers a more parsimonious reading the great nighthawk imbalance you conflate the basic problem of fitting scarcity that every ship in the game is subject to into such an embarrassing metaphysical crisis and think youre perfectly valid on all your tortured readings i asked for proof of your fits as a means to see what you practically run not as a means to undermine you as i could care less about your person and you read all my posts as personal attacks i told you the comparisons of ships and weapons wasnt fair or accurate you called me illiterate is everyone flying a nighthawk touting perfect skills if not surely they too must be making some concessions which is at the heart of this thread despite your attempts to remain scholarly and empirical your hostility and consistent oversimplification of general ship parity to mean identical ship fitting strategies reveals that you are little more than a selfinterested partisan
a thanks for the bumpb the evidence and proof is present to be read as many have already donec you managed to use rhetoric to avoid saying anything of substance and you managed to once again avoid providing a counterargument facts evidence proof numbers or fitsd see a
no my good friend it is you who is being combativemy approach has been interrogative from the start but remember you arent the only audience you insist on misunderstanding or distorting my initial two premises and as such the rest of my scheme naturally evades you let me rephrase my point in a different way to wit your fundamental position if it is interested in game balance is backwards initially you must evaluate the practical reality and deduce the developers logic and test those hypotheses rather than abstract hysterically surely it is no accident that these changes youve been asking for havent materialized all your points signify and confirm that the scarcity of fitting is indeed universal to enough of a degree to allow for balance parity unique costs to benefits and therefore nothing is amiss you should be interested in leaving as small a game play footprint as possible unless you are trying to precipitate a genuine and damaging imbalance between the command ships when your approach is the reverse you offer much so called evidence to answer leading questionsthis is simply dishonest intellectualizing and harmful for game balance
the irony is strong in this one and quite erotic

five launchers on the nighthawk no kidding and youre still using 2 rcu iis you really think thats sensible also the nh needs its lowslots for the same things that other 5lowslot shield tankers do such as the raven maelstrom and indeed sleipnir that is  damage mods dc agility and speed mods or lowslot eccm or sensor boosters or are you advocating halving the sleipnirs pg so it has to fit pg mods in its lowsmore there is no point flying a field command if you do not use a gang mod otherwise use a bc or bs i appreciate that the other field cs have problems fitting a gang mod  apart from the sleipnir really   which i dont believe they should but were discussing the nh here not field cs in generaltanking is not a role in itself it is not a useful ability it is only useful when married to some other ability  such as tackling in the case of hics or decent gank hence you cannot fit a big tank to a pvp nighthawk and also be a useful pvp ship because you will neuter its gank

oh sweet princecalm down
the nighthawk is a command ship it is designed to use a command module other command ships such as the sleip absolution and astarte can fit one with no problem not to mention this issue was tackled in the original thread if the nighthawk must forego the use of a command module in order to be useful then it should still be equivalent to the other command ships when they do not have to fit one which is far from the caseummm 5 launchers the nighthawk can fit 6 and your awful 5 launcher nighthawk with no command module still requires 2 rcus thanks for yet another setup that explains the powergrid issue of the nighthawkalso for rigs  other command ships do not need to use fitting mod rigs therefore the nighthawk should not have to use them eitherthe nighthawk does not have some incredible tank why people are under this hallucination is beyond me in fact the nighthawk if anything has a rather average tankhmmm lets see how about nanos inertial stabs a third bcu or even eccmthanks for your assistance in showing that the nighthawk does indeed need a powergrid boost id honestly never thought of posting a five launcher setup that requires two rcus in order to make the point
still waiting on those numbers evidence proof or something remotely similar to a sound argumenthowever im still thankful for the regular bumps to this thread
do you see any of the other field cmnd ships fitting gang mods no its because they would rather have the extra dps people fly fleet command ships for the gang mods i actually ment to type 6launchers not 5 if you use your head then you would of seen thatnighthawk does have a pretty bad tank dono how you fit it but the way my mates do they can tank a  load
both the abso and the sleip fit them because they have free high slots without hardpoints neither ship has a hard time fitting one either the astarte can and does sometimes fit one depending on the situation so yes i see them used  and personally use them   very frequentlyregardless ive pointed it out and youve ignored it if all the command ships decline to fit a command module then they are far ahead of the nighthawk in fitting possibilities thanks to the nighthawks amazing lack of powergrid the issue isnt a command modules grid requirements other command ships can fit them with no problem when only one command ship cant fit one then where do you think the problem lies with the ship or the module use your brainthats interesting because you typed 5 again in your response after that same post however even if it was an accident show me another command ship that must use 2 fitting mods to fit a full rack of its lowest powergrid t2 weapons while at the same time forgoing the use of a commnd module once again you are helping me prove my pointfeel free to post some setups showing this amazing tank because if you actually fly the ship  or throw it into eft   youll see it has nothing approaching an amazing tank the sleip can easily fit a command mod full rack of weapons an amazing tank using an xl shield booster damage mods and nanos with no fitting mod try that with the nighthawk thanks ill be looking forward to that particular response
thanks to kailiani for this group of setups excellent post which yet again shows how totally screwed the nighthawk is for powergrid  even with all the command ships foregoing the use of a command module it takes two fitting mods and a fitting rig to fit the nighthawks setup using its lowest powergrid weapons yet none for the others  sleipnir gyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iidamage control iinanofiber iixlarge c5l emergency shield overload i10mn microwarpdrive iimedium electrochemical capacitor booster iinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field ii425mm autocannon ii emp m425mm autocannon ii emp m425mm autocannon ii emp m425mm autocannon ii emp m425mm autocannon ii emp m425mm autocannon ii emp m425mm autocannon ii emp mempty high slotsemiconductor memory cell isemiconductor memory cell ihammerhead ii x4tanks 718 for 1min 15sec 701 dps fastest at 1540 ms also very easy fittingastarte medium armor repairer iimedium armor repairer iienergized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane iiarmor explosive hardener iimagnetic field stabilizer ii10mn microwarpdrive iimedium capacitor booster iiwarp disruptor iistasis webifier iiheavy neutron blaster ii antimatter charge mheavy neutron blaster ii antimatter charge mheavy ion blaster ii antimatter charge mheavy ion blaster ii antimatter charge mheavy ion blaster ii antimatter charge mheavy ion blaster ii antimatter charge mheavy ion blaster ii antimatter charge msemiconductor memory cell isemiconductor memory cell ihammerhead ii x5tanks 413 for 4m 2sec 700 dps webs and scrambles 1164 msabsolution  medium armor repairer iimedium armor repairer iienergized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane iidamage control iiheat sink iiheat sink ii10mn microwarpdrive iiwarp disruptor iimedium capacitor booster iiheavy pulse laser ii multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii multifrequency mempty high slotsemiconductor memory cell isemiconductor memory cell ihobgoblin ii x5tanks 396 for 4m 16sec 630 dps scrambles and second fastest 1191 msnighthawk ballistic control system iiballistic control system iidamage control iipower diagnostic system iipower diagnostic system ii10mn microwarpdrive iimedium capacitor booster iiinvulnerability field iiphoton scattering field iilarge shield booster iiheavy missile launcher ii scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii scourge heavy missileheavy missile launcher ii scourge heavy missileempty high slotancillary current router isemiconductor memory cell ihobgoblin ii x5tanks 414 until out of booster 451 dps slowest no webscramble 78km range 1087 ms and this setup needs awu 5 the pg is weird because with awu 4 it requires 26 pg leaving you with extra powergrid or just short 1
oh come on your mates are obviously talking about pve everyone else knows that sprs and passiveregen tanking are too slot and capintensive to be useful in pvpthe pvp nighthawk having a big tank is a classic eve myth claiming as such is a good way of showing that you have no idea what youre talking about

unfortunately for the trolls my argument that the nigthawk shouldnt lose grid compared to the drake trumps all their inane excusesare there any other ships that lose grid like that going from t1 to t2what is a drake fitting that a nighthawk is supposed to ditchthis chart says all that needs to be saidpowergrid of tech 1 bcs compared to tech ii versionshurricane 1350  sleipnir 1460myrmidon 1175  astarte 1450harbinger 1500  absolution 1575drake 850  nighthawk 710  wtf  
to those of you having er difficulty understanding the nighthawks pg problem here is a simple comparison i dont know how i can make the problem any clearer than this both the sleipnir and nighthawk have similar slot layouts and are fit in similar fashion one is a good popular pvp ship that is also extremely viable in a nano configuration the other has is hopelessly gimped for pg and has a useless precision bonus making it rarely seen outside its current home of afkl4 running sleipnir7x 220mm ii gang modmwd ii medium electro cb lsb ii sba ii inv iidc ii 3x gyro ii warded ladar backup cluster2x solidifier rigs5x hobgoblin iis  with 15 m3 drone space in reserve  tanks 553 dps  cap lasts 5 minutes with mwd off  deals 547 dps without drones  barrage 27 km optimal 23 km falloff   646 dps with dronesnighthawk 3x aml ii 3x sml ii  yes those are frigate weapons   gang modmwd ii medium electro cb lsb ii photon ii inv iidc ii 3x bcs ii warded gravy backup cluster2x solidifier rigs5x hobgoblin iistanks 588 dps  cap lasts 2 minutes 20 seconds with mwd off  deals 189 dps without drones  cn bloodclaw missiles can travel 42 km but are largely ineffective against unwebbed targets   288 dps with droneswe fully appreciate that to fit a gang mod sacrifices should be made but we believe that the nighthawks currently has to make far too much a sacrificethere is no reaso for it to have such a low pg especially on a ship that lacks the flexibility of the sleipnir the sleipnir is not overpowered and it is impossible to imagine that a nighthawk with boosted pg will be overpowered
if the astarteabso were to try to fit a gang mod they would have to gimp the setup by either dropping to the lowest teir guns or by dropping what tank they have they have no cpupg to spare on a gang modand its quite easy to hit the 5 button instead of the 6 as they are right by eachother and typing late at night doesnt help eitheredit show me any other command ship that can hit outside 50km

i was following this discussion in the original forum threadstill training for command ship was hoping to use a nighthawk for pvp i hope they fix the powergrid problem and the precision bonus before my training completes edit  didnt know how to do thumbs up have figured it now

this may or may not be somewhat of a pet issue im not certain if smaller corporations have the same problem but i imagine any corporation over a certain size will run into this situation and i feel its something that could be addressedas it stands as ceo of goonfleet my evemail is unusable this is because every single corporate going on generates an individual evemail every time a player joins an evemail every time a player leaves an evemail every time a pos runs low on fuel an evemail every time something is shot an evemail essentially this puts me and im sure at least a few others in a position where our evemail is completely unusable it is my assumption that this was not the intended purpose of the evemail system but rather that the evemail system was intended for communicating to allow for other players to get in touch with me regarding issues when im offline or to initiate diplomatic contact i would propose that a separate system be used for logging corporate events be it a log similar to the new kill log or a separate mail account specific to the corps needs there have been a number of times in my case where attempts at communication have gone ignored including communications from ccp simply because i cannot at times even open my evemail it would take a significant amount of time to clean this up and even should i do so it will be self defeating because i will receive hundreds of evemails a dayessentially id like to see these messages going somewhere else so that my evemail can be used for evemailing im not sure how much support this topic will receive as im not sure how widespread a problem it is but in my case its untenable thanks
sounds good to me you can help your situation in the mean time make an alt with few roles so you can convomail and have a nice tidy inboxi hear stories of ceos getting flooded with tons of message like you say and a way to block out the ones you dont want seems like a fine idea to meedit forgot support lols

agreed  corporation logging should happen in the corporation window not via evemail of course this would require the corporation window to get a total overhaul but it needs one anyways
agreed a corporate activity log or something of the sort would win i imagine itd be a simple conversion similar to how killmails used to come in rawtext to the inbox rather than the character sheet combat log
although im not a ceo myself i can see the benefits to this suggestion anything that makes corporation management easier is a good thing in my book
god i dont even have that many roles and i get several hundred at th every least a day signed
never been a ceo but i was in an alliance long enough to get annoyed by the constant pos mail spami think ccp should rework the corporation interface to be the central management interface with all the logging  and mail spam   happening thereimo a corp mechanic overhaul is long due currently the divisions have almost no meaning except restricting cash flow a bit at least an internal corporation contract system is needed
use a corporate commanding alt evemail is completely broken when it comes to being a ceoi must agree with this issue though
they fixed killmails this cant be so much harder

i support new ships especially for exploration
an exploration vessel would be extremely useful for and help develop some of the things introduced as mini professions to people that prefer that sort of game style after reading one of the csm logs it is discouraging to hear you should not be able to finish most exploration because you are a single playerfirst off do you really want to group up and wait for someone to scan for you or waste all your time for the benefit of others  typically now that i am a ceo i would not say such things but first and foremost i am a player and exploration was a miniprofession not a group type thing just certain high level complexes in 00 and the ones that got moved to the exploration system to avoid exploitation of its resources  there are already exploration sites that are not soloable but having a ship that would be capable of scanning and a decent chance at running the exploration complex would bridge a giant gap for this game play not having to tow around multiple ships and all their equipment to do exploration let alone in new and more dangerous areas like 00 sov controlled space areas where by standing issues you cant dock at player made stations and having to leave all your stuff out in a open space bookmark  safe spot where it will get deletedsecond off using mmo as an excuse everyone should play together for every type of end game type content is weak especially in a game where you are not encouraged to trust other players massively multiplayer online does not mean you must group up to play most of the end game features are already centered around groups like most daily important game features blobs and sov  conquerorable 00 being able to select to do something with others is what makes mmos great but being forced to group for things is a major stopping point in most gamesi am very surprised to see such a useful idea shot down with a minimum of conversation
it was really discouraging to see how certain csm candidates refused to look at the game from a larger perspective but instead just shot down the proposal because they believed that ccp should not spend time increasing solo activity viability and dismissing people that support this issue as lazyi believe that this proposal would positively impact a large amount of players as well as making eve a more diverse game i was amazed that this idea was rejected while many what were in my opinion trivial issues did make it to the iceland agenda perhaps well get another chance of bringing this issue up at a later time but im affraid its off the list for iceland
after reading the chatlogs of the discussion concerning the proposed exploration style ship it seemed pretty clear that some of the folks didnt have much idea about exploration or just werent interested in it especially the hey why dont we make it possible to raid an outpost with a single ship as well response to making it easier for explorers to fulfil thier role with a single shipoff the cuff comments like that really show you guys in a bad light and demonstrate a kinda it doesnt affect me i dont care attitude imo
well it would seem that unless you play the game as they want then you shouldnt playwhat a waste
i support this idea
so something like a marauder lots of spare high slots for tractor beams bonuses to said beams with the damage tank and cargo hold to clear the mission and space to fit a probe launcherprobe launchers arent class limited fit them on a marauder and go to work
well i liked this idea and i voted for it and tried to persuade people sorry it failed
the laziness comment is the first thing that made me a bit furious about the csm you are supposed to represent player interests not offend us you can be sure that this will affect my votes next time aroundthe question you have to ask is is exploration meant to be work or fun if its work then i simply wont do it for the limited rewards thank you very muchif its supposed to be fun then how can one be lazy the current exploration mechanics just arent appealing to me and thats quite disappointing after spending a lot of time preparing for it i didnt do this for the money but with the idea of having fun there are better ways for me to make money so why should i bothera new ship certainly isnt the only way to make exploration fun but it would at least have been worth bringing up i wouldnt want the ultimate ship that makes teamwork completely obsolete i merely would want a ship that makes deep space exploration at least remotely feasible without having backup in the vicinity i quite like the idea of giving astrometrics bonuses to the marauder actually it would fit perfectly with their home away from home slogan and what could be less lazy and more dangerous than flying a 500m flying brick deep into dangerous territory dont you want players to take more risks this would have been a great chance
i like the idea but i dont think they need any significant damage at allwhat they need is probe bonus  tank  medium size  new hull that looks like the one from starcraftreason i dont want them to become useful in pvp really covops have a defined role and theyre good at it i dont want to see gank covops where covops pilots are suddenly top of the killmail at the top of this page was aguy complaining about certain suggestions because they had too few dps  whut   and asking for basically an ishtar with better tank and a probe bonus  mental  they need tank to survive the explorations and bonuses to do science stuff  ie the arch salvage and hacking   that these exploration sites encourage if youre coming up with the combat sites you need to bring a combat shipso entirely for examplet1 hull new sisters of evecruiser sized 5 high  3 turret   six mids five low600m3 cargo slow max velocity but good agility ship bonuses 10 bonus to scan speed 75 bonus to armor replevel role bonuses 25 to scan strength 50 to codebreaker and analyser success chance 200 bonus to cloaked velocity thus tanks nice can fit bonussed hackarch plus cap recharge  carebears love passive cap remember   similar tank to a myrmidon equal to covops probing  better strength can hide while scanning but cant warped cloaked 3guns to clear friggiestheres no way you should be having heavy firepower on these type of ships if you want to run combat sites you should bring combat firepower especially the ded plexes and escalations however this vessel allows abilities that dont exist  eg strength and archhack bonuses   overall a cool scienceoriented science vessel
i was very disappointed this motion failed and i disagreed with the laziness argument i feel there is a role for solo explorers in eve and it was a great pity this didnt get through
short range  transversal and not hitlong range  just plain damn range and not hitmid range  optimals and death i think something needs to be done to allow for increased life expectancy in the mid ranges
the problem with midrange combat is that you cannot tackle at these ranges in main combat ships this neccessitates the use of tackler pilots in quick ships or gallente recons the issue ends up being that you need to put pilots in tacklers instead of battleships which may not be the most efficient use of pilots and that you need to have a higher degree of coordination between tacklers and dps which isnt really a gameplay issue but more of a barrier to entry

hell yes

signed finish em
everything right nothing wrong with this request
signedccp this issue is one that unites the amarr and minmatar rpers ignore us at your peril
fully support this issue amarr needs a new emperor it makes no sense for the empire to go to war with no emperor at the helm i also agree with the khanid issue it is very confusing to have the khanid bloodline and also the khanid kingdom of which neither are really related other than in name and race this doesnt make too much sense or at least there isnt enough infomationbackground story for players to absorb and use in rp it would be a whole lot easier if the kingdom was comprised of solely khanid bloodline  as well as the khanid bloodline being fully accepted in the empire like the ni kunni  
i was going to post something very similer to this but a lot less elequantly well donethe trouble with your fix is it seems to me to be dificult to implement from ccps side and prone to abuse  for instance you could warp friendly titans to the field doomsday nothing and then move your capitals and support in knowing that hostile titans will be less effectivewhat i suggest as a fix is simpler but hopefully just as effectivereduce titans hitpoints to the same kind of level as carriersat the same time as this increase their ability to tank in excess of motherships perhaps a 75 increase to rep amount and remote rep amount per level and a greater cap abilitythis will mean if you have titans on the field and want to instadamage with multiple doomsdays you will pop your titan fleet as well as the enemies capital fleet this does make titans more vunerable to killing but i think that this is neccesary anyway in relation to their poweryou would still be able to out tank normal caps and even motherships and with effective spidertanking this would still make titans very difficult to kill but you reduce the ability to instapop capital fleetsit would still be possible if you could get a titan fleet of the same race and stick to one damage type that your own titan fleet is heavily resisted to but this comes with its own problems and allows the enemy to counter

best idea since warp to 0
how did we not think of this before
definitely an amusing idea and i am torn in two directionspart of me concludes that monster trucks are not airtight and without ground underneath them couldnt get very far  let alone not even having one loo aboard   the other is that the daughter of some dear friends of mine owns and runs one of these beasties at shows so i ought to support de truckbut i dont think i can  sorry oiz
i can completely get behind this idea
i can see the rl logic behind it two lumberjacks do not cut down a tree in half the time because they get in each others way and have to coordinate their swings likewise projectiles racing toward a ship can get in each others way lasers might catch on missiles heading towards the same target and if you blow a hole in a ship just as someones shooting at that same spot then theyre going to go straight through and hit nothinggame balance well it seems its focusfire or lose these days i can see the argumenti do not however support nerfing focus fire against bigger ships tiny little shells against a massive battleship have plenty of places to impact without getting in each others way
so youre basically saying if you have double the guns you dont have double the firepowerapart from that not making any sense at all it must be one of the worst ideas ive ever heard
i wholeheartedly support this idea it will help eliminate the blob warfare that is ruining eve online
this would make a blob nearly unkillable you wouldnt even have to call primaries anymore a logistic ship here and there a tank on every ship and bam youre entire blob is unkillable barring lag
absolutely surrealistic you should die a fiery death if youre being primaried thats the whole point if you dont want to lose your ship in pew pew anymore go nano or go home
i propose we get mythbusters in on this they can have multiple remotecontrolled trucks driving past multiple remotecontrolled machine guns and see if the speed of stopping the trucks is directly proportional to the number of machine guns
what a horrible idea please stop posting
basis for the idea is good enough its to easy to do focus fire no need to position yourself in any way i agree on thatbut your suggestion is unrealistic a better way would be to introduce a line of fire if you have a friendly between you and your target you cannot hit target also enemies should be able to move in between you and your target taking all the damagethis will give defenders an advantage as they can entrench themselves and attackers a harder timemy idea will also encourage blobbing and put a huge load on the servers so its not acceptable
eee lets make a only first torp from ganking raven hits rest should not be counted  it should counts only when ur staying on one leg with your mouse raised above your head while screaming i love caldari
line of sight is the only viable solution but it is not viable to be implemented because of high cost on hardware power
worst idea ever
what a load of old twaddle sounds like the whining of someone who got ganked if you ask me
whining about focused fire is so 2006there are other ways to deal with blob warfare like functional nontitan aoe as a blobbing deterrant
dreadful1   op states a solution without stating and explaining the problem 1b the problem here doesnt actually exist  2   op seems to be operating on a different planet  you actually like the current setup well yeah obviously   2b suggest the op hasnt actually got sufficient combat experience to comment but cant i cant prove that  3   focussed fire is a vital part of the combat paradigm in eve nerfing it makes about as much sense as nerfing warp drives stargates or targeting
see this this is where the support would bebut its not
see two missiles erradicate the existence of said tree into nothingness in half the time one does
ship trails are always something i enjoy watching they give the game a certain complexityin homeworld ship trails were actually modded pretty heavily as players found them aesthetically pleasingwhen trinity hit tq all ship trails were nerfed to some extent in both classic and premium i dont know if the game was given a huge multiply filter for trails etc but their visibility was taken away at longer ranges making drones harder to track  sort of   and with ships that accelerated quickly you had no visual reference as to how fast they were moving without glancing at the overviewdont get me wrong i fly by the overview but sometimes actually seeing the game field is helpful too i just see this as an unnecessary visual nerf  lets face it it has nothing to do with lag and you can disable client trails via the esc menu anyway  
im not sure but im guessing they got nerfed to increase performance if thats the case wich one is the heaviest  performance or aesthetics
moot point you can disable trails in the esc menu as i said
performance hits are server side not client side
yeah i noticed it too it is really a very minor detail but ill give my support to this one
oh im sorry siigari i missed that you wrote thatbit sleepy here im curious to why they changed it must be some reason to itbut if not you got my support   
yay   
i spent billions to invent ships and in the process i lost billions the  minus  me and chance of sucess rate is far to flawed fix the me and all will be better thereby closing the gapnow i only invent a little bit to keep me in my fav shipsthis is expecially true of bigger ships like the jf imagine trying to buld an anshar with a 5 mefriggin ridiculouschris
either make t2 bpos available to all or remove them from the game that way were all on equal footing no need to comment on this one at least not for my benefit lecrotta i always ignore snotty little snips like you for the rest fair is fairi believe there was a previous suggestion to set t2 bpos to a maximum number of runs copy that sounds reasonable to me and if the number is 1000 isnt that far more than most will ever useand just in case youre wonderingthis is an alt
learn how to use decryptors already toss a test reports or collision measurements in there and your anshar will have only 1 or 2 me and given that its physically impossible to get a better anshar blueprint i dont think thats exactly onerous to deal with that who cares what the abstract cost is perfect research on new t1 is 1 me just add 20 to the base costs and be done with it
only option i see is reinstating the lottery those research agents are preaty boring right now anywaytech 2 bpos stay and we all get a chance at the lottery again while prices are stable thanks to inventionso rework this topic to new lottery in the game and you have my support
whatever pal your greed and envy are the issue here and neither of them are justification to remove items from the game just cos you wanna make a little more isk btw t2 bpos are available to all as thay pop up on the escrowauction quite often you just need to check regularly and buy themhow is it fair to remove a thing others spent multiple billions on just so a bunch of jealous greedy ppl can make a little more isk
no am i biased probably yes but then again i dont hide it and try to come up with reasons trying to look like i am not wich is what most people doas for leveling the playing field yeah right what are you going to do next ask ccp to lobotomize the people smarter than you
lol thats pretty accurate of what those people want it is all those wow and cs babies coming in with little or no concept of what eve is about and start spouting off the pearls of wisdom of how a game should be and fairness and equal playing field eve has all of it fairness and equal playing field one just has to be smart enough to find the way  and take advantage of the ones who are unequal and be unfair to the ones who are not smart
signedthese guys will always find things to complain about while others find the same things and profit from them i love the comments of balance and other crap as well when what they realy want is to play eve in easy mode
very much agreed with the op
i would like to see something get done about this in the game right now a few old players have items that you cannot obtain ingame this in my mind would be something akin to developer content for testing i see a few options to handel it such as change all the bpos to full run bpcs to remove them from the game or add the ability to create bpos for these items in gamenot addressing these in the game because somebody feels that its unfair to loose all that isk is not smart its lowers the gaming experience for the rest of us and should be dealt with i personally have 2 t2 bpos and i still want this changed so its a fair and level gaming for everybody
how does somebody owning something you can buy off them if they decide to sell it lessen your gaming experienceshould i petition ccp for the time i played since 2003 cos invention was not available are you and others so pathetic that your jealousy and envy of others is ruining your game timego farm gold in wow
along the lines of the ops complaint i find that t2 mining crystals are selling for much less than the invention costs would dictate the materials to build them are cheap but the datacores are expensive t2 bpo holders hold the monopoly on these stillvery much signed
i support this not because i think t2 bpo owners have an unfair advantage but because it creates cost inequalities which increase the barrier to entry of inventionin addition if you actually own a t2 bpo and support this you can put your money where your mouth is and trash it you can even wait until youve gotten max runs out of it or whatever your proposal would entail
with these changes it seems more like a nerf nanoship thread trying to be disguised as a helpful encourage more midrange combat thread midrange combat does exist just look at any long range cruiser set ups  4060km  and when making suggestions like these try to see the ramifications of the suggestion and how it would effect a ship or type of ship pleaseps tarminic if your intention was not a nerf nano then please forgive me if my opinion sounds harsh
a lot wrong with this sniper ships can easily load short range t1 ammo and do massive amounts of damage at 4060km but why you are so much more vulnerable to getting bubbled or tacklednonfaction webs have a max range of 10km not 12km and they can be overloaded to 13kmhow would a 30km scram promote fighting at 4060km they can just warp off so wtf does that domidrange combat is actually quite available using standard ingame tactics all you need is to drop a bubbleinterceptors on the opponent and you can go out to any engagement range you desire hacsbcs can hit quite well at 4060km and are very effective as they can be much more mobile than a bs group so yeah your proposal doesnt show how your changes will promote 4060km fighting and sounds like you want to nerf something else 20km webs and 30km scrams doesnt sound like it will have any bearing on 4060km fights for obvious reasons
i do agree with the webs a bit and with the scramblers a little less than that   mid range combat takes place in medium gang sizes where the tackler and primary damage dealers are short ranged ships while all the support is mid ranged so they dont need to travel  or at least not that much   to apply damage on the targetsolo midrange was never viable due to dps limits and fleet mid range is also stupid due to usual fleet ranges being 2x the longest midrange 
no problem after writing it i could easily see how it could negatively impact nanoships thus my note at the bottom though i do think that the prevalence of nanoships alone and in small gangs is too high that wasnt the intention of the post although it would be a side effect this may speak to my recent inexperience as a pvper then ive never been in a fight thats taken place over a range longer than 1520kmps am i allowed to support my own topic
well i am no pvper myself but my limited 00 experience tought me to rely on mid range and stay out of harms way    it has a few benefits1 easier to stay out of bubbles2 faster target switch as there is less distance to travel3 the best option for a caldari specced character   4 option to pick alternate targetssmall gangs dont have the player resources to separate roles so you have to do all  tackle tank damage   thus they are 99 short rangemedium sized gangs do have the luxury of numbers so you can safely ignore the tackling part and fit for range and damage  with a little tank if left alone   usualy thats the best options for missile ships and midrange snipers  moa ferox munnin zealot etc  fleets are very dedicated in their roles and midrange is not one that works therealso for midrange to work properly youd need a mechanic to keep your target longer at that range webs are unfair because they work from 0 to max of their range with same efficiency in fact there is no effect in eve that does not work at closer range but works at longer range  not talking about usability but about effect  
 disclaimer i am an armchair tactician too  there are some interesting ideas here although im not sure that midrange combat is broken enough to need fixing that said though a and c sound reasonable i remember seeing a nice thread about slightly buffing abs andor slightly nerfing mwds a while agob and d could be seriously unbalancing though but youre right in thinking that theyre necessary to get combat occurring at greater range making webs and scrams effective at longer ranges makes them more powerful and broadly speaking they dont need to be more powerful  theyre doing their job fine already perhaps instead of extending the range of all scrams and webs introduce new scrams and webs that can operate at greater range  but make them harder to fit  grid or cpuwise   or operate  capwise   except on certain ships which could get bonuses to their use
it would be nice to see longer ranged scrambling but the problem lies in how to implement it either it costs more to fit costs more to use or the whole warp core strength thing is completely redonemaybe make bigger ships gradually harder to scramble starting with 0 strength for frigates and destroyers 1 strength for cruisers and battlecruisers and 2 strength for battleships then another jump for carriers and dreads up to the invulnerability of supercaps then you could use a longer ranged less intense scrambler on weaker ships but require more for larger ships with more sophisticated warp systemsinterceptors could get a role bonus of 2 warp core scrambling and whatnoti just ramble a lot
the webber strength being affected by sig radius is interesting although i could see a problem with the disparity between a large slow ship trying to web a smaller faster ship  which even with the sig radius increase from the mwd would still be smaller than its target    in a gang situation wouldnt that mean the smaller faster ship could tackle even more easily with less threat of being counterwebbed and blown upstill it seems like something that could be tuned with specific numbers if you combined it with different range on webbers  or better a falloff for webbers where their effectiveness fades out at higher distances  maybe the stasis webifier section could be reposted as its own issue though
hell yes other than the rorqual its been a long time since miners got some love id like to see some real incentive to getting out in 00signed
as somebody who is basically a carebear i heartily endorse this idea the lolqual was an insult to industrialists and its high time we get some attentionthis may help the macrominers but there are other ways to go about hindering them rather than helping them my idea about periodic highsecurity raids as well as other ideas such as asteroid veins will hinder their activitiesi do run missions and the removing all t1 loot from it will hurt me slightly however if you increase bounties to compensate i see no problem with that ideaabout being able to build anything in the game that would require what would essentially be an industrial rewrite rather than a modification we should be able to produce bpos by copying if we devote the appropriate amount of time but i dont see that getting rid of bpos completely unless we do something related to invention for t1 bpos
supporting because moar carebears  moar targets
i think that the best way to incentivize industry is to give industrialists more options when it comes to the use of their skillsbeing able to use industry and trade skills to improve what you can do with business inside of a station for producing the goods or whatever option ccp will leave openeither way supported

i think the op meant new stuff for industry not a nerf to industryop supported
even though i am a 00 vet and a pirate i thoroughly support this topic in all its glory
there seems to be some contention on the forums and in the csm itself in its chatlogs as to how the csm meetings can be better conducted  as evidenced by comments about chairmanship talk of no confidence etc  i suggest formally adopting roberts rules of order which is the basis for debate in most legislative committee and corporate meetings all over the world most organizations use some simplified version of it since it can be rather unwieldy for small groups but it balances the rights of individuals while keeping the meeting on track since the csm has trouble holding an informal meeting the csm should use a simplified form of roberts rules of ordersee rulesonlinecom or robertsrulesorg for the proverbial whole nine yards
i meant to start this thread last night but got too caught up in the drama threads yes  adopt rro asap and put 90 of this stupid procedural bickering behind us
yup best idea to date tbh
all remarks must be directed to the chair remarks must be courteous in language and deportment  avoid all personalities never allude to others by name or to motivesthis will never work
hehnevertheless supported
agreed but well also need a way to add house rules as the csms usually meet online not in a room this difference may warrant changes but given how little guidance ccp has offered to date it a good starting structure it would also avoid stupid statements like a vote of 4 for 2 abstained and 2 against being ruled as voted down when roberts notes abstain votes go to the majority  iirc  
supported i read in this weeks notes how one rep found it important to interrupt constantly could have taken an hour off the 4 hour meeting from that alone
in practice most bodies that use these rules use them very loosely  like company board meetings and community organizations   they only need be invoked when ignoring them is causing problems when a situation is obviously contentious theyre very helpful in keeping things fair and oh yeah obviously supporting my own topic here  
agree
agreedi kinda assumed the csm would be following this sort of thing from day one anyway but takes all sorts i guess
those websites are the most recent pre1923 versions since theyre the only ones in the public domain modern rro books have provisions for meetings by alternate technical means which should be close enough to chat channels as to make no difference i assume the chair would go out and buybittorrent a modern copy of rro or something for this purpose
agreed
this is a musteven just to make it easyer to track each csms input on issuesbig fat hairy support for this
what the hell the csms arent supposed to be debating anything the people present opinions on what needs to be presented to ccp the csms vote then they move on to the next issue the only debate that should take place is here in the forums not in the meetings the csm members need to manage their time better and the latest meeting was clear and decisive proof of that
i agree
i dont mean this is an agressive or dirisory tone at all but what do you think the csm is there for at all if not to discuss an issue i mean if we just talk about it here and they forward it on to ccp then there is no need for them as ccp can easily let us talk for a while and every six months add up what got the most support and talk about it themsleves
we have now had three disastrous meetings of the csm chatlogs have been released and yet we still have yet to receive a single set of minutes of the meetingsthis is clearly unacceptable considering the importance these csm proceedings hold for all eve subscribers the chatlogs themselves are inadequate badly formatted and in a horrible format  why rtf why  finding the votes on a particular issue is almost impossible or even whether an issue was voted on at all
do you really need minutes for the weekly fiasco10 jade loses the plot20 goto 10
that is beside the point minutes are meant to be produced for every meeting they have not been qed fire the stupid bint in charge of making the minutes and get someone who can tell which end of the pen makes the ink go on the paper
is it ccp or is it the secretary that decided that the meetings should be held in text chat im not sure but i suspect its ccpsince your issues seems to be whit how the meetings are beeing held i think you should make a new thread and suggest a new method personaly i think they should get a internal forum where they can discuss things instead of text chat that would make it much more organized
there are chatlogs where
my issue is that the promised minutes of the meetings are not available three weeks after the first meeting chatroom meetings are fine however the way the chatlogs are distributed is stupid
not supportedfrom what i understand the minutes of the meetings have been completed and sent to ccp for distribution however for whatever reason ccp has yet to post them up despite having promised the csm that they would within 7 days of the meetingtherefore the problem in this case lies with ccp and not the secretary
i have honored my duties and sent the minutes to ccp within the timeframe given in the csm document to the best of my abilitiesccp has failed to release them to the publicsee last meetings chatlogproctoheliosis what format would you prefer for the minutes rtf was chosen because it is platform independant keep in mind that mac and linux users wish to read it as well id rather hear your input and suggestions instead of only complaining how whatever we do is wrong
how about a god damned text file rtf is a horrible format its also not completely cross platform for example opening it on my computer gives me the logs in a greek font i have to manually change it to read themthe three column tabbed format means the interesting portion  what was said   is only a third of the page wide making the logs multiple pages long for no reasonand if what you say is true and ccp has failed to release the minutes you have sent them then perhaps it shows just how little they care about the csm process
i would like to see the chatlogs released in a csv format so we can rearrange columns for readability in fact i might just go and write a script to convert them
as pointed out already the problem isnt ankh shes doing a great job
much unlike mistress jade constantine
this also has anyone else noticed that this happened between two roleplayers just putting on a tinfoil hat here but mehroleplayers should not roleplay during the csm in my opinion
allthough jade isnt doing it good atm i think it is way too easy to just put all the blame on jade anyone who ever done an msn conversation with 10 people know it is impossible so why would this work
this is your first formal warning do not disrupt this thread with your arguments
i lold
oh noes lol
please cancel your subscription unplug your keyboard turn off you computer and never returnkthxbyte
to be frank given the time and geographical issues and what i have just read it is a miracle anything is going to happenok pro tips your secretariat should prepare an agenda and meeting papers in support of that agenda  ccp should support this   every item on that agenda should have a resolution in clear short terms setting our the proposed decision sorry but that rules jade out from writing any resolutions if an item is just for information then record the decision as notednever use msn for meetings use voice and secretariat records deliberations of the council and consideration need to be kept private as you may be privy to game design issuesdraft agenda1 quorum  including choosing a chairman if it rotates  2 acceptance of previous minutes3 matter arising from previous meeting discussion about issues that have been raised from previous meetings  4 general businessa  ccp reportreport from ccp detailing significant matters of relevance a document put together  a report   covering an agreed set of matters tabled for discussion and noting if you cannot trust any member simply warn them what will happen and make it clear that they will be hounded across the world with litigationb  proclamationsa review of proclamations to determine which ones have the most support and a reference to ccp for issue evaluation and managementresolved that ccp be requested to formally advise the committee as to its considerations on pos warfare  flogging the dead horsethat puts ccp under pressure to formally state its case in writing to you guys evaluating the pros and cons if the paper is any good then you can seek permission to table it and then put it on these forums for everyone to seec  assembly hallnote the status of issues and summarise the discussionsd  other businessits easy if you plan and prepare and document for everyone to see where actions are requested secretariat follows up
thanks for your well reasoned response to this thread however i will have to give you a formal warning for using kthxbyte a misspelled catchphrase
its all good problem is weve been told we have to use ingame chat and as i think you can see from the last meeting  that is a very problematic medium given the personalities and timescale involved id be much happier using voice chat of course  but we will need to get ccp to sign off on that
no one wants to listen to your whiny voice for 4 hours while you pontificate about how important you are especially if you talk as verbosely as you post
on the csm website bookmark it as it doesnt seem to be linked from anywhere on this siteedit ankh is doing a very good job and the delay is caused by ccp they do have this whole factional warfare expansion to push out the door tomorrow but thats not an excuse to ignore a process that they themselves installed and deem important  the csm stuff  theyre a multidepartment organization they should be able to deal with multiple things at the same time and none of that soon business is acceptable either imo
jesus wepttell ccp to wake up to themselves chat logs ffs if thats how they run their business then they deserve to go bankrupt voice comms and then get it transcribed if you have too but not that tripe um guys fundamental rule of meetings if you are not there you cannot vote and if the vote is carried on the voices and a quorum is present too bad so sad any other way is anarchy it encourages people to be on timewhats with this moved and carried crap just move a motion bring out the critical points and vote once moved its a resolution and binding topic closed next item  not really but it works best that way  chairman should not vote they have a vote in the event of a tieagendas look like they are not working well and the chairman needs to stick to the agenda your secretary needs more support from ccp to build a worthwhile agenda and supporting paperschairmans task is to facilitate debate over the agenda items not participate you really need to stick to the agenda and only open up for new items under new business if people wander away and make spurious motions  slap them and let them loose under general businessget people to state the nub of their case and what they want if they cannot say it simply and quickly get them to prepare a paper for the next meeting if the issue needs more work but sounds valid get ccp to do the supporting workmeetings are for decisions not for indepth discussions papers and presentations should contain the meat of the issuesi notice that people are all saying they have to visit iceland for one day um interesting for people in the lower half of the southern hemisphere thats a 5 day trip 4 spent on planes i guess half the world is ruled out of ccps democracy use videoconferencing
ankh is fine the problems with minutes and such are ccps fault
to be clear you may want to give your definition of table that may sound like an odd request but the phrase has contradictory meanings in different societies and historically it has caused much confusion and trouble in diplomatic encounters its a colloquialism that generally should be avoided in international meetings
hey my voice is sexier than yours you damned forum alt
eh slab of wood with legs nailed on isnt it   note to the table purist those monstrosities made of metal and plastic are not considered true tables although at first glance they might appear to have the same form and indeed function in extremis stone may be considered as an alternate material
ank is doing fine i do not agree with her views but she is in the right spot i think until something else happens that would change that she needs to be a bit more organized and prepared before the meeting she gets a little distracted though out the meeting from time to time but thats because i think she is focusing on a couple things at once tbh
your voice is awful
says the man who burst into tears on our vent after we criticized the fleet warfare capabilities of goonswarm  lol
i dont support this ankh is doing a fine jobjade please stop trolling assembly hall threads at least pretend you take csm seriously
i take the serious threads very seriously i pay the non serious threads the respect they deserve i hope it wont hurt your feelings if i laugh at the monster trunks  titans thread next
yes imo nano ships is the only counter to 200km falconsflying around in low sec in a small gang with a sniper fitted bs for killing falcons isnt a good solution id recomend nano ships instead tbh90 of the fights in low sec is at the same gates and stations
i hate falcons you need to have at least as many people in gang as the falconn have jammers 1  so 67   and in the meantime your gang is getting slaugthered dead so most gangs our corp puts togethere are in the 510 man range meaning that we got no ability to counter the falcons now here are the counters to nano ships  which people claim are uncountrable  1 heavy neuts2 cursesentinel3 rapierhuginnhyena4 good tracking medium range guns5 cerberus and other highspeed missile ships6 ecm ships7 damp ships8 tracking distruptor ships9 doomsday10 remote repping bs fleet11 warrior iis12 faction websofficer webs13 nano ships14 webbing drones  really they work kinda  15 high alpha shipshere are the counters against the falcon1 falcon2 doomsday  not possible in lowsec  in addition this is what you can do to mitigate the effect  note non of these counters  1 bigger blob2 eccmnow how many of the falcon counters and mitigations seems reasonable for a small lowsec gangif you need a specific ship to counter another specific ship something is wrong
falcons are fine its just the ecm effect that ppl do not like and falcons have become the target of all that frustrationdont blame the falcon blame your choices in gang members and ships and your decision to engage a gang you know you cannot hurt with your particular setup
what do you expect a 3 man gang to achieve you have no diversity  as you dont have the numbers   and flexibility your 3 man gang is only safe to take out at most solo or 2 ship gangs of inferior qualities or you pick your targets very wisely in which case you still need a forward scoutin your case even a lousy blackbird will be more ecm than you can handle so it is not a falcon is overpowered issueas i said dont nerf a ship because of your lack of preparation or resource would you ask for a carrier nerf if one was dropped right on top of you
it is quite common for experienced pvp corps to fight gangs twice their own sizeit has been mentioned several times in this thread why a falcon cannot be compared to a bb or even a rook and we are not discussing the ecm strengththis thread has nothing to do with lack of preperation lack of resource or even carriers it would be nice if you could stay on topic and keep a civilized tone
the stupidity of this post offends me
this makes sense  but are there any situations where a corp might not want the standings to change automatically  i cant think of any off the top of my head but you never know   maybe instead of it being automatic there could be a align standings to alliance button or something
the only situation i could think of is that the corp has a spy in an enemy corp or alliance and their own alliance doesnt know about itin which case mirroring alliance standings and then having any corp standings override the alliance mirrordo people even set their spies blue i dont know anything about that sort of thing anyhow still mirroring is a good idea
ugh i have found this a problemsupported
as a ceo i respect my alliances standings  for the most part   but there are standings that are unique to my corporation we have one corporation that operates in the same patch of lowsec we do and theyve agreed not to fire on dfias and weve agreed not to fire on them that doesnt meant hat all of our alliance is blue to them nor should it most of our alliance doesnt fly in that regions lowsecthere was an incident where one corporation was kicked from the alliance we were in due to personal squabbles between that corps ceo and the executor of the alliance in question we did not agree with the action and refused to attack our friends in the corp that got kicked the alliance had them set to 100 red  which was childish   dfias had them set to 50 bluecorp standings are not personal standings are not alliance standings and that is as it should be if you cant handle outpost management then pass the torch to somebody else in your alliance who can handle it
csm chair should only be allowed to mute someone if there is a majority call from the other representetives present to do so
disagree  its the chairs job the problem here is that the chair abused powers he rightfully had not that he invented powers he didnt
its not his job to silence any of the csms from discussion he has no right to silence another elected official nobody but ccp has that authority
the chair is an organizer nothing more is defined anywhere muting people in the discussion channel was never granted therefore it was invented
sure
the chair has the right in any discussion to end any disruption to the order of the meeting
not in my opinion this is a council of equals not a lord and its subjects also there wasnt any disruption to the meeting in question
the chair is mad with power and defines disruption as anything they disagree with what now
the chairperson has all the formal administrative powers that being a chairperson grants those powers are not up for debate traditionally a chairperson has the power to silence or even eject any member of the body who in the chairpersons opinion is disrupting the meeting any such decision of the chair can be appealed to the body and overturned by a 23 majority vote and by traditionally i mean according to roberts rules of order which is the basis for the rules of debate in most legislative committee and corporate meetings all over the world  sorry no support
adopting some already established rules of order is certainlyin order
this is a terrible idea and will be sure to bog down csm meetings even further you simply cant have every single detail or your process be wrangled over by the majority you need a moderator who keeps things in line and who keeps things moving arent any of you familiar with roberts rules of order
try calling somebody a liar in parliament and youll get thrown out by the speaker try bellowing out of turn in just about any body anywhere and youll eventually be thrown out by the chair you arent thrown out by the election commission the presidentcrown or anyone else youre thrown out by the presiding member chosen from your own ranks if someone starts posting cut and paste spamspamspamspamspamspamspamspam every second i want the chair to mute them i just think that the chair should limit his use of such powers to situations that actually warrant them rather than abusing them to silence an opponent who was just questioning what was going on
since its kinda what weve been talking about here heres a proposal to introduce roberts rules to formalize the powers of the chair and the rights of individual members of csm
no they do not sorry i hate to break it to you but this isnt space parliament
if it is or if its not is the point in question tbh and i support the rule of law or tradition on this matter the fact is that the forms must be observed or every meeting will degrade into a shouting match where everybody talkstypes and nobody listens it is a chairpersons right and hisher place to police the discussions and censor or reprimand the individuals if he feels a breach of the rules is occurring a formal protest may be made about the decision but should not be done while that session is in conference so not to disrupt it further
roberts rules are used by every body aside from elected legislatures who have enough time to establish their own that ive ever seen and even in those bodies the chair has the right to eject members who are misbehaving sufficiently the right to temporarily eject members under certain circumstances is a universal right of the chair of an assembly and should be here as well
if only there were a document which could have laid out all these rules and procedureslook in my opinion ccp should have laid all this out now were dealing with the results of that id be perfectly happy to abide by any rules that were fair but thats simply not where we stand today and shoehorning in rules isnt going to change past abuse or give me any confidence that theyll actually be rendered in an evenhanded fashiontheres no reason why people cant just have a dialog about spaceships today without people being bullied or muted thats a personal choice that ability was never explicitly granted and with good reason
i bolded the important part for you the assumption here is that the chair is able to exercise sound judgment this is not the hand weve been dealt
the real problem lies with the whole idea tbhyou put together a group of ppl who volunteered to represent the most self important petty minded moaning complainers and whiners in eve and i include the members in that group then you give the group a little authority and then give a individual authority within that groupim surprised its not been reduced to hair pulling and name calling sooner tbh
oh granted im defending the position not the occupant
no supportanyone voting for a chairperson should do their best to recall that the traditionally defined job of a chairperson is to officiate and supervise the intended meeting that indeed means to silence or even eject a member whom they believe is being disruptiveif people dislike how a chairperson conducts meetings or disagrees with the chairpersons individual take on what defines disruptive then they need to vote for a different chairperson in the next election or rules need to be written in regarding an impeachment due to no confidence
this pretty much sums up my feelings in the beginning of this whole thing i was rather excited about the whole thing i thought that maybe just maybe this was being taken seriously by ccp and there was some chance that this could despite the obvious problems a system likes this has do some good for the community not star fraction not freespacers not small gang pvpers not pvpers heck but everyone i had hoped that there would be some great debates on issues that affect everyone in the game and then we come to what it is now arguments over the details of how the csm should be running the policies of how the csm runs should not be set by the csm for reasons that i think are pretty obvious ccp should have given all members of the csm a clearly defined set of guidelines to work from and their acceptance of the role as a csm members should have be on the proviso that they accept and stick to these rules instead what we ended up with is from what i can see little or no guidance on any issue pertaining to the running of the csm the attitude shown by ccp in this whole affair is nothing short of pathetic and they should just own up and say they have no intention of putting an ounce of work into running it than is required at the bear minimum i mean the minutes havent been put online for goodness sake its not like it is a more than 5 minute job for someone in the end i feel sorry for each of the csm members having been duped by ccp into do a staggering amount of work on this with nothing in return being given to help make the ride that much smoother i feel sorry for those who voted who have to read chat logs of procedural nonsense than should never have come up in the first place we voted for people to represent us and our views not to try and find a way for a committee to run in an internets spaceship game i would be surprised if the csm managed to get anything that we want to be done in the first term because setting up the core principles of a committee like this between a diverse group of people is a nightmarish idea at best should someone be muted should someone have the power to do so should a majority of the voters or the majority of the nonabstaining voters count should a rep be allowed to vote in absence through a proxy all these and more i would have expected ccp to have set in stone before they even thought of opening up the vote to elect members to a committeetldr version its ccps fault for not caring about the csm enough to provide even the most basic guidance please stop blaming jade darius ank etc etc
ill blame jade for not acting like an adult when hes dealing with grownups though i agree with it being ccps fault the csm is spending the majority of their time ironing out how the csm is supposed to function as a group
i dont know how well jf logistics work at present and its possible this would be overpowered somehow but if it isnt then this seems pretty reasonable
hmmm i quite like this jump freighters were worried about as being overpowered but theyre still not popular partly due to price they are very nice in size jump range and fuel cost per m3 but lacking in versatility especially with the versatility of the smaller but tougher and slotted rorqual this might add a nice twist to them there doesnt seem to be a downside as its nothing to do with normal caps its not going to change the dynamics of 00 logistics which is where jumpfreighters were worried about being too goodthe only slight isuses are 1   the agility bonus which is pretty useless if they never have to gatejump again 2   theyd never gate jump again why have a ship that can gate jump when nobody will use it because if they were gate jumping they ought to be in a normal freighter for safety
supported
sounds like a good idea to me what would come of the rorqual as it isnt exactly combat   
i believe this is a valid thing to look at however it makes jump freighters virtually immune to hostility right now the only way to kill a jump freighter is with a wellplanned highsec gank a war dec  which means it will stay docked if the owner is smart   or when it jumps to get back to highsec you have to be willing to take at least some risk with using a jump freighter otherwise its equivalent to reinstating interbus and have everything magically moved for you at cost granted this is a concern not a necessity because id love to have them ill reserve support until someone can logic through that concern and how it will affect game balancefake edit dont forget that black ops ships can use gates as well and enter highsec  and jump from highsec   if you make this it would be valid to allow them to use them as well
this makes jfs overpowered in the since that they could buy low in rens and then take one maybe 2 jumps to jita to sell talk about mega logistics if you can make 300 mil isk in 2 jumps then thats very fast isk i dont support it and think this should go in the features and ideas forum till its more refined though i dont think it will ever really make it onto the drawling board
arbitrage exists in direct proportion to transportation costs if you can move jfs for hundreds of millions in profits then those profits will be eaten up by people doing so and flooding the market
i guess not then 4 days in and only one reply to tell me that things are ok as they aredead issue then it seems
it would be cool if people with multiple accounts could support a thread by giving full permissions from one account to another so that the person could support with all his accounts without having to relog every account kinda like stock market works today you can give full permission to someone to vote for youedit also you shouldnt be able to support more than 1 time per accountedit2 because right now with being able to support with all char on an account kinda ruins the point of having a treshold for votes as it is per account csm vote was not per character rl
euhm how about no you think you are very important because you have several accounts and then you are even too lazy to post with them
well the votes are per account not per character and yes people with more accounts are more importantbookmaker oddsonamarrian gambling
sign
supportedmain reason being to streamline the voting process as with this you only need to post once as opposed to spamming up the thread with additional signed posts from each of your altsalso voting rights for an account should be tied to a single main character no voting with the other characters on the account to pad a vote once you pass your alt account vote to your main the alt account should also not be able to vote  though the alt account can always retract its permissions at any time stripping its vote from the mains in any topic the votes been used for and becoming eligable to vote again with that accounts main character  just need to add a line to the character details that is always visible  unlike the corpalliance ticker   so your details will end up looking like this for exampleredlioncaldaripolaris projectcuratores veritatis alliancerepresents  x   accounts  where x is equal to the number of accounts you hold votes for  edit could also be a good dea for building on the turnout for the csm elections themselves as many said that they just didnt vote with all of their alt accounts because they found it difficult to get in to vote even once
first of all id like to get off on a positive note i hate carebears with a burning passion and belive that they are only here to serve the greater players  aka anyone who has actually used a weapon on another player ingame ofc    now i understand ccp feeling the need to put up a player council so they could say hey we did it first screw u wow and they could pull in more subscirbers by promising your votes will count and all that crap but star wars galaxies beat you too it with their galatic reps or weanyways the point being that csm is faulty because they do not represent the full eve community my reasoning behidn this is1there is not 1 pirate representative2there is not a merc representative  sry if im wrong on this 1  there may be afew 00 alliances reps but they will be outweighed by the carebears this will unfortunately lead too1 the nerfing of wars  1 war dec per corp or some crap like that   2concord in low sec  comon lets face it carebears will whine until they are safe everywhere in eve  3the eventual death of lo sec pvp  its bad atm  what i propose is to totally wipe clean the current csm comitte as its kinda obvious they rent getting along anyway  im looking at you jade  and if they do bring it back they should have it split so every group has a fair representation i dont care who got the most votes as carebears far outnumber the pvpers  however if it wasnt for pvpers carebears wouldnt have anyone 2 sell their stuff 2 now would they   so what i propose is15 seats minimum3mining 3missioning 300 alliances 3mercsempire war 3piratesthis means that pretty much all the groups get a fair rep rather than just the carebears and afew 00 alliances  which is what it is now  also please ppl stop posting crappy ideas  no they arent going to nerf nano no they arent going to nerf blobs  well maybe  no they arent going to nerf titanst2 bposmotherships etc   now i understand that many of you will object to this as you want the entire of csm to be controlled by carebears but it will lead to your demise eventually along with all of eve
i flew with a wellrespected pirate corporation for UFFFD year doesnt that count
i see mining  that i do   and missioning  that i do   but nothing for industry  building   and science  invention   that i do both of so can i have 2 seatspirates mercs and every other segment of eve had the chance to run and get voted in this time around we got this group of 9 next time we will get another set  perhaps with some of the same people and with the vote levels reached anyone has a chance to run and win
the votng system is extremely unfairsince carebears have a misguided view of pirates thinking them exploiters and omgyouwouldntgethisinwowhowcantheykillmewhinewhinewhinethey will all vote for the carebears so if a well respected pirate went up for csm they would get maybe 1100 of the entire eve population voting for them if all the pirates banded together and voted
pirates vote for pirates and carebears for carebears that is democracy welcome to itand reading your post i can understand when carebears have those feelingsyeah uhm right you are sick this is based on what exactly your imaginationmost carebears dont give a crap about low sec only thing they want is that idiots like you stop being an idiot and just let them be happy without telling them they are wrong for not going into low secthere are 2 reasons low sec pvp is almost dead1 no reward in low sec compared to high sec2 gatecamping  pirates who only fight when they outnumber targetsnone of these problems are due to carebearsand your definition of fair is kinda flawed lets do that irl i know how we can split country in 2 groups during election one group is me other group is everyone else and of course both groups should get same ammount of representativesoh and yeah before you flame me i do pvp
are you using carebear to describe industrialists and people who does pve in generalbecause that isnt true many people go into these things to fuel their pvp habbits same is true for me
often carebears put up alot more risk then normal players especially on the industrial side but anyway issues are brought up here and talked about in neutrality so list your pirate issues and if enough agree it will get discussed
doesnt hardin have a pirate background i thought he mentioned that lavsita does but being a roid hugger does not disqualify me from my views of pvp what determines a carebear do look at there character sheet and say hmm well this guy is a carebear or is it by his platform or should they claim pirate 00  industrialistcarebear like being nominate green party republican or dem
well if you consider me setting up the privateers and burn eden alliances then yes  maybe but seriously i have been a dedicated antipirate right back to the good old days in sarum primehowever while my roleplay character may be a hardcore pirate hater i personally recognise the value of pirates to this game  and would never support anything that would see the profession wiped out hell verone wouldnt let me
ok well aslong as there are atleast 1 or 2 reps but i still think my original csm plan is teh sexest
facepalm
weve seen the chatlogs of the singlechatroombased csm meetings so farobjectively ill comment that theyre getting quitemessythe reality of such meetings is that one has to deal with factors such as typing time and the fact that 8 or so people might want to talk at the same time  this is common knowledge regarding my personal experience ive chaired such styles of meetings in my own alliance with about 1215 people in attendance and theyve always gone over an agenda quite swiftly  using only chat much of the time there should be two channels where all the csm members are attending one taking the role of the floor and the other taking the role of a draft channel the floor channel is moderated and the draft channel is unmoderatedthe floor is moderated and represents the area where discussion actually occurs speakers recognised by the moderator can be allowed to speak and at the discretion of the moderator more people can be recognised and the floor discussions take the form of a dialogue the purpose of the draft channel is for csm members to state that they wish to discuss something or enter a current discussionthat they have an objectionthat they have a question the reason this is useful is it allows the moderator to organise the speakers into a logical order rather than the floor becoming a shouting matchin the meetings i have held the draft channel is actively monitored by the moderator however in the case of the csm it would seem that it be more appropriate for the vicechair to monitor the draft channel and organise speakers while the chair moderates statements and dialogue in the floor channelaccountability is not lost  dual chatlogs can show how long speakers are waiting for their voices to be heard and whether ideas are given reasonable time for discussion till voting since the draft channel is unmoderated the speakers have to selfmoderate to allow the vicechair to pick up on who wants to take the floornaturally this system may have many avenues for refining but i think the core message towards improving the csm meetings is adopting a dualchannel systemplease state any improvements you believe this proposal can take on and i will edit them as in as addendums when i next check iti would like to propose that the method we use be adopted by the csm to help them get things done
oh and i like my idea p
this is a pretty good idea although it kind of appeared as though there was some sort of established system for declaring you wish to speak  posting an exclamation point   and when you were done speaking it looked to me like it just wasnt being followed it could be that just adhering to that system would speed things up
i am in favour of taking the task of maintaining order at csm meetings out of the hands of the csm to allow them to focus on issues while somebody else focusses on fairness in points of orderin most democracies this role is called a speaker
this or some other similar mechanism to facilitate meetings makes sense
that was never established serenity took it upon himself to do that
this i like  it fits with ccps demands regarding text meetings and it will eliminate at least half of the chaos weve experienced thus far
 looks at your alliance as ive commented already on  yet   another thread the very first use of a  to ask to speak was by serenity in last nights meeting there was no fullcsm discussion nor statement from the chair at the commencement of the meeting about its usein my experience the use of a main  recorded channel and a sidebars  raising hand channel is the normal  best way to go and i said this last nightiz
should it be established i thought it was mutually agreed upon my b
thank you for expressing support  mind showing your thumb
ianna its hardly fair to claim to represent all players and then start poking at peoples corp tickers clearly people speaking out of turn was a part of the problem and there are ways of making your dissatisfaction with the proceedings known without jumping in  and although i in no way would lay all or most of the blame at your feet reading over the chatlogs you often insert little parenthetical statements that clutter up the log and i can only imagine that makes it harder to follow what is going on when the conversation is happening in realtime keeping a meeting orderly is a group effort and whatever criticisms you might have of the way it was chaired you werent contributing to that order eithergoing into the next meeting it would behoove you all to adhere to common parlimentary procedure and refrain from interjecting except to say i have something to say or  or whatever you want it to be but the more people fail to follow some consistent process for speakingorder the more youre all going to run into gavelbanging youre out of order  no this court is out of order situations
ill second the efficiency of this method for chatbased agendas its worked great for our alliance meetings so far
currently position of chairman of the csm is given to the candidate who recieved the most votes in the csm electoral process this seems fair on first sight but might result in a chairman who lacks support with other csm candidatesi recommend a csm internal vote to appoint the chairman of this council since the chairman is likely to be able to do herhis job best with support from the csm members themselvesin short public vote for the csm candidates  as is   csm internal vote for their chairman  new  this process would make sense for the next csm elections
yea speaker or chairman of parlament should be elected by parlament as he speaks for em
this is a duplicate thread  the original has already received csm approval and will be taken to iceland
ah good to hear this has already been approved
hey sorry farrqua missed that im not sure what you mean by what stops 3 big alliances from attacking the same system in the example system i linked  which ill reiterate is not what the csm is taking to ccp its just there as an example   alliances lay claim to stargates in areas they frequent and when those claims are contested they have a certain amount of time to respond and reassert their claim if they dont return to reassert the claim the stargate falls back to a neutral stateso to answer your question it more depends on the long term presence of these forces  a single encounter in a single system isnt going to swing things one way or another its more the cumulative effect of an alliances presence in an area nothing stops the scenario youre asking about from happening but the long term effect is based on the presence of those alliances in the system over the long term
ie its ping pongguys the owners of the station just depend on the long term occupancy its totally fine
well shieldbuffer hurricanes fail tragically under sentries and tbh no web makes them unable to use the 3 gyrostabs fully  meaning toe to toe with highdamage ammos loaded   using ecm drones does sacrifice a notable amount of its dps anywaybesides no hurricane setup you do wont kill a hamgank drake up close  none of the bcs will the harbringer being probably the most likely to do it or a really really well tanked rigged myrmidon with implants vs a not top skilled drake which could kill its drones anyway you can do a 2xmar ii 2x eanm ii dc ii tank plus damage mod losing drone dps hurts but oh wellyeah  but on the other hand you cant simply give it all it has now plus 5 ogre iis it simply does too much dps  it used to enable the myrmidon  together with blasters possibly supported by one magstab   to do metric tons of damage while still having a not so flimsy tank killing drones yielded huge issues because you simply couldnt kill em fast enough before the dps literally melted youalso dont use 5 hammer iis if youre looking for flat out dps  2x ogre ii 2x hammerhead ii and 1x hobgoblin ii is the mix youre looking for when youre interested in dpsit is i cant wait to skill into t2 hams
comeone guys there was a time when i could fly with myrm towards x bs protected mining op kill everything and possibly escape or pop now i cannot match any other bc with similar amount of sp yes i can tank but i can tank not better than noob drake with 5mil sp pilot  drake can do it perma i have max 10 800stell me how ur utilising your myrm in fleet tanking is useless solo  what for  rating  take a ishtar drake cerb even lousy deimos can do better not mentioning other races which im not very familiar withi understand every race has to have useless ships as it seems but tier 1 galente bs is much more versatile than tier t2 it has no niche if im seeing myrm in hostile gang right now im pretty sure that its pilot took it to get insurance back or experimenting with some funny setup like ecm myrm or nano myrm in both situations threat level from him is low and he will die last   
literally castrated
i will not say the myrmidon is useless it still tanks well and can still put out good dps but that isnt my issue my issue is i put most of my sp into drones i am and will always be a drone boat pilot i can fly drakes harbys etc but drones are my tool of choice i would love to give up 3 turrets and 2 highslots on the myrmidon to get back the full 5 heavys and a little more drone bay it wouldnt do any more dmg then it does now and would lose highslots so as not to offer utility slots like the domi it is however the gallente bc size drone boat and needs to be put back where it belongs signed though to the op can we be a bit less dramatic so people will take this more seriously
why is it impossible to appeal to a higher power about biased or unfair moderation on these forums i have evidence that moderators have deleted supporting posts in the assembly hall forum without noting they have done so and without reason when i asked about this at the email address given i was ignored completely  over a week without reply now despite a second resending of it in case it got lost  given the clear possibility for abuse by moderators on these forums and no one policing their behaviour  a complaint about them is sent straight to the people you are complaining about a situation unacceptable in any scenario   it is clear that it is past due that these abuses are investigated by internal affairs  if this department even still exists  
this is never ever ever going to change but it would be nice to have someone bring this up
agreed
its not impossibleas i understand complaints about moderation is sent to the community manager he is not a mod more like a moderator for the modsand internal affairs still exist
in the past i have received replies from that address signed by the same person that performed the questionable moderation in the first place  ccp navigator  
complaints about moderation sent to modsccpgamescom should be handled and sent forward to wrangler by the head mod if you suspect they are not you can mail wrangler directly at wranglerccpgamescom if im wrong about this then wrangler may slap me whit a wet trout  
the center of many many ships is not at the center of the camera at all times the model of many ships including the myrmidon scorpion raven  hell all of them are off center  save for the pod  anyway this is a simple issue that needs very simple fixing simply set the point of origin on the object or the object axis to be in the center of the screen at all timeshere is a screenshot of a subissue that i would like to address that ties into this to an extentthat is a myrmidon viewed close up what are we centered on the area where the thruster meets the ship i believe ccp has made the model center the thrusters  ship and it is causing us much griefa simple fix to the models should not prove a problem when the new ships came out in revelations i remember having a huge issue on the test server with the myrmidon axis being all wonky but come tq time they fixed it now theyve broken it all over againplease support this so we can have working directional scanners and a more attractive visual appearance ingame that does not have issues such as this detracting from game play functionality and aesthetics
sounds good there are more than a few ships like this
this issue is of the highest importance
could also be an isk sink  money for the object  and a fee to keep it in space would be a pain to code though
edit login cookie deleted contentbad plan youd have to search out wrecks then come back to them an hour later not everyone plays eve for hours and hours on end ninja salvagers are already disadvantaged by the fact that they cant tractor beam the wreck maker can tractor beam there are so many counters to ninja salvagers from getting a gang salvager to aggerssion gaining strategem giving in to the mission running carebears would reduce mission ruining to mindless farming even moreso than it already is the game encourages player interaction greed is on the mission runners side in the form of salvage evolving into loot stealingthe choice is how do i counter a salvager busting in on my mission  freedom of choices and result of that this is a tactical choice and this should be encouraged for the most part you dont actually fly your ship you choose the equipment and skills to fit it  so tactical choices are very limited already
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks
linkage anyone then ofcourse remove all the other learning skills
i am curious how anybody spends months on these unless you get them all to v of course i had them all to iv shortly after my 21 day trial ended and they were not the first things i trainedthey make complete sense in the realm of rp which is an aspect of the game whether you like it or not i am a newbie and i think they should stay and are perfectly fine and i am sure a good majority of other newbies feel the same
funny that is actually how it works now when someone takes the items in your wreck  yes that is yours   they go blinky blinky to you very plain and simple
i love my vengence
after reading the logs from the latest csm meeting it seems like some of the council members are acting like immature children and muting and kicking each other from the channel where the meeting was held what are these people doing on this council if they have to resort to kicking and muting in order to solve conflicts you would expect these people to at least behave like adults and be able to talk to each other without kicking people i guess ccp will have to continue to communicate with their customers using these forums instead since this csm thing obviously isnt workingyou cant really blame ccp though they didnt vote for the candidate s   that obviously arent up to the task of acting like adultsedit link to the log in question
wild speculation  could it be that the kicking and muting was generally done by two maybe three particular csm members  nope havent listened to it yet so im just asking
lol id be a liar if i said i was surprized just look at the forums also it would be a good idea to post a link the the chatlog here though
rofl so it begins
hells yes keep up the good work jade constantine if you continue to put forth no issues ill actually vote to keep you in bro
i posted this thread here because i wanted to bring attention to the eve community that this could have a negative affect on the relationship between the developers ccp   and the playersfor the people who do not know what the csm isthe csm consists of nine playerelected representatives of the community members of the council are to meet regularly with ccp staff in iceland to relay the most pressing matters from the community and to take ccps decisions back to the player basejade constantine and inanna zuni are elected council members of the council of stellar managementhope this helps
where can we see logs like you stated
question  where the hell are those chatlogs i cant seem to find them quickly where i looked for them and since you already read them you could probably point me in the right direction faster
tbqfh who your rep is is irrelevant as your going to get moar done by using the tried and true forum route than some dodgy council members influance
not a trojan or rick roll
omg and these guys get a free ticket to iceland wtf i knew i should have ran
people just voted for someone who they likeknow it is hard to determine someones ability to debate effectively within a group if you personally havent had discussions with that playerin my experience discussions within a group can get more productive over time as people get to know each other better and may be adopt a better framework for discussions
its still better than many democratic institutions which isnt saying much but thats democracy for you im just glad that they arent agreeing too much its better for the csm to have a wide variety of different and opposed opinions and personalities than for them to all be the same and agree with each other wed have real trouble then
you get what you deservepeople ignored that fact that forum s like jade constantine had numerous bans for disruptive forum trolling and ignored that fact that she single handedly destroyed an alliance through manipulation and disruptive behaviourthis is what you all deserve for not bothering todo research i never had any hope that this csm council would achieve anythingand once i saw the elected members i had a chucklewill the next csm be any differentprobably not people are lazy and will allways vote for the persons name they remember the one that theve seen post the most forum threads
 20080608 194750  bane glorious  i just want to talk about spaceships pleasethis is after nearly two hours of them talking about themselves and arguing like children i havent even read to the part where they mute each other yet
from what ive read the majority of issues theyve voted on have been passed unanimously or close to it they just havent had much time to do anything thats all
see if you think that this meeting was bad imagine the next meeting when several of them enter it with a chip on their shoulder
ok like right now they are talking about whether an abstain counts as a no or not and it is hilarious because some of these people claim to have been in real life meetings when it is pretty obvious that they dont know simple voting rulesabstain votes do not count towards the majority you should not be allowed to have your physical presence counted toward the constitution of a quorum and at the same time be allowed to deny in effect your official presence by a failure to votei could go on and on but man i cant believe the csm got that one wrong oh man just roflsi feel like im taking crazy pills so according to the csm and ccp 3 votes aye and 4 abstains  fail wtf is that have you heard of the roberts rules or order have you looked up abstain in the dictionary abstain vote is an oxymoron abstain means not to participate its like a working holiday wtf is that are you working or are you on holiday its nutty
i dont see a problem theyre functioning as effectively as any other rl political enterprise
 20080608 212442  serenity steele  emote signals to anyone reading the chat logs that they may want to do something more productive with their life as this discussion comes up againthis is 35 hours in
looks at irl politicsis not surprised
how is this different from any other government
surprise surprise
 20080608 213552  jade constantine  innana im giving you a second formal warning for this session for interruptions and interfering with the process of the chair 20080608 213609  jade constantine  now then 20080608 213611  inanna zuni  and what do you mean by that 20080608 213614  hardin  what is a formal warning 20080608 213619  lavista vista  im sorry jade 20080608 213621  inanna zuni  formal warning is a misnomer 20080608 213625  darius johnson  your warnings dont mean a thing fyi 20080608 213636  inanna zuni  and how can i be interrupting when i am completing what i type 20080608 213658  eve system  inanna zuni was muted by jade constantine effective until 20080608 220657 reason till the vote 20080608 213704  ankhesentapemkah  some order pleaseyou couldnt make this stuff upin summary 20080608 220228  lavista vista  this is a waste of everybodys time 20080608 220233  jade constantine  yes it is 20080608 220233  lavista vista  and i have an exam tomorrow 20080608 220240  serenity steele  move to close discuss this in caod where it belongs 20080608 220243  darius johnson  lets just mute everyone and move onat least something was established 4 hours lateri hope evetv records the meeting in iceland i do enjoy a comedy
csm in joke status shockerseriously no one cares otherwise they wouldnt have voted based the appeal of a womans car
i voted for her because of all obvious rump shots
i want to point out that i 100 am happy with darius johnson my elected representative
thisll be real funny when they meet in person i wanna see the video of the guys in their 30s yelling across the table at the 14yearolds especially the little girly boy who has the gavel
a lot of the criticism that was established prior to the csm was indeed justified during this meeting the way jade kept ignoring members of the council who didnt agree with him and muted inanna because of stupid reasons which he is yet to justify btw   was just pathetici understand that you guys arent happy but im not happy either but i hope you understand that these issues are caused by certain individuals either some of us did try to recover that cluster but we were merely ignored by the chairmanedit spelling
oh dear the visual of that has me almost in tears
since im effectively the youngest council member i fully approve of this but i think there will be more order in iceland the way we conduct meetings now is highly ineffective i believe if we used eve voice or the like things would be much more orderly
 20080608 215433  jade constantine  inanna ill ask you to stop making false accusations about being kicked and blocked tooo nom nom nom nomtime to vote and find new people everyone in favor say aye or nay or you can just abstain
from that convo i carried that these meetings arent going to work well with the current chaiman being jade 
csm members are still getting settled in so the first meetings are supposed to be pointlessthe point is that if all these people meet in rl it will change for the betterif you ever attended long boring corporate meetings youd know
this must be recorded when it happens must i say
ccp is able to record serverside with vivoxs eve voice so that shouldnt be too hardwhile im not a big fan of eve voice its much better than textbased only issue i see is editing out secret information and quoting the meeting for future reference
jade constantine is roleplaying as if hes in front of congressthat will never ever work there is no have the floor in a chat roomheres what you guys do heres yet another freebee that i really need to stop giving out but hay im used to being exploited ouse a forum to separate the topics into their own threadsyou post a complete thought without interruptionyou dont all have to be logged in at the same timeand when it comes time to hold a meeting for god sake use voicechat
i really dont understand why the meetings have to be chat based chats arent suitable tools for communicating and discussing complex matterswhy isnt there a internal forum for the csm though forums are also used for trolling they at at least sometimes come up with something productive while i still have to witness something worthwhile being discussed in chatsalso a forum would have numerous advantages instead of having a set date on which all participants have to attend you could set a time window for discussion and a deadline for votes
you cant effectively hold a meeting with 7 people on a chat programwhat else is new todayrain is wet front of a train is stronger than your head
they get free trips to iceland we get some comedy and drama voice chat would multiply the hilarity tenfold but honestly i dont have five hours to listen in on a voice meeting between those clowns
voice comms anyone  gratz to all the people who voted in jade brilliant  
wait i didnt check entire chat log but i didnt see wall of text this can only mean one thing the jade in the chat is an imposter
i voted for you vista because of your post on the forum and what you wanted to do you need to drag some stability in there plus you have the balls to come here and post that is worth something tooahh it feels good to yell at a rep or we can just pod them over and over
use voice 
new teams go trough 5 stages during their lifecycleas explained here
qfe from that log its seems like heshe is a condisending arogant  d yes i know i spelled it wrong bite me  
it wont help have you ever been in a voice chat meeting with jade its about the same as him having op
normally i rail against all lvv posts but this one is good if you werent such a carebear i might have voted for ya
sounds like par of the course for jade atleast someone is calling him out on his ed 
wait people are surprised that jade constantine is a giant bleeding female reproductive organ
yes they need to get a forum text chat isnt gonna work 
so did they just not adopt a parliamentary procedure at all
im pretty sure they did trying to sort through the chatlogs im pretty sure they basically have a parliment where the chair is a 12 year old kid who can stop anyone who disagrees with him from talkingoh well we all knew that the csm were never actually going to be able to change anything at least now we get a few laughs out of the whole debacle
self important tedious ctsdid any of you really expect anything else
they should simply vote an arbitrating member democracy rules even if members are not keen on the arbitrator the group as a whole voted for that one personor if you want to get pragmatic you could always vote 3 arbitrators that vote to move on or continue a pointless discussionsecond this really does sound like they simply need time to adjust and adapt to each other but have a single strong headed person chairing the meetings will only disrupt enough for everyone else to walk out the chairs role should really be that of a listener to ideas and interpret those into a group understanding by pushing his or her own ideas is never going to work if people do not trust the chair chair should be voted in by other members not take senior role due to popularity contesti have not read through all the chat logs or the ccp guidelines for running the meetings  i hope they have them   but i am sure the mature members of the council can set these simple situations up contemplating with a perpetuate kid trying to push heher ideas will make the whole process a shambles and never move on from this stagebut remember youre meant to be a voice for the players your opinions should not be pushed if it is not represented by the eve population
why cant i just read the pdf in tahoma or arialcopied it and moved it to notepad 
this frankly i changed the font to arial and it went from 67 pages to 42
crap you people im gonna write this in big letters so everyone can understand what the word abstain meansabstain means you are not votingso if you have 10 people and 4 vote yes 3 vote no and 3 abstain that is a pass vote because majority rules and the vote is 4 yes to 3 noread this again4 people voted yes3 people voted noanother example10 voters vote on an issue 3 vote yes 1 votes no and 6 abstain vote passes3 voted yes1 voted nomajority rulesthat is what to abstain meanstaken from wikipedia
lol what did you expect just read these forums and all the kneejerk thread and replies and you will see that jade constatine is a great ambassador for this community even wow has a more mature community than eve these dayssad thing is people like hardin are trying to do a good job gets overshadowed by tards such as seen in that chatlog
i am realy disapointed with the csm the meaning of mayority discussion was just ed to have no doubts i ran across several constitutions and other legislation acts and it is as follows mayority  more yes than no absolut mayority 50  1 of pressent voiting yes and a special order of voting requiering more than 50 but that is not important the chat based discussion is highly inefective that is obvious also i dont realy see any diffrent points of view because most of the topics are concluded that they will discuss it with ccp insted of putting forward sertain solutions and i agree with the person that said that the forum way is much more efficent dedit forgot about the jade issue jade delusions herself that she is a real politician and acts as if she realy was muting others for typing too slow is stupid and immature hope there is a procedure to change the chair before another election
i am just wondering if jade is gonna adress his actions i mean as mentioned previously the csm is meant to put forward eves community thoughts and feeling and not there ownon a side note who the hell voted for jade anyway i mean seriously 
id much rather ccp spend the rl cash that will be wasted on this csm on monthly ups for themselvesrl cash that we pay thinking it might actually go towards making eve a better gamefat ing chance with the cash wasted here
is there an option for like a nonconfidence vote or is csm stuck with candidates it has
if we compare csm with the playerbase id wonder whod we call more immature and childish and lets not forget whining spoiled and obnoxious
hello chapsa few comments1   i would just like to point out one thing about the chat log posted herethe chat log came from a member of the committee who had channel rights which is why it contains a note about inanna being muted by jadeunfortunately the other members of the committee who do not have channel rights did not see that notification and therefore had no idea that jade had gagged inanna and jade didnt inform usi only became aware that inanna had been gagged when she mentioned it to me in a separate convo2   i was not happy with how the meeting went yesterday particularly jades editorialising his muting of inanna and then raising two issues we had already discussed after we had completed the official agenda and have made some suggestions to the other csm members about how this should be handled in futurehowever all that said the csm committee did has passed a large number of issues on to our iceland discussions with ccp  mostly unanimously agreed if we end up getting ccp to do something about even 50 of these then in my view csm will have done its job making eve better for everyone yes there is bickering but it is to some extent the nature of the beast3   a lot of the responsibility for csm wasting time in discussions over majoritiesalternates etc is down to ccp who have only provided the initial csm with very vague operating principles as a result this first csm in particular will be more painful as we work these teething issues out it is my hope that as the csm process develops that less time is spent upon csm procedure and more time on issues that impact the game positively but have to say that at least initially we will see these debates as a csm constitution is developed cheers
its the communitys fault for voting in people theyve heard of rather than looking for the best candidate while jade ankhesentapemkah and the like get in really good candidates without forum reputations dont have a chance
cant say im surprised or bothered after all they only applied to the csm for the free holidays to iceland
i must say i was rather amused and disturbed by that chat log
useaforumthey are superior in every waythey1   separate issues into threads2   can quote so you know wtf people are replying to3   cant be interrupted4   have infinitely superior time constraintsand in general they make everything easier for everyone hardin so you were a counselor irlwell this isnt gonna work in a chat room a chat room is the most unorganized cluster of a discussion meeting you could ever hope forwhether it be to show off or make use of your irl experience or just to roleplay that youre in a courtroom doesnt matter youre better off using a forum
how about you start next meeting with deciding how other csm meetings are going to work like dont mute others even if there is a good reason to mute them next this was first time give them some time to get used to these kind of meetings allthough i dont agree with jade muting arround i can understand that you get touchy after chatting that longand finally they indeed look like a good representation of the eve user baseedit i got second thoughts jade shouldnt mute less but should mute more often well maybe not really mute them but it is a chat based meeting now where everyone talks at the same time no  it becomes chaotic and you want to mute some ever tried an msn conversation with 10 people one should be talking at a time and if you are going to do that via text chat the meeting will take 12 hours next time solution use forum  you cant post in each others posts so it stays clear   and once a week  or something like that   you talk directly with each other using voice chat
fourm  foUFFFDrum  1 the marketplace or public square of an ancient roman city the center of judicial and business affairs and a place of assembly for the people2 a court or tribunal the forum of public opinion 3 an assembly meeting place television program etc for the discussion of questions of public interesti think people often forget about what the word forum actually means a forum is a discussion place a chatroom is where people get together to chatter away about whatever organized discussions can take place in a forum where there is less organization in a chatroom which can lead to chaosi agree here that a forum would be more appropriate but it is sort of amusing to watch how they problem solvesadly i have a feeling that after reading the entire thing some of them are in over their heads  which sucks   and i did not say all i said some
i was neutral and open minded about the csm but after reading the chat log first impressions were initially  then  then finally i hope things improve i am sure some of the csms do also they have donated a lot of their time to this
i have so far spent at least 8 hrs of my eve playing time in csm meetings which i am sure as you can see from the chatlog is not necessarily the most fun time to be had in eve on top of this there is the huge amount of time i have spent reading through the assembly forum issues  go take a look at the amount of threads in there   and deciding on the meritsdemerits to eachof course i am not complaining about that  heck i enjoy the political stuff  but to state that we only did it for a free trip to iceland is a bit ridiculous when from what i can tell most of the csm candidates can well afford to pay for their own holidaysalthough i am not sure any of us would want to pay for a holiday which will involve us being locked up in a committee room with 8 other egotists for 4 days  especially as it means i actually use some of my proper holiday allocation which could have been better spent on a beach somewhere personally i stood because i am passionate about this game and do want to see it improved and believe that the csm does have the potential to promote positive change to ccp of course we will have to wait and see how it turns out
if the majority of csm members have issues with the current chairman you should probably post a petition to ccp of a vote of no confidence and request an anonymous election within the group for an figure head chairman  committee arbitrator   be actionedyou will probably want to get over 70 of your present members to agree before posting any vote of no confidence to highlight its not just one or two individuals that are not happy with current situationotherwise this op is just a lot of hot air and its main point to post is to derail the good job the csm isor could be doingedit nothing more pointless and rather dimwitted is to post meanings of words well done for your great understanding but please stop as you might be suprised people know said meaning it only serves to show your ability to be willing to belittle people in trying to prove a point
i think the csm needs to recruit a speaker to handle this let points of order be left to someone who isnt trying to put a case at the same time
while i think everyone csm included would agree that the discussion left a lot to be desired i think its a bit of a misnomer to claim that any kicking has taken place in this instanceas evidenced by the chat log for those who dont have the patience to read it all jade constantine did indeed block inanna zule in fact on three separate occasionshowever there is no record in the chatlog of inanna being kicked from the channel we thus have two explanations for why inanna left the channel at some point between 2136 and 2147 that jade or another player with moderator priveleges removed them  which is the theory everyone seems to be assuming   or that inanna by design or accident left the channel on their ownthere is evidence in the logs to suggest that the former is doubtful other than jades own protestations of innocencegetting over the indignation of some of the csm representatives at jades actions for the moment i think were best served by following the advice of baneso rather than stirring up any more accusations it seems appropriate to let the devs look into the chat logs and see if any discretion on the part of jade has taken place while im not intimate with csm procedure  as apparently no one is   if the chairman did indeed kick inanna from the channel some sort of review should place to ensure that such powers cannot be abused in the future on the other hand if inanna left the channel through other means and was merely muted so the vote could take place the issue seems less severethe concept of a chairman being able to terminate unwanted discussion at a whim runs counter to the principle of a democratically elected body and i implore the csm to remove moderator privileges from all members of the quorum to ensure an incident such as this is not repeatedhaving said all that the meeting seemed to run quite smoothly save for the debate over the role of abstaining issues that were brought up on these forums were discussed the merit of some suggestions was carefully reviewed and the entire process was completely transparent to the regular observer the csm should see these early disagreements and disputes as a learning experience and move on a great deal of player interest is vested within them
inanna wasnt kicked  she was muted some bug did kick her out of the channel though when jade tried to unmute her
oh my god that painted an epic picture in my head framed in pure goldyou made my day joe starbreaker
anyone taking bets on who gets muted next my money is on lvv with darius as a close second
what was the actual reason for muting
shakes head solemnlyfrom review of all the current logs posted it appears that our newly elected body politic is not quite up to scratch on the points of parliamentary procedurethings appear to be rushed before all results are in haste seems to be this  dis  organisations pitfall not to mention unattentiveness to the propsals put on the table for consideration and therefore more time wasted on rereview of the matter that was clearly stated mere moments beforeits a bloody chat channel missed something  scroll upcsm you must exsercise patience restraint and above all profesionalism i would advise that this esteemed group as a whole refamiliarise themselves with simple parliamentary procedure and conduct meetings accordingly reguardless of how long it may take stay on task until the task is completed point of order votes in abstentia only count on the recorded vote wherein the majority  yea or nae   is counted for official result  simple majority rule   or in the case of the proposed  full majority   yea or nae votes numbering 5 or more would be required for a proposal to be carried votes in abstentia do not count as nae votes and are to be recorded as abstentia votes  neither yea or nae as the issue or proposal is unclear and warrants further investigation   for the official record what ive seen thus far does not please me in the least
rofl who woulda thought of the choices jade would be the one stirring up 
they were like a deer in headlights when it came to exploration in a large hulld vesselwtf is their problem i can do every level 4 mission in a raven but god forbid i can do exploration without having to travel a million fing jumps to pick up my combat vessel and come back to finish the sitethese people are gd biased idiots if youve never done it as a profession then stfu and let the people that have make the vote
this is what you get for voting for jade tbh
laffing like a mother er
at first i was sad that the person i voted for didnt make it after reading this im a bit mad
omg i cant believe the transcript of this meeting are they all really arguing over how to hold meetings and cast votes this reads of stupid petty squabblings of people who perceive themselves to be more important than they really are my god is this the best that was taken from the eve community for crying out loud sack these people
lol  csm
vote alteration petty bureaucracy abuse of power hours of talking whilst saying nothingnot fit for purpose did sort of spring to mind
darius is a champ   
lol
thank you hardin to be fair i think your conduct in the entire chat log is commendable hopefully that conduct is contagious and the first iceland trip turns out well
jade constantfail
what a massive pile of most of the csm got less votes than the number of people who abstained and so far all theyve done is recreate the tossbank that is eveo forums in miniaturegreat going 50 price increase for eveonline new csm coincidence
i expect this thread to be at 10 pages when i get home in two hoursget to it chopchop
this is by far the most compelling statement made in that entire log
thats quite debatable and is in fact for the council to decide for themselves i have seen and studied organizations that use both ways of thinking some require 501 of the delegates to say yes  ie abstentions count as a no   and some require 501 of the votes cast  ie abstentions dont count either way  
me facepalms well  one thing is for certain if ccp ever feared that the csm would constitute a unified front from the player base keeping them on their toes and making sure they stuck to their promises then they need not worry at all now how pathetic was thatin its very first meeting the csm has managed to erode its authority completely will anyone bother to try to leverage the csm from now on or will it simply be reduced to being a channel for major alliances to try to manipulate the development of eve for their own interests whichever it is  csm as a concept has failed
whereas i expect some new forum rule that didnt exist before this thread was created to be in effect by time you get homeespecially since i have scented it already
thisalso thank you for this log it brightened up my day with bowelfuls of laughter and my bowels always needed a good laugh
hop on board to the lol train tickets are free what a shame the powerhungry individual holds rule were all screwed
disappointing to the point of despair
ive been stuck in what seemed like largely unproductive meetings all day and then i come out and read thisall i can say is thank you csm
for some reason this characters name is quite appropriate
motion to nominate the official background music for reading of the csm logs
lol thanks for this its like reading jita local
damn thats one cluster
this is how democracy works guys people arent muted in nth korea their just shot and as a result things work just fine theremake love not warcraft
put nine elected powersharing politicians in an internet chat channel without even emoticons to help convey emotion and nonverbal queues and this is bound to happen im not terribly surprised to be honest though i am amused lets see if the csm can do better once they meet in person
this is crazygood ol csm members if youre reading this you may want to look at getting a neutral nonvoting parliamentarian to run your meetings the kind of bias in those logs is inexcusable for someone running that kind of meeting
i hope like hell that its filmed   
next pod cast needs dramatic readings of these logs with sexy results
absolutely
and here i voted for goum in hopes hed ruin the csm i could have saved myself a lot of trouble and voted for jade had i known he was so capable of destroying the csm in such a short period of timeat any rate after reading that epic failure of a meeting i do hope ccp steps in and does something to correct the situation clearly the csm isnt working under the current rulesetps ill bet 5mil isk that jade either gets arrested or thrown out of ccp by security while the csm is on their trip
reminds me of the movie 12 angry men
i can just imagine itccp newsflashriot erupts after chairman tries to forcebly use ducktape are we sure jade isnt a closet minmatar
thanks for giving me a laugh its like goonswarm childrens in the council
ahahahahahagg
this tbhim getting more and more happy by the day that i decided to pull out of the running for what is quickly becoming a circus and a farce
i hate to say i told you you so buti guess the the whole csm thing goes down as just one more of the epic failures of evemaybe once they meat in person with reps from ccp thows cool  no pun intended   non violent icelanders can defuse the situation with on the csm boardbesides is it any wonder they are like this the csm board is primarily made up of americans
putting my head above the pat again i would like to point out that in last weeks meeting  and most of this weeks meeting   a lot of useful business was donea lot of issues  are going to be brought forward to iceland  most of them fairly unanimously supported many of these changes are small tweaks which incrementally and collectively should make eve a better game for us all  even if ccp only acts on 50 of themyes the meeting last night did become ridiculous at points  which obviously isnt great  but there is still the potential for a lot of good to come out of csm so please dont judge it on the basis of these chatlogs but on the results that are deliveredif nothing changes  that will be the point we can slam the csm  until then just enjoy the entertainment
and here i was thinking i was bad at running meetings guess im not that bad after alljade you need to step down as chairman you are very obviously not fit for the position do it yourself and you might save some dignity
i bet they will people tend to behave more respectfully when face to face as opposed to via a keyboard
actually the largest national contingents are dutch  3   and english  3   we also have one dane and just two americans
with all due respect to yourself and to the others who are actually taking this seriously its deplorable how much time is wasted in these meetings for petty and ridiculous stuff if you guys need clarifications on what you should be doing and how you should be doing it with regard to the constitutions you should talk to ccp directly and stop wasting time with this inconsequential excrement that has happened for the last three meetingsyou should not be voting on or discussing how the csm should be run you should be discussing and voting on issues that the community has brought to your attention your current chairman is more interested in petty bureaucratic issues which at the end of it all have no bearing whatsoever with what you guys were elected to dostop bringing up these issues with the csm during the meetings and if you must talk about them do it on your own time on the forums or in private and then bring them to ccp yourselves you are not serving the community with thisyou should be talking about internet spaceships so for the love of all that is holy please do it
i totally agree  keep your eyes on the prize i do think a voice chat might be preferable though one would hope that would cut down on the distracting parenthetical asides
halca if you havent decided how exactly the voting is done it is pretty useless to vote so it is normal to first decide about such things
this is a problem for ccp to clarify not for them to decide arbitrarily in a meeting that is being misused for bureacratic silliness they are there to represent us not to play at politics
the problem wasnt that the problem was that jade wasnt exactly ideal but also that many other members had serious issues about knowing when to shut up 8 people trying to speak at same time on eve in game chat just does not work
my problem is that every single argument to date has been about some petty bureucratic crap that has no bearing on any of the actual issues being raised ironically when they discuss real issues they get voted on and resolved quickly instead were forced to suffer through pages of chatlogs about stuff nobody really cares about if they are really struggling this much at understanding what they should be doing and how it should be done then maybe its time for them to go talk to ccp for clarifications instead of wasting so much time on this piffle
well i read the csm logs and would agree they were fiascotastic so i thought a bit and suggested this solution
well the meeting was 75 fiasco 25 useful but ultimately good issues got onto the agenda including the councilvoted csm chair ill be pushing that one in iceland and hopefully it gets added to the constitution if it does ill be stepping down from chair and seeing what the revote brings the council will be able to vote for its own chair and ill probably get to sit back and sip fine wine but at least ill have catherded some decent issues onto the agenda and made a progressive change to the constitution in the inaugural csm anything else is pure froth at this point
unfortunately halca ccp did not give us specifics on how this would work we are therefore having to develop a constitution as we go alongtherefore this first csm was always going to be a bit messy until basic procedures are put in place in theory subsequent csms will then have a structure to work from and can avoid some of the more pointless procedural debates
pretty much yeah i find this rather surprising actually  ccp can quote a dozen philosophers in their founding document for this group but they cant toss in a oneliner about using xyzs rules of order has nobody there ever been in on a meeting
talk to ccp about it please if this is the case then you are doomed to continued failure you guys know you are wasting time with this so do something about it i seriously doubt ccp will refuse to help on this issue but if they do im sure you guys could raise some hell if it was brought to lightso far these meetings have been deplorable and they seem to be getting worse
i cannot believe were expected to pay for you all to have a free holiday to iceland it makes me sick that were expected to pay t20s wages but this as well its utterly pukeworthy and hiding it some irrelevant csm forum wont make it go away either
halca i have to disagree with you there have been plenty of good results out of the first few meetings in the shape of issues being brought forward to iceland  the majority pretty unanimouslyyes the chatlogs are messy  and plain childish at points  but please look at the bigger picture if csm can actually deliver ccp action on even 50 of the items we already have on the agenda i would consider the process to have been successful of course that still needs to happen but hopefully once we move to the face to face part people will be more reasonable  well i hope so anyway  
do csm members have staff working for them or will vista have to rewrite that document on his own
i didnt mean to say that the csm have done nothing hardin merely that you could achieve substantially more without this level of bureacracy for the sake of bureaucracy talk to ccp about the constitution and formalise the rules get them to clarify it and you will have more time to deal with the issues instead of wasting your time on something they might not be happy with anyway and in my opinion is beyond your remit in the first place
i am sure he could ask for help but otherwise he has to rewrite it on his own and all the csms have to do their write up on their ownthen again that write up seems to be linking to forum threads
i have to agree that this has been a sore point with me the entire time ccp should have defined these things yesterdays meeting was the first time i can recall the concept of a constitution being thrown around and i cant say im for the idea at all essentially i dont see a reason we couldnt all just sit down and discuss and vote on the issues without the need for all the stupid posturing and power grabbinginstead of a group of adults sitting in a room treating each other as thus were left with petty squabbling over stupid epowers that were never defined or even essentially necessary id have assumed at some point ccp would step in and end the idiocy but perhaps they see some merit in the experiment essentially everyone has their own ideas about what csm is and what their roles and responsibilities are this is now most obvious in the chairmanship role i see it  and the document seems to define it   as someone who schedules and facilitates the meetings and codifies the agenda jade appears to view it as the person in charge of the csm with signing discussion moderating and vote defining authority an executive if you willi dont think anyone expected to have a boss in this and i dont think anyone signed on for that i also dont think ccp intended such as theres no way to make that work
well the only power i believe the chair should have in these meetings is the ability to moderate discussion what that actually means is the issue that causes such friction last night we got into a ridiculous series of problems because nobody amongst the csm committee  thats all nine members   had the wit  myself included   to quote the piece from the founding document that specified simple majority voting was the default rule instead we had had a 54 in the committee on the issue and i tried to get clarification with a vote  vote was resolved some people felt they werent bound by the vote eventually husko pointed out the quote from the founding documentation and we had a revote that signified our  re  adoption of the simple majority voting systemnow i lost patience with a csm member continually interrupting these votes with offtopic comments critiques of spelling and grammar and general disparagement on the real life knowledge of people debating with themquestion is  what do you do as chair of a committee in a textbased chat when somebody will not follow the procedures of discussion and voting and is continually interrupting face to face its easy you look them in the eye and ask them to behave and restate the principle that you raise your hand to be recognized in a text chat in a badly overrunning meeting where we have the time pressure of knowing that anything we dont consider will not be on the formal iceland agenda and you have a recipe of badtempered exchanges and frustration for all concerned
its not that im surprised that jade has managed to alienate so many people with pompous selfserving and narcissistic behaviour that would shame a spoilt 12yearold im merely surprised that it has taken so longthree weeks for him to be revealed in his egotistical glory is far longer than i expected who would have thought that somebody banned by ccp for disruptive behaviour on the forums would turn out to be a disastrous selfcentred and comedic failure as a chair
again you attempt to rewrite history when the logs clearly show otherwise nobody continuously interrupted votes how delusional are you that youre making this statement not 7 posts after the actual conversation is quoted face to face you wont have a mute button if you think youre going to railroad your agenda there as well i can assure you you will find it significantly less easy
i wishyes we get to spend three days at the offices of ccp and spend another day flying there and flying home again in that trip are three weekdays  usually working days for most people  as well as a weekend thus free is misleading there are three days to be taken as holiday from work  aka losing three days holiday when we normally would have planned to take it   and there will be numerous small expenses related to our trip which wont be recoverable  i am told that beer  alcohol generally is way more expensive in iceland for a start   overall we are going there to work and will each incur unavoidable  unrecoverable expenses this isnt a playtime at fanfest izps re the thread title members didnt kick and mute each other  not plural  singular
the logs show otherwise read them
quoting an i know you are but what am i post spoken like a true child  i didnt expect you to reason your way out of it because youre wrong  
that a chair can be neutral and unbiased during a meeting and assist the parties present through the discussions  and remove themselves from the chair temporarily if they wish to say something about the subject under discussion   is not a difficult thing to achieve ive done it and im sure other members of the csm have just as im certain many forum readers  eve pilots generally have it shouldnt be the case that we need some referee in there alongside the chairin the elections i was the ninth person to be seated in the council but the rules say we are all equal once we are serving on the csm that appears to be regularly forgotten by some  hence my reminding them   and though i didnt get overwhelming support i was elected and thus i serve all pilots throughout eve not just those who voted for me i am not answerable to my corp or alliance  indeed you may have noted disagreements ive had with my corps leader on the forums   and dont have to politik my statements or decisions other than to do what i believe is in the best interests of all pilots i would like to believe that last nights meeting was an aberration and we will move on positively in futureizps two of nine isnt primarily sfaiaa 
hey jade could you just copypaste in the chatlogs that show the disruptive influence that forced you to mute a csmtia
how about you reason your way out of it how about you get the logs which have been quoted here and in other places for your convenience and make an argument as to why this member was being disruptivebecause the way i see it is the opposite that when things didnt go your way you had a hissy fit and attempted to change the outcome in various ways the first time you redefined the outcome of a vote that didnt go your way the second time you badgered two csms to change their vote in a vote that they had already voted in
inanna do you speak for all csms as being comfortable to raising objections after what has transpired
at all times i speak for myself i could not say what others may or may not believe when i speak for myself i try to best represent the interests of all eve players and not my personal belief or play stylei will however continue to query whomever is in the chair if they make a statement contrary to the agreed position or fail to explain themselves or their actions that is the duty of any member of any committee or council and despite the bullying  ongoing threats i will not change that if pilots do not feel i did a good job then they can choose to not support me at the next elections if they believe i did right then they can vote for me it is called democracy and in my opinion is better than autocracyi think there is a quote something like here i was elected here i stand and fight for them alliz
sorry but that single sentence is one of the most stupid things ive ever seen posted on these fourmswhat the hell is the point in a discussion if one person can ultimately decide what is discussed and silence anyone with whom they dont agreeits unfortunate that the csm has turned out like this and that theres so much bad feeling in the air about it actually it borders on being dissapointing to be honest
what is it with the damned hippyflowerchildpoliticallycorrect mumbo jumbo being spoken on these forums today we have an agenda rep starts bringing up a topic not on the agenda  chair  moderation   thats not on the agenda please disregard that topic we have a topic rep starts talking about a different topic  chair  moderation   thats not the topic please return to the topic we have a vote rep starts debating other peoples voting choices  chair  moderation   please refrain from interfering with the process of the vote etc etc etc moderation of a meeting does not mean censorship it means that you are doing what you can to ensure the agenda items get raised introduced everyone who has a desire to speak on it gets to speak and say their piece and then a vote happens results are recorded without some kind of moderation what is to stop the meeting simply arguing about the first agenda item for 2 hours and getting nowhere 99 of the bad feeling comes from people who for one reason or other have decided they want the csm to fail dont be one of them verone
restating votes in terms other than the ones which were actually voted on then muting people for calling you on it is censorship the things youre referring to dont appear to be in the logs
oh man that chat log is gold keep up the good work people i need more lulz jade constantine we really need a what a dong emote
quoting for posterity keep digging yourself deeper the most frustrating part of this all is your inability to accept responsibility for your actions you dont even seem to realise why what you did was wrong now youre just going to brush off the communitys outrage by saying we just want the csm to fail you if the csm doesnt remove you from chair its a failure that should be put on all of them
99 of the bad feeling comes from people who for one reason or other have decided they want the csm to fail dont be one of them veronewow
one word narcissism
i can blame ccp they thought up the crappy thing anyway you csm guys you act like a bunch of kids i hope ccp dont pull it or scrap it tho becuase if all the csm meetings are gonna be as imature as that one you will feed me with lols for a long time to come shows we elected a bunch of morons mostly next vote i wont bother
lol dont make me laugh a few dozen goon forum trolls and assorted hangers on is not the community seriously get over yourselves guys
are you familiar with the term ironyin before goon conspiracy ohwait
there is more support for this issue than there is for any of the issues you personally pushed onto the agenda under the guise of community support
1   adhere to the voting rules ccp stated stop trying to make new rules 2   inanna zuni stop interupting3   darius johnson stop being an instigating er you are so transparent its not even funny4   jade copy and paste is the true way to paraphrase ie dont paraphrase when you have a bunch of people who vote on something5   i cant believe the amarr roleplayer and the super bears are the most professional lot in that chatlog
you were a bit too slow seriously though im thinking of have a siggy made that says i muted a csm rep and 2000 goons flamed me  now thatll be funny
yep youre right
has he come out somewhere and said he was paraphrasing i asked him what he was doing and he is ignoring me
you keep telling yourself its only goons just like you told yourself you had won some vote for moderation capability just like you told yourself that inanna was being disruptive just like you told yourself that the chat logs show anything other than you being a titi think youre on meds
in a few days time you can see for yourself something tells me youll be a lot more polite in person time will tell
theres plenty of nongoons criticizing your immaturity and unprofessionalism along with fellow csm reps
i think youve got the wrong guy also how would i be able to see for myself if youre on meds would i rifle through your purse im an  not a creep
jade tried to paraphrase the first vote on the alternate member it didnt seem selfmotivated and there is a clear understanding that there are logs to make sure he doesnt twist and turn votes into something other than what they wherebut moderators dont need to do that they do get a mute button in meetings they can pull the room aside to make sure they are on track there was nothing malicious about what jade did in that log there is something darius johnson did and that was try to undermine jades postition at every opportunity he could its pathetic everything he said boiled down to who the hell do you think you arethe funny thing is people are complaining about the time in that log they want to get it done jade muted someone who kept dragging it off topic late into the meeting bane even wanted it to be over a goon jade decides to put the majority of the members ahead of one and gave a warning that is what i sawthis is turning out to be a really poor soap jade stated he already wanted to step down as csm chair well before the incident what else do you want from the guy seriously its nothing but a big target unless a goon with a forum brigade gets the position and keeps the threads rolling in their favor by volumes of worthless circle jerking threadsmight as well just shut down the csm and let ccp write it off as a lost cause
in my eyes given the amount of putrid adolescent slush thats poured out of the mouths of the very people who should be running the csm its already failedas for your other points im not saying that a meeting shouldnt be chaired im questioning what the hell the point is in a meeting when people whore taking part cant put their viewpoints across because theyre silenced by an overzealous channel moderator
he might not be but im looking forward to you trying to mute people when your in iceland its a lot harder without the button
what are the icelandic laws if a public brawl or fight takes place what is ccps stance on it cause judging by the way the forums have exploded and judging by how people are reacting there might be a fight people could be more polite in person or not
ccp could always claim it is a sporting event sumo wrestling
um nowhere is it stated any member of the csm should be muting anyone least of all for having an opinion my statement of who the hell are you stands the chair is a meeting planner nothing more its not undermining if the actual authority doesnt exist it doesnt nobody in my opinion dragged anyone off topic with the exception of jade repeatedly i dont seem to be the only person of this opinion so i feel i still have some handle on my sanityalso you mention jade stating he wants to step down repeatedly ive said repeatedly that he is well within his rights to do so nothings stopping him whatsoever
begs the question why did jade do that its quite clear that jade editorialized not once but twice the vote that hardin put forward then when someone questioned said editorializing jade got indignant that they were disrupting the meeting bull the editorializing was disrupting the meetingobjections are only disruptive when they are frivolous was it certainly not if its not and it wasnt   then the disruption is caused by the person doing whatever was objectionablein both instances the first when jade editorialized a vote that had gone against her way and the second when jade badgered two people who voted in a manner that did not suit her needs to change their vote on an issue she wanted passed it was jade who was doing the disrupting then why hasnt jade done so the csm document provides provisions for said step down and jade had read the csm document at the time of making said claimit seems that when someone makes a claim in full knowledge of what that claim means then they dont follow through on that claim when the time comes to do so they were lying about their original intent
i stand by that moderation decision 100 i dont care if 10000 goons get up on their hind legs and cry primal soliloquies to the moon about this if a disruptive csm member is preventing us getting the business of the meeting done then i believe the chair has the right to temp mute them to get the business of the vote underway this wasnt about stopping discussion  the person in question had their say  many times   and their objections were noted  but the group wanted to move to the vote and get it done sorry if it chaffs your sense of political correctness verone but i believe getting through the agenda items and properly representing the player base that voted for us is more important than listening to pointless circular arguments that have already been stated in the course of the meeting
lol and she just keeps going like the duracell bunny but less professional what i like the most writing it off as a goon campaign when clearly several members of the council have raised their concerns about her behaviour and so have a lot of other  nongoons   people how can one be that delusional yes jade constantine you actually ed a whole lot of people off and it will come and bite you lets see how your self importance goes once youve lost your epowers
i heard iceland has the oldest democratic parliament of the world they probably have a rich history of vikings chopping off eachothers heads in heated debates the next meeting in iceland will be recorded right i mean thats very important csm should be transparent and all that
further irony in the same post you can insinuate only goons are complaining while addressing verones  who is most certainly not a goon   concerns which mirror those of everyone elsethis is called psychosis disconnection from reality
to clarify this point with something that was said in another thread which i had to correct here is the vote in question and context to the post
oh man thats a great quote
im 100 standing by my decision to moderate when someone points out something i have done incorrectly and later admit to right
none of the concerns brought up have convinced me that there was anything incorrect about the moderation decision i stand by it 100 if ccp think i was wrong they can sack me if the csm think i was wrong they can support my motion to make the chair an elected position and then vote for somebody else at this point thats all anybody can substantively say on issue we can have another 1000 goon posts complaining about muting and pretending to care about the process of the csm but it will make precisely no differencei made a call i stick by it move on or keep crying either way the agenda is going forward and well see what happens in iceland
csm with jade 20080608 220228  lavista vista  this is a waste of everybodys time
i love the way people voted for hardins proposition that allows csm members who are late to a meeting come in after the current agenda item is overand then jades idea of paraphrasing
i chuckle at the thought that anyone would even consider me to be concerned about political correctnessback to the point in question i still fail to see where you even remotely used a sense of rational judgement when moderating the meeting in question moreover it seems to me that this is the first instance of a csm member using their position to force their voice to be heard over another equally important voicewhen i withdrew from the csm applicants list i mused on how long it would be before this kind of thing would occur sadly i had more faith than i should have and it was misplaced due to the fact a mere matter of weeks into the first councils office its already happeningon a serious note im concerned jade extremely concerned if youre the elected person whos chosen to represent my voice and that of the the rest of the community in an office with ccp in a sensible well presented and mature way then how do you think it makes myself and thousands of others feel to see you throwing your toys out of the playpen and throwing your weight about when you cant get your own wayand all this just a couple of weeks into a six month termim concerned jade and as someone who you were elected to represent i have to ask you were elected in by the majority vote because people had faith in you to act in a becoming manner of someone given the position of csm chairman how do you intend on repairing the apparently massive damage thats been done to the working relationship between csm members because of your hasty and overzealous silencing of people who arent saying what you want to hearplease dont take this post as bigotry because trolling you i am notim genuinely concerned where the already visible divide between members of the csm will lead
what about another 1000 posts from nongoons im a mission running rping carebear who lives in high sec where i can stare at my shiny toys with impunity and i think you were out of line reactionary and completely delusional in your enforcement of your imaginary powers im shocked and a little dismayed to see that the two goon representatives on the council are outclassing you in spades
why not there are two sides to an argument nuh uh is not one of them no they cannot there is no provision for that in the csm document did you even read the thingno they cannot did you even read the csm document the csm brings the issues to ccp ccp responds there is no ability to change the csm document granted to the csmthe only way that the chair can be an elected position as current is for you to step down as you promised you would as allowed by the csm document when you were running where the council would then elect a new chairman why dont you honor your promise why instead do you choose to redefine the debate to suit your needs there is no fox news on these forums to parrot your reality jade all we have is the facts and they disagree with you
resolutions darius has an axe to grind put it away read up on what chairmanship means jade will restrain the desire to mute as it is far more damaging than useful everyone there will behave differently next time their underwear like anyones are better unrevealedas i read the logs i was amazed at the utter deluge of interruptions from half the csm i have chaired many similar text chat meetings and the only way it works is to shut up until it is your turn to speak everyone will  should   have a turn with the floor usually granted in the order of requests placed the job of the chair is to signal when the next person has the floor when a person is finished speaking  has the floor   they signal to the chair that they relinquish the floor nobody else speaks in that interval including the chair when that process fails the person disrupting must be handled or the meeting falls apart quicklythere was only one person following this protocol and she gained the attention of the chair with an  cheers to the one person doing it right   ill bet all my isk the next meeting is more civil on all sides
well jacque  this is the motion from the agenda i wanted to be sure on precisely what we were agreeing too as you will note from the chatlog  anytime people questioned my paraphrasing i invited them to restate themselves for the record
ccp can indeed remove council members
no damage has been done this is all forum froth and trolling in reality well sit down next week and whenever and continue our job you are welcome to your opinion that this was hasty and overzealous muting i  and incidentally the v chair   am of the opinion it was entirely correct muting of a person who had fallen into a pattern of disruptive behaviour in the meeting i have no opinions about what people say in meetings its the when im concerned about as long as they follow the proper order of debate they respect other recognized speakers and they curtail their interruptions when asked there will be no further problems
this is a lie again the first time you stated it wrong you were corrected the second time you restated it incorrectly after the vote had occured and when inanna objected you officially warned herhere is the freaking chat log copied and pasted into this window for you to see again from the original point of you misrepresenting to the vote to the point of you warning inannaUFEFF 20080608 183027  jade constantine  1st is issue is  can a candidate walk back in a meeting in process that has empowered an alternate and immediately dislodges the alternate and regains his positionUFEFF 20080608 183040  hardin  great phrasing their jadeUFEFF 20080608 183043  darius johnson  thats a misleading way of framing itUFEFF 20080608 183047  inanna zuni  issue of proxies is not on the tableUFEFF 20080608 183051  jade constantine  rephrase it please hardinUFEFF 20080608 183059  jade constantine  and well vote on your phrasingUFEFF 20080608 183102  jade constantine  goUFEFF 20080608 183111  inanna zuni  yes biased statement there by chair UFEFF 20080608 183129  hardin  1st issue is can the elected candidate return to a meeting and regain voting rights when the debate moves on to the next item on the agendaUFEFF 20080608 183146  serenity steele  i vote noUFEFF 20080608 183149  bane glorious  ayeUFEFF 20080608 183151  jade constantine  i vote noUFEFF 20080608 183152  ankhesentapemkah  nayUFEFF 20080608 183156  hardin  ayeUFEFF 20080608 183157  darius johnson  yesUFEFF 20080608 183202  inanna zuni  ayeUFEFF 20080608 183205  dierdra vaal  vote against  at least until the issue of alternate terms has been solved  UFEFF 20080608 183207  lavista vista  ayeUFEFF 20080608 183216  jade constantine  okay its carriedUFEFF 20080608 183230  hardin  thank youUFEFF 20080608 183305  jade constantine  alternates can be removed from csm rep voting status at any time by a candidate arriving at the meetingUFEFF 20080608 183308  jade constantine  next partUFEFF 20080608 183315  ankhesentapemkah  nayUFEFF 20080608 183316  inanna zuni  jadeUFEFF 20080608 183322  inanna zuni  please do not editorialize a decisionUFEFF 20080608 183327  jade constantine  please phrase your 2nd part of the vote please hardin UFEFF 20080608 183329  hardin  2nd issue is should an alternate step and begin voting when an elected rep leaves the meeting for whatever reasonUFEFF 20080608 183342  jade constantine   inanna please stop interruptingUFEFF 20080608 183356  inanna zuni  jade  please chair neutrally thenUFEFF 20080608 183426  jade constantine  im going to ask you formally now inanna  please stop interrupting the process of the voteUFEFF 20080608 183433  bane glorious  inanna has a pointUFEFF 20080608 183448  bane glorious  if you want everyone else to play by the rules you should tooand here is the original proposal in context that was motioned to be voted on before your first attempt to change the proposalUFEFF 20080608 181124  hardin  okayUFEFF 20080608 181127  hardin  i proposeUFEFF 20080608 181142  serenity steele  emote suggests take it in 2 parts if its easierUFEFF 20080608 181155  lavista vista  emote agreesUFEFF 20080608 181201  hardin  that once one of the duly elected csm candidates returns to a meeting he resumes his voting rights on the next item of the agendanow stop lying
really i couldnt find it in the document where is it
im sure youd like it if that were the case im honestly ed and not too impressed with you this afternoon nor was i yesterday i dont imagine that will change this week unless you ask your future self to go back in time and prevent past you from muting a council member with no cause by my math 2 isnt much of a plurality
look for eula violations as a key word ill find it if you cant i cant get at the doc right this second
lol darius come on you loathed me from before we both got elected i said no damage is done not that were best chums we disliked each other before the csm elections we dislike each other now nothings changed but that doesnt mean we cant look at issues about internet spaceships and cast votes
discussing spaceships and casting votes im all for unfortunately someone went ape yesterday making that difficult stick to the agenda and dont try to silence or bully people and well all be happy birds
so let me get this straight youre pretty much saying that although the vast majority of people whove posted and whom you chair a body to represent completely disagree with your treatment of csm members and are up in arms about it you see nothing wrong with it and as such you did the correct thingfurthermore youre stating that youll continue to do the same thing if you feel that someone is getting in the way of what you have to say and that you have no problem silencing members of the csm for no other reason than to be able to talk over themyou have blinders on to the world jade and theres something seriously wrong with the csm and its goals if you feel that this should be your role
as i havent got an answer from jade on this point despite myself and others asking repeatedly maybe you can point to when and where i kept dragging it off topic as i really cant iz
oh god you guys are so immature its ridiculous the transcription and this thread makes the majority of you guys look like idiots  yes both you jade constantine and darius johnson with your witty crew of hurf blurf goon followers   its pretty obvious you guys cant be impartial about all this for whatever your personal reasons so either get ccp to make you a solid constitution with appropriate bylaws quit the csm or snap the  up and leave your baggage at the door during the discussionsthe best part of the csm will be the inevitable youtube video of the future fist fight between jade and darius
i am sorry i was excluding the eligibility segment since jades post was clearly indicating that they had the power to remove csms at their digression rather than if they violated a preexisting agreement which precluded their involvement in the gamethough it should be noted that both the documents do not actually provide a manner in which ccp can remove a csm only when a player may not run technically since a csm is no longer running after they have been elected there is no way for ccp to remove them though i doubt they would care with an eula violation
yep since the vast majority of posters here are goons with an agenda to promote and are enjoying the simple joy of trolling and since this vast majority  a few dozen individual posters at best its easy to ignore especially since the motivation of these posters is ridiculously transparentnope thats absolutely not what i said and you know it poor play verone very poor
ill look everything over later i could have sworn there was some line in there regarding ccp being able to remove people
i thought so too but i went and checked and didnt find it v0vi could have missed it though
and that is the very point i was making when i asked you to stop editorialising the original motion was a positive  elected reps taking their rightful place  whereas you were redefining it as a negative  alternates get dumped whilst i am very happy that  some   alternates are in the meeting channel and can step in as required it is the elected members who are here to serve the podpilot population for their sixmonth term your reworking made out that the elected members mattered less than the oh so close but no tomato ones and i saw that as very wrongiz
no that is what you said and you know it you know it because we have quoted you in this thread doing what you did and you are quoted here in this thread saying you would do the same thingso either the record is wrong and its not its copy pasted from the logs and formatted officially by the secretary you were lying when you said that you would do it again or you were not lying when you said you would do it again and verones interpretation is correct neither outcome is very flattering for you
just because goons post on the forum it doesnt make it falsealso i think the reaction i have had from people who contacted me out of the blue on messenger says it all jade saying something is false doesnt make it true people have documented your behaviour trough logs you have only stated that people are wrong
whist i personally think jade was incorrect for a number of reason to mute you i would like to take this particular opportunity to ask you to leave that area well alone if the goons or any other alliancecorp represented on the csm decided to war dec star fraction for a slight on the csm i would expect most of the allaince would do two things first laugh at people not being able to keep out of game activites out of game and secondly cheers for a free war and whilst you may wish to quote a certain 80s tv show in regards to your opinion on this subject it is quite clear what you are implying by bringing it up furtheremore i personally feel that the ones at fault is mostly ccp for not providing the csm will more structure before deploying it as i think most of the arguements diagrements and time wasting of the last couple of weeks can clearly be placed at thier door for the lack of support in creating this council in regards to the procedural side of the csm if there had have been more of it in place the csm could have got on with representing the people who voted for them straight out the gate rather than it having to spend all this time bickering about simple matter of internal policy maybe if we quote star fraction members that think jade was wrong on a number of things hell listenthat is hearthstone here
after reading the chatlog i must say that the incident was unlucky and maybe jade was a bit too hasty with the mute but seriously the way some people smack on jade is just childish and ridiculous
aside from the other odd chatting etc that went on gotta say i agree with the following sry couldnt help but to notice this onehardin  arriving 5 mins late for a meeting shouldnt exclude the democratically elected candidate from not participatinggotta say i agree with that one post right there why the hell would i want an alternate to vote instead of someone who was voted in just cause the guy was 5 minutes late  mid vote on topic 1 per say hardin arrives but doesnt know whats up  sure let the alternate vote on that one topic on to next topic alternate leaves hardin  in the example   would take over
that was precisely how the majority of the council felt about it
now youre putting words in my mouthwhe you run out of arguments jade it boils down to one thing apparently i have an issue with you or goonfleet have an issue with you or someone else who disagrees has an issue with you and doesnt like you and therefore is trying to troll youthats not the case in this instance i still regard you as one of the most respected players in the game hence the position youve been put in by the playerbaseif i was trying to troll you cause you problems or be a pain for you trust me youd know about it and these words would be a lot harsherim genuinely concerned because i dont feel that as a chairman you should be silencing any member of the csm who wants to speak and has the right to do so
verone myself and you havent often seen eye to eye in the past on a whole multitude of issueswhat i will say here though is that what you have posted in this thread is 100 spot on and has been echoed in various channels i sit ini havent been an avid supporter of the whole csm thing from the start because it was pretty evident that this is the way it would go i cant say im glad to see myself proven right thoughjade just because somebody disagrees with you does not mean that they have an issue with you or they are trying to troll you
fixed that quote for ya
believe me im so glad my opinion changed and i decided to withdraw
not a goon and i completely agree with verone and by chancesome goonsadd the power crazed behavior obvious attempts at manipulation and spin in rephrasing resolutions for dramatic effect and top it off with the over zealous support of a star fraction specific agenda and you have a total disaster in the chairman role hard to imagine a worse combination of immaturity egomania and a total committment to a self serving agenda all bottled up into person sitting in the chairman seata terrible shame for what could have been a decent social experiement in eve
i feel sorry for jade lost his time his gf and now his virtual reputation  if he ever had one  maybe he should resign and let csm try to recover
whether or not they had the right to do so is the question it depends on whether there are rules of order or whether any csm rep can shout whatever they want wheneve they wantif the chairs job is to lead the meeting and ensure it adheres to rules of order then it surely is the chairs job to call for silence when participants are out of orderthe question is whether there are rules of order  either implicitly or explicitly  that the participants are supposed to be abiding byserenity steele may have been using a method of requesting the floor of his own devising but all the council members should be behaving with that sort of decorum otherwise we have the parentheticals and exclamations that get in the way of an orderly discussion where everyone has a turn to say their peacei dont think the intention is for the csm chamber to be a place where people shout over each other and in the end that means someone has to be able to enforce order if the members cannot contain themselves to orderly conduct
if ccp wanted that they should have specified such and put a democratic process in place to choose the groups chair most votes overall is a poor way to determine thisanother alternative would have been for them to appoint someone to chair the meetings my main problem with the process so far hasnt been order its been the lack of guidance from ccp and the usurping of power by people not responsible for doing soif you look to the meeting prior to yesterday youll see that as long as we stick to spaceships and away from power grabs we are quite capable of carrying on a dialogue without the need for a daddy
isnt this the social experiment going pretty well as expectedthere is no reason the csm cant still obtain success in their original goal as long as everyone can take a step back calm down and get back to the task at hand anyone with real life board experience knows that people make mistakes cant shut up talk out of turn get their nose outof joint get worked up etc at meetings it doesnt mean you ask for resignations or give up on the process you just just take a breath prepare your material as best you can and go into the next meeting trying to be as progressive and productive as possiblethere are a lot of good points made in these threads  and this is not a stfu post   but lets give them a chance to sort things out on their own blatent optimism i know but if i didnt have some faith in people id have quit this game long ago
good heavens could you be more dramatic do you think my dog and goldfish are going to die next listen to yourself i volunteered to an elected position on a bloody player council in a mmorpg i muted somebody in a meeting to let a vote get counted now my virtual reputation  whatever that is   lies in tatters ive lost my time  sounds like a doctor who plot   and ive lost my gf though how youd know anything about my personal life ive got no clue go outdoors smell the fresh air get a sense of perspective and have a beergo find a girlfriend and have some fun mate shakes his head kids today honestly
actually i am quite surprised to see the meeting progress when no in game politics are involved so when they are talking space ships you get to actually see objective game mechanic discussions at play  for the most part  but when the power play comes in and epeen muscles are being flexed that is when we see the crap i am sorry but there should be no reason to silence any one with in the context of that last meeting it was a bit over the top and unnecessary if jade would have just listened more to the group and less to hear himself talk you would have had a very short and productive meeting a sign of a good leader is someone who listens more than heshe speaks and leads more than heshe dictates
somehow i doubt if my comments in that meeting would add up to a substantial proportion of the 4hour running time but continue with the silly trollwar its all getting a bit desperate maybe my parrot dies next right
hell yes to this cheers to you all for sticking it out and getting issues on the table with ccp as thats the most important thingthat said ccp did appoint a chair  the person with the most votes and they charged that chairperson with leading the meetings implicit in leading meetings is keeping some semblance of order and moving the discussion and agenda forward while you suggest that the chair has no powers the only documentation of how the csm is supposed to run says the chairperson runs the meetingsit would have been nice if ccp had written detailed instructions but they didnt its up to you guys to work together to keep things moving and the only instruction given is that jades supposed to lead that effort i think its fair to argue with the exact nature of how hes supposed to do that but to claim ccps intention was that he have no authority on which to lead meetings is false as it does say in the csm document that that is his job as chairperson
the guy who yells fire in a crowded theater doesnt do much running either but that doesnt mean the commotion and delays caused were someone elses fault
looking at the mirror jade
further irony jade criticizing fellow eve players for being nerdy despite his own lesbianloveaffairroleplaying
sir i am not a troll nor i am trolling nor did i make any comments about any of your supposed real life issues nor do i care i am much as apart of this process as you or any one else i am apart of the friggin player base i am voicing my concerns and views based on what i am seeing and experiencing both here and in the damn game you can not silence me like when you mash the mute button on your fellow csm members your actions speak louder than your self delusional rants you created this mess and now you are trying to push it off to others including the player base that happen to have voted for you
as soon as i saw your corporate ticker i chose to disregard your post knowing full well what its content would be
well im sorry to ask but isnt that a bit narrowminded when you are criticizing somebody
its exactly what jade does so v0v
well if you are going to quote my dear chap learn to read things before you quote k first its heartstone not hearthstone and i said he was wrong to mute her for a number of reasons not wrong on a number of things as to the issue of wether the chairvchair should have the power to mute i think it is frankly pretty obvious he should indeed have this power as asking someone to be quiet and let the agenda continue without some way of making them  eventually   having it otherwise would be akin to someone standing on top of a hill 5 miles away from a music festival shouting would you chaps there mind keeping it downin any case with the quite obvious axes to grind around here i shant expect my words to have any affect really have fun damning someone who has put an insane amount of work and effort into this for not doing it the way you like shrug
well thats a yp not an mp
given past experience all ive seen when ive disagreed with jade is members under his roster blindly agreeing with him regardless of the subject when things get heatedso to answer your question no i dont feel its narrow minded at all given the situation
would u guys all shut up and shake hands youve ben elected by the community to represent us not  about with ego issues on both sidesdo the job u put ur self up for and were elected to do
probably for the best nobody who stood doesnt have leather for skin anyway im sure itll be handshakes and smiles at the next meeting before we on the dramallama for the next set of fun rides dont worry about all this froth as long as we keep pumping through the issues we are actually doing the job
the council will be able to vote for its own chair and ill probably get to sit back and sip fine wine but at least ill have catherded some decent issues onto the agenda and made a progressive change to the constitution in the inaugural csmnice but remember those other 8 players that were also on the council and voted on those catherded issuesplus you are forgetting it isnt the csms or chairs responsibility to make changes to the constitution all such matters should be directed to ccp to make rulings on such as alternates in meetings muting representatives etcyou have no more power in a meeting than any other csm representative you can chair the meeting but a failure of a meeting is your responsibility and no one elses you have no rights to make final rulings etc read the documents again then post the passages that give you those rightstake carebruce hansen i still see you have yet to step down as chairman despite your election promise
reposted from aboveccp did appoint a chair  the person with the most votes and they charged that chairperson with leading the meetings implicit in leading meetings is keeping some semblance of order and moving the discussion and agenda forward while you suggest that the chair has no powers the only documentation of how the csm is supposed to run says the chairperson runs the meetingsit would have been nice if ccp had written detailed instructions but they didnt its up to you guys to work together to keep things moving and the only instruction given is that jades supposed to lead that effort i think its fair to argue with the exact nature of how hes supposed to do that but to claim ccps intention was that he have no authority on which to lead meetings is false as it does say in the csm document that that is his job as chairperson
yawn why do you keep flogging this dead horse i said id do my best to get a change to the constitution that made the csm chair elected by the committee ive written publicly discussed and commended the issue to the csm its been added to the iceland agenda if i manage to see this put into the constitution by vote and consultancy with ccp ill step down and stand for reelection as chair under the new rules if it doesnt get added to the constitution i wont its fairly simple to understand i want to ensure that no future csm session will be led by a person who wins the popular vote but isnt capable of chairing meetings if i dont get this surety then there is no purpose to resigning and ill stand as chair for the full session
nice job with the deflect and redirective been entertained all day with a million posts about this and i still havent seen you accept your fellow csms view that you acted out of line until that happens i think the handshakes will be in short supplywhat ive read of your responses in chat logs and forum posts have been a number of excuses deflections redirects personal attacks broad sweeping generalizations about player groups and other blather if you really think reconciliation is the appropriate way forward showing you have the humility to admit you were wrong might go a long way in moving onso will you admit that you acted out of line  this question only needs a yes or no answer but i dont see that coming  
you have no freakin clue all the bodies which have decisional powers ive interacted with are chaired by an entity which has power to maintain the discussions on track according to the agenda this include the ability to stop a useless diatribe expel a member for the duration of the session or even abort and postpone said sessionits done the same way from shareholder up to parliament  house sessions the number of occurrences of sentences which had nothing or little to do with the matter at hand in these chatlogs is staggeringso imho jade displayed quite a bit of restraint before acting anyhow the csm looks exactly how i was expecting it to be a kindergarten full of overbloated egos
im going to say i made three mistakes 1 i didnt restate the rules of discussion and debate in the meeting at the beginning 2 i should have simply copy and pasted the vote intros 3 i should have taken a direct judgment on the simple majority thing  and should have known in advance what the doc said  for that stuff im happy to apologize and say ill do better next time but on the issue of muting a member of the council after 3 warnings in order to protect the process of a vote  absolutely not i stand by that decision 100 and would do it again
yawn why do you keep flogging this dead horse i said id do my best to get a change to the constitution that made the csm chair elected by the committee ive written publicly discussed and commended the issue to the csm its been added to the iceland agenda if i manage to see this put into the constitution by vote and consultancy with ccp ill step down and stand for reelection as chair under the new rules if it doesnt get added to the constitution i wont its fairly simple to understand i want to ensure that no future csm session will be led by a person who wins the popular vote but isnt capable of chairing meetings if i dont get this surety then there is no purpose to resigning and ill stand as chair for the full sessionthis issue keeps coming up because its something you said youd do before being elected and now havent done again i ask you where the passages are that give you the right to change the csm constitution i see no evidence of submission of csm constitution stuff to ccp for rulings just proposals and votes in the csm meetingsyou have now put conditions on standing down as chair i also see that agenda item 4  science and industry   had the voting before discussion and during it can you as chairman please explain clearly and concisely what the vote for this item was for and what forum posts we can expect to see in regard to the issues listed in the volumous pdf documenttake carebruce hansen
ive told you what i said and thats precisely what i am doing
arithron where did you see this conditionless promise to stand down as chair if elected i dont see it anywhere are you sure about that
it was in one of the livechats interviews iirc you deflected the question with irrelevant information you didnt promise to look at the csm document and then attempt to change it you promised to step down if you had that position and then let the council elect its own you failed to meet that promise i mean how hard is it you said you would do something and when the time came you didnt do it
again i ask you where the passages are that give you the right to change the csm constitution i see no evidence of submission of csm constitution stuff to ccp for rulings just proposals and votes in the csm meetingsstill managing to avoid this one since its proving a little harder than you thought to find those passages
oh so its posted as an mp3 or something somewhere link
probably not not all of them were recorded notice how jade isnt saying she didnt say it if you want to look in archives of this thread he was called out on it you will notice in that thread jade did not say he did not make the claim only refused to do it
you can ask jade since he isnt denying stating that hed stand down as chairman take carebruce hansen
lol seriously only way it can be done is for us to raise an issue on the topic  as ive done with the electable chair proposal   well present it to ccp and ask if we can do it if they say yes its done if that happens ill set down and well have an elected chair immediately i really dont understand where you are going with this line of questioning
as far as i know there is no recording or mp3 or whatnot it was an open vent session when i said i felt the csm should have an elected chair and if i got elected id lobby to get the constitution changed issue raiseccp agreed i got asked  what if you win and become chairman i said id still push for the measure and step down for reelection when it was done others have tried to make an issue of this but really there is no issue im intending to do what i said id do and try my best to get this measure though if i cant get it through then i have absolutely no intention of resigning and i will stand as chair for the session regardless
actually you are supposed to be presenting to ccp player issues not csm constitution ones you seem to make decisions in meetings and through votes that will not be put to ccp this frankly is an abuse of power by the csm and not its purpose csm mechanisms if in doubt should be clarified through ccp directly not group decisions by the chair and representatives before clarification if it takes some time to come you should be guided by the csm documentswhich give you no rights to changedecidepropose alterations of the csm constitutionbesides any issue that is discussed and voted upon must be put to the players via the threads for 7 daysbruce hansen
no seriously the csm document clearly states that the chairman can step down and the council can elect a new chairman the way it happens is if you buck up and step down like you claimed do i have to get the quote and the page for you like weve had show you the chatlogs proving you are wrong in the primary matter of this thread
it was
actually i was referring to other csm issues apart from the chairman onesuch as alternatesabstaining etcim also asking for the written evidence that allows the csm to vote on these matters at all you have produced no evidence regarding ccp rulings on any matters regarding csm constitution changes or csm meetings etcbruce hansen
indeed and herein lies the problem as ive expressed elsewhere i feel that the csm shouldnt have to spend all its time trying to piece together a way for it to work and should in fact be discussing the issues that matter to us who is at fault in the end well i dont think its jade i dont think its darius or ank or any other csm member i think the problem lies entirely with ccps inability to organise it properly in the first place
or the inability of the csm to actually ask ccp for rulings and guidance on these matters instead they chose to act outside their scope entirelybruce hansen
thats because were making it up as we go along arithron sorry but there it is i mean we could have met first time and saidwhat shall we do dunnoummm what should we dodunnohow should we handle all this stuffdunnowe know lets ask ccpmeeting adjourneddrinks on me great meeting everyone next meeting  so what did they say umm nothing reallywhat yeah they said its all in the documentationummwhatlets ask for clarificationexcellent meeting adjournedgreat meeting guys drinks on meinstead we opted yes to make it up as we went along and try and score the win condition of taking a bunch of issues to iceland from a running start with 3 weeks and a bunch of forum trolling to put up with end of the day were going make that win condition and i for one am pretty happy to say to the electorate that they made the right choice to elect some cando grifters in the role rather than a bunch of people who wouldnt dare take a move without everything signed and sealed in triplicate with the favorable entrails of a dove and the blessing of a local clergyman have we made mistakes hell yes have we at least got something done hell yes lets have a big drink of glass half full here and look on the bright side you bunch of moody soandsos
so every record of jades position on this is consistent except for the one recounted by an unknown person who heard it differently late one night
who are you calling a moody soandso i think you do a disservice to those candidates who were unsuccessful by suggesting that they would have not applied themselves diligently to the job as most of the csm representatives have doneyour assertions regarding ccp are frankly unfair as you did have a ccp member in your first meeting where you could have put csm mechanism specifics to get clarification besides i am sure they would have given requests from the csm on csm matters good thought and prompt responseit still gives the csm no right to make things up and step outside their remit as specified in the csm documentation that was an error i am glad to see you have finally admitted to thank you time for the csm to send a mail to ccp regarding some csm mechanism questions and constitutional matters ehtake carebruce hansen
after reading the lengthy chatlog of the recent meeting of the csm it becomes quite apparent that they really need a neutral arbitrator torun the meetings someone with no vote who enforces rules of order and the like and can keep the meeting from turning into a free for all it was quite clear that inanna didnt think jade had the authourity to give warnings and it was also clear that jade was frustrated by what he felty were disturbances to the voting process this could be solved by someone with no personal agenda as a representative conducting the meeting in a neutral fashion this person would have no vote and their only goal would be to make sure that everything is handled fairly and even handedly something along the lines of the parliamentary speaker of the house  at least the way its used here in canada  
more people more imaginary and misunderstood powers more fail
to clarify re i am quite happy that a chair should be able to warn a member that they have done something clearly wrong but in both cases as i had not  indeed past meetings have had comments from others clearly disruptive to the smooth flow of the meeting   i asked for a clarification of what i was supposed to have done and what a warning actually signified instead of getting answers to my questions  and neither did others get responses when they asked   i was muted and locked out of the discussion imho far exceeding any authority that the chair may haveiz
 jade constantine  i hope these are steps that will never be needed this led to a vote on the principle of operator rights that confirmed that csm officers would maintain operator rights  yesterday i took your request for reclarification of this statement on record to be spurious and again an attempt to prevent the vote in progress from coming to a conclusion the discussion was over wed moved to the vote you were not locked out of the discussion you were muted to prevent you continuing to obstruct the process of the vote as you can see from the timing of the log i attempted to unmute you the moment after i formally called for voting preferences
youre grasping at straws if you think any amount of silencing a person on that council for any circumstance is acceptable
obviously i disagree with you  im disagreeing with a lot of goons today it seems  
say the guy role playing ehookers rolleyes
stop lying liarthis is the vote in question20080531 193138  jade constantine  everyone in favour of everyone having op rights in the csm channel say aye UFEFF 20080531 193144  ankhesentapemkah  yes for universal op rightsUFEFF 20080531 193145  inanna zuni  ayeUFEFF 20080531 193152  darius johnson  noUFEFF 20080531 193155  jade constantine  nayUFEFF 20080531 193156  serenity steele  noUFEFF 20080531 193156  dierdra vaal  ayeUFEFF 20080531 193158  lavista vista  nayUFEFF 20080531 193204  bane glorious  gonna go with nayUFEFF 20080531 193221  tusko hopkins  ayeUFEFF 20080531 193243  jade constantine  thats a no then so it looks like you are again redefining a vote to suit your needs note how there is nothing in that vote that says the csm chairman retains op rights and the ability to mute others it simply says that this right should not be given to everyone it does not say anywhere that the right should be given to anyone just that it should not be given to everyonethe discussion then moved on to the template document
i think this again demonstrates the need for a neutral arbitrator with no vote clearly there is a point of view issue here and neither side is being objective on the issue this is what i believe in the end will make the csm useless some good things were done in that meeting but it has already started to degenerate personalities will always clash as will ideas and what some people think is right and wrong a neutral arbitrator with a clearly defined set of rules and practices can help keep the process working instead of degenerating into a free for all
i choose veronemaybe sirmolle
chribba might also be a good choice
isnt there some sort of scandinavian word for this kind of role ombudsman is that what this arbitrator would be
an ombudsman is more of a supervisory position that would check onthings for the public interest  like a legislative investigator   what im thinking of is someone who would attaempt to keep the peace in a csm meeting using something like roberts rules of order or something similar so that issues could be discussed and voted on without bogging down forever and things could be accomplished it also has the advantage of helping meetings not become overlong etc
arbitrators are cool but you might need something with more firepower here perhaps an abaddon
all that needs to happen here is for the csm who do not have the floor to shut up until the chair gives them the floor that is the essence of their job if the chair fails to fairly grant the floor ask ccp to replace themlooking at the logs it is obvious half of the group have no clue how to behave in a text meeting the next meeting should have jade directly giving the floor to an individual priority based on the item list sponsor as a primary speaker and secondarily to impromptu requests for the floor in all cases the only interruption is a  in the chat abuse and repeated interjection would be the only justification for muting in the case of this meeting it was chaos from the start due to people feeling anarchy was the mode and nobody was their boss somebody is different and that is the chairman they sort the trafficword to the chairmannever paraphrase the content of a vote cut and paste verbatimword to the committeeshush till you have the floor
this and everything will be fine
yesto properly fulfil their roles csm members must be emotionally invested in their motionsto properly maintain order a speaker must be emotionally detatchedcsm members cant act as speaker as well as debating motions
sounds like a good idea to me ill try my best to make sure this happens
totally agree we dont need the worst of goonies in the csm keep bane remove darius
i am sure darius would gladly step down to a suitable replacement if it meant jade was removed as well   
does anyone else see the irony in being called a simpleton by someone who doesnt understand basic punctuationi agree however out with that awful darius what with his powertrips and frequent abuse of moderation abilities
great post i especially like the part about not going to read the thread and then not not going to read this thread again later
naw darius wouldnt step down youre forgetting his ego must really burn his cookies the way everyone seems to prefer bane over himwindjammer

after a power outage i just got around to finishing my reading of the chatlogs and im pretty ed off at the conduct of the meeting the chair decided to arbitrarily mute a member of the council who had done nothing wrong til the vote and then proceeded to remute her twice more without ever actually letting the block off until after the vote had already taken place and this was on the basis of two formal warnings for conduct that is entirely normal in a textbased meeting  the first was for calling a point of order and the second was for taking marginally longer to type a comment than it took jade to ask for silence this is abuse of power of the highest order on the part of the chair and im incredibly disappointed to see it also on the issue of abstentions its a total nonissue and the fact that a minute was spent on it is wasteful let alone an hour abstention  afk  absent from meeting except as regards quorum and replacement by alternates if aye  nay the motion passes and if nay  aye the motion fails abstentions have no weight whatsoever  serenity is appallingly wrong when he says that they be counted as nays and ankh is understandably wrong but still wrong   when she says that majorityabstain is a failed vote if eight of you abstain and one aye vote is cast the motion is passed its the same as what happens if say 90 of eligible eve accounts choose not to cast a csm ballot  we dont throw out the results we simply record the votes of those who chose to cast a vote and go from there
this is actually a technical problem we discovered with the chat channel  the first notification of a mute is where i muted inanna  following polite requests and two formal warnings against disruptive conduct   the second notification of a mute  immediately before the vote   is actually me clicking unmute which for some bizarre reason doesnt work and ends up kicking the person from the channel the third notification of a mute is actually the unmute once shed been reinvited to the channel by me  there are technical problems with the mute system in that channel  we checked all this afterwards btw  but technical issues aside its the role of the chair to moderate meetings if people are refusing to ask to be recognized by the chair before speaking  while other csm members are quite happy to do this   then its the responsibility of the chair to ensure that steps are taken when this conduct damages our ability to make progress polite requests were made warnings were given i took the step to mute the representative when she point blank refused to remain quiet while a vote was being conducted the vice chair agreed with this step ultimately the csm reps need to respect the authority of the chair to moderate meetings if they dont then no progress can be made if people dont like the way i handled this they are free to complain to ccp or whatever but ill continue to do my best to ensure we actually get things done rather than spending fruitless periods listening to endless cross talk and interruptions while other csm reps are actually respecting the process of the meeting and waiting to be recognized before speaking their own points well as it turned out it was a complete nonissue and it would have taken about 1 minute to resolve had we been able to move to a vote of principle on the issue in a timely and disciplined fashion there is a lesson here
i am jade constantine god chairman and emperor of the csmbow before my unpopular and unsupported issues lest i mute you
or post a wall of text that does not address your question that too is one of the many eweapons in my earsenal
 jade constantine  innana im giving you a second formal warning for this session for interruptions and interfering with the process of the chairaside from a  totally unnecessary   grammar edit on inannas part which shed been doing all night you just gave her a warning for not looking at the screen during an 8second window plus or minus lag between when you could be interpreted to have called for silence and when she finished typing her message or a 4second window after you clarified slightly call me crazy but a warning over taking a bit too long to type a response is abusive and destructive of respect for the chairimmediately after the second formal warning inanna asked for clarification of exactly what the warning meant for that matter so did hardin and lavista which implies to me that nobody knew what you were doing you certainly hadnt specified up until that point in the chatlogs but the fact that three people questioned its meaning and darius questioned its validity means that i can safely say you also hadnt specified it anywhere else which means you cant blame inanna for not knowing what she was being warned against or what the consequences of ignoring those warnings would be those things are standard for any warning anywhere either int he form of rules of order contempt of court laws or something else of that nature or theyre contained within the warning themselves but you didnt provide them which makes confusion basically inevitable and apparently this confusion and questioning of your decision were muteworthywhile it is certainly the right of the chair to prevent members from disrupting the meeting it is also the right of members to question request clarification of and even formally challenge and seek to overturn the rulings of the chair under all rules of order ive ever seen not only did you ignore those rights you disrespected them flagrantly by silencing a member of the council who was seeking to do no more than exercise her rights as a member you acted against the proper proceedings of a deliberative assembly and misused your powers as chair to do so your actions were abusive and generally reprehensible and deserve condemnation in the strongest terms and if i were at the table my first actions would be to nail down these amorphous rules of order well enough to find a way to eject you from the chairim willing to accord you quite a number of rights due to your electoral standing but dictatorial powers are not among themoh and tress stfu youre not helping
excerpts these logs are getting longer and longer and the rules increasingly seem to be either still unclear or just a facade
why couldnt you have just stuck to the issues jade instead of trying to turn the csm into some sort of toy
jade constantine failing to explain his decisions then muting people to avoid confrontationwho could have seen this coming
very classy
both actually the rules are naturally unclear because the constitution of the csm is a pr pitch as opposed to a quasilegal document ccp is their usual overworked selves and they havent clarified further and nobody at the csm is lawyerly enough to have forced proper rules of order upon the council yet thing is power abhors a vacuum even more than nature does if theres unclear rules every side will push as hard as it can to gain more power for itself  darius as a common member is agitating for the rights of common members at every opportunity and the utter irrelevance of the chair and jade as chair is trying to define himself into far more power than anybody else probably wants him to have theyre both pushing for far more than they ought to get but between their personalities and philosophies and the fact that theyre trying to further their own interests which will make anybody fight a little bit harder   im not surprised by their actions at all its also true of every other organization with multiple power bases i can think of thats not bound in by some pretty ironclad law  the house of commons has spent 800 years hedging out the crown and lords by means ranging from financial threats to questionable constitutional changes to civil war and regicide presidents from andrew jackson to george w bush have sought to expand the power of the executive beyond that which their predecessors enjoyed and congress has constantly pushed back the fact that jade and darius and others of course but those two are the most egregious   are doing the same thing here doesnt surprise me and sadly neither does the fact that theyre both being so bushleague about it but at the same time as im unsurprised that somebody will take up the banners of the anarchist and the tyrant im disappointed by those who do darius needs to calm down and get past his 4thgrade civics notion of absolute universal equality in all things and jade needs to get down off his high horse and acknowledge the rightful limits on his role as chair and until both of them do that there will continue to be unnecessary strife that makes them all look like children or worse politicians i hope iceland solves the problem  facetoface discussion is almost inevitably less bloodthirsty than textbased  but im not excessively optimistic about the good functioning of this council over the next five and a half months i hope to be proven wrong but the issues at hand seem too fundamental and being stifled in those issues seems too likely to provoke bitterness for these hatchets to be buried among this group
serves me right for voting for jade i thought he could handle the responsibility of csm in a reasonable manner boy was i wrong my worry was that the goons would  up the process jades actually making them look good ironically edit after rereading the logs all joking aside im pretty disgusted with the pettiness and immaturity jade showed multiple times throughout the meeting
dont you know he is very important in the eve online community
postcount  notoriety  respector maybe in his case wordcount
i find it quite ironic about how people were screaming for the ability to remove a chairman should the goons get a chairman with the intention of griefing the council but now it seems like its turned around anyways yesterday was an absolute fiasco the way jade conducted himself is as pointed out unacceptable in my eyes not only did he unrightfully mute inanna based on vague and unreasonable reasons he also totally ignored certain council members and had no respect for the fact that people had a real life this resulted in the meeting taking 2 hours longer than expected thats 4 hours totaland why well i will let those who read the chatlogs judge for themselves but its pretty damn clear why such a huge deal was made out of it resulting in this chaoshopefully everybody will learn something from this so that we dont waste so much time next time
it seemed like during the meetings they came up with new issues constantly how about next time you make a vote for an issue along the lines of only issues previously stated in our csm forum or in the alliance hall forum can be brought to the csm meetings this would cut down on the lengths of the meetings drastically it would also allow more debate since you can look through the threads and read them rather and try and prove your point in a 2 hour timespanmaybe make a vote for the removal of a chair if he does an inefficient job one that takes longer than 3 hours to do counts as inefficiency
i think a more important issue though is the righteos instigator that darius johnson is playing through out the meeting and especially in the last quarter he baited jade and company multiple times he was trying to push the meeting even farther off topic into a all out brawlexamples 20080608 213625  darius johnson  your warnings dont mean a thing fyi 20080608 214620  darius johnson  well she did get two official warningsUFEFF 20080608 214629  darius johnson  maybe the channel is enforcing rule 20080608 215821  darius johnson  well its cool just mute them next time you dont like what theyre saying and well be cool 20080608 220124  darius johnson  so what who the hell are you 20080608 220243  darius johnson  lets just mute everyone and move onif the csm wants to be taken seriously then that kind of behavior cant be condoned
im not going to defend darius actions but he makes some fine pointsthough it could be considered childish at least he didnt interupt the meeting nor did he mute people
even if theyre both being an ass to the same degree darius isnt going around censoring people jades conduct needs to be addressed well before anybody elses for that reason alone
maybe because this is an internet spaceships committee for internet spaceships pilots to discuss internet spaceships the committee isnt some ultimate roleplaying device just for jade to obsess over constantly and acquire more and more espaceship power in if jade is going to act up and pretend  s  he is some super important person with new and growing authorities rather than what  s  he actually is then someone should just tell him to sit down and shut it enter darius
id like to see someone held accountable for the cluster that was meeting 3 especially disenfranchising iannas constituencyridiculous utterly ridiculous
that would get you muted but you could always abstain of course
is this is the bit where i grin smugly in the knowledge that i did not vote for jade constantine
most rules of order ive seen for bodies like this allow for impeachment of a member with a 23 vote ive never implemented such a vote so ive never looked at whether it can be narrowed to just stripping their roles while leaving their seat intact since i have no objections to jades conduct as a member thus far   but id imagine that its possible to do so seems to me theres an obvious target for such a motion
reading that log made me think damn goonfleet is cool
oh csm i knew jade would provide me the comedy so much needed in this forum
this
laffing at the people who voted for jade thats a pretty funny chatlog right there keep up the good work 
is that for roleplaying a nymphomaniac gallentean hooker or whatever hes intoor has odo actually achieved something in this game
jade alt spotted
 20080531 200257  bane glorious  also darius has informed me that he just warped into a fleet fight in bwf so hes a bit lagged 20080531 200303  bane glorious  lets not have any votes for a while 20080531 200314  jade constantine  heh were going to be firing through several 20080531 200324  inanna zuni   i would suggest that all members of csm should not be active in eve during meetings  defeats the point   20080531 200342  serenity steele  id suggest darius is either attending the meeting or fighting a fleet battle take his pick 20080531 200349  inanna zuni  agreed 20080531 200358  bane glorious  well thats out of his control at present 20080531 200406  bane glorious  ill remind him later 20080531 200407  darius johnson  no im here 20080531 200420  darius johnson  i said im herecomedy gold
 20080531 210153  bane glorious  that said im going biking goodbye nowhahaha
hate to tell you i told you so but i didalthough it seems a vote of no confidence vote in the csm chair has been supported by a csm member meaning it can be brought up at the next meeting when it is i would hope that all those csm representatives who feel that jade constantine has acted in a disgusting manner vote no confidence in himmaybe then the csm can spend time discussing matters of importance instead of having 4 hour long meeting where they are lectured at by a man child who has never had a position of power in his life
maybe you should discuss whether you should discuss if the left or right arm should be used for voting i guess you could fill two hours that way
i would just like to point out one thing about the chat log posted herethe chat log came from a member of the committee who had channel rights which is why it contains a note about inanna being muted by jadeunfortunately the other members of the committee who do not have channel rights did not see that notification and therefore had no idea that jade had gagged inanna and jade didnt inform usi only became aware that inanna had been gagged when she mentioned it to me in a separate convo
left arm no doubt im lefthanded and wont have righthanded buggers get their way
the plot thickens
ok i just got home from my exam so i went a bit trough the logsfrom meeting 2 while discussing time limits jade wrote 20080531 192709  jade constantine  if somebody is disruptive id ask them to stop 20080531 192720  jade constantine  if they dont stop ill eventually give a warning 20080531 192725  jade constantine  then a second warning 20080531 192733  jade constantine  then use the mute function outside of votingso it seems to me like this will happen to a person who is disruptive1 first warning2 second warning3 mutethis means a person effectively have to disrupt 3 times so lets look at the logs from yesterday 20080608 194737  jade constantine  no inanna im giving you a formal warning 20080608 213552  jade constantine  innana im giving you a second formal warning for this session for interruptions and interfering with the process of the chair 20080608 213658  eve system  inanna zuni was muted by jade constantine effective until 20080608 220657 reason till the vote 20080608 214029  eve system  inanna zuni was muted by jade constantine effective until 20080608 211028 20080608 214406  eve system  inanna zuni was muted by jade constantine effective until 20080608 211405 20080608 214930  jade constantine  you were muted after a 2nd formal warning for disruptive behavior innanawell
what gives jade the right to mute people he deems disruptive other than his own mind he made up a punishment system and then enforced it unilaterally without consultation a dictator indeed
lol what a chatlog p almost coad qualityhowever after reading the logfile i found the chairmans behaviour to be inappropriate ianna was by no means disruptive in a way that would have justified a mute or even a formal warning gi believe the chairman should abstain from muting people in the future and state an apology at last
my logs look like this  20080608 213552  jade constantine  innana im giving you a second formal warning for this session for interruptions and interfering with the process of the chairUFEFF 20080608 213608  jade constantine  now thenUFEFF 20080608 213611  inanna zuni  and what do you mean by thatUFEFF 20080608 213613  hardin  what is a formal warningUFEFF 20080608 213619  lavista vista  im sorry jadeUFEFF 20080608 213621  inanna zuni  formal warning is a misnomerUFEFF 20080608 213625  darius johnson  your warnings dont mean a thing fyiUFEFF 20080608 213635  inanna zuni  and how can i be interriptiing when i am completeing what i typeUFEFF 20080608 213657  eve system  inanna zuni was muted by jade constantine effective until 20080608 220657 reason till the votewe had reached an issue that needed to be handled within that meeting we had csm members that that believed we needed a full majority 59 yes for an issue to reach the agenda we had csm members who believed simple majority was enough we had been through one vote already that inanna had refused to vote on and virtually protested through now we needed clarification because it was ridiculous and would have been a failure on the part of the chair to allow a meeting to close with the csm split on what the interpretation of a successful vote actually was  20080608 213400  jade constantine  im going to suggest we clarify right nowUFEFF 20080608 213406  jade constantine  inanna your objection is notedUFEFF 20080608 213409  serenity steele  motion to vote 20080608 213428  lavista vista  i think we just need to do something 1UFFFD over time stillUFEFF 20080608 213429  bane glorious  i move we drop the whole thing and forget we ever discussed it because this is just asininei can understand you were tired and frustrated but without clarifying those voting rules we had 4 csm members who believed that we needed 5 yes votes for an issue to pass that would have let to us publishing contentious minutes that would not have been acceptable to other members of the csm 20080608 213514  inanna zuni  actually i see no decisions on topics which we have taken which are compromised in any wayaside from the issue that finished with 4 yes 2 no 2 abstain that led to the discussion of voting majorities needed in the first please an issue that 4 of 9 csm members would consider hadnt passed and others would consider had passed now external commentators can certainly point things and say that as csm members we should never have questioned simple majority voting but that doesnt change the fact that these things were questioned and once questioned the chair has the authority to hold a vote on the point of principle to clarify the issue and make sure the meeting ends with votes we all agree happened and game to results we are all clear on
jade how will you be voting on the issue of no confidence in your position as csm chairi also note that you posted another few thousand characters that dont address the issue in question here ill make it nice and bold for youwhy did you mute a csm member for no real reasonthe logs you posted dont make your case any stronger you got angry that people werent respecting your nonexistant authority at one point you gave her a formal warning  something you cant give because you have no authority to do so   for typing something that was sent in the same second as your statement for her to stop talking
as to the general complaints about muting raised here i stand 100 behind what i did and id do exactly the same next time to any csm member who ignores 2 formal warnings on disruptive behaviour im expecting certain rules of courtesy from csm members in council and these need to be respected if this process is going to go anywhere its been established that raising a hand  in channel is to be used to indicate a desire to speak from there the chair recognizes individuals by name and they speak in order as called once weve moved to a vote on an issue it is not appropriate to continue debating against the notion of the vote  clarification can be asked for its considered respectful behaviour to listen to clarification while its being given now text based meetings of this sort are extremely challenging  there is no verbal queue no eye contact and very little peer pressure on members of the council to behave properly yesterdays session is an example of what happens when moderation from the chair is not followed we managed to get through the agenda by pure force of will and stubborn resolve on the part of the csm officers however  if wed ended on time  items 6 to 17 on the agenda would not have been heard but it does show there are problems im pretty unhappy with the ingame chat system and its functionality in this medium the mute function does not work as it should do the word limits mean that statements are broken up and its too easy for people to interrupt and break the flow of meaning id personally be much happier with a voice meeting or even using irc chat where the moderation functions work correctly end of the day though that agenda was discussed and resolved and what needed clarifying got clarified i repeat im a 100 behind the moderation decisions taken and will do exactly the same thing next time if people refuse to respect the process of the meeting and keep crosstalking and interrupting and behaving disruptively
what about chairmen who ignores other council members notice plural   motions can they be muted too
i suggest the csm think seriously about appointing a speaker so that decisions like this arent taken by people involved in the debates
ironically for a group concerned with keeping a business meeting model for the csms meetings they seem to have overlooked one item thats usually traditional for this stylenamely that the chairman should not be votinghisher position is simply to regulate the flow of the meetings and to cast a deciding vote only if the vote is tied between the other council members
so the person who got the most votes should not be allowed to vote i agree that there should be a neutral chairman but only ccp could provide this person dont get fooled into the idea that any player is actually neutralas on the drama in this thread you cant have a chairman wo the tools to actually chair muting might not be the best way but possibly the only atm it wouldnt be needed if people would actually behave and wait till its their turn well i forgot they are all super special equal
now its the ingame chat systems fault you muted a csm member without due authority
chair has the authority to mute disruptive csm reps
the majority of the csm representatives did not find inannas behaviour disruptiveat last from what i can tell by reading the chatlog
that is also what i thought quite a few of us questioned the call
find that quote in the csm document please not a vague sentence that may or may not mean it the quote itself because clearly if you are saying so authoritatively that you have this ability it would be backed up in writing for everyone to see it would of course not be only mentioned in the chatlogs of a meeting where you decide  without any vote   that these are your powers and how you will be enforcing them
where did that authority come from besides your mind i mean
im telling you the chair has the authority to moderate meetings that can involve muting disruptive csm members in extreme circumstances we can get involved in debate as to whether silencing a council member for 30secs while the chair was actually stating the terms of a vote that would allow us to finish a meeting that had already overrun by 2 hours is  extreme circumstances by all means but ultimately i made the call and id do it again if any csm members feel this was wrong then its their right to bring up an issue for the next agenda proposing specific rules or limitations on moderation or indeed ideas as to how one does deal with ongoing and disruptive crosstalk and interruptions to keep a 2 hour meeting under a 4 hour timespan without having the sanction to silence a member who has already ignored repeated requests to follow the protocol of the meetingbring it to a vote by all means if the csm does manage to vote itself out of all moderation in text chat then well see where that takes us
so i was right you did just make that up its not stated anywhere in the official documents
jade quite aside from your pathetic little power trip the fact that you allowed a meeting to run two hours overtime clearly demonstrates your sad lack of competence at performing the most basic role of a chairman the csm may well be the most important thing going in your life right now but its a gross mistake on your part to assume that the same is true for the other members of the committee you have not accepted the responsibility for allowing the meeting to run so horrendously overtime you have not acknowledged your role in ejecting an elected representative from the meeting and holding a vote in her absence such complete ineptitude would not be excusable from the chairperson of a highschool debate yet you can somehow manage to write an afteraction report congratulating yourself on a job well donefurthermore your inability in both this and your own csm thread to reply to any criticisms of your positions or attitudes coupled with your repeatedlystated intentions to ignore a sizable percentage of the playerbase that you have been elected to represent demonstrate that you are barely competent at performing your role as a csm representative let alone that of the chairperson
within wishing to interrupt the flow of goon flaming too much could i ask a little favor and suggest you skip over to meeting 4 sign off on items 12th june 2000 hours and continue your wild flights of fancy and hilarious attempts to wind me up there please  thats the current agenda for issues sign off that we need to get done by thursday and if youd care to troll and flame me in that thread we can serve the dual purpose of keeping it bumped and letting you have your fun  fair enough
maybe you could just mute them here scuttles off snickering
do not attempt to belittle the serious concerns that have been raised in this thread about your abilities as a csm chair they are serious and concerning and considering the majority of them relate to your conduct in the meeting this thread is about surely this is the correct place for them post here if you think jade is dum  
guys give jade a couple of meetings more to get into it might be he is just on a powertrip but might also be that chairing meetings if you are not used to it is a pain in the ass and chairing meetings in text is a real pain in the ass and more so to someone who is used to being a charismatic dramatic colorful character type instead of a neutral careful mediator type also do bear in mind jade did not ask to be the chair  in fact hes asked the procedure to be changed from the one that made him sothat said i agree completely on the following points the muting was jumping the gun from the logs the meeting was obviously getting heated and people were getting tired  not the least jade himself   what should have been done was to call a break let everyone cool off and continue separately  the idea that abstains count as no is bizarre in this case abstains should count as votes not cast that is the point of abstaining in this kind of a meeting  letting whoever does have an opinion decide
wow i mean is this a seriouspost youve been called out by many people some of them goons some of them fellow csm members  non goon   and this is your reply beating people over the head with wordswordswordswords doesnt make you less wrongps is breathing still a reflex or do you pass out a lot
postin
is there some good reason to do this in terrible text format there is no way youre ever going to moderate anything as its not a discussion it looks like thisjust do it via voice coms so there is as little miscommunication as possible and so it has the pretense of question and answer after all no ones accent is so egregious that this misbegotten text method offers any advantage i think the csm was so preoccupied with being romantically political and transparent that it forget no has ever had a meaningful exchange in between the lols and other dross
ok ive been debating making a comment or not in this thread and need to quickly state a couple of points1 where precisely was i being disruptive and where precisely was that extreme circumstances  im leaving aside the question of whether you even have the right to mute an elected representative for the moment  i noted during the meeting that jade was editorialising positions and not being a neutral chair  indeed arguably the function of being the chair of a committee   in my opinion it went downhill from therei dont know where this might have been established but the meeting last night was the first time anyone used this mechanism  UFEFF 20080608 182213  serenity steele     which was without explanation maybe a back channel somewhere without all members presentfurther i have been accused by the chair of interrupting exampleUFEFF 20080608 183326  jade constantine  please phrase your 2nd part of the vote please hardin UFEFF 20080608 183329  hardin  2nd issue is should an alternate step and begin voting when an elected rep leaves the meeting for whatever reasonUFEFF 20080608 183341  jade constantine   inanna please stop interruptingim sorry to point out that i see no interruption by me soonline meetings have their own particular difficulties not only the prevalence of spelling errors but primarily based around lag time  comms delay readingtyping delay multiline comments interleaving   so asking for comments needs to be clearly separated from asking for the vote to permit time for responses howeverUFEFF 20080608 192451  jade constantine  does anyone actually oppose this issue UFEFF 20080608 192515  jade constantine  moving to a vote then  all those in favourUFEFF 20080608 200932  jade constantine  anybody else want to speak on the issue UFEFF 20080608 201004  jade constantine  okay then lets move to a vote on the principle of raising this discussion with ccpand when i tried to actually respond you kept interrupting untilUFEFF 20080608 201146  darius johnson  you can let inanna finishUFEFF 20080608 203532  jade constantine  yep anyone against this one UFEFF 20080608 203610  jade constantine  kk moving to the voteetcthen lets look at voting instead of noting whether everyone has voted and waiting until they have you preempt things  see UFEFF 20080608 203100  jade constantine  reexamination of 00 sovereignty system  aye or nay onwards  now lets look at this warning business first time around went 20080608 194728  inanna zuni   if the yes is greater than the no then it passes how can that even be a question UFEFF 20080608 194737  jade constantine  no inanna im giving you a formal warningso no explanation of what i was alleged to have done that was disruptive there other than ask a question moments later we even hadUFEFF 20080608 194803  ankhesentapemkah  i object to this issue and withdraw my votethis all followed your refusal to accept validly cast votes from myself and dierdraUFEFF 20080608 193355  dierdra vaal  emote abstrain  i dont care either wayUFEFF 20080608 193355  inanna zuni  having read all the thread  
 contd from above  UFEFF 20080608 193712  jade constantine  yeah to be honest i dont really understand the point of abstainsand after more discussion wherein those who understand that abstain is a perfectly rational and acceptable position to take argued with those who seemingly do not jade typedUFEFF 20080608 194452  jade constantine  so i need inanna and tusko to register a vote pleaseand then presumably because it suited youUFEFF 20080608 194632  jade constantine  okay im going to record no votes from tusko and inannaUFEFF 20080608 194638  jade constantine  option a passesthen despiteUFEFF 20080608 194644  ankhesentapemkah  objectionyou warn me later you bring it all up again but others in this thread have commented on thatas a point of principle i always support the chair of any body on which i serve whether i am that chair or just a member but a chair has to show that they have the capability and capacity to undertake that task responsibly and to do it properly that requires their being independent of the subject under discussion  passing the chair to someone else for a moment should they wish to talk on the subject   so that they can remain evenhanded my view was that the editorialising returning to subjects and general bullying of myself suggests that there are issues in the present incarnation of the csm one cannot demand trust one has to earn itiz
yes the meeting was overlong but we were caught on the horns of dilemma there any issues that didnt get heard at that meeting were not getting on the iceland agenda since they needed to be agreed and then have written documentation produced this coming thursday for submission to ccp and if you review the logs  we actually got through the substantive issues in about an hour  and spent 3 hours arguing about complete tosh yes i was tired yes i was hot and frustrated and yes i really wanted the meeting to end but we had a seriously problem half the csm thought the vote on issue 3 had failed half the csm thought it was successful thats where all the wtf does abstention mean debate came from sure in the cold light of day im going to put my hand up now and say what i should have done was say im making a call on this this  chair says were using simple majority voting  moving on though im guessing that would have led to some toys being thrown out of prams and more accusations of chair claiming too much authority again  sometimes you cant win  but as it was we needed to get clarity on that issue to prevent a situation where ank was going to produce minutes showing one result for issue 3 where half the csm thought it had gone the other wayid dearly have loved to call a break elebeth but wed not have reconvened afterwards  people were desperate to be away and it would have led to us denying the electorate the chance to get some of their issues on the agenda for all the drama and spats and footstamping and goontrolling its led too im glad to have persevered and gotten to the end of the agenda what led to me mute inanna was her interference in the two separate votes on the simple majority issue doesnt matter she was right   and i agreed with her on the principle   what mattered is that she was further stalling the process of a lengthy and fractious meeting by arguing against us having a vote to decide the issue if she had gotten her way and there had been no vote wed be arguing right now about whether issue 3 had passed or not since at the midpoint of that meeting we had 4 csm reps serenity steele dierdra vaal darius and bane 20080608 194138  bane glorious  im voting a because thats what the csm documents rules sayUFEFF supporting the principle that 59 majority is required for a vote to pass 3 csm reps ank lavista and myself supporting the principle that simple majority is required 1 csm rep  hardintusko   not available to vote and 1 csm rep inanna refusing to vote because  20080608 194026  inanna zuni  i choose to decline to support or reject this proposalas it ended up that vote finished 4 yes 3 no  2 no opinions   which would actually have pushed through the notion of 59 majority voting being required but it didnt finish the argument since 2 of the 3 no voters and 1 abstainer refused to accept the verdict believing  correctly as it turned out   that it contradicted the spirit of the founding csm document hence the secondary vote on the issue with more information  supplied by tusko   that led ultimately to an overturn of the earlier decision and confirmation of the principle of simple majority voting sometime you just need to get the vote done people have a time to object once noted they need to shut up and vote  or abstain    interfering with the process of a vote will earn a mute

goontrolling i fail to see any occur last night  are you  somewhat selective there that comment was way after i had voted abstain  see post above   and was not part of any vote it was a response followingUFEFF 20080608 193952  ankhesentapemkah  noone has the right to force you to choose dierdraUFEFF 20080608 194016  jade constantine  option a 59 needed to make the agenda  option b simple majority neededUFEFF 20080608 194025  jade constantine  please choosewhich by no stretch of an imagination is a call to a vote when the members present had already voted it is however an example of bullying to try and get the result you wantedand as i have noted in the posts above if you are giving people a time to object you need to actually wait and give them that time their responding to you call to comment is not an interference in any way ps saying vote  or abstain   is a tautology as abstain is a vote btw having read the full logs now might i enquire re the followingUFEFF 20080608 215906  jade constantine  if we want to do this discussion lavista  i muted her for the 3 specific instance of her blocking the ability to move to a vote with disruptive behavourso again as i and others have requested where are the 3 specific instance of her blocking the ability to move to a vote with disruptive behavour  sic   i have no blocking ability  although you subsequently demonstrated that you do  iz
talking about this thread obviously
how else would you interpret 4 yes votes 3 no votes and 2 csm candidates that refuse to register a vote i recorded youd cast no meaningful vote  effectively an abstain   so the measure passed by simple majority voting 4 to 3 ultimately inanna you need to examine your own behaviour as well look back through the log and count the number of comments you interject without asking to be recognized by the chair look at your reaction to a vote being called look at the generally insulting and demeaning way you post with accusations against the competence of other reps continual correcting of grammar or spelling haranguing other reps and the chair and generally refusing to be called to order im not expecting any kind of democratic resolution here inanna but im going to tell you right now that if you keep behaving as you did in that last meeting then ill be warning you each time you speak without asking to be recognized and ill be doing this not to bully or intimidate you but since it is the only way to be fair to the other csm reps and to the electorate that voted for us to actually make progress in these committee meetings rather than listen to 101 interjections and snippy oneliners maybe the sensible thing to do would have been to adjourn the meeting in the face of the interruptions and disruptive antics  but i didnt feel like punishing those members of the electorate who wanted their issues discussed for the crimes of a badly behaved csmif you  or any other   csm rep dont think this is reasonable then you have the option of tabling a motion to suggest how we moderate these meetings in the future
see my post for instance number one above would like hardin and other csms imput as well
sadly weve been told we have to use evechat i agree with you its horrible there are terrible problems with text chat meetings particular in the moderation  there is simply no useful way to stop people interrupting and crosstalking over recognized speakers without muting them which as we see from this thread makes people jump six foot in the air with mortified outrage at the attack on their their civil rights what i wouldnt give for channel commander powers in the moderation role here of course its all going to be different face to face because people by and large behave a lot better in physical proximity  but we are going to need solutions to this fiasco meaning form in the future
id highly recommend you stop blaming inanna for your actions she did nothing wrong whatsoever i know its difficult for you to accept but you were  and are   completely out of line
everyone can read the logs id stop insinuating that anyone other than yourself was the cause of the disruptions you muted a csm member for the dire offense of disagreeing with you and calling you on your attempts to editorialize and change the results of votes where you get off blaming everyone and everything else for this or even insinuating that anyone else was doing anything untoward i dont know
would you care to explain exactly what you mean by editorialize and change results of votesthese are serious accusations id like to know precisely what you mean
obviously nope lets look again at your original statement in other words you were referring to goontrolling in the meeting as only that had an agenda and could reach an end this thread has neitherand again you are being disrespectful to council members an abstain  which is as i have noted the vote i cast   is a meaningful vote and that you choose to editorialise the decision i  and others on this and other motions   chose to make sadly shows you do not understand so seek to cast aspersionsoh dear so a special rule for me whereas  i look at the logs   others including yourself will be free under your rule to speak whenever they wishclearly this thread has gone on long enough and others have made the points that needed to be made that you are not answering the questions asked of you is  a pity  and that you seeking to place the blame elsewhere just sadiz
hardin  ok a vote if the sky is blue in icelandhardin  i vote yesjade  nojade buddy nojade buddy 2 nobane  yes sigh what are we doingdarius  yes ughhinannaa  yeslavista  yesother person  yesjade  ok the vote has passed the sky is blue on days that begin with the letter w ok on to the next voteinannaawait a second thats not what thejade i demand order this is your first warning you will respect my authority
at the risk of agreeing with a goon jadetake some personal responsibility you were out of line it is your responsibility to chair the csm in a neutral and professional manner which you failed to do you are responsible for your own actionswhatever happened to the buck stops here i have to say im not any happier with your response to the general disgust with your actions than i am with your actions in the first place
 20080608 194026  inanna zuni  i choose to decline to support or reject this proposal UFEFF 20080608 194118  inanna zuni  why are you asking this pointless questioni took that to understand you were refusing to vote i recorded your position as an abstain you are quick to make these accusations of editorializing  but they have no real substance yep its a long and sad thread and it does show a pretty poor side to the csm for sure all i can say is as distasteful as i find your behaviour in council ill continue to try to work with you and give you the same respect as i afford to others involved with this process if at the end of the day you find you cant follow the procedures of the council chamber youve got the option to raise a vote to change them i guess be assured that while you are introducing your vote ill be keen to stop over people interrupting talking above and generally trying to disrupt the points you are making funny that
um read the logs inanna called you on it hardin called you on it i called you on it inanna was then muted its been quoted multiple times in this thread and im sure youve read itgo ahead and play coy and offended though
the thing about textbased meetings is that its pretty hard to actually interrupt proceedings  you dont silence somebody by typing over them you just scroll the window faster since i assume all the csm reps are sensible and are sitting docked with the chat window essentially fullscreened scrolling is hardly a capital offense its not impossible and a dedicated spammer can certainly ruin a window but inanna was nowhere even close to that line as for the csm bringing up rules on the topic i dont think that would solve the problem disruption is hardly something easy to set down in formal law  it will always require interpretation you dont solve the problem of excessive moderation by laying down rules you solve it by getting a chair who has some understanding of what their job is supposed to be clearly youre not it
i was asking to see if you actually understood the accusation you were making
you can be assured that all voting will be reflected the correct way in the minutes in the manner agreed upon before the vote however jade phrased it afterwards is not relevant and was not agreed upon by the vote and thus will be omittedyes there clearly were mistakes made during the discussion and voting itself but they will be corrected no need to start an argument about it here or during the discussion please act in a professional manner we will all benefit from making this csm a success and the best way to work on that is stop this pointless fighting amongst ourselves
seeing as people have actually read the chatlog im amazed you continue to push the blame over to someone else
 jade constantine  a or bwhere you again refused to accept my abstain voteas i said editorialising decisions to make them appear different to how they were presented and decided uponiz
here let me spell it out for you in shorthand i apologize for the brevityvotes on a motion to allow council members to enter a meeting and take over for the alternate who had stepped up in their placejade the motion to kick alternates out of the room when a csm has showed up late has passedrest of csm thats not what we saidjade youre out of line mutes dissentdoes that spell it out for you for the 50th time how about that time we voted that not everyone in the channel would have moderation capability and you decided that meant you should does that helpmuch like the meeting yesterday you continue to waste everyones time for your own purposes youre wrong get over itedit also read above as if you hadnt already
itt jaded getting new meaning
not condescending at allim going to have to disagree  its not pointless for the council to function youre going to need a good chair and jade has proven that hes not it strife sucks but its usually better than giving up on things that matter
you completely misunderstood what was going on there inanna the electable chair vote ended with a 422 result and half the csm committee felt that meant it failed half felt it passed we moved to a secondary vote on the principle of majority voting  in general   to clarify whether the result was a pass or a fail your behaviour makes a lot more sense now in retrospect if you actually did confuse these two issues and assumed it was a revote on issue 3 specifically
that isnt what i said does that mean you are editorializing now
thank you ankh would be nice to see this from jade and why he thinks his nonrelevant and confusing statements are helpful to the process
whats this a representative was chosen because of their erep in the world of flames and strawman debates and you say its going not in circles but in shattered halfmoons of chaos destruction and a waste of ccps money why i neveris anyone really surprised at this its jade
you are a terrible chairperson and should step down you cant control the meetings and you are lashing out in extremis making things even worse do yourself the csm and the community a favour and step down from the position you have every right to represent those who voted for you but you are destroying this excellent chance for the community to get their views across more succinctly to ccp and actually have them acted upon
editorializing is not a difficult concept to grasp are you seriously wondering whether darius is able to comprehend what it meansbut hell since you dont seem to understand this simple concept i will explain it for youit means that when the council voted to pass a measure that was defined in one specific way you made a note that the measure passed defined in a different specific way now i will assume for the sake of courtesy that you are both literate and not a polemic dillweed though it there is ample evidence for the contrary   and will present both the issue voted on and the issue you editorialized precisely so that you can comprehend what is going on here  however dense intentionally or otherwise you would have to be to not understand  the vote 1st issue is can the elected candidate return to a meeting and regain voting rights when the debate moves on to the next item on the agendathe editorializing alternates can be removed from csm rep voting status at any time by a candidate arriving at the meeting note those are above quotes of the issueitalics are me for emphasis and this happened twice where you made that same mistake this quote being the second time after the official vote  do you just not care enough to read what you are voting on or is this a concentrated effort to subvert the will of the csm since they voted against you
what was decided on this does it require 5 or more yes votes to pass something or just more yes votes than no votes its confusing to determine reading the log
they eventually reconsidered their first selfnegating vote at the end of the meeting and decided that yes  no  pass only took them three hours to come to a decision that should have taken ten seconds  thank you serenity for the gifts you have brought us
jade has made some mistakes in this meeting we are reviewing what happened and will try to make sure it wont happen again next time im pretty sure that what people call editorializing on those votes was not intentional it got blown way out of proportion and people reacted in an unprofessional mannerit was already a brewing mess in the chat so i understand why jade wanted to stop the endless arguing and bickering and just get to the vote hence ignoring a complaint that would probably be valid if the debate was otherwise conducted orderly im sure that the complaint would have been heard and addressed appropriatelyas ive said before in the other thread the mess cannot be attributed to just one person
so the measure failed to pass and then you attempted to get the two members who didnt vote to vote so that it mightyou moved to a secondary vote what the heck does that mean for people who dont reside in jade landand where was the movement for the secondary vote and where was the second on the movement for the secondary vote and where were all the other votes in the secondary vote that would have to be recastno you were badgering the people who didnt vote to vote its a simple concept how hard is it to understand
yes now you get it the logs of what you really said are contained elsewhere in this thread and that was merely an interpretive and not entirely inaccurate portayal of the events ive wasted enough time on you for today and 4 hours yesterday im not going through the logs again to point out what multiple people already have including 5 i think other csm reps
while i would like to share this sentiment jade has a long long history of doing this intentionally as stated earlier he was banned from the forums for just this sort of behaviour having tried to have discussion with jade based on logic where he devolves into ad hominem attacks and strawman i cant in good conscious say that this was anything but intentional
i respectfully disagree only one person muted anyone and editorialized votes to suit their own whims that is the source of this mess thusly this mess can be attributed to just one person
 jade constantine  weve established that csm rep dislodge alternates when they are in channelwhich while not exactly as per darius do demonstrate that you were editorialising the decision in your own way rather than be a neutral chair reporting the decision of the vote just completediz
the best part imho is anhk voting on jades editorializing imho  20080608 183305  jade constantine  alternates can be removed from csm rep voting status at any time by a candidate arriving at the meeting 20080608 183308  jade constantine  next part 20080608 183315  ankhesentapemkah  nay 20080608 183316  inanna zuni  jade 20080608 183322  inanna zuni  please do not editorialize a decision 20080608 183327  jade constantine  please phrase your 2nd part of the vote please hardin  20080608 183329  hardin  2nd issue is should an alternate step and begin voting when an elected rep leaves the meeting for whatever reason 20080608 183342  jade constantine   inanna please stop interrupting 20080608 183356  inanna zuni  jade  please chair neutrally then 20080608 183426  jade constantine  im going to ask you formally now inanna  please stop interrupting the process of the vote 20080608 183433  bane glorious  inanna has a pointor was anhk preemptively voting on the next subject before it was even announced
wow i thought all of the talk about votes of no confidence were jokes related to star wars aimed at showing a dislike for jade after reading i see they are 100 seriousjadeyou have evaded a question where do you get the power to administer formal warnings and subsequently mute a csm rep we dont care if you would do it again that is not the question we dont care if you are the chair that is not the question we dont care if you felt innana was being disruptive that is not the questionthe question is where do you get the power to administer formal warnings and subsequently mute a csm rep
jade you are an abismal chair as i posted in the other related thread i have gone through the chatlogs and its practically unbelievable even more so when in this thread you insist in defending your reprehensible behaviour
i have no idea of whether it was intentional or not but i do assure you that in a rl meeting intentional or not he wouldnt be coming back and thats only referring to the editorializing parti attribute it in whole to the chair from what ive read in the logs and that chair is jade
it wasnt jade constantines fault that over half an hour of time was wasted on the first issue before the voting even started most of us dragged out the discussion this is one of several things that affected the atmosphere in a bad way and likely attributed to the mistakes further down the road i was definately itchy after wasting so much time and later on i was close to losing my temper when people were casting  in my opinion   uninformed votes demanding an absolute majority for votes to pass my apologies for my behaviour theresecondlyi really dont want to get involved in this editorializing discussion but i just read the chatlogs yet another timeif we compare hardins formulation the two of jade well clearly see differences which i boldedhowever the item was phrased very differently on the agendafrom my perception jade constantine saw this issue as blackandwhite as either they can come arrive during a meeting and regain voting rights or they are excluded from voting until next meeting the nuance of the timing in which they would regain the rights in the meeting was lost this is understandable if we look at when exactly this particular aspect of the issue was mentionedthen the debate went off in an other direction and other aspects of the issue were covered it was not discussed at all for almost 15 minutes when jade called the voteupon which people attacked jade for leaving out the aforementioned detailfrom my hopefully neutral perspective this was not intentional and merely miscommunication in the future i humbly request of all of you to politely correct other council members when they make mistakes instead of assuming the worstlast i really want to thank all council members and alternates for their commitment in seeing the meeting through to the end no matter how frustrating it was
itt many people who are way too caught up in meaningless minutiae of the rules maybe they can combine with the mass of jade haters to prevent the csm from accomplishing anything
yeah that does seem to be the undercurrent  dont worry though ulstan we got a decent set of issues through regardless and if the csm votes in iceland to make an electable chair in the constitution ill be happy to sit back and just promote good issues for the next 4 months of the term im sure the next chair will enjoy herding these cats
 20080608 183316  inanna zuni  jade 20080608 183322  inanna zuni  please do not editorialize a decision 20080608 183327  jade constantine  please phrase your 2nd part of the vote please hardin  20080608 183329  hardin  2nd issue is should an alternate step and begin voting when an elected rep leaves the meeting for whatever reason 20080608 183342  jade constantine   inanna please stop interrupting 20080608 183356  inanna zuni  jade  please chair neutralperhaps when correcting the chair not only should please be used but perhaps following with sugar on top as to not offend
as was stated directly in the meeting and repeatedly otherwise and ignored selectively theres nothing preventing the chair from stepping down so a new one can be elected right now theres also no constitution dont let me get in the way of you framing your own reality however
i suppose you would have preferred sheep eh jade
would you
or you can always mute them and then go on the forum and ask what was this editorializing about and brush off any kind of observations about biasparaphrasing you are not being neutral due to editorializing this is an unnecessary discussion give the results of vote 1 ok and the votes of vote 1 have already established that editorializedso apparently jade didnt give a damn about either neutrality or what this editorializing was if he didnt know he was doing it he could have asked after the first or second time he was pointed out
which is actually a good point despite the choas at stages all proposed business got done we may end up all hating each other on csm by the end of our time in iceland  but if a result is delivered for the players of eve it might well be worth iti do wonder who will even want to stand enxt time though
i think you hit the nail on the head there details entering the topic during the discussion should be included in the restating of the issue at the time of the vote perhaps by the person who brought up the issue to avoid confusion in this case it might have helped if hardin had been asked to restate the issue in his understanding prior to the vote at least so that youre starting with the person who is sponsoring the issue and working from their definition of the vote
to be honest its the light at the end of the tunnel if we do actually get these issues into useful discussion and help get some decent changes through it all becomes worthwhile these horrible meetings do have a purpose end of the day all the forum trolling and nonsense means nothing if we make a positive impact on the game
you mean the discussion you are avoiding having on the forums as required by the csm document that discussion the csm is not a place where you get to make your argument to ccp its a place where a group of people can come together and judge and present the communities wishes reservations and needs to ccp so that they can better create a game that we playbut you actually have to have a place where wishes reservations and needs can be presented to you before that happens and all that takes is a little will on your part to get it done
he did after which jade then summarized him in an incorrect and unflattering mannerit would not have been very different had there been a vote on reexamine 00 sovereignty and then at the end darius johnson had said vote to  over small alliances has passed
the more i look at the whole brouhahah over the issue of abstained votes the more i shake my head in dismay that issue should have been dealt with in about 10s abstaining votes dont count in any way whatsoever thats why theyre abstain instead of yes or no it just means im here but lets pretend im not for the purpose of this voteanyway hopefully thats all threshed out now and future meetings can deal with more weighty matters
i suggest the following things happen before the next meeting1   every csm brushes up on parliamentary procedure2   a moderator with no voting powers is appointed to handle the appropriate procedural points of order
get into coattails irc you knob
yeah truth is everybody in that meeting failed on that point i failed to just make a judgment call and say the votes count this waythose in favour of the 59 decision  including bane who actually said he saw it written that way in the document   failedthose against the 59 decision failed to point out it was written otherwise in the docs inanna failed to actually explain herself rather than arching criticizing lack of committee knowledge and delaying the processall nine of us failed and as a result all nine of us wasted more than an hour on a ridiculous sequence of discussions and accusations and hotblooded confrontations that have led to the fiasco here today  then again id say a high proportion of the forum respondents on these numerous threads fail as well because while they are frothing and snarling about this administrative stuff there are actually a number of real gamplay issues that have made the iceland agenda theyd be better served by talking about  
now its everyones fault well at least thats a step in a direction
well darius im talking about a specific vote there you played a part in that as well as i did any of us could have actually read the docs and said actually it says clearly that simple majority voting is the rule  nobody did
i apologize it was not obvious to me with my limited linguistic skills that you were talking about a specific vote and not the meeting in general
im not suprised to see that csm meetings arent going as well as they could be this comes from a flagrant disregard for the csm documents and the rules mentioned within it and a misintepretation of what the meeting with ccp will actually be it also comes from some csm members assuming that they can just turn up for a quick meeting once a week and vote on some issuesyour jobs as csm members is to discuss in meetings the issues that players are concerned about those issues must be issues that affect the majority of the eve players and they each must be posted in the forums for a period of no less than 7 days for player discussion etc i pointed out that having 60 issues as one agenda point was in disregard of this but since it suited certain members to have it voted on as one issue it was ignored i see that you did not discuss each issue in the pdf as you said you wouldthe csm documents make it clear that each issue must be discussed by csm members  and it is expected that the 9 members will have differing views etc   then a simple nay or aye vote taken since there are 9 of you 5 votes in the aye are required for an issue to be esculated i see no mention of an abstain being allowedbut since you accepted it that makes the 5 ayes harder to get that is all accept that all issues will not get esculated to ccp for commentfrom the information it is clear that you submit issues to ccp they consider them and give their verdict in iceland and the other meetings you formally present the issues  not the arguments   to them they reply at the meeting you can then present further arguments on why x issue is important however since many of the issues have had poor support and you still esculated them without discussion expect some pretty firm negative responsesall of the changing of the rules inventing new ones to suit and solidify a position etc is plainly wrong stop it please you pollute the waters ahead for those csm members to comeif you cant stay for a 4 hour meeting i question why you stood in the first place you must have accepted that you may not actually be able to play much eve for 6 months you are being flown to iceland this shouldnt be something that only requires a couple of hours a week to gain meetings should not have time limitsyou need to discuss each issue when you shove 75 on the agenda expect it to take 4 hoursarithron
would you please point me to where someone stated we were going to discuss them alland would you please read the chat log you will see that the topic was voted for provided it was split into chunks in order to ease discussion as for the time issue the first meeting was stopped due to the time limit was reachedthis time around we wasted too much time on nothing some of us have stuff to do in real life like exams or jobs at least have respect for that when you put it on a sunday or earlier on in the evening so that those of us who lives in gmt2 arent kept up till midnightalso who are you to question why people stood in the first place im sorry if i come out as angry or anything but i see it as an insult   i dont think you quite know what goes on behind the scenesi personally havent pvped since the beginning of the election as i dedicated large majority of my time to csm and at present i spend about double the amount of time im actively ingame to csm related work
jade you viewed this thread  linkage  you then responded with a positive vote and mentioned youd bring it up in the csm meeting  note  this thread was authored immediately once the csm forum was active the original thread is months old the problem is years old  however i seen no mention of its discussion or of it even being brought up
actually if you remember right i also stood   please dont take everything personallyi may not have been referring to youmeetings will go on beyond the expected timeget the chairman to put them at better timesi see that the 60 issues being split up again will now require reposting for a period of seven days right and all the other issues that werent posted on the forums such as abstaining from a vote alternates etcmeaning that a representative cannot bring a topic up at a council meeting without having it go through deliberation on the public forumthis is an interesting part of the csm document that a couple of representatives need to read carefully  not you lv  csm representative conductany behavior or actions considered to be a material breach of the eula or tos by a csm r epresentative is grounds for immediate dismissal and permanent exclusion from all pending and future participation in the council there are no exceptions regardless of the infraction representatives are not only expected to uphold the social contract that all society members are held accountable tobut should also set a behavior standard for everyone else to followanyway i appreciate that you had other things to do than sit in a meeting  rl takes precedence always   thats what the alternates are for though i know you are working hard behind the scenes and putting time into the csmbut then thats what you stood and were elected to dotake carearithron
i do apologise ill make sure its on there for next sunday and do my best to get it on the agenda okay
no sweat it happens was just a friendly reminder
id suggest it meets the criteria if lavista can break them up as separate issues for vote wed be fine 20080608 191834  jade constantine  okay 20080608 191842  lavista vista  i will split them up and have the documents ready in 2448 hours 20080608 191844  inanna zuni  lavista  i was explaining why i couldnt support the document en bloc 20080608 191848  jade constantine  im going to propose this to the vote on that provisonow exactly what did you vote on here did you vote that all these go to ccp but be broken up into seperate issues first  hence making it appear that you had discussed all the issues  60   and voted seperately on each oneor did you vote for the issues to be broken up and brought up at the meeting on thursday where you will again discuss them and voteand my final question did you bypass the rule requiring each issue to be posted on the forum due to workload etc it certainly appears you have
are you saying that you think we shouldnt be able to support any of those issues in lavistas document unless he presents 60 individual issues arithroni ask because we have a couple of other issues on the agenda that have several included  inanna has a ui issue that has multiple fixes ank has a general fixes to the forum issue that has several issues there hardin is going to be supporting an rp issue that has plenty of individual sub categories let me get this straight are you saying that in your opinion we are breaking the rules of the csm to vote these grouped issues onto the formal agenda for iceland and a secondary question   if we do break  change   the rules on this  what are you proposing to do about it
im saying that having 60 issues lumped in together stops discussion on each issue on the forums and in a csm meeting i do not believe it was the intention for 60 issues to be voted upon in one go by a single csm vote there was very little discussion  in fact you started voting before discussion   on any of the issues before the vote and as you say you should be able to support any of the issues that lavista proposesand not support others that you disagree with by having them all together you deny thisall issues should be posted seperate on the forum for discussion regardless of what they are or how interconnected representatives can then choose to support each issue or players can vote to support itwhat ill do about it is ask ccp to make a ruling on it im suprised that you havent done so already and reported it to the publictake carebruce hansen
okay you would advise lavista to submit 60 submission docs and well confirm each one with a vote on thursday right same with inanna and her ui issues ank with the forum issues and hardin with the rp issues  you are welcome to right to ccp to make a ruling i think youll be a little disappointed at how forthcoming they are able to be at the current time with the patch tomorrow and timescale constraints however dont assume weve been completely failing to ask ccp opinion on things re lavista and inanna im going to ask them come and debate this issue with you first hand
i think he is saying do things properly so that the people have a chance to comment on each issue as required by the csm documentthat isnt an unreasonable onus
yes lavista needs to write 60 topics for the threads and the other representatives also thats the rules you were elected under thats what you have to do this gives players a chance to discussdebate each issue and for the representatives to do likewise both on the forums and in the meetings it also allows for the important vote on each issue seperatelytake carebruce hansen
okay ive asked lavista and the other candidates with multiple item issues via our internal mailing list to come and respond to you specifically here arithron i hope youll either come to a rational compromise on the issue or ill advise that they need to be split out okay give tomorrow for some discussion and ill make a call in the evening
i dont need to come to a rational compromise the csm representatives need to follow the clearly stated rules for posting issuesplease note i have been rational through this entire discussioni have highlighted above how circumventing this important procedure leads to a restriction or denial of discussion or rejection of issues  and the acceptance of issues if there are a few good proposals lumped in with many bad ones  im looking forward to making contributions to many of the issues when they are posted seperately on the forum take carebruce hansen
csm issue sign off meeting thursday 12th june 2000 hours eve time this is a sign off meeting for the issues raised onto the agenda for iceland so far the intention is to check that we have formal submission documentation for each issue raised supported and voted onto the agenda so the documentation can be bundled up and indexed and sent to ccp by the csm secretary following the meetingall items for submission need to be mailed to ankhesentapemkah before by 0100 hours on thursday afternoon for the issue to be heard at the signoff meeting that evening any items that are not received in time may be struck off the agenda of issues to be discussed in iceland at the discretion of the committeethe list below shows issues crossreferenced with the csm rep responsible for those issues we expect the csm reps listed below to produce the submission docs from the template here and have these documents mailed to the csm secretary  by csm mail address   by the deadline of 0100 hours thursday afternoon delegated to ankhesentapemkahremoval of 3090 day gametime codeslogserver exploitation and baconmaking suicideganking more difficultgeneral eve forums improvementfixingdrone implantsdelegated to bane gloriousskill queue functionalitydelegated to darius johnsonreexamination of 00 sovereigntydelegated to dierdra vaalevaluation of empire war dec mechanics reload all ammodelegated to hardinimprove bombsdelegated to inanna zuni5 voter issuealliances and faction warfareproposals for ui improvements replace doubleclick in a chat channel cargo hold size of ships in hanger but not in use delegated to inanna zuni delegated to jade constantine improvements to black opscsm should vote for its own chairman feasibility of outposts going boom aggression timer is too shortvariable hull fixdelegated to lavista science industry  secondary market  issue passed on the condition that document is split into major topics for individual confirming votes prior to submission  rigged ships and cargoedit mid sized freighters  my bad this should have been on here all along  delegated to serenity steelejumpbridges and cynojammer fixtransferable killrightsfunky pos alterationsto recap these issues need to be properly written up and mailed to ankhesentapemkah by 0100 hours  thursday june 12th then well check to documents at the meeting in the evening  2000 hours   prior to giving the csm secretary permission to index and send directly to ccp in advance of the formal meetings next week in the event that eve is still down following the patch  well do this by irc  
i feel its unfair to relegate my issue with cynojammers and jumpbridges to serenity steele a csm representative who has no concept of the problems involved in this issue he advocated a form of concord in 00 space for gods sake
life is unfair i emphasize with your plight i really do
get a csm rep to post here requesting it and they will be
they can post in this thread requesting it on the agenda and itll be done
but i also stated that i at this time do not wish to bring up this issuelearn to read a thread
it is not my fault that you cannot stay facing one direction long enough to stop getting dizzy your support post in that thread indicates that you do wish it to be discussed at the csm and yet later you state that you dont please make up your mind before telling other people to read threads you cant even manage to read your own previous posts

those will be for the sunday following bane  to be announced since they are 7 day issues that need to be formally voted remember that as agreed yesterday youll need to provide the fullywritten submission template with each of those and if they get voted through this thursday meeting is currently purely to confirm items for submission before the ccp deadline  any crazy admin sack the chair  abolish moderation style procedural votes that people want to bring to filibuster the meeting with if they get bumrushed into it by forum nonsense anything after that  including the sunday issues well be submitting as a secondary group and asking ccp to make an exception on the 7 in advance rule if we have the time on the agenda tldr versionill put those on the agenda for the sunday meeting but youll need to make sure each issue is fully documented with the ccp submission template
i would like to put the following items on the sunday agenda and take responsibility for getting the template worked upcompletion of unfinished story arcs
i believe these meetings are supposed to be scheduled in such a way that all may attend 4pm east coast us time on a week day is typically during the work day im going to ask that you reschedule for a time when all of the elected representatives can attend
i would concur with this despite my uk base i have long experience of worldwide online meetings  and the innate difficulty in scheduling them   but when it is known that two of the csm are usbased then it is unreasonable to intentionally schedule a meeting they cannot be present at the timezones the current csm 9 are in are i believe cdt bst gmt1   and edt so there is a six hours gap this is very clearly a problem on a weekday  due to school  college  work  etc   thus an actual meeting might not be the right way to proceed  midnight european being 6pm east coast is the nearest to a possible time and is still very imperfect   so maybe a thread on the unusedsofar proclamations forum is the right way to go here with each council member posting their submission as a new thread and csm members only posting an acceptance of it this has the sidebenefit of getting all the current issues to be submitted in one clear place separate of the discussions still taking place on other topics so that all pilots can see what we are taking forwardiz
i like this puts everything into easilylogged text format and avoids scheduling issues

if someone would support minmatar capital review or maybe minmatar bs and above review that be great because they are really terrible
almost all newer players allready wont go further than 4s 6s and 7s are way too expensive for new players
this seems like a rather weak blanket argument against anything that would be new and expensive ie i could see the same argument being used against supercapitals and the like youre one of the few csm members that i respect and enjoy hearing about so i hope you get back to this thread my question for you is why should older players be punished for the sake of younger players im by no means an older player but i would not object to the introduction of these more powerful implants
this has been bugging me so hard i have to make a postthere has to be hot keys for this menu you should be able to select the station and just hit d for dock i for info and so onplease visit your user settings to reenable images
cleanedplease do not use images without the express consent of those in the photo pictures of get togethers such as fanfest are often posted during and after the event with a link to various online photo albumsposting pictures of players especially directly into threads is not supported this issue is akin to that of the usage of photos in signatures that were removed earlier in the year
the express consent of those in the photo has been granted in this very thread that you just cleaned you even left a post in the thread from the person in the photo thanking the person who posted it for doing so
so if i put this image into a photoalbum i can link to it but i cant link directly to an imagethats ridiculous once more the moderators of this forum prove their ineptitude
my suggestion is to modify local chat so that it doesnt show who is in system local chat is currently used as a tactical tool and i believe this hinders the atmosphere and game play potential of the gamethis would make space much more exciting potentially lead to more dynamic pvp opportunities and would encourage people to work together more and in new ways it would make space feel like the giant ocean it is not just a series of interconnected fishbowlsi believe that constellation chat should autoupdate rather than local chat this way hostiles can still be located but not instantly pinpointed to a single systemi think this would be a balanced change for the better as though it may benefit a potential attacker it may also benefit someone who doesnt want to engage ie a miner or someone hauling it would make fleets more reliant on intelligence from players rather than from a box full of names discuss
modilfy this goon scumgood idea
while i could see this as an advantage in some cases it would be a major major disadvantage in my casechanging local like is proposed would undoubtedly further the bias toward really big corporations and alliances even more it would also make it even harder to do anything by yourself outside of highsecas it is right now it is simply stupid to rat more than one or two jumps from your buddies and that is with instant knowledge of who is in systemif you dont know who is in system at any time then you had better be in a gang of some size if you want to even rat unless you have a death wish  without an actively updated local roaming gangs would make 00 life even harder than it is now almost nobody willingly engages unless they have an advantage changing local would only force more people to fight and die when they would have rather run

when are we going to see some of these issues formalized as many have been adopted by members of the csm is the player input part of the csm effectively over and the plan to go straight to ccp with the templates or what

ive been banned for the last fourteen days so forgive me for not being here soonersomewhere along the line the discussion seemed to get off track where people confused the words loot with salvage in the original posti read and reread the posts here and the op seems to only be concerned with the looting of the ships killed  ie pulling stuff from jetcans   and not concerned with the random salvaging of the wrecksi lend my support to the rewriting of the rules providing that they only affect jetcan looting and not giving salvage aggro i would consider it very irritating if after blowing up another pilots ship in highsec i was unable to shoot any thieves that might be close byit seems unbalanced to me and i vote yes

i fully support this issue
he blew the whistle on blatant developer misconduct ccp denied it tried to cover it up and blow clouds of smoke to distract people from it and when eventually public outcry forced them to admit what happened and forced the developer to post a public apology about his actions  was bannedthe way the matter was handled and the banning of   under a catchall you cant make our jobs harder or we ban you clause   is a black black mark on ccps reputation and showed the playerbase ccps true face
he faced ccps despotic wrath in the hopes of making the game a better cheat free place hes one of the few players that deserves the title of martyr
i always felt he was banned as ccps way of discrediting the fact their employee cheated i support this
just today on slashdot people were discussing developer misconduct and that they unfairly unbanned the whistleblowerthe view that ccp are cheating bastards still live onthis wont change unless ccp actually admits fault
op should modify the thread title from player banning a rather general and obscure until one reads the contents to unban   that way we will all know what is going onas far as i understand ccp has a full authority to pretty much do anything they want in the game world and on forums all our stuff belongs to them that said i do not know what exactly happened even after reading all the information on his forums  i am not certain how he obtained the db that implicated certain characters in the nowwellestablished passed scandal if he obtained the information legally or as legally as one can then i would certainly not mind csm taking a closer look at the  affair  however if the information has been obtained via a hack or other illegal means then i would not be able to support it at all  even though i am am avid reader of his forums other than that i am just bumping this thread to see what happens  and if csm would ask some questions and perhaps prepare a report without too many details on what ccp told them was the reason for banning was it a retaliation for outing some well known characters was it for illegal actions that lead to the outing that can be proven by ccp what was it  the affair is well know and widely publicized a small inquiry would be in order  but i can not support to just unabn the guy need more infoeditcould someone point me in the direction specific direction that shows where the version of the db was obtainedhow it was obtained or drop me an evemail with the info until then a simple unban does not work for me worthy of an investigation by csm perhaps but not just lifting the ban
this man did all of eve a service and got banned for his troublenot because he broke the rules because he made ccp look stupidfree 
unban
 i want to live i want a home and children and peace do ya aye i do ive asked god for these things its all for nothing if you dont have freedom
revealing the truth behind a scandal is not a reason to ban someone
right the wrongs of the ban
i support this unban him if he wouldnt have spoken then we would still have devs that cheat in the game we payhe shouldve been awarded but not with the ban stick
yep i thought this aswell supported
supporting this
supporting this
this should have been done ages agoshame on ccp for shooting the messenger
afaik  he didnt hack the rkk forums to get the db dump he convinced some admin that he was someone else and was given the dump willingly he went to ccp first with the whole t20 deal and gave them a chance to deal with it once they did nothing then he went public after the whole thing broke ccp asked him to take down kugucom while they investigated and he did ccp then banned him and he brought it back
at this time id just like to know more about ccps motivation
as would i but this is something where everyones hands are tied no matter how unjust it might or might not have seemed to us in any individual case ccp has the legitimate authority to ban players and they cant comment on how the investigation or the specifics of what happened because of issues of privacy and confidentiality we the rest of the players are not privy to all the facts and its not appropriate for us to becsm can certainly ask ccp more generally how it conducts investigations and the steps it takes in deciding when to ban a player but asking ccp to unban a player isnt csms jobsorry no supportlord grant us the senility to forget the people we never liked anyway the good fortune to run into the people we do and the eyesight to know the difference
free  this happened just as i started playing eve and i cant believe its still not sorted

give everyone 10 in all attributesleave basic learning skill alonerefund sp spent in learning skills by doubling training speed until you gain back twice the amount of sp you lost remove the 800k sp character builds and revert them to before they were introduced newbies need to spend more time in frigates and less time on learning skills
if learning skills are removed i expect to be reimbursed on the full sp i spent on the learning block and be allowed to put it where i please i didnt spend months on that block to be screwed later onregards maabuss
learning skills should be done away with and skill training time should be reballanced once they are gone ccp might even give us our skill points back
youre hardly acting as if you care what anyone else thinks as youve repeatedly said that youll act the same way in the futureand darius does a hell of a better job of rolling with the punches when he gets trolled i hope you understand its rather unprofessional to troll back youre taking this way too seriouslyi voted in favor of itso a method exists already but you want ccp to be the only ones to initiate a vote of no confidence considering all the support theyve given to the csm this far im not at all pleased with that option
oh i can support in this topic tooimpeach it
hey guys lets elect a council but if they try to have a discussion and disagree with me lets mute them for being disruptive democracy in action
oh wait im a goon and obviously because of that i cant have an opinion on this matter because its a goon conspiracy to ruin eve
not true i care about what some people think i just dont happen to care what abusive trolling people think and yep while i have admitted some mistakes in that meeting i dont believe muting inanna was one of them and i stand by that decision if you want vote to impeach the chair because you hate the concept of committee moderation then go you but dont feel too bad if i mostly ignore your arguments on the matter as irrelevant claptrap while i get back to considering the merits of gameplay issues on this forum section right
there you have it straight from the horses mouth if you disagree with jade and vote opposite to what it wants youre an abusive troll and dont deserve a voiceoh wait im a terrible goonie and my opinion doesnt matter
so what would you say to the csm charter which clearly states its a council of equals but yet you take it upon yourself to make it unequal  in your favor  this isnt a fascist dictatorship that because you got 40 odd more votes than hardin you get to rule with an iron fist its guess what a council where guess what you all get to vote equally no wai are you sure it says that in the charter mutes the charter
i support this vote of noconfidencethe last meeting was pathetic
so if a member from the player base speaks up in disagreement with you and replies to your condescending remarks in kind that player is labeled a troll so is this your solution for a mute towards your player base that you are supposed to be working for
channel mute it and let the csms have an opinion just because it got the most votes in the initial election doesnt mean it gets final say in any and every topic brought to the table
everyone is equal but some are more equal than others
i check my own prostate all the time whats the problem
no the council is not the same as a government they do not have to be in charge of things like this honestly i think that the csm document should be greatly expanded to include some sort of procedure for discussion debate and decission makeing with the time constraints that this council is under i am supprised that they have gotten through as many real issues as they have well done everyone however the problems with this council are due to a lack of clear procedure they do not have time to create one from scratch before they goto iceland and still have quality things to put on the table there for discussion this is why someone got muted this is why darius farted this council has been asked to decide together what meaningfull topics will go to iceland for discussion with little to no procedure as far as a vote of no confidencehave the csm document changed to state that if a majority of the csm reps feel the chairman should be removed they can take the issue to ccp who will look into the matter and make a decision  oh and use a clear deffinition of majority  the csm does not belong to us it belongs to ccp this is their tool to get usefull feedback from their players let them make it work
does moderation really include quelching votes and disregarding vote results you dont like
seeing the log seeing jade comin here and act 12 i wish i had voted for another dunno maybe his dad wrote up his little spiel that made me vote for himim not a goon or a goon alt he dont know me from adam i want him off the chair before he has another malfunction with the channel when its time to vote for a important issuealso who come to the chair i would hope would know what it is tobe a chair and not make there little wises after every voteand jane growup ya want to play big boy then play iti vote to have him removed from the chair and if he cant settle down and work for me twards my goals in the game i want him out of the csm and put somone who can do the job with out being a burden to the system
i agree with what you said and yes i voted for him also however i do not agree to remove him from the csm completely he has a lot to contribute but just not from the chair
so youre going to just ignore us blow us off and the thread that has been created because of you yourself jade constantine its becoming increasingly evident that you dont care about us just because we didnt vote for you if you keep up that attitude you may not get another termthe only problem with this is that theres been very little feedback from ccp xhagen may have been in the first official meeting but he didnt really do anything they havent even published the minutes from the first three meetings yet i think its partially their fault too that jade has taken it upon himself to enforce the meetings as he sees fit
ccp just helping the goons destroy the game faster
no you misunderstand i dont care about silly forum trolls with nothing better to do than post exactly the same thing 10101001301003 other forum trolls are posting its got nothing to do with people not voting for me i can respect a difference of opinion what i cant respect is repetitious mediocrity i find collectivist activity very yawninspiring at the best of times well technically ive taken it onto myself to run the meetings as advised in the csm documentation where things have gone wrong have been where ive made the mistake of allowing this council a little too much democracy and allowed them to impact the constitution of the csm itself inevitably it led to problems as people try to vote themselves advantage case in point was the vote on moderation and op powers what i should have done was rule it out of order and simply say the docs say the chair moderates live with it or complain to ccp instead we wasted time on a vote to confirm a power the officers have anyway just to placate the butthurt feelings of some guys that dont like being told when they can speak in meetings thats the truth of it
yes because it is clearly in ccps interest to help destroy their own game and primary corporate income
why does jade keep dismissively referring to your csm reps it was pointed out by darius earlier jade in case you werent aware you are our csm rep you didnt vote for yourself 2436 times and its entirely possible that one of those people who voted for you disagrees with your recent actions take responsibility for your actions and stop opposing both your constituent base and your fellow csm members
lol one thing you are going to have to realize about me is i treat people differently depending on my past experience with them youve acted like a complete plonker from your first posts so i honestly dont care what you think anton sorry but i got elected for my disarming honesty as much as anything herschel yamamoto on the other hand even though i disagree with him over the issue of muting inanna i do care what he thinks because hes taken time to read and present issues here take an interest in the csm process and generally be a responsible respondent to issues threads so dont try and sun yourself in my conciliatory post to another person its really not meant for you
no support let them work it outi think its very important that the csm learns to leave their baggage at the council room door and works together almost as important as the end product theyre working towards future councils need a precedent set that you dont just move to impeach whenever someone does something stupidunpopularstart the culture of cooperation now those who dont buyin just look silly and short sighted next election day make cooperation a voting issue
youve obviously realized that flat denial and selfdelusion isnt working so youre attempting distraction and appeasement is the pointironically when you insulted all those who criticized you  zomg we want to see csm fail and its all a big goon conspiracy   you insulted the people whose es you are now attempting to kiss good luck jade if theyre stupid enough to be disarmed by your facade more power to them
youre hardly acting as if you care what anyone else thinks as youve repeatedly said that youll act the same way in the futureand darius does a hell of a better job of rolling with the punches when he gets trolled i hope you understand its rather unprofessional to troll back youre taking this way too seriously
vote against jade acted appropriately in muting innana who was clearly in the wrong and disruptive to the meeting furthermore innana has acted even less professionally since the meeting and is now making wild accusations on these boards instead of working with the council to get past the issueif anyone should be removed its innana
no i dont think innana should be removed at all  i am of the opinion that people should only be removed for gross misconduct such as breach of the nda or at the end of thier term nothing else   i do however agree that she should take it up with the members of the csm to try and come to some sort of way of getting past the issue beween themsleves rather than bringing it into the public domain
nobody wants anybody removed from the csm some people just feel that the position of chair would be better filled by someone other than jade
wheres my support thumbwait there it is seriously jade youre easily the biggest idiot ive ever seen elected to office and i live in america
jade is going great inanna was disruptive and deserved the 30 second mute lol wahh waahh the csm chairman isnt nice to me when i criticize him seriously shutup
you are ignorant of the facts my dear forum alt ianna was kicked from the chatroom and then unable to join until after a vote had concluded
doesnt jade write terrible fanfic about unrestrained gallente sexuality someone find that link thats clearly not the direction i want this game going
yeah ive read the chatlogs and i do agree that jade seems to be not only abusing its power as chair but seems to be paranoid i vote that jade is removed from chair position at the very least at the most it should be removed from the council altogether if its obvious mental instability becomes an issue
well actually the sanction against inanna was a 30 sec mute but sadly the chat channel functionality is messed up and the unmute setting  kick from channel she then needed to be manually reinvited and unmuted again but the point is the punishment was a 30 sec mute while the final vote of the evening was being stated its entirely false for you to state that she wasnt able to join against till after the vote  she was given an opportunity to cast her vote when shed rejoined if anyone is ignorant of the facts  albeit intentionally so   its you anton
good even better if hes diruptive again he should be banned for a month
 hardin  hang on where is inannashe was able to voteafter she resolved the problem and returned minutes after the vote had been called by you jade
innanas vote would have been useless either way i hope hes learned not to disrupt the process next time
guys we should have a fair election for who should be csm chairmutes everyone not in gs
sadly based on all evidence i can see its clear that jade is unable to remain within his remit and therefore i support this
i have to admit its pretty funny how much of a giant joke the entire csm is
 in most of that time i had not been able to see the discussion let alone vote at any point thus is quite ridiculous as i didnt even know what the vote was about having been kicked and reentered twice then kicked an unable to reenter yes it was subsequently suggested that there is something odd about that channels controls  unique indeed i havent been able to replicate it on any other channel   so maybe some of that was unintentional but it doesnt change the sequence of events into that you repeatedly suggestiz
its hardly a joke the ridiculous fascination with it is though
who didnt see this comingboot the loon
seeing the log seeing jade comin here and act 12 i wish i had voted for another dunno maybe his dad wrote up his little spiel that made me vote for him im not a goon or a goon alt he dont know me from adam i want him off the chair before he has another malfunction with the channel when its time to vote for a important issue also who come to the chair i would hope would know what it is tobe a chair and not make there little wisecracks after every vote and jane growup ya want to play big boy then play it i vote to have him removed from the chair and if he cant settle down and work for me twards my goals in the game i want him out of the csm and put somone who can do the job with out being a burden to the system
see what bitter whiners not getting what they want and so looking for a witch to burn cos they cannot deal with their own in game inadequates and incompetenceyup id say anybody with a brain saw this coming a mile off although i am sure ccp are very happy the crybabies now have somebody else to blame and pester
nolet jade do his joba complete democracy with no one in power using said power to keep the csm in order will fail to accomplish anything then a comedy circus im sure some would like it to fail this way
i had a pretty decent reply but bitter whiner not getting what they wants and so looking for a witch to burn cos they cannot deal with their own in game inadequates and incompetence pretty much describes jade perfectly except for the bad grammer of it all
actually i was referring to you and the other drama queens on here spouting your crap but i am more than happy to include jade and the rest of the useless csm clowns as well
what is his job to boot and mute anyone who doesnt agree with him to make the other council members lives a living hell to claim powers that he has no right to if thats his job then sure he does it quite wellwhy even have anyone else on the council if you want it to be a dictatorship
you completely missed the point of this and several other entire threads if jade were acting like a moderator and not a tyrant  read roberts rules of order if you need to have what that means defined   we wouldnt be having this discussion jade has taken every opportunity to usurp power and control for himself up to and including silencing people with dissenting opinions who are just as passionate about their job as csm as himhes got a christ complex and hes working himself up to be the martyr im happy to give him that status if it means hes out of the chairmans position you could put anyone else in that position and id be fine with it the rest of the csms have displayed at least a passing respect for what council of equals means
whilst you are certainly welcome to your opinions  and if everyone thought exactly the same the world of eve or real life would be very boring   please point me at any evidence for these claims wild accusations hardly izps i do not presently support the removal of jade from the position of chair of the csm obviously being a rational human being this opinion is subject to change in the light of future events
i think most people respect that if you did support our position it could easily be spun by jades flunkies to make you look petty youre an intelligent person so im sure you already know that though
qft   so is jade a he or a she decide please   i knew this crap was going to happen and i bet its going to happen again and again even if someone new is elected i wish there was a way to do psychological screening before electing candidatesi say we give jade a chance to get hisher sit together sort to speak people make mistakes and sometimes they need to learn how to handle themselves in a new role lets just see how it plays out ill always have a chance to give my thumbs up later if nothing will changeps teh goons need to hush seriously the way people conduct themselves in a game often shows what kind of people they are in rl at least to a certain level to be complaining about someone elses conduct you must 1st show good conduct yourself  just my two cents  
i refuse to take the responsibility of making such a decision
so when a person is throwing around their power and abusing you just roll over like a good little slave and take it
dont worry about me my desktop pc runs on goon tears
its all downhill from here im afraid hence my proposal to nip the jc problem in the budjade is also trying to assert veto power which the chair clearly doesnt have
so you want to mute people who dont disagree with you tooi dont get why everyone thinks were terrible people just because of our ingame reputation why are we powerful enough to get two individuals onto the csm why do we control so much space what makes us so much worse than the other griefers ill take your stereotyping into account and reiterate what you had to say to be complaining about someone elses conduct you must 1st show good conduct yourself

i support this ideai dont mind if theyre not searchable but i would like to browse them without mucking about with contracts
but there is the problem it becomes increasingly difficult for an attacker to have any ability to get their caps into system to counter your caps they have to send in bs fleets in order to shoot a cynojammer module with about a million hp while under possible fire from enemy capitals supercaps and by extension dds with no oppertunity to get their own cap support into the system to allow the support fleet to work essentially to fix youre problem you can lower the cynojammers onliningofflineing timers but if you want to move caps freely around your systems you should leave the cynojammers offline and online them if the system is under threat if you take capitals out of the picture the defenders already have an advantage they dont need an overwhelming advantage such that you have to be a megablob to attack it anyway the best proposal is to make the jump bridges into jump gates and allow any ship that can use system gates be able to use jump gates but any ship that cannot use jump gates will have to cyno to a pos cyno module  you know those modules actually exist right and are disabled by cyno jammers  
good ideas
ill agree with this buti feel in many ways the whole eve online universe needs a complete fiction reboot not unlike what they do with comic books every now again and this new fiction must be integrated fully into the game and game play because is someways eve online feels like a game looking for a story
seems to me if there was a substantial vote of approval from nonrp segment of the community was for this  youd get my approval since someone within the rp community is rallying the troops  bravo  but there are more important stuff ie game mechanics issues  please stand in line no approval
i approve of anything that says ccp update your website and finish what youve started
it would make large fleet fights take hours to complete it would without a doubt make large fleet fights even worse it only works in your imagination
i always expected some crazy requests but you sir take the caketwo people have a gun they shoot one person that one person should only take the damage of one gun if theyre the same size or largerwow i know we have to suspend disbelief a bit and ignore physics but this is ridiculous
why dont they just make invention dual tiered the current system for makeing bpcs of of t2 gear and a way more expencive like 1001000x more data cores and some other new stuff and invention based skills at lvl 5s in the same things you need now and it will transfer t1 bpos to t2 gives poeple a reason to get those high lvl rd agents it will remove alot of t1 bpos as they get transfered to t2 it would still take quite a bit of time for new players to get these skills and rp but it would give some poeple another goal it doesnt seam like this would be unfair to anyone really this game is skill and isk based and it will feed both really
i would only be satisfied if my bpos were turned into bpc equal to 3 years worth of productionactually id only be satisfied if devs actually commented on the issue instead of hiding from itthe last peep of info was ages ago at the last fanfest  a reply of no they wont be changed   but there really is too much time between actually dev commentsits a constant gamble investing in assets than can be nurfed becuase of a forum of majority whiners
i move that all threads suggesting the removal of any of the csm reps be taken with a grain of salt theese people were elected to do a job it is a job that you all want them to do ccp has given them an enormous challange and they are sucseeding the majority of the work of the csm has run very smoothly and every problem that has occured has come in the form of commitee procedure they have not been given time to work out procedure but they are doing it as well as they can and have come to some decisions as for the goons it seems obvious that they like any other group are a group of individuals while some goons may attempt to harass or troll or greif that does not say anything about other goons an individual may not be judged by any other member of a group to whitch they belong they must be judged by their own merrit well done csm
ccp introduced roles for seven people if 7 people cant get along without one being called chairman they certainly cant get along with one being called chairman what makes it worse that the person with that title takes it to mean they have more say and more power than the rest of the group which is not trueccp screwed them from the beginning i feel sorry for the csm reps council of equals not a dictatorship where one rules over them allwish i could give this a thumbs down  
put a group together without a well defined structure and the individual with a more dominantstrong personality will always rise among them to take control its the natural and normal progression of things no matter if you like it or notmaking a set of well defined rules will prevent things from getting out of hand in the future but complaining about it is a waste of breath
support ive actually got no confidence in the people that make no confidence threads i think theyre rubbish
absolutely these should be the starting point for working out rules that work for the csm not a blank sheet of paperfull suport
i like roberts rules of order and all but honestly it wont fix any of the issuesits kinda like the motion to end discussion if everyone just shut up discussion would close by itself the current csm board has unofficial decided maybe official horrible minutes are horrible   that they discussion will happen on the forums the meetings will be pretty much straight up votingonly thing i wish they had a clear list of motion they can do right now its pretty much a cluster on what csm can do thus some of their logic is horrible
the csm exists to present issues to ccp thats all the authority ccp has given them i guess what youre saying is that since theres no way we can get five percent of the voting population to vote on a single topic that its up to the individual csms to push their pet issues i can understand why youd need to debate amongst each other in an environment like that
ah well quite in the case of a 5 supported issue then the csm has no business debating wether or not to bring it to ccp as it is mandated in the csm document that this issue must be bought before the ccp council by the csm however there still in that case is issues of how to present it and the wording of such an important presentation would also be discussed
broadly speaking i think youre right lacking the 5 in order to make it to ccp an issue has to pass a vote of csm only one member of csm needs to be in favor for it to be brought to a vote at csm though the members of csm have a legitimate right to convince each other which way to vote on particular issues  unless every member makes up their minds just by reading the forum posts which would be nice but seems unlikely   as much as we might wish otherwise debate is probably unavoidablei wont say youre wrong because youre right but im willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that this is actually harder than it looks still supporting my own topic  
i was swaying for the proposal until i saw thisthat statement alone is enough to illustrate what should happen even if the csm members can bring things to the table the forum thread should be used as the paper for the item simple as that it should present all the facts and the facts should sway the readers in fact even easier than a real meeting the other csm members can see the discussion going on and there may be little gems in that discussion that noone has thought aboutedit however there does need to be some structure to the debate id rather see this move to irc where the standard v  voice   can be applied to only one member at a time to raise a point this then streamlines the discussion and the minutes as they can be copied almost verbatim it also allows people to present their entire point without interruption again that is in the extremely few cases there will be discussion and that discussion must only be limited to events pertaining to the csm only otherwise the debate should be opened up to everyone some of the other standard rules of debating could be included but not for the purpose of debating
why the hell dont you just ignore the crap threads and focus on things that matter over the course of your term theres going to be so much  floating around that youll spend most of your time commenting on those posts easy answer is dont
i take it you dont watch pvp videos most of them are small gang pvp vids and we accomplish a whole lot
your stupidity offends me
stupid is as stupid does
this post intentionally left blank
this brings a tear to my eye ive been banned from the forums for 15 days and when i finally return my original post is still on the main pagethanks everyone
i dont believe that they are that unfair to be honest as the communications from ccp in regards to what was asked of them to do by the csm were all along the lines of soon which is hardly the mark of an organisation going out of its way to help things along unfortuntly some of these matters needed asking as there were no guidelines but yes it certainly shouldnt be the csm who is doing this agreed heres hoping that the response given is better than the responses given so far
you actually youve stalked these forums for the last three weeks like some kind of morbid vulture picking holes and singing songs of doom and gloom and anytime anybody actually tries to engage with you they get more carping criticism and nitpicking leaving the poor respondent wondering they bothered in the first place ive tried to explain the situation to you but you still insist on trying to blame and whine and complain about whats been done over the course of three weeks of frenetic struggle to get this show on the road at this stage arithron though im deeply tempted to tell you where to get off im still going to advise my fellow csm reps to try and reach middle ground with you on these multiitem issues but im going ask you in turn to shelve the pettifoggery for long enough to see we are actually trying to work with you here and do the best we can do but if you cant do that well nobody can say i didnt try
why is it always somebody elses fault jade
bears repeating cant believe youre on your high horse here darius sort your own act out before throwing stones please frankly though the blame lies at the feet of all the csm reps for the problems in this meeting i think it also bears repeating that things were achieved in this meeting despite the difficulties that actually augurs well for the csm things can improve certainly im confident they will but that things were still done in these the most trying of times suggests that when things sort themselves out the csm will get a great deal done and may just turn out to be a vehicle for positive change i realise drama is the lifeblood of eve but try and keep some perspective people
why do you feel the need to troll every thread this evening its one of those perennial questions of the human condition isnt it
are we back to trolls and goon conspiracy
to be fair i think conspiracy is pushing it just a tad too far when you look at your posting history today almost all of it is abrasive comments aimed at jade with no actual content other than that designed to annoy people so yeah i think the troll words fits in pretty well here post somethign constructive with even a hint of middle ground and you might find people more willing to give your words some credence
it is clear that ccp did not hand you a constitution by which you are intended to funciton and that is most likely intentional merely some suggestionsguidelines just look at the game and how it is played you are the first set of elected representatives it is your job to serve as the founding fathers and write the constitutionif you did that worked together and wrote the basic outline of the constitution selected your rules of operating procedure yourselves and followed it  and when you met with ccp insisted that they recognise your player designed constitution formed by player elected representatives they would really have no choice but to recognise it  outside of course the actions of one government  ccp   choosing not to recognise another government  the csm   just as happens in real world politics  mainland china throwing their weight around to discourage for example the usa to not recognise the government of tiwan officially    id like to add that up until i read this thread i was on a trial account and for some madhouse reason this actually made me want to activate my account you have a huge opportunity here to form a player goverment in a very very political game in all honesty there is no reason this could not have been done before entirely on the will of the players alone without ccp saying you could do it  with of course the dubious question looming about votingvote validity but thats really no different than any real world government  
welcome to eve dippin
i thought so too let jade knowif reality annoys youi believe removing jade from chair is constructive i believe it is to the benefit of csm and many people agree with me furthermore plenty of people are willing to give my words credence jade simply doesnt because my position is different from his fortunately he is in no position to mute me
oh it doesnt annoy me in the least actually it is just the intention i was looking at hmm getting people to agree to what they already agree to isnt a trick getting people to listen to what you say and alter their opinion or at least make them think is rather the point and i dont think that youve really done that with the way you have gone about it today which was more my point you are assuing jade of simply not lending weight to your words becuase he disagrees but you have been doin the same all day since hat thread came into being in anycase i hope tomorrow brings about a few more cooler heads and a few less tantrums on these forums  not that i am holding my breath on that one      
i dont wish to change peoples minds or alter their opinions i dont have an agenda like yourself plenty of people came to the realization that jade is out of control on their own people can and should make up their own mindseither that or he really believes the goon conspiracy tripe in which case he is mentally ill
well i believe that removing you from your ship and podding you repeatedly until your clone had so few skillpoints you couldnt reliably speak caldari without a phrasebook would be constructive too but we cant have everything we want i guess we both need to get used to living with disappointment
youve already shown that you love no less than punishing those who disagree with you i appreciate the fodder however
no offense but i am unsure of your reason for posting then do you simply wish to see your words on the forums surely the whole point of the forums is to encourage deabte and discussion which is obviously partly about altering peoples opinions to an extent as for you not having an agenda well its quite clear you do as you posted an issue thread for such an item    i certainly do have an agenda i wish the csm to work i believe ccp is at fault in the main for the problems with the csm and i think flaming jade continutally doesnt help to make things better of course being in star fraction i know jade personally and dont like to see him insulted and called things that are untrue but i will live with it as he will as for being out of control i think half the problem as stated by cosmo on another thread somewhere is that people dont seem to realise how much control a chairman should be exerting on a commitee that is of course nobodies fault as not many people have experience on serving as a chairman of a commitee in any case the chairmans control or lack thereof is still a matter that should have been address by ccp in a properly prepared document rather than left to the first commitee to figure out for themselves i realise many people dont like restrictive rules and in most things neither do i but a commitee without a solid structure and control by a chairperson does not work and i would rather like to see this particualr commitee succeed me goes to bed before he has to be up again
that was probably the least threatening threat and the wussiest burn in the history of eve online
that makes two of usif quoting jade and ironically editorializing said quotes is flamingwhen you appeal to authority make sure its not someone who knows jade personally and dont like to see him insultedthe chairperson is responsible to the playerbase not just ccp as are all csm reps the point of the majority of my insulting posts was to explain why i and others take issue with jades actions during the meeting and since perhaps you should try reading them again as you missed the point in fact the majority of criticisms directed toward jade arent about the rules or lack there of but rather his own actions during the meeting and after
you mildly irritate me and your presence in a local channel that includes me may cause me to frown a bit hows that i really should work on my threats i knew there was a reason i didnt become a pirate   me really is going to bed now
thumbs up
bull you will see people give a middle ground when there is a middle ground to give when jade lies and refuses to acknowledge the facts of the case he will get called on it if you are complaining that he is called on it then maybe you should talk to jade about his habitual lying ad hominem strawman and ignoring of all points which might damage whatever it is he supportswe are long past the point where we can present new evidence and arguments we have presented them in spades and all that has been done is for jade to ignore them lie about them ad hominem them and strawman them
this basically sums it up at this point i never thought id be on goums side of an argument but there it is
dearest goumwhen are you going to get around to lengthy and irate derision of darius for the part he clearly played in this messi mean if youre calling people on their behavior in some apparently nonpartisan way and holding them to account for their actions i assume thats on your agenda also
darius muted ianna editorialized csm decisions then flipped out and said that those criticizing him were part of some conspiracy to destroy the csm rather than accepting responsibilityplease
dear me im pointing out what appears to be double standards when goonswarm members lambast jade whilst silently letting darius off the hook for the part he played in this mess your counter to this observation is to continue that very behavior yeah well played
what part you have access to the log lets see some quotes although you may wish to start your own thread as this one is clearly about jades actions  read the title of the thread  darius played no bigger part than any of the other csm reps save jade antigoon bias is fun but weve got real issues here
youve been doing some selective reading if you dont know what im talking about if you want to see the quotes then someone in one of these threads compiled a list of them where he was pretty clearly instigating rather than address the problem however goonswarm members just dismissed the person as an sf alt thats the very same treatment goum here is complaining to jade about you going to admonish your own people for acting in a way youve complained to jade about goum or is this just a case of double standardswhen i raise the issue myself its dismissed once more and labelled not a real issue and antigoon bias again more double standards here or what i think ill leave it there you seemingly dont have the capacity to meet the issue and i wasnt even addressing you in the first place ill let the man speak for himself
dariuss comments have always been towards the actions that the chair has taken to expand its power outside the scope of the csm document are you are saying that it is right and proper to sit by and let the chairman expand its power so that it can push through partisan agendas i suppose the meeting would have gone smoother had no one objected to jades usurpation of power and corruption of the position of chairman by using it as a bludgeon to get what he wanted but i doubt that the outcome of the process would have been better
this entire csm is like a puppet show with jade dancing around and darius carefully pulling his strings it really is quiet amusing especially when you get to hear about the emails
i love it welcome to eve dippin
way to swallow the coolaidgoons and darius in specific are transparent as air on this forummr johnson was playing the righteous instigator from the start and especially at the tail end of that meetinghow many times did he bait jade near the end three times at least the double standards applied in this thread could win a trophy
3 even you cannot ignore that you only twice purported to silence me when i asked a question surely and please do not say it was to protect a vote when none were in progress really iz
sidebarthis is actually the very best reason why no matter that it was very imperfect  especially used in a singlechannel format   that a textchat channel is the best option for meetings voice recordings suffer from noise lack of random access lack of timestamps that all have equal access to etciz
i am sorry i must have missed that can you please point out these baits and why they were unjustified considering jades prior action and disregard for the legitimacy of the council which has already been documented  
 20080608 214620  darius johnson  well she did get two official warningsUFEFF 20080608 214629  darius johnson  maybe the channel is enforcing rule 20080608 215429  darius johnson  well the meetings not over so what happened will be included whether you like it or not 20080608 215821  darius johnson  well its cool just mute them next time you dont like what theyre saying and well be cool 20080608 220124  darius johnson  so what who the hell are you 20080608 220243  darius johnson  lets just mute everyone and move onanyone thinking clearly will see that these are emotionally charged baits for jade to get hooked on and drag themeeting further into a conflict they add nothing constructive to the meeting or the topicgo ahead goumindong spin away im sure you will find someway to warp this around
nothing to spin one of these comments was not directed at jade and the rest are quite clearly responses to jades unauthorized disenfranchisement of an elected representative really the comments are quite tame in comparison to what the situation deserved really i dont see why anyone would bring up comments made in response to the topic of this thread unless the desire was to deflect from the issue at hand
youre quoting darius opposing jades conduct multiple csm members have taken issue with jades very controversial actions during that meeting so i dont see how an emotionally charged response can be viewed as unreasonable espectially from the candidate who has been the most active in keeping the current chairmans presumptions of power in check and advocated for equality in the powers of all csm members
how are those responses  clearly those do not add anything contructive to any topic or the flow of the meeting at allin addition qualifying them as tame doesnt mitigate the fact of what they are flame bait they are hooks for someone to catch and pull them into an emotionally charged conflictyou cant spin out of that those are not responses they can only be categorized as outburstssorry you dont get a free pass to make outbursts to bait the room into even more conflict just because you feel emotionally justifiedno meeting needs or requires a righteous instigator to drag it into the mud
you actually youve stalked these forums for the last three weeks like some kind of morbid vulture picking holes and singing songs of doom and gloom and anytime anybody actually tries to engage with you they get more carping criticism and nitpicking leaving the poor respondent wondering they bothered in the first place ive tried to explain the situation to you but you still insist on trying to blame and whine and complain about whats been done over the course of three weeks of frenetic struggle to get this show on the road at this stage arithron though im deeply tempted to tell you where to get off im still going to advise my fellow csm reps to try and reach middle ground with you on these multiitem issues but im going ask you in turn to shelve the pettifoggery for long enough to see we are actually trying to work with you here and do the best we can do i feel i must reply to such a personal attack which i feel is totally out of order and not in keeping with your supposedly high standards of societal duties that csm reprsentatives are supposed to havehow have i stalked the forums i have brought up issues that affect the players of eve i have always been polite nonpersonal and noninsulting everything i have raised has been backed up via csm documentation or posted forum comments you clearly have mistaken me for someone else singing songs of doom and gloom i want the csm to worki stood remember and will be doing so again next time aroundmaybe you take players pointing out the guidelines and rules personally i cant apologise for that since i have never attacked anyone personallyyou dont need to work with me you need to work for me and all the other 220000 players that you represent the issue i raised regarding multiple issues as one post and vote affects everyone if my concern for due process and rules concerns you again i cant apologise someone needs to raise these issues and highlight the areas of concerntake carebruce hansen
so categorize them as outbursts i wont be losing any sleep over it ill instead be concerned about things that matter such as council members being able to speak
im sure you wont transparent as glass my friend the csm is a delicate boat and everyone is more then happy to grab a rope and pull the chance to entertain themselves watching it capsize is too compelling
a man in a crowded theater yells plural n word there is a fire there are many appropriate responses for this one of which is to run another of which is to object to the use of offensive language neither of these qualify as furthering the discussion and all might be considered outburstsyou are walking down the street and a man next to you get stabbed holy  call the police is an outburst but it is also a clearly an appropriate responsemany times when someone does something outside of the rules appropriate responses certainly include actions that do not further the discussionanother example closer to home responses that are signed with a thumbs up in the assembly hall are not discussion but since the assembly hall is a place where players are to voice their opinion its an entirely acceptable response
transparent try honest its actions were deplorable they will continue to be im not going to deny or act as if that doesnt bother me it does and its wrong v0v if thats a bad thing in your eyes then so be it
not really interested in comparing apples and oranges goum already had lunchagain you cant spin when darius has admited that those were already flaming outbursts all thats left is to downplay them like he is doing nowagain you act like your comments could solve or sooth something those were obviously ment to drag the council into more infighting it really doesnt matter how emotionally justified you feel you were constructive or solutions to problems they were not
im still having a hard time understanding how jade can maintain that he is in the right through all of this jade do you honestly think that avoiding tricky questions and passing the blame lends credence to your massive walls of words
its previously been said that what darius should really do is act completely submissive and let jade do whatever the hell he wants 
where did i say that they were clearly meant to be durogatory to jade i never said otherwise jade broke the council by disenfranchising an elected representative i responded in a semiugly fashion unlike jade i can accept responsibility for my actions and will say that wasnt very professional i will also add that the comments wouldnt have occurred if it hadnt broken the council process by bullying yet another council member im not really sure what youre trying to get at here but im not denying anything i had pushed for this and all communications to be completely public i know when i say something itll be read by everyone i have nothing to hide whatsoever
im sure if you keep attacking he will eventually change his mind resign from the chair and cry in a cornerwait no he wont he already said his peace and probably is going to focus on the next meeting to try and stay above the crap that everyone likes to slingmob politics is too brute
thats right beat that strawman ow i beat he felt that one
dont get me wrong darius i voted for you because i like your poltics this isnt an attack on your person its a counterattack on the people attacking jade for hypocritically stated reasonsthe chairman needs power and the will to use it people can debate the fine line all day but what people are currently flametraining is a point were anyone in jades shoes is going to be expected to carry the burden of getting meetings done on time but with no real power or with limited power that it is afraid to use because the powerabuse witch hunters come crawling out of the woodwork to beat him down
had i been saying those things you quoted out of turn and been muted for that id have agreed with you unfortunately in this case i believe the powerabuse witch hunters are correct really the logs speak for themselves
its not apples and oranges do you not believe that standing up for the rights of disenfranchised representatives is the thing you ought to do when someone runs roughshod over the rights of anotherthe analogies are fitting enough
depends what you mean by standing up nothing i quoted could be construed to be working toward that goal it wasnt even criticism it was just bait to start a mud fightsince you like analogies ill give you onesuppose someone accidentally hit your dog with a car and was bleeding internally it needs to get to the vet instead you drag the driver out of his automobile and proceed to beat the crap out of him your dog dies due to the trauma what have you accomplished other then venting your angerat any rate i think darius has said his peace and its at a point were we are agreeing to disagree
well ive said my piece to them already as far as im concerned heres the line in the founding documents im supportingsummary of representative responsibilities chairman and vicechairman organize meetings of the csm moderate meetings delegate assignments where necessary summon alternates when primary representatives are unavailable its a cut and dried case really chair has the power to moderate meetings moderation can mean calling people to speak warning people from speaking over each other ensuring the correct order of the agenda is followed and yes if neccessary its going to include channel mutes if people really are refusing to follow the guidance of the chair where weve gone wrong in my opinion is allowing ourselves to believe we can handle rules changes to this admin and procedural stuff as a elected committee but the reality is were a factionalized csm with some members who really dont like other members and too much voting on partizan lines for our prospective changes to the constitution to be considered safe or reasonable i think the way forward is to pretty much veto all attempts to rewrite the constitutional issues at this point and focus entirely on player subscribed gameplay issuesive certainly got the power as chair to say whether an itemmotion can come under the heading of issue or administration and from now on im going to be inclined to say all attempts to change or rewrite the constitution must be submitted as issues supported by a csm rep go through the 7 day public discussion and come up for discussion in the meeting as a prospective item for future 1to1 discussions with ccp on and thence to a documented proposalwell basically take the position that only ccp can or should change the constitutioncsm texts and all we can do is make advise on that we never should have been changing these things on the fly and its clear in retrospect it was a big mistakesimplifying matters in this way well remove a big slice of politics and infighting from the csm because issues like moderationnoconfidencerole of alternatesvoting weights and such will be out of our reach  and temptation   and well focus entirely on issues im sure there will still be storms ahead but i think a majority of the csm are behind this intention to remove factional infighting from the administrativeprocedural section of csm proceedings and fingers crossed well ensure that from this point forward we wont be having any more silly votes and wasting the public time
at what point did you ever think that any amount of changing the boundaries you could and couldnt do things was acceptable at alli also want to know where in the hell you get off thinking that its okay to mute someone who is disagreeing with your methodology of being unfair disruptive to the meeting process if things arent fair in the first place that trumps all other said issueits obvious you have no idea just what a chairman does to facility the meeting and you should step down be removed or learn really dam fast
this is not analogous it is not because there is no fault of the driver it is also not because the driver is not taking actions to disrupt the resolution of the matterin this matter jade is at fault and is disrupting the resolution of the matter
thank you for finally accepting my points on all of the above as this is what i have been asking and pointing out for the past 2 weeks of course an apology for your earlier comments might not go amiss   its good to see that from now on the csm will be focussing on the important stuff of player issues lets hope the way forward is brightertake carebruce hansen
but it does not includeeditorializing decisionsbadgering those who have already voted to change their vote when votes do not go in the manner the csm head wantedmuting people with reasonable objections to the abovein order to do this you would have to change the constitution and rules of procedure to give someone veto power something that is not within the purview of the csm to deal with anywaythis is also incorrect this power is clearly defined by the csm document to be within the rights of any equal member of the csm that means everyone not you everyone
oh sweet looks like its everybody elses faultgood to see youve genuinely turned around jade and arent just pretending to reconcile because youve finally figured out most people hate you
yeah on this issue you were right and i was wrong i admit it sorry to doubt you there bruce
so this is how democracy endswith a thunderous applause
wrong jade did what he thought was appropriate to keep the meeting in order people are punching the driver because they feel they found some angle to abuse him withno one attacking jade is trying to resolve anything they just want to kick him for the fun of it the only ones that can do something construtive at this point is the csm by buring the hatched and clarifying were the line can be drawn that or ccp stepping ineverything is just more  in a sea of it
i always have respect for a person that can admit when they were wrong apology acceptedtake carebruce hansen
cheers to that well done guys
what the hell thats not an apology he blames everyonewhosnothim for ruining his meetings then says he will veto any attempt to remove him from powerbut whatevs nameless caldari guy and member of star fraction lets continue to pat ourselves on the back
trolling removed navigator
the chairman doesnt have veto power jades gone off the deep end
like this is a recent development
id like to make note of the fact that this issue was not brought up until after a motion had been presented to remove your ability to mute people during meetings as youre clearly not fit to handle this id also like to note the fact that you have chosen to unilaterally state that the results of the vote which caused you to throw the tantrum in the first place are null due to this dictatum all in all an exercise of convenience
some people appear not to understand what it means when the status quo ante the vote remains the status quonothing jade has said about the vote on operator rights is a liethe officers had operator rights before the vote this was the status quo antethe motion sought to change that to a situation where all members of the csm had operator rightsthe motion failed thus the status quo remained as it was before this implicitly confirms the officers as having operator rightsit is absolutely correct to object that no decision as to who should have operator rights before this vote has been taken by the csm that decision appears to have been taken by the officers of the csm specifically by agreement with the chair and vicechair they have the explicit duty and authority to establish the operations of the csm and this decision was in their remitthe csm has now acquiesced in that decision by not voting for a positive changeif there is anyone who really believes that the csm should confirm by formal vote every decision made by the officers of this committee for their decisions to have validity then they essentially believe that the csm should be mired in procedural gridlockcommittee work is where idealism meets pragmatism and often must yield this might be unpalatable to some but it is quite essential if work is to be donei entirely expect certain people to dismiss me as a jade campfollower or nitpick over the chatlog and what procedure in committees means i am afraid i will remain unmoved by this as my aim is simply to air my opinion on the matter i have no expectation of swaying the opinions of otherscosmo
you vote simple yesno you do not have the power to vote towards an idea the vote was whether or not everyone had power the vote was no there was no implicit confirmation of operator rights there was no implicit confirmation of the right of the chairman to mute pull your nose out of jades ass and examine the facts of the situation jade was abusing his power jade got called on it jade muted and then kicked the person calling him on it
no he did not the logs show the system autokicked him jade tried to unmute on the 2nd system notificationplease stop lying goum your reputation is already terrible enough
i am sorry i missed that would you please show me where this happened
i agree with adhamhnon the csm could use a guiding hand
he underlined it in the post you quoted
no he underlined a statement of mine i dont know about you but i do not consider my statements to be logs of the csm meeting let alone the logs that show that the system autokicked inanna
making a statement that contradicts the truth is in some quarters referred to as lying
show me were in the logs that jade muted then kicked inanna it doesnt in fact the logs show that she wasnt on the blocked list and rejoined after an invite inanna said she didnt leave on purpose so the only reasonable conclusion was the system autokicked her during the mute periodyou said jade kicked inanna on purpose the logs refute that thus you were lying
only if its intentional such i am asking him to substantiate his claim if its true and the logs do indeed show that inanna was accidentally kicked from the channel and jade attempted to unmute her then i am wrong and will retract my statement there is a very simple resolution here and i suggest you take iti am sorry the logs show no such thing nor would they necessarily show all kicks especially if the kick was performed by removing someone from the invited lis  t nor do channels work the way you state in eve you are invited and can join at any time if you are on the list when you are invited you are added to the list that inanna was only able to rejoin once she was invited again is evidence that she was removed from said list this is the way nonpublic channels in eve worksaid evidence directly contradicts your claims which is that the logs show that it was an accident you made that claim and i would love to see what substantiated it
wrong you made the original posit jade kicked inanna the logs not just the system msg but the other members declaring that she wasnt on the blocked list show that this was not the case thus you have no evidence other then conjecture to make such a statementyou cant make a baseless posit then try to dismiss a counterargument on the fact that points out the negative really this is logical argument 101 you are trying to win this by making the challenger to your posit prove a negativethe logs all of it show that your original statement has no support 20080608 214545  jade constantine  she quit the channel apparently 20080608 214614  jade constantine  she isnt blocked from rejoining 20080608 214650  ankhesentapemkah  shes locked out of the channel though 20080608 214727  dierdra vaal  she isnt on the blocked list
it has been previously stated the kick was likely a sideeffect of eves unwieldy chat system to remove someone from the muted list also removes them from the conversation or something regardless the issue here is jade muting a csm member after being called out for childishly putting spin on the outcome of a vote that did not go his way whether or not said objector was later kicked is irrelevant to the meat of the issuee kis can you not see the flaw in using jades oh she must have left herself i certainly didnt do anything as evidence of inanna not being kicked given his personal stake in reputation over this issue she herself has said she was kicked in another thread likely the events lie between both claims in that eves mute function kicked her as part of removing her mute
i do not think you understand how private channels work in eve there is no blocked list there is an approved list if you are not on the approved list you do not get in you are on the approved list from the point you are invited to the time someone removes youwhen i make a private channel i do not have to block the entirety of eve from joining they are by default until i invite them its an inviteonly channelif she was removed from that list the channel would neither show it as far as i can tell nor would she be able to get back innow i just went and did some testing and when you unmute someone it kicks them from the channel and removes them from the list and sends a message to the system that the person has been mutednote that this shows up twice after the initial muting by jade which was 30 minutes for some ungodly reason that anyone would think they would take 30 minutes to get to the vote but if it showed up twice then jade would have had to unmute inanna twice and doing such would have meant that she knew what would happen when she would unmute someone i can understand the mistake the first time but not the second
then after all this testing to see exactly what would actually happen you still think jade intentionally muted and kicked inanna on purpose from the start or are you now changing it to jade figured out how the system worked and engineered a method to kick maliciously after some trial and errorthis is a lot of hoop jumpingabsurdum reductum jade mutes inanna with the desire to unmute soon after the system kicks her at the unmute without anyone realizing it and people eventually figure it out
i cant believe you are still arguing about this seriously get a sense of perspective already i muted a member of the csm yep i did it i was the moderator  chair   for a live discussion in a chat channel that lasted 4 hours and near the end of that time i ended up taking a decision that was backed by my  vice chair   to temp mute a csm rep for as long as it took me to state the terms we were voting on hint  while the chair is stating terms for a vote people are not supposed to be talking in channel anyway   if you look at the log youll see that first mute notification when i clicked mute youll see me state the terms of the vote and say now vote and youll see a second mute notification  that was actually through ccps twisted logic   me clicking unmute being recorded as a kick from channel what followed was people voting and then us wondering where the muted csm rep had gone  thinking of course that it was quick duration muteunmute   not a bloody channel kick froth and emoism followed so ultimately heres the story1 csm chair  with responsibility to moderate a meeting   2 moderates the meeting 3 moderation involves a temp mute that goes horribly wrong due to ccp bugs 4 muted rep is unmuted and given the option to vote 10000 alts and forum trolls cry about it on the forumgood heavens talk about a pathetic overreaction to a routine matter of moderating a chat channel ive been in meetings of caffeinecrazed stockbrokers being told they arent getting their full christmas bonus that involved less crying and gnashing of teeth than this topic
reduction to absurdity is a rhetorical technique not an argument you are thinking of occoms razor however the razor says that the explanation must account for all evidence it does not since there are three total mute messages your explanation only works if there are only two mute messages contained in the logs
it was more a label for my thoughts i was writing then a counterpoint reply though now that i think about it i should have just left it off and stated occams razortell me goumindong how exactly does one reproduce those 3 messages wouldnt it be odd to mute then unmute twice it sounds far more like a technical error or ignorant fumbling with the system then someone maliciously hovering over the kick button on purposeagain your scenario would have jade realizing how the system works first through trial and error during the meeting then maliciously abusing the mechanics to kick inanna on purposeif jade knew what was actually happening you think he would complicate matters by having to explain and fabricate ignorance for what purpose
when you mute some you get a mute message the channel gets a mute message possibly with a purposewhen you unmute someone that has been muted you kick them from the channel the channel gets a mute message with no purposeat the time of the second mute message inanna had been kicked from the channel at the time of the third she had been kicked for a second time this is consistent with her telling of the tale not knowing accounts for the first kick ie the second mute   but not the second kick ie the third mute  
considering he was the one that initially wanted it to only be bane running i seriously doubt that
its quite clear the csm needs a set of standing orders or it wont function properly it doesnt matter what mix of people you get on it there will always be arguments about process unless it is set out clearlyoverall i feel that almost everyone involved is failing to respect the roles of officers representatives and alternates on the csm where jade can justly be criticised is in being too forebearing and allowing chaos to reign i do agree that jade should not have restated the issue of alternates motion but i am quite sure it was not intended in any malign way the fact is that the agenda item was vague and jade was trying to clarify it it was mistaken because it should have been left to the mover of the motion to do thisas to the things decided by the csm regarding alternates i think they are nothing short of disgraceful and should not have been on the agenda at all as they seek to significantly alter the role of alternates as set out in the summary document as it is the decision made is deeply unjust to those who were elected as alternates on the basis of the original documentationso the order in which the candidates are elected is immaterial in terms of privileges and it is made clear this extends to alternates when they are acting as representatives in a meeting many of the representatives appear to feel that as the primary representatives they have a special status over and above that of an alternate who is taking part in a meeting they do not once summoned to a meeting by the chair  which is explicitly a power of the chair   the alternate is an equal on the committee once summoned it is repugnant given what is written on the role that they should be dislodged from the meeting by anyoneincidentally yes the entire paragraph is conflicted with the current process of selecting the chair the current process is in my opinion bad practice a committee of equals should elect its own chair once selected the chair does have certain powers as set out out in the roles of officers and members in the document  the main power within a meeting being that of moderation  next the critical issue of alternates and termslike much in the csm documentation this is somewhat ambiguous the harshest interpretation is that an alternate who attends even one csm meeting immediately expends one of their possible terms as either an alternate or representative that is to say it is possible to become ineligible to stand for election as a representative by attending one meeting as an alternate in one electoral session of the csm and one meeting as an alternate in another electoral session of the csm another possibility is that it means someone can only act as an alternate twice as well as as a representative twice in either case it indicates the seriousness of the act of attending a meeting as an alternatei feel the whole concept of alternates has been misconstrued as if they are disposable standins they are not they have a role responsibilities and rights as defined in the documentthis decision should not standcosmo
i read the chat log jade is in the right on this innana acted unprofessionally throughout the meeting and on several occassions tried to turn votes about game issues into discussions about jades conduct darius johnson seems to have picked up that standard and run with it since the meeting endedif this continues id be in favor of removing both darius and innana in favor of csms who can remain focused on game issues
are you seriousmembers arriving to the discussion enter the discussion and voting at the beginning of the next agenda item is neither vague nor did jade clarify it she flat out changed the meaning of the suggestion not once but twiceas soon as the representative comes back the alternative is no longer serving as an alternative and as such your argument is irrelevant
jesus the star fraction drones and alts now even have goons agreeing with goum
quoting this for posterity id be interested to know whether jade still stands by his words
in light of the quoted document i have to agree vigorously it seems several csm reps were not aware of this part of the csm document and treating alternates as standins to be inserted and removed at the leisure of the representatives is all wrongwithout that section of the csm document i was inclined to agree with the way the council voted but reading it now it seems they were misinformed
i am sorry where does the above quote say when alternatives are relieved we have the mandate for representatives to attend in the absence of a rep but not when the rep is not absentas voted by the council when a representative returns or arrives the alternate is no longer serving as an alternate at the moment the agenda item ends and as such the afore mentioned passage no longer applies to them at the point the agenda item ends
well if an alternate serving in place of a rep has equal power to a rep then the rep doesnt have authority over that alternate to displace themto displace an alternate the returning representative is exercising authority over them but according to the csm document the returning representative has no authority over the alternate because they are equalsto put it another way on what authority does a returning representative displace an alternate
okay ive asked lavista and the other candidates with multiple item issues via our internal mailing list to come and respond to you specifically here arithron i hope youll either come to a rational compromise on the issue or ill advise that they need to be split out okay give tomorrow for some discussion and ill make a call in the eveningokay so you clearly forgot that it was patch deployment day i still see no posts from lavista and other representatives with multiple issues so now you are advising them to split them into seperate topics right a pity this wasnt just done last week when i highlighted the problem since now these issues will miss this iceland meeting but better that than an undermining of a process that is crucial to the csm and playerstake carebruce hansen
when a representative returns the alternate is no longer required to represent the representative hence he ceases to have the rights of a representative and becomes an alternate  nonacting as a representative   again and is therefore no longer considered equal in terms of rightsto have it any other way facilitates a powergrab by the chair as he can wantonly declare representatives that dont abide by his every instruction  such as being at work until just before the meeting   awol and pack the council with people who are loyal to him thus having to avoid performing a much uglier power grab by means of refusing to allow issues to be brought to the csm discussion
the representative is not exercising authority the council is exercising authority just as a representative does not have authority to bring issues to ccp the council has the authority to bring issues to ccp etc etc etc
highlighted the important word therethe debate was not about the roles and responsibilities of alternates  it was about when they could exert those responsibilitiesi had no problem with tusko acting as a csm rep in my absence and casting votes whilst i was away i did have an issue with elected  as opposed to the nonelected   representatives being disenfranchised by the chair on the basis of arbitrary rulingsi would also like to point out that jade specifically told me to bring the item forward for discussion at the next meeting when i complained about being gagged by him at the previous meetingthe fact is that we as csm candidates have been elected the alternates were not yes the alternates can step in and have equal rights to the elected candidates when the elected candidates are absent for whatever reason but not at the expense of excluding those who were rightfully elected when they are available to fulfil their dutiesi would also like to point out  because it has been conveniently forgotten  that in addition to the clarification on when alternates should stand down in favour of the elected representatives i also put forward a proposal increasing the rights of alternates by clarifying that they could step up when an elected csm member dropped out of the meetingin my opinion both these proposals were straightforward and sensible and the majority of csm agreedthat said i do actually agree that ccp stating that an alternate is considered to have served the term even for temporary involvement is ridiculous and should be changed tusko should not be penalised for his sterling service
well hardin i agree that in general its open to interpretation but its the equal powers line that makes it a harder argument to say an alternates status can be changed by the comings and goings of a representativeid contrast the scenario that the council passed  where a rep coming late to a meeting would displace an alternate serving in their place at the end of the current agenda item  and likewise the alternate would step in when a rep needed to step away from the chamber    with a scenario in which the meeting is called to start at a set time the present eligible representatives and alternates are accounted for and so long as a quorum is present issues are discussed and voted on for the duration of the meetingyes in the second scenario if a representative could be five minutes late and not be able to participate in the meeting however its also a more cut and dry rule and it doesnt result in alternates sitting on the bench only to be called in for one vote while a rep takes a smoke break and then kicked back off the field when the rep is ready to return i think theres something to be said for the interpretation of the rule passed by the council degrading the role of alternates and that does seem to run counter to what was quoted from the csm document above
actually this i think is contradicted by the quote from the csm document and is the perspective i find disappointing  the alternates were elected and when serving in the place of an absent representative should be treated the same as any other rep that they can be displaced at a time not of their convenience demonstrates inequality
watch your language please hardin you were not gagged you were told you couldnt arrive at the latter half of a meeting and dislodge an empowered alternate that was my read of the role of alternates  by being sworn into that meeting husko was accepted as a full status representative for the duration of meetingand alternates when serving in the place of representativeshave equal power on the csmi took a rule that you couldnt reasonable arrive late and dislodge an alternate sworn in as a representative for that meeting i think this is poor argumentation we all received votes from the electorate and its entirely possible that one or more of the alternates will have to serve on the csm in this session you are making artificial distinction between the top nine and five alternates that i do not see in the csm documentation of course thats also problematic because in order to step in theyd need to be swornin this would count as them having served on the csm for the session and by my reading of the csm rules i see no reasonable expectation they should be dislodged again should the original nine csm rep returnat the time they did but most hadnt read the appropriate documentation and since the vote outcome contradicts the role of alternates on the csm im going to declare it void pending feedback from ccp im of the opinion now that we shouldnt be messing with the founding documentation  especially not in areas that concern voting privileges and the responsibilities and duties of csm members
if they cannot then the status of the representative cannot be changed and they were never entitled to vote in the first place they have those rights when they are acting as representatives when they are not that status ends there is no interpretation where this is concerned the only question is when that status changes by your definition tusco would have full voting rights at all subsequent meetings and be entitled to go to iceland at that point you would have 10 official representatives since no one could remove the rights of a representative or acting representative if tusco were unable to make a meeting then another alternate would need to be appointed since he had equal rights as all the other representatives and his absence would qualify for an alternate said alternate would push the total number of reps up to 11 these are clearly not intended nor can be read into the document if it cannot and the reading that supports your claim must necessarily support that claim as well then yours must be wrong
you are not entitled to rule on the csm document and make rules based on said readingno he does not the distinction is made by the language when serving in the place of a representative you are deliberately attempting to change the language in order to secure partisan advantagethe csm document states no such swearing in you are again making things up of whole clothyou do not have the power to declare a vote of the csm valid you are equal to all the other representatives and have no special power over them as we can clearly see in the language
nope that doesnt follow from what i said you must have misunderstood
indeed it does you see it says he has equal standing when he is serving in the place as a representative and it says he serves as soon as anyone is absent such equal standing and rights if it means that when the real representative cannot displace them when they return then either the real representative can never replace them or both must go if both must go then as soon as the replacement goes absent for any reason another alternate must be appointed because that alt has the same rights as the other representatives which includes having an alternate vote in their stead if they are outboth of these are ridiculous such the differentiation of when cannot be confused with the equality defining the when is thus an important part of what the csm or ccp must do and since ccp cannot act speedily the csm must set out a way that they can operate this is typically by way of a voteoh look we had a vote
where in the hell do you get off thinking you can void something that passed a vote i dont know what in the hell you think of yourself in this council but you do not have any power to veto or unilateral power to do anything but facilitate a meetingit also quite clearly says that an elected representative can move aside an alternate when they come back or did you fail at reading part of this documentthis entire thing is out of hand and you have no idea what it is your are doing and there needs to be a moderator that has nothing to do with the council as per real group think strategies
im declaring it void because i dont think we have the power to change the constitution outside of a formallyraised issue that is presented to the csmccp conference just like i dont think we have the power to change the constitution on an electable chair just like we dont have the power to pass noconfidence votes or boot off elected members for being disruptive link please
cleaned please stay on topic and attempt to discuss the issues at hand without resorting to personal insults
supported
everytime i fly my arazu in gangs everyone tells me to stop flying arazus theyll complain endlessly about how useless i am and how flying anything else would be betterplease make the hurt stop
agreeing  gallente really need this to be fixed
supporting this
yea theres very little reason to fly the gallente rsd ships these daysedit forget the thumbsup
why is the coolest looking ship so terrible  
the bobpet in me doesnt want to admit it but the goon is right
matar caps  and bs   are certainly the worst in game and need help
it makes more sense to stop at bs0the hel has the same basic problem as the nidhoggur its ship bonus is pretty weak it needs a stronger bonus or some sort of capacitor bonus
i may be gallente but an old alt of mine was minmatar after seeing the as of the howitzers i wanted to get a better as by training capitals then i read the info about mini bscaps and stopped with the ruppie cmon devs give the minis some lovin
sort itnuff said
true but they are sexy
yep
i support it im a new playerish and at the moment im happy flying a interceptor and not messing with the bigger ships because of the inherent flaws i would love to fly a big ship at some point but so far the only  relatively   large ship i would want would be the factional macherial and never mind the capital shipsi understand the story behind the minmatar peoples though we are a bunch of mildly savage peoples subjugated for generations and our grasp of ultra sophisticated technologies is spotty at best yes we have some geniuses amongst our ranks and we thank them for the ships that we do have that mostly fly but i dont think its unreasonable that our captial ships are behind the times however i think that there should be steps that can be taken to make our capital ships worth flying and spending the ludicrous amounts of time to train for said needed skills there has to be a trade off somewhere generally we  the minmatar people   like to go stupid fast and hit like a freight train most of our ships look like a control stick glued to a frame which has a bunch of engines duct taped and bailing wired into position and then guns everywhere they can be slapped on with gorilla glueso if our powergrids are going to substandard along with everything elsewhat do we get in returnagree
supportin da op minnie caps are in dire need of some serious love the nag especially the minmatar jackofalltrades design philosophy really breaks down when applied to a highly specialized ship like a dreadnought right now the biggest benefit of the nag is that us minmatar wannabe dreadnought drivers get to fly apocsmegasrokhs as we crosstrain another races ships so we can fly a dreadnought thats actually worth training for

having anchored parts of several towers on behalf of my corporation dear god please make it less tedious
ive had to go through this a dozen times its an inordinate pita taking a fully fitted pos down is just as bad
something needs to be done about this i agree the time sink is needed here is what i would like to see1 in addition to anchoring an onlining there should be an option to anchor and online the time taken for this would be a combination of the two2 a queue can be implemented by allowing concurrent anchoring with the first item taking the documented time to anchor  online and then the second item is listed as anchoring but instead of taking the documented amount of time it takes the time consumed by the first item and the second item so basically if i choose to anchor a corporate hangar array it takes 10 minutes as soon as i click to anchor i chose to anchor a silo if the time to anchor a silo alone is 5 minutes  just for the sake of argument gents   then the timer on the silo should be listed at 15 minutes  10 for the corporate hangar and 5 for the silo itself   this way we can anchor a pos and then go do something else for the rest of the night you can even add a queuing time penalty  2 minutes for every additional item  as for refueling allow one pos to be designated boss in the system and placing fuel in that pos disseminates it to all the other poss in system
to be perfectly honest fueling is no longer the big issue it used to be now that we can fuel towers for a month at a time that said the other suggestions you raised are pretty cool

been playing the game since beta and only in the last few months have i encountered pos management and all its delights whilst i appreciate that things shouldnt be easy in terms of space holding etc pos management is a monster and for the first time since playing eve ive genuinely found something that makes me think is it really worth it its like a job i dont play this game as an alternative to my rl job fix it and fix it soon

what makes you think that this change would make lowsec00 any more dangerous than it already is in fact it would give players more time to notice that a hostile gang is incoming or camping a gate to be quite honest this change would be a boost to small gangsolo pvp and increase the chance of remaining undetected in lowsec00 its no secret that the majority of players who hang out in lowsec00 are pvpers and thats why they live in these areas of course the risk vs reward of lowsec00 is quite horrible if you want to line your space wallet with isk but that is a side issue to this debate

i am in agreement this topic does get a great deal of coverage however
agreed local is a pretty powerful intel tool and yet another problem that is making pvp that much harder to findi like the idea of everyone showing in const chat though
yes yes all pirats want this no no no no no bad idea lowsec is bad enuff the uber bad kill way tooo often now stop whining
signedfor those people who are worried about new players learning the intricacies of eve you could leave local as it already is in empire and just remove the auto update function of local chat in low sec00just make it that once you have spoken in local until you leave you remain visible to those in local when you spoke
why dont you farm some isk about iti think this could make things a little more confusing for new players but at the same time this makes sense as empire has more traffic and should be more transparent i agreethis is not about making it easier to gank carebears or people trying to ratmission run etc i do all these things as well you know the main aim of this proposed change is to open the boarders of space and make pvp more unpredictable and dynamic
agreed but along with this i would ask the csm to recommend introducing a new more robust scanner system to give that submarine sonar feel to figuring out who else is out there
ok getting rid of local or changing it has been a recuring thing for ages now it was tryed accidently once due to a patch bug and it was pants co ops alts were everywheretheres no real easy way out of it and tbh the update when somone speeaks argument will only worlk till somone comes up with a lil mod to get around it much like the standings  or  in local local use to not show who was in local till they spoke but that changed with a patck cos ppl wanted it iirc
local is fine as it isanyway nerfed local  less people in lowsec00 and you dont want that do you
eve is not just a pvp game and removing local for all of eve would be a totaly stupid and irresponsible movei would vote for removing local from all 00 spacehence no vote from me
definitely in favor of the principle of altering local chat we need to get a range of opinions and options on how to do it but im in favor of bringing up the issue for serious consideration
i think its quite funny that the people arguing against my idea a   cant spellb   havent formed any constructive argument at all  no its a bad idea adds nothing to the discussion  d   think this relates only to pvpe   believe because this issue has been raised in the past means that it is a dead issue and wont give it a moments consideration andf   probably didnt even notice i skipped out c because they are too busy nerd ragingarguing that the only reason people are in 00lowsec is because they can see peoples names in local is an absurd and unrealistic argumentif you are opposed to this idea before you post i ask that you take this viewpoint imagine what i have detailed in the op is being implemented what checks and balances would you suggest should go hand in hand with this changewould shifting scan able asteroid belts similar to the instances that can be found using the basic ship scanner satisfy you  i believe this was the way that ccp was talking about modifying asteroid belts at some stage   or do you have another reasonable suggestionedit hey look the guy the majority of you voted for agrees with me
i support this suggestion if it goes along with making the belts objects that move and have to be scanned out this would alleviate some of the issues that it unfairly works in the favor of pvpers it gives the minersratters the ability to do their own scans as soon as constellation goes hostile this game isnt about making it safe to afk minerat in complete safety its about balancei think it will make pvp more spontaneous rather than the easy scouting job it is now there are x hostiles in local knowing exactly their numbers without even having to be in sight of the enemy or run scans that would have to be constantly updated at least make the scouts work at scanning the hostiles numbersmovementalso right now if you have larger numbers the other side is either stupid without scouts of any sort or wants the fight where without local youd be able to force fights by not knowing full well what you are facing without good scouting
yea make it so local dosnt show what corp etc the perosn is in though still shows how many people are there untill you speak then it will show the corp stuff and name this with the constalation chat idea would be a good idea
the local scanner as that is what it really is should be removed or at least only show those who chat in it while you are in the system
i agree 100 with this idea this idea has been thrown around for years by many of the player base and maybe it is about time ccp take a constructive look at it this would not only make pvp more dynamic it would also give smaller corporations and groups a chance to break into 00 for pvp andor industrial operationsit would suck at first getting used to it but to be honest this would change the shape of eve as we know it if implemented
the entire idea would be scrapped because its ed the only way to remove the function of the local channel and have a semblance of balance would be to duplicate its functionality right into the scanner a system wide count of friendlies hostiles and neutrals this would be even easier for you to read and would actually increase the ability of the defenders to keep themselves aliveyes the only way to balance local removal would be to duplicate its functionality to a point where it would actually be easier to identify enemies in your systemmore information see post 40 and 41
i support the idea of a change to local however i dont believe in removing the ability to gain an understanding about who is in the system with youthink of it like this you are on the battlefield you know how many you have in your ranks however you can always survey the enemy and find what they arescan probes would be our way of doing this however that mechanic is quite slow and it dosnt give you an idea of who is blueredperhaps adding in another type of scan probe or system of scanning that can be used to get ideas of these numbers now for fluiditys sake this information could be rounded down or rounded up to say the closest 5 or the closest 10 for anything that isnt blue say there was 33 in local 14 blue 17 red 2 neutral it would report blue14 red 20 neutral0obviously this is an early idea but it gives a overview of the field it dosnt have to be an accurate guide just something that gives some idea and allows for quick and semiaccurate ideas of whats out there much like a recon mission would in real world battlefieldsit could be used say every 30 seconds or so
i direct thee to this little thread of mine
im against removing the local names how about pirates be more cunning than beg for more loopholes
that would take pvp to the next lvli approve it
the tempest is the weakest fleet sniper and the alpha factor of artillery is now little more than an underpowered gimmicki agree with da op but perhaps the topic could be better presented with graphs comparing the dps of each of the main fleet sniper bs dealt to a bs target against range and mathematical comparison between weapon typesultimately the issue may be resolved by adjustments to the tempest which much like the eagle was hit hard by the script changes and went from a decent sniper to the worst racial choice
arties do suck
one significant problem with artillery is how the racial characteristics work poorly with each other specifically how the alpha strike philosophy does not work well with the minmatar characteristic of fighting in falloff because artillery has high alpha and a correspondingly low rof each shot fired is individually more important than those of other long range weapon systems 1400s on a sniper bs have a roughly 12 second rof whereas 425 rails have a roughly 5 second rof and tachyons a 7 second rof because beam lasers and rails typically work within optimal as compared to artillery more shots hit with better quality of hits combined with the characteristically low dps of artillery missed shots from fighting in falloff significantly reduce the effectiveness of minmatar snipers compared with other racestldr high alpha low rof and fighting in falloff is a very bad combination

i agree mining needs some improvementsone place to start i think would be to look at mining in a gangfleet and expand on that look at roles and benefits of mining together and provide a boost herewhile something along these lines exists for lowsec00 it doesnt yet exist for highsec the completion of the orca project would be a good startgiving us more incentive to mine together for greater yieldprofit would go some way to remove the boredom of mining and also benefit our industrial corps
hello everyone before proceeding what i ask you to do is to actually read what i am saying this thread is designed not to discuss t2 bposownersfairnessgame balance or any other issues related on how we feel the t2 bpos are affecting the game what this proposal designed to do is simple we need a developer blog or a response to the community at large both bpo holders like myself and those who wish them to remain and the detractors who wish for them to be removed or otherwise modified again this is not a discussion of t2 bpos it is a call for the community to actually show the developers that we need an answer on how they are going to proceed  it has been a long time since we heard anything and i think in order to restore some calm or to cause some panic however it is viewed we need a blog and a response from the developer team both parties will benefit from this call for answers so to speak so show your support does not matter if you are foragainstundecided about the bpos  but i am sure you want to know one way or another what is up

recently i have been on vacation from alliance warefare and seeking solo pvp for my holiday hotspt i choose curse and more specifically the systems ra and hlw now i use frigates of various kinds to roam around in and get fights but you cant kill much in a frigate solo so you need to start using bigger and more powerful ships the problem is though that you will almost certainly get ganked there is no way that anything above cruiser size can move around 00 safely  eventualyl you will get ganked and sooner rather than later in most casesso what did i do i brought and fitted a heavy tanked bs and spent some time station hugging id engage what i could kill and deaggress and dock whenever i was getting blobbed normally managing to take out some small supprto ships before the hostile heavy hitters forced me to dock solo pvp is a dieing art in eve everywhere you go there are uncountable blobs and the only way to fight with any chanche of staying alive is the nanoship but still you options are limited i am strongly against anything that will once more limt the optiosn for solo pvp in 00

black ops need some loving for all the requirements needed for it to be used1 alt account with 2 months minimum just for the prerequisites of a recon ship and the covert cyno or someone willing to train and spend a high slot thats only useful if you log in with at least 80m spent on that ship probably more2 main account with over 5 months of specific training many on capital jump skills that most of us will never use again with something like 11 level 5 skills and thats for what it takes to get in the ship let alone use it effectively from when you make the decision to get in it assuming you are a high sp player already you are looking at around 8 months and something like 300m on skillbooks to get in it then after all that you have to pay 500m which is more then what a carrier costs to replace if it is insured
youve had something like 6 months to rebalance it already and its painfully obvious that to justify the price tag its going to need some major rebalancing and if you want to take the time to get that perfect i can grudgingly accept that but at least give us a fuelbay and let covert cynos work in cyno jammed systems in the meantime
the bops battleships need across the board buffs currently they are a novelty a potential logistics tool for recons and that is about it using them in actual battles is just a risky way to lose an expensive shipon the same note t2 ships in general particularly command ships often do not offer enough of an advantage over their extremely insurable extremely lowsp counterparts to offer a worthwhile advantage bops bs and commands are without a doubt the biggest victims of this problem with assault frigs also suffering
this is all very wise
devs you realize the sin is the biggest joke in the game right a 2b isk ship that is worse then a 50m fully insurable   t1 battleship come on why even put ships in the game if theyre this terrible
i would like to see the balancing and a little more loving with this ship i purposely avoided training for it when it first came out because i felt it was going to turn out to be another useful and well conceived ship like the smart bomber turned out a little better but meh

this isnt about whether or not ccp can ban people they want removed from the game they have a catchall clause in their tos which allows them to do just that and this vote does not challenge it what it does challenge is their use of the clause in this particular instance banning  because he was getting uppity and causing massive controversyhe did some dumb stuff after his banning like exposing the player character of an innocent dev  though i dont think devs should have player characters in prominent 00 allainces personally so im not too bothered   but i think emotions over these old issues have died down and it would go a long way to reconcile and restore trust between the ccp dev team and the 00 playerbase affected by the scandal

i was not in snigg when all this kicked off so i come from a a fairly unbiased position on this matter i say fairly unbiased but i do know kugu and taught him when he first started playing eve   in any game if you are caught cheating you get banned you do it in other games as a matter of course you dont also ban the person who told you to check this person outi fully endorse his being able to reenter the world of eve so please unban him as soon as physically possible he is the reason the council was created he was also the reason why anyone caught being a naughty dev etc now comes under the internal affairs lack of better term   sectionso please if you are reading this big boos of ccp in fact any of you who have the power to do so please let him back in game and show a bit of class
i really think letting  play again would draw a line under the whole dev misconduct incident and publicly show ccp has made peace with the issue

if ccp can make enough peace to allow jade to come back to these forums even to the pinnacle that jade has reached these days kugu needs to be unbanned there is no way ccp can defend the action as it was clearly a decision influenced by spite one should never spank children when angry the results are always embarrassing own up let him free
set it right
i have no faith in the csm or ccp to actually do this but whatever

im not going to support the specific case because neither i  and im guessing none of you   have specific information on precisely what went on between this player and ccp i would support a general motion that players should be able to appeal their own bans if new information or new circumstances come to light  or specific penalty time has passed   and internal affairs should have a responsibility to ensure those proceedings are fair and unbiased  if neccessary using a panel of arbiters unconnected with the initial banning to reassess the status of the casethe principle here is that we are playing a game and yes sometimes people do bad things and deserve some kind of bans but this is also a long term hobby and over the course of many years people grow and mature and their life circumstances change and i think its very rare that people fully warrant a permanent banning in actuality banning proceedings should give the benefit of doubt where possible and only in the instance where there is clear and malign intent to harm the game and ruin the gameplay environment for others should a permanent lifetime banning be enforced so short version yes there should be some kind of appeal process where an independent panel of arbiters look at the case and are obligated to give the applicant a substantive reason why they are still banned  or revisit the judgement   this shouldnt however be public and it must remain between the player and the independent panel  and in the case of permanent bans id say there should be a minimum cooling off period of 3 months or so before this process should become valid in the first place  to the op though you should be aware that tying a measure like this to a specific banned player is a recipe for the motion to go nowhere you really do need to address general principles rather than those entirely specific to a particular person
thank you for your well thought out response jade if it is required to create a more general issue thread about the establishment of an independent review board i am more then willing to do so the reason i made the op so specific to one user is because his case is the most well known and most controversial this has allowed me to drum up support from his friends and those who feel he was treated unfairly and allowed this thread to get noticed by different members of the csm please try you hardest to make sure that the issues the csm debates goes beyond just balance issues and looks at matters such as these because they are just as important to the future of eve as finding a role for assault frigs or anything else currently on the table
i sit corrected
yep if you can work up the issue as a general principle id be happy to support it and do the advocacy work on this one though its now too late to get this formallyraised at the iceland agenda  7 day public debate rule and the fact we have have to submit the documentation tomorrow   it can be heard by the second formal session in august we are hoping to have informal talks with ia at iceland however and i can touch upon the issue there in advance to see the general feeling  though they wont be obligated to give a substantive yesnoexplain reply publicly until we do it properly by formal issue anyways please work up the general proposal and lets see where it goes i do feel strongly on the issue of bans for obvious reasons i think we should be giving the benefit of doubt more and recognizing that you have to something pretty damn terrible to earn a lifetime ban from an internet spaceship game more nuanced punishments would definitely be a step forward  as in real life the death penalty should be a sanction that people think pretty hard about
this is very interesting can you please share this specific information personally i think you are full of  yet again because why would ccp share personal information of one customer with another if this is the case then ccp have been breaking their terms of service and this is very worrying if they are willing to share information about 1 player with another where do they draw the line
he wrote this rather badly tbh but he is saying that he nor anybody else has the info maybe you should take a few deep breaths and chill a bit from your witch hunt and while he is learning to write a bit clearer you can learn to read a bit better
 edited for clarity   if you could stop flaming long enough to read the sense of what i wrote we might have some decent discussion here if on the other hand you want to treat this like caod mk2 then id respectfully ask you to go back there and stop messing up this forum for other users
no he quite clearly said he had special information that none of us did
you edited your post after i made mine and then accuse me of reading it wrong you really are childish
it is quite clear that while yes his op did seem to read like you posted that that was not his intention and was just a simple typo which when pointed out was quickly corrected if you could keep your childish flaming and pathetic posts out of my thread that would be great
your posting is horrible proofread and keep it simple
torshin had he just said it was a typo in the first place rather than try to make me out as some flamer and not to mention going back to change his post to make it seem that way then we wouldnt be here but admitting mistakes and making up for them doesnt seem to be something jade can do i apologise if my first post was a bit inflammatory but that is because i found the way his post seemed to implie that ccp shared information with him very worrying
while i do not agree with some of your posts torshin your honesty has just scored you a lot of points the other drama bombers however need to  off back to caod
only after it was edited when someone makes a mistake which causes someone to ask a question usually the person who made the mistake says sorry i made a mistake and left out neither i dont have any information they do not say you suck at reading stop trollingthe fault lays on the one who made the error and narciss made no error in reading what jade wrote its not a big deal so long as the person who made the what seems to be completely honest mistake doesnt go ape when someone asks a legitimate question regarding what was actually postedsome guy in gf found a section on the forums where i typed president instead of precedent did i change it to precedent and then call him a dirty liar no i said whoops then fixed my mistake then we went on our merry ways everyone was happy
while this may be true i think this current discussion is taking away from what has become a very good thread the amount of support for this issue is right up there with the top issues in the assembly hall and i feel that we should get back on the matter at hand which is taking steps to put in a review process or appeals process for bans
since the actions of kugu can arguably be blamed for the formation of the csm  maybe not directly but the idea of oversight and ia for example   id say this is one of those rare occasions where the specific case should be argued just remember that if he hadnt done what he did there may not have ever been a csm or any sort of internal oversight such as the ia  at least publically   and issues such as dev corruption would have never been checked  and you wouldnt be getting trips to iceland   
agreedalso i agree with go maz the fact that the csm is more or less a direct result of s actions warrants that the issue be looked into and outweighs any concerns regarding whether or not we have the evidence to judge with the csm bringing it to the agenda they will have to at the very least share the information with the csm as they must give reasons for any acceptance or refusal in writing   who will be able use their judgment regarding whether or not ccp acted a proper manner and whether or not the appropriate measures have been taken or need to be
i cannot and will not support a individual case as that is a bad way for things to proceed but i will and would support a motion that allows a separate or board to review cases of bans individually and perhaps over turn them if justification is found to do so
the point remains  did this game a great service by dragging so many things into the light what matters is that corruption was exposed and he forced it to be dealt with by making a compelling case his reward the banstick this was a kneejerk reaction by ccp and should be reversed whistleblowers should not be punished they should be rewarded read up the information is in plain sight for anyone who knows how to use the internet the story of s discoveries is one of the most interesting stories this game has to offer and has generated untold publicity for this game some good and some badfree  a true patriot of the community as a whole

with all due respect this is the individual case there are no other cases like this by any stretch of the imagination and i believe much of the mmo world is still watching to see what the final verdict will be not understanding this demonstrates a lack of understanding in the issues or facts surrounding the  debacle were not asking for the csm to become a court of appeals for anyone were asking for this one very special case to be reviewed and hopefully the ban reversed due to the very highprofile nature of the issue and the vast public support for 
i do not care about this or any other individual case although in matter of fact i do know about the case as i was playing at the time my point is that it cannot be treated as a individual case and the whole banningappeal structure must be looked at if that is what ppl wish or it is not a fair system as popularity or lack thereof is not a just reason to ban or unban somebody
lolz
baemp him
noone knows exactly what happened with the  bannings bot even some of his better friends in sniggerdly but surely since it is such a hotly debated topic if ccp had nothing to fear they would expose the truth to clear their namethis arguement needs redigging up and looking into and i believe the csm is the only way we have the power to do this if any csm member wants to disagree with this then i invite you to reply to this post and argue against it
the  banning was justified using some catchall terms of service agreement clause as the result of a dev decision to ban him for the trouble he was causing to ccp  at least one would assume this was the reason ccp kept very quiet during the t2 scandal   it did not happen as part of any normal established banning procedure and therefore overturning this ban would not require the creation of any broader system of appeals for other bans you say it cannot be treated as a individual case but this was exactly what happened to ban him in the first place his ban was extraordinary  in the literal sense   and his unbanning would be equally so
every ban can be portrayed as an individual case just like this one is if a appeal system is to be implemented i will vote for it 100 however i will not support the use of the csm for each individual case as doing so will be decided on popularity not on the full facts
if every unjust ban could be examined and overturned i would totally support it however most of them happen completely out of the limelight in the privacy of email notifications the kugu case was completely in the open for all to see and is probably the only ban of its kind that has any reasonable chance of generating enough support to convince ccp to even blink at itan appeal system is incredibly unlikely do a little bit of good instead of overstretching the csm authority in search of justice or whateverccp admitting a mistake even in light of them creating the csm council as a result of kugus actions and actually going through with any unbanning i feel is very unlikely however and this discussion is probably entirely academic i hear hope is a pretty powerful political message these days though so well see
the first part of your post is exactly why one players case cant be a csm issue every banned player has a sob story or an excuse as to why they shouldnt have been banned  how many of these stories are legitimate is another matter   if you ask the csm to champion the cause of this single case you are asking them to give preferential treatment to a single person based on the popularity of his issue this would move the csm out of the role of a representative body for the playerbase as a whole and into the realm of giving individual favors to friends associates etc which i think we can agree is a bad idea either that or in order to be fair representatives the csm would have to take the time to personally review the case of each and every banned player which would be a huge waste of time and entirely beyond the scope of what the csm is supposed to be doing they are not here to handle individual player complaints thats what customer service is forif the csm wants to work to get ccp to set up an impartial review process open to all former players that would be entirely different even so we would have to keep in mind that it is ccps game and they have the final say on who plays and who doesnt regardless of what we may think is fair if in the end you cant put up with their rules and decisions then the best thing to do is take your money to someone elses game
every player can come up with a sob story true but they cant come up with a sob story that involves them doing absolutly nothing in game being punished under a general eula term for causing them headache that didnt break any actual rules
please visit your user settings to reenable images
they cant why not do you know the circumstances of every single player ban that has been issued by ccp i dont think so and i dont think that the csm have that knowledge either my point is that singling out one special case sets a bad precedent and opens pandoras box either requiring the csm to perform a job which they were never intended nor equipped to perform or paving the way to corruption by favors to the popular opening an issue like this could very well be the start of the downfall of the csm as a useful and fair institution is that really what you want im sorry if a player was treated unfairly im sure hes not the only one but you have to look at the bigger picture here the fact is that this is not the way to go about solving the issue giving one player an unfair advantage over others simply because of the notoriety of his case does not correct past unfairness it only creates a new disparity

i like most of the ideas in here and well done to the posters for some well thought out suggestionsi think that ab boost needs to be increased and them to have a bit more agility with a web resistance bonusmwds should be less agile imo if people want to fly in an orbit and engage a target whilst orbitting then they have to fit a fair few istabswhilst peeps flying blaster boats can just get to range and turn it off
sounds good to me id like to see ccp explore possibilities for rebalancing here
i dont think there is any meaningful way to boost abs without nerfing mwds  which needed to happen a long time ago   but this idea gets my support
silly  opeve is more than sp learning the game is more than just being able to fly whatever class of hull and that takes time if the process of waiting for skills to finish is boring then look at what happens in the meantime just want to say that youre playing for the wrong reason if copying some meaningless number into your corp chat is the highlight of the playtimeo7
i disagree learning skills should stay as as far as i can see they activly encourage people to stay with the game as they teach how rewarding planning your career can be
you had better leave at the same time i think sir you have a little growing up to do
i dont support this idealeave them alone
you are incorrect sir after wasting so many days and weeks on learning skills i did not walk away with an appreciation of career planning i already knew the value of that im not a child and this is a game for crying out loud all i came away with was resentment that i had to flush almost 2 months down the drain in order to stay abreast of everyone elsein any case the devs themselves have stated that they would like to see learning skills done away with i dont think youll find more resounding endorsement of this thread than that
i believe i heard a ccp guy talking about this some time ago but they had no good solutions i agree that having to spend a couple of months to train how to train faster is slowing things down it takes forever before you can even start playing the game and you dont want to train anything before learning because you know youll loose sp in the long run by doing thati already have all learning skills maxxed out so if they plan to take them away i hope ill get compensated somehow for the millions of sp invested  45m or something i believe  
personally having gone through the drudgery of training all basic learning to 4 and advanced to 4  except charisma of course    i would have no problem if they were wiped from the database would i be disappointed at the wasted time maybe but i think id be more excited at seeing a hated enemy vanquishedthats what the learning skills wereare to me an obstacle to be suffered through not an engaging part of the gameplay or an element of what makes the experience fun and enjoyable honestly if i werent so stubbornobsessive i dont think theres any way i would have lasted in eve through the bulk of my learning time as it was i barely logged in for a good part of itfor all the vets who say we had to do it so they should stay do you guys actually hear yourselves do you realize how much elitist crap that is or do you just not remember what it was like dont give me this it was a good experience or it was fun crap ive been there ive done it and it stank like a manure heap in augustif we get compensated for our time spent training learning skills thatd just be icing on the cake itd be simple enough just let those with sp in learning skills spend those points on oether skills whichever skill they activate for training next gets those points applied to it instantly and so on with the next skill until they run out of extra sp and then normal training resumes but as i said id be happy enough just to see them goif youre concerned about being able to use learning skills to correct poor attribute choices made at character creation i have a couple ideas on that one is to have a limited set of trainable skills similar to the current learning skills except with the training time independent of the current level of the skill but rather scaling according to your current level in that attribute  minus implants   the idea being that if you have a lower attribute you can raise it faster and higher attributes become more difficult to raise this would allow for some quick equalization of neglected attributes while limiting the relative need or ability to boost anything beyond a maximum levelthe other idea i had is to introduce new implants possibly requiring a new implant slot possibly just making use of an existing one these implants would boost one attribute at the cost of lowering another by the same amount this would allow for a rebalance of sorts for example if you put too many points in everyones favorite attribute charisma you could use one of these implants to shift your wasted points to something a little more usefulanyway thats my 002 isk on the subject lets hope pooling our money adds up to something worthwhile
actually asking the leaning skills to be taken a way and not giving anything back to the vets is kind of a slap in the face as you call them elitist for telling you we did why shouldnt you is in the same vein as you telling them tough deal with it sucksso you are being no better than the elitist bad guys you are so bent on making sure they do not get what they have worked hard for because you are not only taking away what they invested you are taking away what they will earn in the future
this alone confirms to me that youre lying
and ur a goonie  sucking troll
bitter much why dont you go back to bwf and lose a capfleet over it
fyi this is what a troll looks likewhat i dont understand is how you can believe that just because there are a lot of people that disagree with you that our opinions somehow become less valid should we then put the people with the fewest votes on the csm when voting is involved the outcome has everything to do with collectivist activityi understand that the csm documentation is poor at best so its understandable that you and the rest of the members would either ask for clarification from ccp or hold a vote regarding the councils process its not a waste of time at all that you would want to do this in fact if i recall correctly most of the first meeting was centered around straightening out the duties of the council itself i agree that it was a waste of time but it was necessary given the circumstances until ccp produces a better document is it not one of the duties of the csm to determine what the duties of the csm is and if the majority agrees the motion is passed this is democracyhowever when you say things like ive made the mistake of allowing this council a little too much democracy you open yourself up for attack and derision this is supposed to be a democratic process and its frustrating that youre not willing to work with either your constituents or the rest of the csm in a democratic process
surely an amicable resolution could be reached by holding a vote betweeen the csm representatives as to whether implementing the standin vote involves a modification to the csm constitution or simply stands as a clarification of the constitutionif jade seems to think he can decide this key issue as chairman of the csm despite all csm representatives being equal then surely the natural way to resolve it is to give all reps an equal say in the matter by putting it to votethis has the caveat that the vote will likely go the same way as the original standin vote being contested meaning jade loses his tantrum issue
i cant find the jade bit you quoted where was that said
two threads for this issue means double the votes
this is a clear chance to prove that the majority of the playerbase that you are supposed to represent trust you via a vote of their elected representatives so you shouldnt be afraid of the vote as it will vindicate that you are the subject of a loud but very minor goon faction unless of course you admit that the majority of the playerbase finds the way you have been acting harmful and detrimental to the health of this democracy experiment and would rather have a nonpartisan chairman electedwe dont need or want a goon as a chairman we would be happy with whoever the council decides in an open vote with all members present
having an open vote for a new chairman would be the fastest least deceive and most productive thing this council could do you owe it to the playerbase to elect someone that a majority of the council can stand
agree
yeah im having a hard time of finding it myself it might have been in another thread or something ill look edit found it  you may recognize it from the thread where he called you fickle   thanks evesearch
quoting dis to give nonsupport
its nice to have ones suspicions confirmed yep vote of no confidence in jade constantine since its been very clear that hes not up to the task at hand
all hail fUFFFDhrer constantine
i support this issue
its also how committees dont work they waste tons of time and effort bickering and voting over things that have nothing to do with why they were created in the first place
remember that all those whos guys did not get voted in now have a target for all that disappointment and bitterness and i defy you to claim that most eve players  especially those who want nerfs or changes to the game   are not that petty
this has my full support
supported enthusiastically
jade is worthless  supporting this
wow your corp has one member  thanks for letting us know how you really feel alt
every kind of council or government body  the latter we dont have here actually   needs a means to remove the head of that body to maintain functionality and to prevent grasps at autocratic powersthe ability of the council to call for a vote of nonconfidence against the chair is supported
supported
this procedure is necessary supported
after ive seen the results and that jade is becoming boss of the csm i thought to myself this will make a wonderul thread and here we arei support this
supported as with the other threadthe chairman needs to be a unilaterally chosen member by the delegates from the delegates
you have to actually click the supported checkbox unless you voted earlier in the thread
im sort of torn on this because leaving jade as the chairman is bound to generate some delicious drama but on the other hand i wouldnt want to see csm completely fail supporting
those of you who are going along with jade out of a kneejerk antigoon stance should consider how youll feel if his power grab succeeds what if we then dont decide to split our vote next time and instead corner the godemperor chair for ourselves
what
had gs not decided to split its vote we would have likely taken the chair such the question is posedsince its unlikely that gs will go away in the next 56 months and since there is also likely to be another csm election how do you feel about giving the chairs these wide and ridiculous powers when the next person to have them at their disposal will likely be from goonswarm
chairman arghy has a nice ring to it
i personally am all in favour of having a member of goonswarm as the next csm chairperson with these powers as long as the csm logs remain public gouimdong as csm chair has a nice ring to it you are going to be standing again i trust
i agree with this summary and therefore give support to this issue
i can imagine darius sitting on a throne at the csm meeting completely ignoring everyone and just pushing his own agenda while laughing manically  and just muting everyone so they cant vote  
wow your corp has thousands but you guys did not get anybody on the council chair i guess that shows how much regard ppl have and how ppl really feel about you tardsps scuttle back under your rock on caod goon you do not belong here
we have twoedit removed those smilies one was quite sufficient
fixed my grammar error and re added the smiles
i will be if only to continue the running joke when i lose
really arghy would be great we have rules for his postings on our forums3 arghystop posting threads in the war room you crazy neckbearded bigot if you have some fantastic idea you really think deserves a thread ask one of your literate squad members to translate for you otherwise take it to spacegbs where you are revered as some sort of idiot messiah this goes for arghyesque arghylike and arghyonic posts no matter who posts themjust imagine four hours of arghy and people having to read through it would be unreadable
checks and balances
there is a clear definition of majority ccp in fact formally specified the voting formula simple majority simple majority is defined as a voting system where the ayes outnumber the naes and an absentee or abstain vote is counted as neitherthere is no grey area in this system its the most widely used system in meetings in the world because its so rigidly defined if you count an absentee or abstention as a nae its called absolute majority there are precisely 2  well theres also modified majority  so 3 really   systems for majoritarian decision making ccp has stated the one to useso yeah you guys hands are tied on that one its about the only thing ccp has mandated
supporting this though i wish it werent necessary  
somehow i missed this thread earlier
our candidate would just mute every other delegate and pass everything goonswarm wanted 1 vote to nothing if the others tried to remove him from power there would be literally nothing they could do because the chair can do these kinds of things without repercussion jade hasnt gone that far  yet   but it just goes to show how jades insane interpretation of the rules removes any traces of democracy from the csm
thumbs down mostlyto all the people who feel this falls under checks  balances is it really necessary the term of office is so short anyway the balance is that if you dont like what the chairman  or any csm representative for that matter   does dont vote for them next timethe only way i would support this is if the process were as followsvoting no confidence in a csm membera vote of no confidence may be initiated by any csm member against any other csm membera vote of no confidence may not be initiated by an alternate csm membera vote of no confidence may only be initiated against a particular csm member once during that individuals term in officeany csm member may only initiate a vote of no confidence once during their term in officea successful vote of no confidence requires a unanimous decision by the remaining council membersupon a successful vote of no confidencethe csm member in question will be expelled from the council immediately upon conclusion of a successful vote of no confidence against him or herif the expelled csm member holds a billet  chairman vice chairman secretary vice secretary   then the billet will be filled by one of the remaining council members to be determined by a council vote and requiring a simple majority to winthe alternate csm member who received the most votes during the election for that term will be elevated to csm member statusupon a failed vote of no confidencethe matter is considered final and no more time should be wasted on the issue
im completely uncomfortable with the direction that jade constantine might take this game due to his past involvement in a roleplaying brothel chatroom inside eve
truth
yupers
if i had a million isk every time a goon called me a liar id be rich beyond the dreams of avarice you really are getting desperate
so is that not your site is being extremely misleading not considered a lie
remember ccp doesnt admit to lag instead they claim that its a client side problem and their customer service fails to document the problem by just stating that there was no server error according to customer service its a client side problem this is the furthest from the truth of the issue there is a problem and customer services need to document these error i dont care about code internet bandwidth or whos closer to the iceland there is clearly a lag problem and since half the times i die in lag and dont get kill rights i have to assume the server is simulation combat but after 3 years its time to start document lag issues correctly the customer may never be pleased but you cant say the customer is wrong csm should use this lag issues as their first concern to improving new eden
i think most people would agree that something should be done to allow large fleet battles to continue fairly and relatively lagglessly timer bars that wait for your opponent in system are possible solutions if one side is lagging capping system population by putting wait ques on gates are another solution to lagccp should admit that this is a real problem and work on solving it answers from ccp representatives saying that lag does not exist are not acceptable
oh yeah its already fun wiping out entire alliances  but to be able to destroy everything theyve built count me in i want to be on an outpost killmail that details every item that every resident just lost  or has a chance to be dropped and looted like every other kill does i think every ship should be ejected into space boardable it would be a lovely pinata of tears
i fully support this stationrelated mechanic that was proposed by a leader of an alliance too worthless to hold a station
eve maps last update reported that no fewer than nineteen outposts changed hands in the previous eleven days huge wars rage in fountain geminate and elsewhere jades idea that 00 is stale and static is therefore revealed as nonsenselikemost people in this thread  and apparently all but 39 people from a player base of hundreds of thousands   i am against this proposalto be fair it would benefit some people it is perfectly suited to the playstyle of jade constantine 00 failure and minmatar space terrorist for instance but if you are in a small alliance perhaps made up of players not lucky enough to hold dyspro moons and t2 bpos and not blessed with a thousand fellow members then bear in mind that in the massively unlikely event that this proposal got through you can kiss goodbye to motivating people to invest in an outpost no matter how mediocre the space you want to hold youd just be a weekend outing for the goons bob or some other superallianceon the upside thanks to jade for posting this idea now that ccp have seen how unpopular it is the risk of implementation tends towards the square of zero point zero
dreadful idea the larger alliances would simply put down any attempt to access 00 for years to comevoting no
while i have to admit that idea really makes me smile i did actually get talked into the compromise solution by hardins crew of letting personal hangers remain in the wreck i think fully destructible and everything in the station is lost is within the spirit of eve pure and simple i have to acknowledge that changing that on the fly and seeing outposts taking out the possessions of people who thought theyd be eternal would be a little unfair hence the compromise solution espoused in this thread and supported to the iceland summit by vote of csm now we just need to hear what ccp think about the general principle
jade how did you feel when an actual mmo game designer who has studied a game that failed directly because of the type of system you want to implement was telling you the same things that i have been telling you for so long
id not like to see what this type of idea will ultimatly become several thousand rtards traveling around eve in a big  train popping outposts and nothing else now the idea sounds good and fun and interesting but the truth is ppl will abuse it like they do everything else
heh i usually make a habit of not getting involved with you but this one is just too funny im guessing your referring to the game designer mahrinskel of orbis games right well dont want to burst your bubble but he works for a company that makes virtual house ranching simulators now im not knocking his professional knowledge goum but neither am i yielding that this experience counters five years of playing an actual pvp game at the sharp endsorry but if you expect me to doff my cap to the man behind sand box farm its not going to happen sure these are games they are even online multiplayer games but nope they are not eve and im happy disagree with this guy to exactly the same extent i disagree with you
wow two supports on one page that has to be some kind of recordalthough they where probably just some weak antigoon troll
shadowbane
when was the last time you held space in 00
the stories about them trying to get space in 00 are even more funny you should ask about that
oh good now you have decided to get involved this will be fun a question jade since you have made this about qualifications for so long why is it that you trust the opinion of someone who has failed at every turn to hold 00 space and is irrelevant in its operation so irrelevant that you couldnt even deal as much damage as triumvirate against cva who promptly failure cascaded not long after their invasion whose expertise lies in mythical literature why do you trust that person over a person who has studied games operations and makes games where multiple players interact and a person with expertise in economics and international relations economics being the study of how people act and international relations being the study of groups of people acthow does king arthur and his court give you unique insight into the machinations of empires over the grand chessboardwell then you will have to excuse me for trusting the opinion of people who have studied how people and nations behave based on changing conditions rather than the opinion of one who studied arthurian legendindeed

youre never going to have an outpost for us to destroy so no i cant support this
over the same period i was a member of fix and originated the fortress querious doctrine ive got a crappy kill ratio because i spent all my pvp time in covert ops i was there when hans roaming opened the pearl harbor cyno in fat i was there when the lights went in in 9cg at the tail end of the coda war i was there for both battles of the egg in ed i was there for both prohibition ops the first capital blob the death of iss and the subsequent  failed   invasion of querious by d2 and all their friends i personally flew the jump bridges to break the siege of 49u  14 jumps half of them unescorted in a fenrir  im not claiming to be some pvp powerhouse but i think ive got the chops to disagree with you with some credibilitydave
im not going to give any suggestions on say restructuring hisec missions or veldspar roid respawn rates and i would ask in turn that empire dwellers keep their 00 warfare legislation to a minimum jade
no support its an absurd mechanism that would be hated by the playerbase and very seriously break 00i trust the council does the right thing and kill this proposal as it has no democratic support
no support treating alliances like rational players the best move for them to make would be to create deadzones of space between the superpowers reducing conflict and preventing new alliances from establishing themselves there are other ways to increase the dynamics of 00 i believe this proposal would serve to do the opposite
no supportmore power to large alliances to keep small alliances out of 00  bad
jade i told you on that other forum before you threw your snit that i dont chase around the internet trying to defend my professional reputation and i meant it so im not going to defend my credentials as a game designer to you however as an analyst and player of games i go back to games nearly nobody here has heard of from the dimdarks of the early 90s in eve i have been playing since september 2004 and i was a member of a 00 alliance from 1 month later i was involved in the strategic positioning of fix all through the coda prohibition and great war phases leaving that role a few months before fixs retreat from querious because i felt that the leaderships views of how to handle strategy and logistics would leave us incapable of defending our space i correctly anticipated the strategic implications of every significant change to the game throughout that entire period and made my character one of the minor plutocrats of eve by anticipating their economic effects iow i wont chase google alerts to defend my professional reputation from the likes of you in random internet locations but i will defend my reputation in eve on the forums of the gamehere is a reproduction and expansion of the arguments i made against your proposal on that other forumthis change will not have the effects you say it will and what would likely happen instead  among other things small but leet pvp outfits that arent interested in holding territory and cant match even a small alliance capital throw weight would have a way to inflict serious damage on them and with dedication could make any arbitrary chunk of 00 unsuitable for any level of exploitation higher than that of around 2004 number of superpowers would quickly be reduced with nomansland regions between them where they allowed no development at all only huntergatherer operations like 2003 iow he hides it under a wall of text and a few convincing lies but jade really is just pushing an agenda that will be better for his faction00 warfare has definitely gotten just too damned expensive and too random there may be 100s of capitals running around but their pilots do not think of them as disposable they were the product of weeks of effort and cant be replaced in a hurry if two 100 capital fleets meet and one loses 20 and the other loses 40 the winning side has 20 guys ed as hell about the time it will take them to rebuild  and the losing side has that problem twice over plus they probably just lost something strategically important   only a few alliances have supercap blobs for everyone else the loss of a supercap is a threat to their continued existance but they have to use it in coordination with allies or they wont get support when they need itagainst the background of this you have players finally realizing that scannable complexes and belts combined with jb freighter logistics has hugely increased the amount of people who can be supported by a chunk of 00 and since theres safety in numbers they gather in places of strategic utility and just own the rest strictly in terms of denying it to others the potential productivity of a single fully developed region is staggering which is why jade can  about so much money flowing around 00 they own turf that is making them rich he doesnt want the hassles of owning turf so he wants a way to take away their territorial advantage since he wont adopt itall the wealth of 00 is ultimately dependant on jbs and outposts and their defense is hinged on cyno jammers so hes metagaming the designers into letting him break the smalltomedium alliances or trying anyway i hope theyre smarter than thatincrease the costs of participation in pvp you reduce the amount of risk people will take and their participation level in pvp declines period we have seen this in every game that allowed pvp from the 80s right through today
this is passably the worst idea ever the idea of taking an enemy station and holding it is a fantastic mechaniclike it was said earlier if stations become destructible the larger coalitions would just powerhouse through and clean space of the smaller powersjade this is really really horrible

the destructible outpost is a unique look i guess but in the same breath you are advocating for new alliances to have the opportunity to get a foot hold  i hope i correctly interpreted what you were trying to say  however what you are setting up is a scorched earth policy and no little out fit would have much of any chance and the larger alliances would become much stronger and a greater threatunless you are trying to marry this with the other proposals from your alliance about capturing gates as part of the packagehowever now thinking about it it is kind of clever all you would have to do is just wait until the big boys all but kill them selves off and move right in and take space after the mayhem i guess one could write himherself a decent storey about rebuilding eden as a role playing base
hello alli have had an idea for this game based off what i have heard from numerous sources and so can only imagine it to be true that ccp does not delete any expired account characters the amount of space that these old characters take up must be staggering and will only increase with timeheres my idea which should be both a standing policy and apply retroactively all characters in the game whose account has been inactive for six or more months and with 2 million or less sp should be deleted to clear up storage space and free a lot of names for the playerbase1   if an account has been inactive for six or more months the player might possibly not be coming back especially if it ties in with item two six months allows somebody who has played the trial but might not have enough money or interest to return immediately to still have their work saved for a significant ammount of time2   a character who has been played for more time than the trial period will likely have more than 2 million sp as that is an easy amount to acquire if not the name is most likely a placeholder or something of that naturecomments questions am i out of my mind well maybe the answer to the last question is yes but what do you guys think of this idea
just giving my support to this topic since i cant do that in my original idea thread
1   actually it does not take that much space and space is not an issue for ccp one terabyte hd will hold enough space to keep all the character information needed for the next 10 years 2   it does not affect eve performance in any rather any unused characters and corporations are not affecting eve detrimentally in any way when it comes to performance 3   deletingremoving any character from the game since it has never been done by ccp especially after such a short period of time like 6 months is not reasonable allot of people go on deployments which are longer than 6 months allot of people might have rl issues which would prevent them from playing eve for longer than 6 months etc sorry not supported what i would support  is deletion of corporate tickers from all corporations that are no longer active and are closed or maybe even deleting those altogether
i was going more along the lines of whiny 39 year old man child

youre telling a csm representative to resign because they were unfairly muted and went on to talk about it i think youve forgotten to put your star fraction ticker on there buddyinannas reaction to the whole thing has been fairly tame enough to oppose jades bullying around votes but calm enough not to fan the fires of controversy

jade as chair has repeatedly sidetracked the csm onto time wasting issues with the powergrabbing etc and we need someone as chair that is not so decisive the new person obviously does not have to be member of goonfleet and i think we all would be happy with someone who would stop trying to give power to herself and then crying foul when people disagree
inanna accused jade of willful wrongdoing in the meeting before she was muted so obviously that didnt have to do with the muting she did it multiple times also then she accused jade of willful wrongdoing for muting her and continues to accuse jade of willful wrongdoing both for muting her as well as for pretty much everything else jade did in the meetinginanna has been consistently focused in her accusations against jade both before the muting as well as after it needs to stop or inanna should step down she is not acting in the interest of the player base she didnt add anything to csm meeting 3 except her criticisms of jade and she isnt doing anything now to resolve the issues the council is havingshe can certainly do all of that from the eoboards just like all the members of goonfleet theres no reason to waste a council seat for that give it to someone who can focus on game issues
how can we have someone as chairperson who is obviously so decisive she has admitted time and time again that she bears hostilities towards the corporation that 2 of the 7 members of the council are from how can that possibly be regarded as a good alternative by anyone by all means lets remove her from power and set up someone who doesnt antagonize and instigate petty little powerfeuds getting in the way of the real agenda
im having that one for lolsnice quote
jade constantine  not my chairman
jade isnt letting the council decide their own agenda any more this empire hugging gallente roll playing dog is power tripping his mind outchairpersons facilitate discussion not rule them but given that council would almost assuredly vote to restrict his power i cant blame this mad dog for banning them from discussing restricting his power

the csms are representative of the players nobody voted for someone to get silenced during the council after it was discovered that she had been muted and then kicked  due to the bug weve all been made aware of   she had every right to criticize jade as did the other council members the only csm who has expressed any interest in silencing other members is jade constantine hes stated that he may have been too democratic in fact its been jade constantine who has been more contrary towards the other csms than the other way around yet he still believes that the rest of the council needs unilateral moderation this is not how a council is supposed to work and this is why there are now threads about a vote of no confidence

ummm no jade is doing her job fine
instead of addressing ingame issues jade constantine has been more concerned with cementing his own power within a constitution that regular eve players really dont care about eve players really dont care about who is the leader of this nowirrelevant csm but jades powergrabbing is stalling the issues for even being addressed much less a suggestion to ccp on how to fix themor even suggest to ccp that they should document all of their hidden features one of the most basic things any game manual would showthe csm is not the jade constantine show as it stands the csm is a joke behind her leadership
no
i dont judge peoples worthiness for a job by how well they perform when its easy thus far i havent seen too many hard decisions youve faced as chair yes theres been three meetings that probably made you want to pull your hair out but those are merely frustrating not difficult and theyve been faced by all nine or 14   members im not denying the successes of the csm as a whole  as you say theyre plentiful  but i will deny that those successes mean that you are fit for the job you currently possess its not difficult to identify the most popular threads and put them on the agenda and its not difficult to call votes on them your successes in those are laudable but not especially meaningful your failure on the other hand is meaningful because it was in a situation where you ought to have done better and where you could easily have done better there was no good reason for your action and a host of bad consequences have arisen from it  the council is fractured your reputation is somewhat lowered and the reputation of the council has been lowered greatly new creations are fragile and easily swayed and just as i feel you collectively lost many good opportunities to set down methods and rules in common law i feel that your one single action born in frustration or whatever may well have made the csm a sandbox for power trippers in the minds of many players even if its not true thats how it will be seen and perception always trumps reality in politics since so few people are obsessive enough to have the information to separate the two your action was wrong on its own merits and it damaged the council as well condemning a serious mistake is hardly fickle
so far as i recall what was being referred to in each of those quotes theyre all true and none of them is a wild accusation accusations yes and rather unfriendly ones but all valid and wellfounded
would you care to elaborate on what you believe jades job is here are some quotes the proponents of this thread would like you to consider
id like to see any representative body of the player base be a body of equals the chair regardless of who it is should not have mute or veto power the idea that six duly elected representatives of the player base can be silenced or overridden on the whim of the chair rubs me the wrong way especially when the combined player representation of those six individuals is much much more than that of the chairjade has taken what was to be a representative discussion between the player base and ccp and made a mess of it

that is absolutely correct turns out people are starting to disagree with him herschel yamamoto for example says he voted for jade but now feels jade makes for an inadequate chairman some people think that waiting for the next election period is only going to make things worsenosays who ccp hasnt said anything theres nothing like that in the csm documentation it was jades ideaso i guess what you want to say is that the chairman is the only one who should be able to say anything and that the rest of the csms are there for aye and nay votes if not please clarify each of these points  to include context   with why you think they are worth bringing up so we might address them and understand your stance
thats a solution when there are csms who treat a council meeting the way goons treat the caod board he is being too democratic the last meeting went 4 hours long and they never even agreed to how their own votes will be determined if jade hadnt been pushy about it they might not have gotten all the player issues voted on in time for their meeting with ccp youre wrong darius by himself has posted more  about jade then she has about the rest of the council the council needs to focus on getting the player issues to ccp not ing about the chair and calling points of order and a council is supposed to take so long to meet that nothing gets accomplished a council is supposed to not even agree on what constitutes a successful vote a council is supposed to nitpick the  out of each others spelling and phrasing instead of getting through the topics individual council members are supposed to disagree with and recognize the exact opposite results of whatever votes they prefercouncils require strong chairpersons for the reasons i listed above and jade was elected the chairperson democratically it is her responsibility to chair the council and anyone who tries to remove her as chair is messing with the democratic process of the council
and some people think some people shouldnt try to overturn a democratic process just because some peoples panties are in a twistlol yessays me if you disagree please find an example of a chairperson who does not have any control of the meetings they rununsurprisingly you guessed wrong csm members do not get to hijack meetings and interfere with votes jade was more than obliging with inannaerr that is context you want the context of the context nowlol goons
supporting this
so you believe the bulleted list above is evidence that inanna is acting like a goon i can assure you from firsthand experience that isnt the way goons act you think inanna is trolling there are much better methods she could have chosen if she has a serious problem with the way things are being handled in the csm she has every right to address themit seems to me that jade doesnt seem to put too much importance on time as a matter of fact he insists on having meetings when individuals will not be able to appear jade being pushy has everything to do with why hes being called out we believe he needs to calm down and not exert so much power over the rest of the councildarius posts  about everybody  hes just an angry person he has not however taken personal grudges into the council and he has acted with the utmost civility in his position as csmwere asking that jade is also removed democratically all we want is a vote whats the worst that could happen we winsome of us arent asking for jade to be kicked outright but the csms should have the power to audit themselves and the voters should have the power to audit the csm thats still democracywell youre actually not the person who determines who has mute powers and who doesnt maybe there should be clarification from ccp or the council could initiate a votebutthats exactly what jade did he muted inanna therefore blocking her from either voting or from participating in her role
im having a hard time believing that people cant take a step back and see things for how they really are and are instead wearing their ingame colors defiantly in the face of the truthreally remove the rosetinted glasses and see for yourself just how ridiculous this dude jade has been behavingi think that many would prefer to see hardin as the chairperson he at least seems to have the interests of the game  and not himself   in mind
thats not really an accurate statement of my beliefs i voted for jade and id probably still vote for jadethecsmmember i just find the process of electing the chair to be extremely unfortunate because it gave us an inadequate chair if jade had done the sensible thing given his support of an elected chair   and stepped down as chair right off the bat this would all have been avoided or at least deserved if he got reelected to the spot but he didnt  im still not entirely sure why not though i could hazard a guess at this point  and so were left with this messunfortunately these godforsaken forums wont let me fisk that list properly inside of ten posts that said at least 23 of the actions posted on there are both reasonable and correct and the rest are no worse than other nonsilenced peoples actions seriously youre calling abstaining misconduct
this thread now has more public support than jades big thread about blowing up stations o

hey can you sponsor me into gf
i can but theres a 100m isk security deposithit me up in game
i think decisions should be made on the basis of some sort of bloodthirsty physical combatseriousposthadin for csm chair the guys got experience
jade is worthless it was already obvious this council would be of limited worth but the presidents being set now just make that worse if goonswarm wins the next council chair are we allowed to pull the same  mute everyone and win all votes by a yes or no by ourselvesabsurd
yes jade is worthless and should be removed
this is obviously an untenable situation jade should be forced to resign
rather see the position of chair removed but if theres going to be an executive it should be someone who knows the difference between leading and bullying
generally the chair shouldnt be a power crazy maniac
will tech two bs bpcs be ok im kinda broke atm
as is standard meeting procedure apologies are minuted unapologised absentees usually are notgender balance questions are fine and pretty common in the modern worldboth true and entirely validand was correct all three timeswho careshow is this abusive should dissedents be rounded up and shot its valid meeting procedure ccp has explicitely noted that the meeting uses simple rather than absolute majority that means an abstain vote  by formal definition means i do not hold an opinion formally but i do not wish my silence to be counted as a no or a yes this is basic stuff hereas was her rightits a valid opinion even if it may or may not be wrongit certainly appears true of the chairrefuses to vote on the question of simple majority vs 5 aye votes as she feels its obvious simple majority is correct with irony abounding 5 aye votes wins by simple majority vote 43 with inanna heavily favoring simple majority but abstaining on philosophic grounds
are they better than me 2
not sure im sitting on a few dozen redeemer and paladin prints waiting for redeemers to be buffeda handful had the me decryptor used but the rest were straight og
as is her rightas is her rightjade was attributing her abstain as a no vote  despite being prohibited in the constitution thats vote riggingand heres the nuts of the problem jade has no formal power to issue warnings they certainly are not formal heres whytheres an aparent contradiction in the csm summary that says1   the chair moderates the meetingbut2   a simple majority vote is required for passagenow under almost all legal jurastictions 2   is generally read to mean what is known as a limited freedom of speech specifically that the person involved is permited full freedom of speech on any matter pertaining to the democratic process because if members are barred from speech it is therefore not a democracy for an example of a ruling of this  see the crown vs the communist party of australia and note that this heuristic is backed up from follow up rulings around the world so how does the freedom of speech thing interact with the seemingly contradictory power of moderationthe key is in the word limited the moderator has no power to stop a person speaking to matters pertaining to the meeting if someone is a pain in the arse but is speaking about matters regarding democracy or topics of discussion that person has an inviolable right to do so if however people start doing z0r chains or posting farts or whatever then yes the moderator can intervene but only to the extent is restrains that behavior to mute someone for interjection or uncomfortable speech that is within the scope is a denial of natural law within the scope of democracyjade stuffed up and should conceed as much i wouldnt support a no confidence but i would if the behavior continuted it is unbecoming of a chair  along with jades and admittedly much of the councils concept of what an abstain vote means   and id remind jade that jade does not have a choice in the matter the chair is constrained by the very clear wording of simple majority to permit all democratic speech and respect the meaning of simple majority to not count an abstain as a nae
you guys need to calm downi read every line of that meeting and theres a number of simple issues at stake1   jade is still figuring out how to chair its not easy especially with a typing based meeting and unknown people cut him some slack for gods sake2   inanna was kept out of the chat room by technical error a number of csm members attested that he wasnt on the ban list this turned what would have been a simple 30 mute into a big hullabaloo3   one incident is not enough to establish jade as abusing his powers especially if there are technical issues inanna needs to stop overreacting and so do others4   does the chair have the right to mute people i believe from meeting 2 its been kinda established that he does however it was never voted upon and specifically agreed upon several people raised objections but a vote went through to not give everyone op it was probably unwise of jade to use muting power without a vote on record allowing him to do it but really its not the end of the world inanna was being disruptive and in my opinion in the previous meetings has made a habit of making loud objections to things in a way that seems designed to stop discussion thats my personal view though suffice it to say that i havent been impressed by inannas behaviour when she ends up on the losing side of a vote by contrast whenever jade is on the losing side of a vote i notice he accepts it with good grace and moves on if nothing else this leads me to my opinion that inanna was out of line and more than a few times5   the issue of majority vote i dont like the fact that 3 votes can push something through if 2 say no and 2 abstain on a 7 person quorum i also dont like that in a pure majority of those present abstains arent meaningful its a hard question but certain members of the csm were much too heated in the discussion and thats what bothers me
farts
i suggest all council members be slaughtered except for the two americansgoons and that goonswarm be granted dominion over all the regions of 00 forever it is clear that no one else is prepared to lead us
thats the non optional part the csmsummary pdf is quite explicit here it says simple majoritythis means more ayes than naes abstain counts as neither thats all it means 322 is a pass because its 35 votes with 2 abstainstheres no other interpretation if 322 meant 34 then the term is absolute majority the document is quite explicit that its not absolute  but simple
how many times do i have to log in before itll let me post cripes
yeah it was a bug but in the frenzy of the meeting nobody really knew what was going on most of the members didnt even know anyone was muted let alone kicked the major problem is that jade has said repeatedly that he doesnt believe he did anything wrong and that hell do the same thing in the future this does not promote teamwork also theres nine people on the council darius and bane may be goons but their positions still count
wholeheartedly supported until jade goes and takes his divisive posturing with him nothing of value will come of this process
supporteddoesnt this already have more votes than the destructible stations idea jade tried to railroad through anyway
it all sounds good to me as any body of ppl needs strong leadership and a firm hand when it comes to discipline jade seems to have things in hand as far as keeping ppl on track is concerned
no support for this rubbish
supported impeach the pooch
impeachare you crazy or just simple
bad egg
judging by some of jades answers is he like 14 yrs of agei vote to remove him from the chair ive never been a fan of bob but i would rather see db preacher in the chair
anyone who suggests that a democratic committee needs a strong leader to discipline it  clearly has no ing idea how a committee work
every committee has a chair person whos responsibilities include keeping order during meetings and that takes a certain strength of personality to accomplish or things become a shouting matchand anybody who does not see that clearly has no ing idea what ppl can be like or is looking to exaggerate the fact and need into a omgwtf dictator drama bomb to suit there personal agend just like they accuse others  jade   of doingdid your boy lose the election
gets my vote i want to see fixes to lag and making the moa not suck i dont want this to be a platform for a repugnant little publicityjunkie to sidetrack the process in order to further his own interests and those of his allianceserenity needs to grow a pair and stand up to jade too at the moment he is at risk of being implicated due to his absolute unwillingness to step in and control someone who is his personal friend
i sure am glad we had one man corp alt people telling us how people are clearly their success in people management is demonstrated in game
a good chair person keeps the discussion relevant to the topic and also stops ppl from using ad hominem attacks and other disruptive comments like this individual seems to think are worth saying maybe those who cannot keep to the agenda  mostly goons as per usual   should move back to caod where they belong
oust
right from the start i knew having jade as chair would be a bad moveobviously i dont know jade personally but just going on the sheer amount of waffling he does he obviously loves the sound of his own voice i mean read his posts or an even better example would be to listen to the evecast interview he did before the csm elections all the others that were interviewed gave nice to the point answers to the questions asked jade on the other hand droned on about every little detaili didnt mind having jade on the council but as chairman he seems to believe this gives him some special rightspower that the others dont and nobody actually elected jade a chairmanits not your council jade seriously if you care about the csm as much as you made out you did before the elections its time to pull your head in and stop trying to play puppet masterbe the bigger man  roleplaying as a girl   and step down youll do more good as a member of the council than you will trying to run it
get back to us when youve read the csm meeting minutes and seen with your own eyes jades behaviour
did i just agree with a goonjade constantine muting everyone who disagrees with him is wrong not to mention 99 of what he says is tldr and could be written in 14 of the length already supported so cant in this post  
i see a chair person dealing with a disruption to a meeting warnings were given initially then a mute when the problem continued seems pretty cut and dried to me
ha ha are you jades alt i doubt many people could cast this in such a partisan light considering how split the counci is already your outright lies are transparentthe only way this is cut and dried is if you really believe jade has the right to silence members and ignore votes neither of which is outlined in the charter so spare me your bull on cut and dried  jadeperhaps you should type wall of text for all your replies  it would matter as much
so goonswarm have found a new griefing toy with the csm it seems how very much unsurprising
jade is no stranger to relying on ad hominem and why do you think caod is so important to us goons post where the action is and theres plenty of drama to be had here  but dont worry well still post in caodis that really such a big deal did you think we were going to be okay with this darius and bane have continually pushed for fairness and equality to the point of calling jade out several times and that wont change if it did id expect people to rise up and call for a vote of no confidence
quoting for hilarity
jade had a chance to act responsibly he has shown he cant this has my support
yes its a shame jade had to do something the council disagrees with before our grand master plan was unveiled we hardly had any goons at all come into these forums but i guess that must be those goonies blobbing the forums so theyll lag out its clearly griefing and not at all related to what had just happened during the last meeting
so im a alt and a liar you really do belong on caod dont you  1 i do believe that the chair has the right to silence a disruptive member its a necessary power2 i do not think that votes should or can be ignored but then i see no votes being ignored only a proposed clarification on the voting systemmaybe you should type more goon drama bomb bull it would save reading time
like most idiots against this motion you fail to describe what disruptive is  like anyone is going to take you or your ilk seriously try harder
considering jades response and behavior regarding the minuscule incident i have to support this notion jade is obviously neither mature nor honest nor objective enough to fill in the position of a chairman remove him from chair and vote in anotherit almost makes me belief that jade was voted in by all those people that want the csm to fail
after seeing the attitude that jade has made in the csm minutes i regret voting for him supported
closer to 40 believe it or not
after having read the minutes of the last meeting it is with a heavy heart that i have to support this issuejade you failed several times to allow iz to finish what she was saying and thus to you it looked like she was speaking while you were trying to force a vote if you stuck to the decision made at the previous meeting to show that you had finished talking properly before moving on this may not have happened serenity is one of the few of you to actually request to speak and signal when she has finished properlyhowever your kneejerk reaction and subsequent moderation with attempt to veto  even tho other elected csms disagreed   shows that you are not at this time capable of being the chair of our elected csmi for one do not wish the csm to fail and i voted for a candidate that has proven to be professional courteous and level headed so far perhaps you should reread the minutes of the meetings and see what the rest of us are seeing
i have a hard time believing a rational person can claim inannas constant and focused attempts to be disruptive throughout that meeting are reasonable and correct and then turn around and have a hissy fit over a single action that actually was reasonable and correctperhaps you can explain it for mei didnt say abstaining is misconduct i do think abstaining is a sign the csm candidate is not prepared the playerbase has put forward ideas to make the game better i think the least a csm candidate can do is review it enough to form an opinion about it and either support it or reject it
did you or did you not threaten some of your members on the goon forum with infractions if they kept posting in eves corporation alliances and organization discussion forum please deny it so i can post a picture of the thread with your posting and show what kind of liar you are many goons post on alts their posting pattern and their antibob attitude makes that much obvious lets not forget the spy goons in different alliances posting here to make it look like many alliances agree with you on removing jade this is an entirely goon fed propaganda campaign it was even you mr johnson that forced jade to tighten control over the council as you were doing everything in your power to disrupt the meeting
jade constantine alt spottedinannas actions were fine jade muting and then kicking himher for disagreeing with his point of view is not
the chair is not required to permit all democratic speech whatever that means regardless time was given to people who wanted to discuss a topic she isnt required to allow time to people who just want to emoragealso inannas interruption of a vote and demands that the council support the opposite verdict of a previous vote  that she willfully abstained from and allowed to pass   is a direct contradiction of democracy and the democratic process for what its worth
lol im not jade glad i could get under your skin though inanna was an ass in that meeting she should have been kicked earlier its not like she was voting much anyway
lol caod troll spotted
the fact you hide behind a alt pretty much negates anything you because in fact you could be jade
i am a sinner and a lazy person but at least im not a goon
this is not a motion its a witch hunt ran by all those whos candidate or ideas did not make it and also by the natural s and trouble makers who look for any reason to dish out a bit of venomthe votes have been counted and the candidates chosen if you cannot deal with the fact your guys lost then tough  thats your problem
i thought i was the altmaybe its just the way s minds work that they need to blame and accuse anybody who does not share their delusion
support
i supprt this i believe the chair should not overstep their role and has no right to mute or remove anyone from the council also the chair should not express their hostility toward council members even if the hostility is there and deserved the chair person as it is now in the council should be able to fill 2 roles in the council one would be the chair role to lead the proceedings and the other would be the elected council member role those roles should not be mixed so the chair person should not use their position to promote or try to enforce their views that they represent as council member if the chair person is not able to keep those roles separated and do both those roles at the same time the chair person should step down and a new chair person elected if none of the council members wish to take on the responsibility or are unable to keep those roles separate then a chair person should be invited from outside to oversee the proceedings so that the council members can all focus on their appointed task by the people who elected themjust my 2c
supported
seeing all of these jade apologists come out of the woodwork makes me think that people arent taking this seriously at all read the chatlogs jade is completely out of control
i think someone has committee chairman confused with chairman mao
all i hear while reading their posts is slurp slurp slurp
this proposal
one request for everybody  could you please stop accusing every third person of being a jade alt even if they are you just make yourself look like a whiny fool because its said about everybody and you cant prove anything and much as its a maxim of human society that theres no position too crazy for somebody to believe in it theres also no position too crazy that two people wont believe in it in any group of sufficient size even those you dislike and find to be nutty will have support too its cool and i see where you got that interpretation from i just wanted to make myself clear
id welcome such a document but only from ccp i dont think any current member of the csm or player supporter of csm members has the required neutral perspective to be involved with this
i understand your position jade i totally empathise with it its a  to be chair in a hostile senate but ccp seem to of left the question openthe scope documents provide a power to make sugestions to them what i propose is you guys take the document ive made as a template sculpt it into something that works for you guys and present it to ccp as a proposal on how it should workanyone whos worked with comittees will tell you that whats happening is growing pains of a new body corporate the solution is always to clarify the procedure if you dont jade people will always question your mandatemake it easy for yourself jade ill put it to you to champion my proposal this will demonstate a comitment to process and make it beyond question that this comittee can be made to work im trying to make a way that works for you recognise it big fella edit for what its worth im a kos widow whilst i adore the goonies i totally recognise they are unstable s at times this isnt biased i do think you blew a couple of resolutions but rather than searching for blood im trying to brainstorm you a way to make everyone happy including you
it would appear that jade is a few clowns short of a circus
we need a cohesive csm not a stage for narcissistic powertrips
nt
at least this shows you cant have the chair be decided on most votes its vastly important for a chair to remain neutral to create a good enviroment for serious internet spaceship dicussion this is a clear example of the chair not remaining neutral and punishing a csm rep for no valid reasonif jade has ever been to a public meeting in their life they would of realize that people can object to a vote at any time it seem quite clear that jade completely change what they were voting on to give their own bias opinion then when they lost the vote lash out at a csm rep whom call them on it with two other csm rep agreeing
jade if you feel like you have done nothing wrong then allow the council to have a vote of no confidence and confidence in you at a time when all the original csm representatives  not alternates   can be online
im not in favor of any player measure that changes the constitution that hasnt been raised as an issue been open for public debate for 7 days been advocated to the csm by a rep and passed a simple majority there documented as a submission proposal and been presented to ccp in the formal discussions at the conference  these coincidently are the steps that have been taken with the electable chair issue i raised  if any csm rep had chosen to support this thread they could have done exactly the same and wed be discussing the constitutional change to allow this in iceland as yet none have this is the only way such a vote could happen and im certainly not in favour of subverting the founding documentation to let people play politics with a csm body that is not designed for this purpose so in short request denied if anybody feels ive done something wrong they can certainly ask a rep to advocate this topic for them or complain to ccp i guess
so apparely you can deny darius mail about the vote of no confidence then anyways
can i ask what you are talking about please
he send a mail the other day on your fancy email list thing about a vote of no confidence in the chairman of the csm i do believe and you said you would not add item so said agenda for the meeting
im new to the game  loving it by the way    and read most of this post  mainly because id noticed if you got a good deal on your ship you could make a profit from it being destroyed  though not a huge one on the ships im currently flying   id agree with self destruct definitely voiding your insurance in the same way that repackaging does though i dont know yet if self destruct has some viable use  like denying salvage or capture from pirates in which case this becomes a little trickiermy main thought though was that it should follow rl and premiums go up in accordance with claims  and can go down when no claims are made for a set period of time  much less than in rl for game purposes   if criminal activities were penalised on their insurance i think it would detract from the game because even as a nonpirate i can see that this is a strong part of the game and that players shouldnt be penalised for choosing piracy as their profession this system would penalise suicide ganking to a degree which i think it should as this seems an exploit
get rid of insurance on concordokken and self destructincrease payout on t2 needs to be seriously thought through ie 40 of what the average price of the ships cost for payout

instead of the little hand icon there needs to be a small 3item bar graph bars in red yellow and green with one number under the graph to display the entire number of votes cast very simple and easy to understand at a glanceand the current system actually defies the original intent of the document it is not anonymous
rejoice t2 ammunition have been changed the bpo copy time has been increased so it is again above production timewhat that is not the boost you were asking for well it is what we get

i dont understand either tbh youve posted a buffer fit that is inferior relative to the other cs yet still requires two fitting mods and are claiming that everything is fine are you insanethe very fact that such a limited fit aimed at the least pg requirements possible still requires two fitting mods is undeniable conclusive proof that a pg boost is required what do you fear about a pgboosted nighthawk why do you think it will be imbalanced justify your position
im not sure are you playing eve because in eve we have parity but not perfect symmetry you fit the ship and accept not only the mods on the ship but the play style as a whole sure those ships have higher paper dps but ofcourse they have optimals and tracking to deal with the partisans here have a module centric view of fitting rather than a strategic view not only do you want the hams but also the gangmod mwd and active tank and think the other ships so wildly ahead of the nighthawk should i complain that because i like armor tanking i should protest that the raven is an inferior armor tanker because other battleships have more lows and grid the issue is not the nighthawk its your fitting strategythe question always comes back to degree of performance and in this case it is fine if you want leadership mods use a vulture it has more grid if you want missile damage use a nighthawk but if you want absolutely everything then oversimplifying things so persistently is silly and misleading to your readers
ipso fact response to the editthe only reason i added the gang mod was because the op is hellbent on making it seem impossible if i were flying one i would replace it for a medium neut or somethingi see no reason to make arbitrary changes is all the nighthawk being pg limited is actually not the problem in and of itself but at the intersection of a lot of different fitting issues extenders injectors boosters being pg heavy not to mention the embarrassingly high cost of gang mods and the reversal of missile launcher pg values vis a vis turrets ie close range turrets are easier to fit while ranged missile weaponry is actually easier to fit not to mention how there are only two calibers of missiles when turret users have a richer selection and it seems like the nighthawk is the problemmaking the nighthawk more powergrid heavy doesnt remedy any of these issues and in six months it could have unintended consequences elsewhere the unforeseen costs of doing that is higher than simply fitting with more economy
my strategic view when fitting a ship is that it needs to bring maximum utility to a gang a command ship that cant fit a gang mod is bringing less utility to the gang it is a part of versus a command ship that can fit the gang mod a ship that does less damage over time as well as suffering a delay between firing its weapons and the target receiving damage is bringing less utility to the gang than a ship that does damage instantaneouslysecondary to this requirement is that you need to be able to perform your job without dying this means being able to fit a tank in whatever slots you have left after youve kitted out the damage gang mods ewar etc while i think local active tanking is pretty much worthless compared with a buffer tank in gang fights these days the principle still standsthe issue with the nighthawk is that its inferior powergrid compared with the other command ships prevents it from fulfilling either requirement it needs to make huge sacrifices in order to fit a gang mod sacrifices that prevent it from bringing as much damage or as much survivability in order to remain competitive with the other command shipsfurthermore given the current pvp environment being able to deal more damage tends to be preferable than having a stronger active tank or larger hp buffer thus the nighthawks inherent nature of supporting a stronger tank at the expense of dealing less damage makes it a less attractive choice compared to other command ships even if it didnt suffer from horrendous fitting problemsyou blame the powergrid requirements of gang mods cap injectors shield extenders etc but at the end of the day its the nighthawk thats the odd ship out compared with all the other ships that are able to fit the modules you listed without issue so either everything else has too much powergrid and injectorsrepsgang mods take too much powergrid as well or the nighthawk lacks sufficient powergrid and injectorsrepsgang mods are fine
now were getting somewhere youre on the right lines here  the nighthawks problem is really a combination of pgintensive mods such as mwd lse gang mod etc but your comment that the nighthawk being pg limited is actually not the problem in and of itself is wrong other ships do not have crippling pg problems when fitting these mods their pgs are designed with them in mind ships like the sleipnir or onyx work well and are not overpowered therefore the problem is quite definitely the nighthawks powergrid rather than the modules in general ulstans     pg chart demonstrates this welli disagree here also a pg boost remedies these issues by making fits possible without crippling yourself with fitting mods such a boost does not directly affect other ships  were not fiddling with the pg requirements of hmls or gang mods and hence is the obvious design choice to minimise unintended consequences elsewherein any case what might these consequences be the nighthawk is a rather inflexible ship thanks to the slot layout true tacklingewar is out of the question  it is a simple ganktank gang support ship with gang mod as optional extra but currently cannot perform in this role a pg boost would do is to make it easier to fit pgheavy modules  but i cannot see a medium neutnighthawk being overpowered  or indeed viable   nor a smartbomb nighthawk a pg boost of level that we seek  150 extra   still does not allow the fitting of an xlsb without multiple fitting mods  unlike the sleipnir you should note   and the active and buffer tanks are still limited by the number of medslots while the pve passiveregen tank is still limited by the number of lowslots and rigslots what unintended consequences do you fear what unintended consequences are there to fear the nighthawk is a simple ship there are no secret uber fits waiting out there you cant nano it with any sensible fit youll never make an uber solo boat out of it all we seek is the pg boost required to fulfill its clearlydefined and intended gang support role without quite as many fitting mods being required
i agree in general with the sentiment of this post but in my mind you depart from the whole premise of playing to your strengths when you fit the gang mod as that is roughly another extender or one of the other mid slots mods on a turret ship youd have to simply concede to fitting smaller turrets or one less gun here losing a launcher hurts a lot more but if you need more grid for more tank you have few other real alternatives given how clumsy gam real world implementation is id leave it off every time in favor of just flying the vulture which is arguably way too effective not only as a booster but as a midrange sniper put another way my nighthawk would either not fit the gangmod and fit a bigger passive fit the gang mod and lose a launcher or two for a bigger tank or simply use the vulture i dont know thats why they are unintended in all seriousness though you used the sleipnir for example as having huge tank biggest guns and relatively relaxed fittingsbut i and perhaps others dont see much marginal benefit to fitting those 425s preferring d180s or 220s in favor of more extenders or a better mwd in the process not to mention tracking if suddenly ccp decided to cut pg and cpu reqs on all gang mods in half to create incentives to use them and launched more skills too then minmatar would be the clear cut gang mod kings able to fit guns multiple gang mods and rely on capless weaponry with effective ranges that dwarfed other close range guns and this isnt even on the claymore which has an even more intense tank and bonused gang mods then were back to this thread nh gained but the gain wasnt enough because suddenly the sleipnir is now faster and better in every metric this comparison to heavy missile iis for example is exactly what i had in mind when i said these pages and pages of comparisons werent fair or accurate if the problem was specifically the nighthawk pg then the comparison would be heavy launcher iis to heavy beams 250mm rails and 720 iis rather than the listed comparison to close range turrets no doubt then youd see heavy weapons seriously preclude other fittings  
ive only got time for a quick reply atm but comparing hml iis to heavy beams 250mm rails and 720 iis is not a fair or accurate comparison either because missiles are not really sniper or longrange weapons in pvp because of flight time and target speed issues weve been using hmls in the comparison because theyre lighter on pg than the superior highertier hamls and we recognise that being able to fit the best of everything without compromises is not acceptable given sensible fittings i would always use hams over hms actually id give serious thought to using aml iis instead also  the longish range of hms is simply not particularly useful in pvp and precision heavies are too terrible for wordshave a look here to see the modelled fits after a 140 pg boost fitting mods are still required multiple ones even for the most pgintensive fit but its a hell of an improvement on the current situation
i wrote out a nice long reply only to find that my folly in trusting ccp to not have jacked up the forums after a patch has burned me once again now i turn to using word again and i will keep this reply briefif you were at all familiar with the differences between turrets and launchers then you would understand my comparions missiles and turrets are inverted when it comes to powergrid requirements for range  longrange launchers are low grid longrange turrets are high grid shortrange launchers are high grid shortrange turrets are low grid if you understand that now then you can see that my comparisons  from the perspective of grid   are across the board low grid and as such are analogousnow while i think the nighthawk is relatively fine when it comes to dps  particularly given the range flexibility of missiles   i obviously do not think the nighthawk is fine when it comes to grid as such i wanted this discussion to focus on grid since that is indeed the problem  this is completely ignoring the discussion of its nearly useless missile precision bonus  my comparisons are not only grid relevant comparisons but they are also  not coincidentally   as advantageous for each ship as possible while remaining true to each ships role the astarte and the sleip are supremely effective up close the abso is fine in both roles however i believe pulses to simply be a better choice for the abso for a few reasons that i wont bother getting into here regardless the nighthawk only receives bonuses relevant to heavy missiles  not hams   and is so powergrid castrated that fitting hams is essentially uselessthose two facts  relevance and general usefulness   being the case  my setups are all realistic relevant to the discussion and generally usefulnow to look at your setup  edit  what is even more laughable is that according to eft 241 your setup doesnt even fit it requires 104775 of 102506  this setup is simply awful firstly a buffer tank using one lse a scram on an antisupport ship without also fitting a webnow i would have also fit heavy missiles so i dont think there is any fault there however i think your setup is actually a fairly good setup to further illustrate my point you have had to use a pdu and an ancillary rig in order to fit the nighthawks lowest grid weapons only one lse  which hardly constitutes a buffer or a tank   you still have a gaping em hole and you had to use a named mwd in order to save further on gridallinall your setup does a fine job of supporting our argument and proving that the nighthawk is catastrophically low on grid
oh god thanks silence i didnt bother to check this myself that doesnt fit guess what you dont have the pg this is quite funny  you post a fit specifically designed to save pg  named mwd buffer tank hmls   and then claim that everything is fine even though it still requires 2 fitting mods and then doesnt bloody fit anywaythis is a damning indictment of the nighthawks pg problem its quite sad that a ship is so gimped for no reason
yeah i thought it was sort of erotically ironic that the only definite point hes made  by posting a setup   didnt even fit which as far as i can tell supports our argument that the nighthawk needs a powergrid boost
mmm irony deliciousbtw i have eft 252 and it still doesnt fit so dont come here and say you eft is outdated and such
totally obvious
i would have to disagree with the op i dont see an issue of jump bridges being active in a cyno jambed systemfrom a rp perspective i never thought jump bridges utilized cynosfrom a game play perspective an alliance shouldnt have cripple it self logistically in order to utilize the protection of a cynojammer on a deathstarif there is a balance issue then you should be looking at fuel  mass ratio for using a bridge not saying it shouldnt be allowed
x
it appears that perhaps you do not understand pos mechanics and fleet mechanics i do not know why you assume that a smaller alliance will never stand a chancei find it irnoic that the brige nerf was being promoted as postive for the small alliances when the reality is that it actually only hurts small alliances and makes no difference to other alliances  other than those who use riskfree dread tactics  but from your perspective it appears you are actually against the smaller alliance which is a strange change of stance is this the truth now coming out
yorda stop posting everywhere youre dumbalso serenity steele has been put in charge of framing this issue for the csm this is kind of unfortunate because serenity doesnt have a clue about anything hell he wants a form of concord to operate in 00 space sounds like just the man to talk about capital and pos warfare doesnt it
ok i think youre going to be surprised by what you read here a ninja salvager is providing a  i think   good solution to mission runners complaints about the ninja salvaging professionin another thread another player wrote i think it should be the uninvited entrance of an active mission which creates aggro not the salvaging of wrecksi must give credit where credit is due because theres a fundamental idea in this thought that i as a ninja salvager might be able to get behindfirst lets get a few things off the tableq should salvaging a wreck give aggro to the mission runner to allow them to shoot the ninja salvagera no too many criminally minded ninja salvagers might use this to their advantage to purposefully bait the mission runner into shooting them so they can return in a more powerful pvp ship  some mission runners agree with this while others do not and thats fine we will not all agree on this one  q does a ninja salvager take away a mission runners possible profits with little riska yes the only element of risk involved is from any npc rats that have not already aggrod the mission runner and might aggro the ninja salvagerq are mission rewards faira im not a mission runner so i cant say for certain what i can say is that salvage is a possible stream of revenue and this is likely why some mission runners would like to change the rules of salvageq should we make mission deadspace unscannable or locked so that mission runners dont have to worry about ninja salvagera no probes do what they do and we shouldnt change the rules of space just because a mission runner is unhappy to see a ninja salvager enter their mission deadspaceheres my thought without changing the rules of salvage  ie no aggro first one to salvage the wreck gets it   how can we make it more fair to the mission runner when a ninja salvager scans himher outsimply i propose we fix the way npc rats actweve all engaged npc rats at one time or another and have noticed the aggro counter at the top of the screen its truly useless because the rats dont do anything about it sure weve attacked them and now theyve got 15 minutes of aggro what does this mean nothingi propose that npc rats be smarterwhat if a ninja salvager enters a mission deadspace and the rats that are attacking the mission runner suddenly say hey this guys an easy target lets take him out firstor if by salvaging a wreck instead of giving the mission runner aggro against the ninja salvager you give aggro rights to the npc rats and have a new spawn appear to attack the ninja salvageri must say  i hadnt thought about the fact that the ninja salvager could just warp away leaving the mission runner with new enemies but that was brought up by the same player and gave me a bit more thought on the whole thinglets say that the aggro counter now becomes more useful the npc rats see that the ninja salvager has left and warp away themselves possibly  by random chance   appearing wherever the ninja salvager goes for 15 minutes this rule could be applied whenever someone attacks rats in a belt and leaves any of them alive the rats could actively search out the player and suddenly spawn during the aggro timer i know what youre thinking if the player left because he was overpowered he might only have enough structure left to limp home so i was thinking that we make the rats damage proportional so that they dont instapop the poor guygal when they find himher  think about it logically scan probes can still do what they do without acting differently just because of deadspace mission runners have more time to act since the ninja salvagers now have something to deal with instead of having riskfree salvagingi think this idea would be fair to both sides
i completely endorse the product andor service
upgrading the aggro mechanics to more actively target the softesthardest hitting targets first id support if it applied to any ship in the vicinity whatever the reason they are there and really it would have to be this way as it seems to me that a system that tried to distinguish uninvited salvagers from other people who might be around for one reason or another would be horribly finicky to makethough id think such a change would do missioners more harm than good at least those who do missions with friendsaltscertainly not this would make no sense why would npc pirates react violently and specifically to someone salvaging their comrades wrecks but not react in the same way to someone taking the loot of the same wrecks it reverses the order of seriousnesslegality between loot and salvage towards npcs as compared to versus players and why would they appear to nail a salvager but then leave the guy shooting their comrades  the missioner   alone if the salvager diesleavessurprise attacks from npc factions you are flagged to could be an interesting idea but as i object to the idea of getting flagged from salvaging  especially if it doesnt apply to looting of the very same wrecks   i dont really see how it applies heresalvaging as it stands now is not broken and as such does not need fixing ive have seen plenty of people take action to secure assets they consider their own and to those i tip my hat and leave those who carelessly leave stuff lying about stand to loose profit as it should beyes to more opportunistic npc aggro mechanics in general a firm no to all the rest
i agree with you in most of what you say however i tend to lean towards agreeing with many mission runners when they say that ninja salvaging has little risk actually it has about as much risk as mining and thats a recognized and respected profession without the in your face aspects that our chosen profession provides  personally if it never changes ill be happy mission runners have the ability to salvage as they go have a buddy to salvage to make the whole thing faster shoot the wrecks or even declare war on a corporation that invades their missions i agree that there are always options  i was just putting forth a few thoughts on how things might be able to change to provide additional balance
not all salvage thieves are in player corps i doubt a war from mission runners would worry most pirates anywaya suggestion i saw on the forums before was to make salvaging a wreck aggro against the person who created it but when running a mission you have an option to mark the salvage rights as available for anyone people looking for free salvage can then do a scan for unclaimed salvage or whatever and warp to the location and salvage freely as some people do not salvage due to time or thinking it isnt worth it
a good idea but this smacks of alot of problems with real life cases where rules get implemented that penalize the majority because a minority decides to be clownsthe simple fact is that if people didnt ninja loot other peoples kills we would not have this sort of problem and would not be having this conversation this ties into people camping the drug hideouts and other places where npcs spawn generally mission runners are equipped differently and not fitted out to specifically deal with pvp  example having a tractor beam and salvager fitted   so making the ninja taggable becomes detrimental as well as spawning more npcs and most pvprs will be able to handle the npcs with ease and like you said them warping away will leave more spawned enemies for the mission runner to deal with potentially leading to disaster especially if they were to warp in multiple times spawning multiple instances of said npcs thus ensuring the mission runners demise then sweeping in and taking all the loot from their mission pretty diabolicaland not very nicei do like the idea of the rats spawning randomly to chase away the ninja looter though has always been a pet peeve of mine in other mmorpgs where after hours and hours of grueling work going through and instance or grinding on mobs that some dude comes in and swipes your shiney and there is nothing you can do about it the level of frustration can be truly epici understand the game is very open ended and quite cutthroat kinda like real life but ultimately we are all here to have a good time and when people go out of their way to be pricks they take away from the game as a whole which ultimately lessens everyones overall experience if people need salvage that bad just partner with said mission runner split it 5050 then everyone winsinstead of trying to make some sort of programmed mechanic for it we could all take a little responsibility for our actions and have a good timei know i know i sound terribly hippyish but i am a minmatar after all and a radical at heart
then we need to deal with all those people flying around shooting at people who dont want to be shot at first
idk mate id be extremely worried about my drones when im down south carebearing for isk to buy pvp equipment with im a terrible pirate if the rats stopped shooting me to go after my drones all the time  its bad enough that they do it sometimes now as it is   it would get very expensive replacing my t2 drones after every belt and if i have to constantly recall and redeploy them their dps would become negligiblei like where youre going with it so ill click support but it needs a lot of worktweaking make drones not count maybe idk that sounds too simple though
i was told to post herethis is an idea i had last night as i was managing literally dozens of targets all by myself at onceview this animation and see what i meanplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesas you can see here when the ibis appears on the overview he lights up briefly and fades to normal this feature  which you could toggle in overview settings   would aide a great deal on acknowledging what just showed up to assist in managing multiple targets that way if youre trying to figure out who just showed up now you can get a visual on itda recent alternativeplease visit your user settings to reenable images
uuuh good onemight want to have a slider or input box for sensitivity  time say in seconds for fadetodefaultbackground colour  heck why not an overview column for time on overview which you could sort by
a great list indeed and im sure that many pilots will agree with thembecause of the way this forum works though anything new has to be the first post in the topic so whereas the current list has already been through the seven days comment process it is too late to add your list to themall is not lost however if you could repost them as a new thread in the assembly hall and it should be possible to get them put forward in the next session in two months  each csm incarnation gets three inputs for guaranteed responses from devs  ccp  thanks againiz
yep yep all agreedsigned
this doesnt need much of an explanationbasically if i want to activate a group of modules such as say online all my high slots then i could have a hotkey which did that for me same with the mids and the lowspretty simple and it means im not using macros or keyboards with extra features to do this for me its a simple mechanic of the game
look at the old mechwarrior games  where you could bind buttons to fire a group of weapons   for an example supporting this
we already have overload rack buttons we could have activate rack buttons which in turn could have hotkeys attachedwho really wants to click 8 turrets every time they want to shoot a new target it gets old quicklyfor example f1 activates the highs and shiftaltcontrolf1 overloads them f2 for med and f3 for low  or whatever your heart desires
absotively posolutely
i would prefer it if you could allocate groups to online at a time with one key but you would think a culture capable of warp drive would be capable of weapon linking
da yob
yup like it you are correct hypothetically speaking the drone damage should be low slot i dont agree with zorda to much gank possiblities by making it mid slot small suggestion i think the auxiliary control link i should be cpu intensive so it can be used on a myriad of ships not just battleships bss dont cry out for a drone bw increase recons hacs and bc do
my concern is that it adds a lot of dps for one slot on anything smaller than a battleship it obviously needs to take a good dose of grid so that frigates dont get to fly heavies but i think it should still be somewhat difficult to fit one on a cruiser and even a hac or bc 500 grid might be okay but id be wary about dropping it lower i said in my original post that im not sure my numbers are balanced but theres a reason why i picked the ones i did
i think the grid should be dropped to 450  equivalent of 2 medium railguns   and that should be good this is a huge module and should really require a lot of grid to fit but not so much that it overlyhinders a normal cruiser from fitting it also if you put it in a highslot itll act similar to the carrier module already in the game but not as powerful  perfectly fitted for a smaller ship modulesigned
fine ideagets my support
signed as an idea n principle have to make sure that u cant make it overpowered but yeh show drones mods some love please
signed
yep yep would introduce more boba fett types always amusing   
totally signedwhen there is little or no difference between the 3 tiers of large ac due to better tracking on the lower end and the absolutley miniscule diff in dps for fitting the larger 800s then theres no point using themgive us a reason to fit 800s please
hey there over the last few days ive been reading a few posts about the last csm meeting etc some people have responded saying things like a forum should be created for them to have said meetings on etc i agree with thisheres my ideacreate a new forum under the csm banner make it so everyone can read it but only csm members and ccp staff can reply and create topics this will illuminate any kind of flaming etc that might happen unless the csm members decide to flame   multiple issues can be raised at any time and can be read and commented on as well as voted for by the csm members might as well use the thumbs up or down function already in place   the chairmanwoman should get the ability only to move topics up and down on the forum but not to delete topics or responses to topics this means that it will be easier to see what is currently the main issue that is being discussed as well as making it very hard to mute other csm membersthis will also eliminate the need for minutes to be taken and sent to and from ccp as well as to the rest of the player base as well as also eliminating any fighting that might take place in say a chat channel issues that might come up are with other players posting stuff on the other forum topics to try put in their 2c this would mean that more moderation would be needed until it becomes clear that doing such isnt a smart ideathe main advantages that this would create are a far more transparent way for the csms to communicate as well as a much more civil way to respond to each other it also will show to the player base they are supposed to represent what the current issues are it will also make it possible for all csm members to have there say and not have to try figure out the best time to have meetings because of time zone differences as well as rl issues that might unexpectedly come up there are also many other advantages i probably cant think of atm with probably a few more disadvantages as well
i fully support proclamations being used in a more sensible fashion i see no need for the csm meetings to be in real time and a forum for discussion and voting would be better for all involved
im conditional on the issue the caldari have to get grave digger or one featuring bruce willis
qft d
we have support of a rep does that mean it now is going to go to meeting and be voted on
being this is the funniest thing ive read all week i 100 get behind it comfortable in the knowledge of ccps veto  
i hope my representatives bring forth this idea even the disenfranchised ones
postin in a thread
the game is crowded with pos towers that have been abandon the only option to get them out of the way is to blow them up so no loot most of the time the mods around them arnt worth the ammo it takes to kill the tower a skill with the chance to steal or if u fail destroy the tower should be in the gamethe skill should only work on towers that have been offline for over 30 days
issue the csm has over the last few weeks spent a great deal of its meeting time trying to work out how it should do things as a commitee and how the commitee should work lack of any guidence from ccp has meant the csm is voting in messures for itselfproblem the csm will not be able to function whilst these issues are still unresolved and there will be many many more issues that will crop up over the course of this session and i expect many sessions to come the lack of guidence from ccp has resulted in the time when voters issues should be addressed instead being put aside for thispossible solution i believe the csm should as a group ask ccp as a matter of urgency design and provide the csm with a consitution and set of procedures for running the commitee and outlining the various responsibilities and powers of the offices in the csm to allow the csm to do what they were voted to do that being address the issues that matter to the players of eve online i have my own ideas for what some of these could be to help allivate some of the issues we have faced and possibly will face again but ill leave that for another threadthere is another thread where another solution is outlined that involves the csm not ccp spending its time sorting these issues out if you prefer that please go and vote on that thread here
oh and yes i do support this
yep supported ccp should draw up rules  including a clear constitutionlike document  i think the burden should be on them to do this since the csm is their creation   but with the builtin ability for csm themselves to make amendments to it as may be necessaryi notice that theres already a proposed constitution being discussed here but in all seriousness a constitution needs to be airtight and drawn up by a smaller group of people not that im badmouthing dippin dots hes right that the csm needs a constitution or bylaws that lay out exactly what it is that they do and how they do it and its fantastic that hes taking the initiative to propose one from scratch but this needs careful oversight from ccp and discussion of the proposal on the forums will get very messy very fast
i believe ccp is already working on answering our unresolved issues for know that is about all i know
good to hear i hope it will be a comprehensive document and not just something that covers the issues already raised but looking forward as well
at this point its the best bet really rulings need to be made and the current makeup of the csm cannot be counted on to make unbiased judgements on administrative and procedural issues we need a clear statement of the powers and responsibilities of the chair and other csm positions  and also the responsibility of ordinary members with regards to behaviour in meetings and in representation of the csm to the broader public   until we get this stuff sorted itll be very easy for people to point fingers and make wild claims about abuse of power and moderationlack of moderation i think perhaps ccp themselves underestimated the degree to which the csm would be immediately politicized between factions on administrative issues and they certainly underestimated the volume of jerryspringeresq entertainment that would come from putting nine people who dont like each other much into a chat channel on a hot summer afternoon
one last try for sanitycurrently the csm does not have any form of formal direction or sturcture many people assume that the csmpdf document is meant to provide this but if you read closely it is easy to tell that it is not meant for that purpose it was written for ccp as a proposal for the idea of allowingencouraging the formation of a player government it is up to the csm like any other founders to establish how it as a government is supposed to work if the people represented are not happy with what they the representatives propose they revolt clearly the most popular csm related threads of late are ones calling for the downfall of the representatives or ones mocking iti can understand their desire to get things rolling and jump straight into issues without a constitution or similar document that formalizes how they are supposed to do and what they are supposed to do anything that is attempted in the meantime will be a catastrophe of confusion before they can address issues the csm desperately needs to adopt a founding document such as thisi would be more than happy to provide them with a docrtf copy for easier reading    constitution for the council of stellar management 10 june 2008  article 1 name and purposesection 1 name the name of the organization established by this document shall be council of stellar management to be abbreviated as csmsection 2 purposea the purpose of this constitution is to establish the form function and procedures for the csm as well as any organization created by or for the csmb the purposes of the csm arei to identify the issues of greatest interest or concern to the players of eve online who shall be referred to as the populaceii to evaluate the issues for their impact on and value to the populaceiii to ensure that the ccp council is aware of the most important issues to the populace the level of their importance and their merits

yes there are a lot of words and a constitution by definition is an organized document so i chose to break it into segments for easier reading  and quoting for discussion  i can most definitely assure you i am not an alt of the chairman
so are you in favour of removing the apotheosis shuttle from the game after all you can no longer acquire it how about the rare skills mfo mro sdo and ae those are similarly unobtainable and lets not even get into the unique ships none of them are obtainable ingame today two of them are useful for something other than bragging rights and one class of them is far and away better than any other battleships in existence
all the loudmouths who are screaming for the removal of the t2 bpos from the game how about going here to this thread t2 bpos the future dev blog needed and posting your support for a simple devblog that will nip this in the bud once and for all hui own t2 bpo and i want to hear what the developers actually have to say on the issue or are you all only good for screaming and yelling on the forums and are afraid to actually ask for answers i am not so show some guts and ask for them
sorry but no the argument against t2 bpos is as valid as a bpo holder saying take invention out of the game because it devalues my assets the simple truth is that invention in most cases is often done wrong and quite poorly by those who engage in it  while some inventors churn out 3bill a month easy some make very little because they invent low demandhigh competion items constantly having to fight price wars and drop their sell orders to get their return faster many threads have bee posted on this topic never has one conclusive argument against the existence of t2 bpos been made  remember invention came along to reduce and normalize prices on t2 items for the sake of the consumer it is not meant to be a insta wealth generator  if t2 bposs were removed and invention became a higher proft margin enterprise it would become flooded by the mee too crowd and in the end your profits would be bled off by competition and would in the end mirror the profitability of t1 manufacturing  an inventor has the advantage of volume by being able with a properly funded and laid out production model to out produce the t2 bpo holder and therefore place on more markets simultaneaously  where as the bpo holder is limited to a single output  if anything the advantage lies with the inventor as long as he isnt working piecemeal and is focused on long term sucess  i would suggest you invest your time and energy on reseaching product placement and and production optimisation  but that would involve effort and dedication on your part and tbh that not why this thread was posted  because its obvious that work is exactly what your trying to avoid 
i know this is just going to be ignored by anyone who disagrees but t2 bpos arent competing with invention other inventors are t2 bpos do not produce enough thats why t2 prices were so high before invention inventors flooded on to the scene dropping prices competing with each other t2 bpo owners probably make more profit per ship but a good inventor has much more volume possible and flexibility to shift products if their current project loses profitabilityif all t2 bpos where removed right now the market wouldnt be changed at all
t2 bpos are fine over 95 of them have switched hands countless times alreadynot signed
this is just one of the many things stopping newer players from integrating into the current eve universemake them into 100run bpcs or something instead
actually if the newer players make multi billions of isk they can buy a t2 bpo just like most of the currant holders had to do
only if the current holders want to sell them
current also life isnt fair but the game always needs to balanced ccp has never refrained from changing ships because of peoples investments into them there is no reason to not extend that to other assets nor have they ever not extended that into other assets   there needs to be a sound reason for keeping these assets in the game which give a significant advantage to the old guard which is unnecessary and against the spirit of eve regardless of who currently owns them
that is the attitude of a nerfit houndthere needs to be a very good reason to nerf summat not the other way around 1 the price drop on t2 items ppl are complaining about has come from invention not from bpos 2 the t2 market will not rise in price just because bpos have been removed so this entire idea is about jealousy and how others can make slightly higher profits and anybody who thinks differently is a fool or a liar3 bpo holders sell them on occasion giving those who had the wisdom and foresight to build investment capital the chance to gain one
warning wall of text aheadthe problem with t2 bpos is not related at all to how profitable it may or may not be to own them as i see it the concept has two inherent problems which act to restrict the ability of a new player to integrate into the eve communitythe first and largest problem in my opinion is that the very existence of t2 bpos acts as an unfair barrier to entry into the t2 marketplace as it stands now a new player attempting to enter the market has to either purchase a bpc with a limited number of runs or invent the relevant bpc themselves due to the nature of invention there is a significant amount of isk and time that must be expended in order to enter the marketon the other hand those few who were playing the game back when the t2 lottery was in play simply ran a few missions and were rewarded with free entry into the marketplace if the lottery was still in place this would be less of an issue as it would still be possible to gain the advantage that the older players possess but instead we have a limited number of unlimited run blueprints held by those who were around back in 2004 competing with newer players who have to constantly invest new capital in order to remain in the marketplace this is inherently unfair and it is irrelevant that the bpos are traded they should not exist in the first placethe second problem comes from a lack of continuity in policy behind the eve marketplace the developers have been working to remove their influence on the market for some time now as best seen with the gradual removal of most npcseeded items their policy appears to be that if it can be produced by the players let the players produce it this cannot be done with t2 bpos i cannot go and make more of them even though they unduly influence an item that is produced by the player base this is an issue that has to be dealt withnow how to compensate those holding the bpos is fairly simple because the bpos do get traded from time to time give bpo holders a multirun bpc of whatever item they have plus an amount of isk to compensate for the loss of the bpo ccp would be in essence buying out the bpo holderstldr  t2 bpos act as a barrier to entry into the market and do not follow ccps current actions regarding the market both points serve to discourage new players from integrating into the eve community
an older player without any bpos has to buy into the market as well buddy just like he needs or needed to train skills or earn isk for ships this is not a eve age issue at all wrongjust because ppl have been playing longer does not mean they have access to t2 bpos or the market ive been playing since 2003 and i do not have a t2 bpo or a t1 for that matter unless it drops from somebody wreck
how is it not an age issue the older players had a chance to get t2 bpos via the lottery newer players do not the supply of t2 bpos is limited by this and such a restriction only benefits older players who hold the bpos or can afford to purchase the bpos newer players can either sell gtcs in the hope of getting enough isk to buy one of a limited number of gtcs or go without
your idea of content and rational argument has not changed much has itgo away
what about older players who were not carebear mission runners they  i   are in the same boat as the newer players as i said this is not about age its about jealousy and bitterness as nothing will change if bpos get removed other than nobody ever young or old will get a chance to own one
something needs to be done to level the playing field
the first thing that invention did was crash the t2 market prices this was not the bpo holders or the buyers it was the sellers undercutting each other now a bpo holder may be able to make a bit more profit that a inventor but thats it and its not effecting the inventors one bit unless you count envy and thats no reason to remove summat
their presence in the game only stands to benefit the few who currently possess them all other players young or old are affected by this however the opportunity to own them was only available to the older players the capital needed to purchase them is only available  without selling gtcs   to the older players why shouldnt the bpos be removed from the game is the better questionim not saying that ccp should simply delete all the t2 bpos from the owners hangars they should be properly compensated however the bpos give a distinct competitive advantage to those players who were around when they were being offered and decided to enter the lottery the lottery itself was unfair and the invention system is a better way of handling t2 items why not complete the transition
why remove them and stop younger or older players from ever owning a t2 bpo as these players may not stay poor forever and young players do get older and richer over timet2 bpos do nothing to reduce the profit of inventors as the inventors themselves have already crashed the market prices of t2 items in their haste to make quick profitsthe only thing removing them would serve is to satisfy the jealousy and envy of bitter ppl who have nothing to gain or lose form the removal other than venomous satisfaction
the t2 market before invention was priced the way it was because there were so few actors in the market the prices dropped drastically because invention allowed drastically more people to enter the market more supply  constant demand  lower prices fairly basic economicsthis does not excuse the fact that t2 bpo holders still have a major competitive advantage over those who gain bpcs via invention their advantage is that they did not have to expend the capital and time in the invention process to gain their bpo due to the nature of the bpo they will never have to jump through these hurdles to remain in the marketeveryone else must continually invent new bpcs in order to remain in the market this is in and of itself unfair while in the long run the advantage of holding a bpo as opposed to a bpc may be only a few percentage points more of profit this adds up quickly in the highly competitive market in empire profit margins are razorthin as it is the bpos only serve to make the rich richer
exactly t2 bpos have had no effect on the profits of inventors these profits have declined due to a now abundance of supply and that is 100 due to inventiontotal rubbishbefore invention ppl were buying t2 products from a few areas and transporting them across empire or into low sec or 00 to make profit from the markup they added now they just invent the stuff themselves to make a profit and save themselves the traveling another load of rubbishthe market is thin because so many ppl invent and if so many are doing it then it must be profitable now a bpo holder may be able to make a little more isk per sale but the fact is that he has zero effect at all on the inventors profit margins in the game as they are already saturating the market and would not be doing that if it was not worth iti do not claim that bpo holders do not have a slight advantage but the fact is that the advantage does not negativity effect inventors in any way so complaining about it is just sour grapes and thats pathetic petty and non issue as far as a removal is concerned
if invention is good enough for me its good enough for t2 bpo holders
thats hardy a good reason to remove summat from the game and lets face it goons were good enough for you
actually inventors hold a competitive advantage over bpo holders inventors can invent and build from multiple bpc at once so run full factory slots churning out more product per given time period than a bpo holder the bpo holder unless she has multiple copies of a bpo is stuck with a limited production per given time period over time the inventor has the edge since they sell more and hence end up with more iskies even given slightly lower profit per item its a volume effect i know players who have only ever invented and made 10s of bils in a year more than owning a copy of the bpo would have yeilded in the same timetake carearithron
oh man a joke about my alliance gosh i have been totally wrecked hereits a perfectly good reason hell ccp has changed far more important things for much worse reasons so it doesnt take much
well said bud unfortunately the cry babies never see this or add it into their equations they only see that the single bpo can mathematical make a cheaper item on occasion the larger picture eludes them in their haste to run to the forum crying about it
im against t2 bpos because much like jade they are extremely imbalanced and their very existence causes unnecessary conflict
t2 bpos should have been removed when invention was released the fact that they still exist probably proves some ccp devs have a large stash of them that they dont want to give upt2 bpos are not available to the new player anymore new players are completely at the mercy of older players if they even wish to purchase one at a ridiculously inflated price its dumb and the only people supporting keeping them have private t2 bpos that they have been making money on since the beginning of time its time to kill off a bad idea once and for all
bpo holders are only limited in their production if and only if they choose to opt out of invention holding a bpo doesnt prevent them from inventing t2 bpcs the issue with the bpo comes from the fact that once you get the bpo you never lose production from it it tilts the market in favor of the bpo holder because he can play by the same rules as everyone else and come out ahead every single timea bit of an example to try to clarify my point we have two producers both of whom have equal skill in their production and invention skills both are producing vagabonds however one of them has a bpo for this item while the other does not this bpo lets him produce 2 in one run the other player must rely on invention and bpcs which nets him 2 per bpcas the second producer can have many bpcs in production you may think that he has the comparative advantage he can produce many more vagabonds than his competitor with the bpo can using only his bpo he can only produce 2 vagabonds in the same time the inventor can produce 2x vagabonds x is the number of bpcs he successfully inventsbut wait why cant the bpo holder also use invention to get vagabond bpcs as well he can put in just as much effort as the inventor yet he will always be able to produce more than the person without the bpo he changes the formula from 2 versus 2x to 2 2x   bpo  bpcs versus simply 2x the bpo holder always wins in this scenario unless he gets lazythat is why it is an unfair competitive advantage and that is why the bpos need to be removed from the game
there is no competitive advantage to owning a bpo as they do not reduce the profit of inventors at all the difference between the two builders profit in your example is utterly insignificant when you consider the scale on which you are trying to apply it yes the bpo holder can make slightly more profit but in no way do bpos reduce the profits that a inventor can make so to remove them out of spite cos a few ppl who invested billions to buy them can do so is a petty and pathetic act of jealousy
old players have an unfair advantage well thats nothing new they have more sp more isk more blueprints more of everything but thats how eve worksi never won any bpo on the lottery so im not saying this to save my own skin its simply a fact about eve its not fairthat said i wouldnt mind if there was a few more bpo added to even things out maybe a really small chance of getting one when inventing a bpc i just dont think its going to happen
a producer who holds a bpo has by definition a competitive advantage over the nonbpo holding producerthe valuecreating position here is that pesky t2 bpo the holder of said bpo will always have an advantage no matter how slight over anyone who doesnt the manner in which they were given out was somewhat arbitrary as i understand it and this process went out the door when invention was introduced into the game what we have now is a source of guaranteed income for those who happen to possess a t2 bpo yes one can spend an inordinate amount of money to purchase a t2 bpo well not inordinate but actually the total lifetime value of possessing the bpo but thats just going back into intermediate microeconomics for me and i really dont want to go there right now anyways the scale of the advantage created by holding the t2 bpo is completely irrelevant they serve only to destabilize the market in favor of those who were either lucky enough to earn one via the lottery or had the resources available to purchase one the invention system was designed to make the bpos irrelevant and i will agree that it largely has why not eliminate the final vestige of the t2 lottery it only serves to benefit a few i am not suggesting that those people with the bpos should simply lose them they should be compensated for the value of the bpo they should not however continue to hold onto said bpo ccp is currently attempting to render as much control of the market as possible over to the player base and the t2 bpo is one final aspect of developer interference on the market that should be done away with this is not a petty and pathetic act of jealousy this is basic economic theory    i have not broken new ground in advocating against outside interference in the marketplace yes holders of the bpos have gained from this interference no they arent responsible for the interference in the first place no they should not be punished for their gains yes they should be compensated in full for the loss of the bpoif the holders of the bpos really benefit as little as is claimed from their possessions then why do they sell for so much isk why wouldnt they be willing to give them up as has been claimed in this thread there is no real benefit from hanging on to them so why not get rid of them
we all know about jita and how crowded it is this is a proposal on how to at least decrease the traffic congestionirl a lot of cities have ring roads roads that go around the city like a ring to help prevent congestion in the citythe problem with jita is that if youre traveling in caldari space you have to pass through jita weather you want to or not to reach a lot of places i would gladly jump an extra jump around jita than having to jump into jitathere are enough people who have business in jita no need to further increase traffic by forcing people to pass through a choke point when they dont need tothis would not change that jita is the defacto center of the universe jita would still be jita but at least those who dont want to go into jita could go around itjump connections are added and taken away in patches  were some changes to the recent patch   so it could certainly be donethank you for your time
the agents for fw should give missions much more in line with their supposed divisions unlike regular corp agents but all the agents seem to be giving is kill missions over long distances it would be nice to see these new missions be a bit more focused toward player skill specializations so things like a surveillance agent giving a job for a cove ops to do a scan and bring back important intel or flying a stealth bomber to deliver a special payload or just something that is a bit more removed from straight combat and ship fitting juggling or missions for blockade runners in transport ships and the likei just think with how much it takes to win a war outside of battles and combat such as intell  counter intell and logistics fw can reflect that with its missions
supportedcan just see it now going to a highsec logistics agent to be toldwe need 50 200mm autocannons delivered to x system y station asap i dont care how you get them or where you get them just get them theremission reward x faction points  towards control in the lowsec destination system  bonus 1000000 iskedit perhaps a good idea might be to only generate a certain number of these supply runs per day  however if the supply runs are failing to get through to the destination system then the faction that is being supplied will begin to lose ground in the systemso to maintain your momentum in a given system you need to organise the supply runs carefully otherwise you may be winning the battles in the system but not winning the war as vital supplies wont be getting through
quoting roberts rules or something similar  point of informationnine people  piz
with the power to vote people into office there absolutely needs to be the power to remove them from office if a goon were chairman there would be absolutely no question about a vote of no confidence clause passing
amen fully supportgetting a group of people with opposing viewpoints especially passionate people with opposing viewpoints and who dont necessarily like each other to work together and is a lot harder than it looks  this i know from experience   cut the csm reps some slackoh and theres no such thing as a motion or vote of no confidence in roberts rules some parliaments and other legislative bodies have adopted the concept and it makes very nice fictional drama but in practice it tends to be used frivolously and prevents anything from getting doneill now hypocritically suggest that we forget about these ridiculous threads and get back to the business of suggesting and discussing improvements to the game
i disagree anthony from what i have seen i am fairly confidant that had a goon been voted in as chair the same problem would be present and there would possibly be more of a cry for removal for the simple fact that goons have a reputation there would be a committee arguing about procedure with no time to actually do so whoever the chair was be it a goon or not would be stepping in and doing what they feel was needed in order to keep the meeting on track or in the case of the end of meeting 3 what was needed to end the meeting with everything clear however in terms of actual game issues i dont think anything would be different
jf  rp partisans supporting their own thread instead of my more elegant and parsimonious proposal shamefulshameful
thats pretty much what i said i support no confidence votes and i think theyre important in any democraticallyelected body
oh hey a star fraction post in support of jade constantine
there is already a mechanic for this at the end of the term if you dont like your csms or chairperson you elect not to elect them again
there will never be a formal noconfidence mechanic on the csm the closest you will get to this will be an electable chair where you might be able to harangue a sitting chair to stand again for reelection mid term for good or ill we are stuck with the csm reps elected this time around and the first opportunity the eve electorate will have to remove those chosen will be the vote for the next session in the autumn the sooner this sinks in the sooner well have this assembly hall back for serious issues rather than spurious muckhurling
is there a list you could provide the public with other mechanicsvotes that you will not allow a lot of ideas being thrown around here and most of them are null and void and nobody realizes it
well its a good thing you elected us to be the voters so you can have no confidence in your choice ohwai
when was this voted on did i miss reading one of the csm meetings
i think people would drop all of this if you would just admit to getting carried away and promise not to do so in the future a sign of a trustworthy person is their willingness to admit their own mistakes stop being such a  upalso as someone who doesnt believe this council will actually effect the game in any way regardless you are further ruining its chances by playing king of a meaningless little castle
the purpose of a chairman is to direct meetings in an orderly fashion and act as an informal representative of the body as a whole you instead have chosen to be an arbiter taking your scant majority as a mandate to act as a decider and to hold power over the other members of the council everybody wants to start talking about game issues but your pathetic and powerhungry attempts to control the debate have paralyzed the body
i am intrigued to know upon what you base your authority to declare what the elected representatives of the players may and may not discussi cant remember the bit in the csm document where you were given the power to rule by fiatwhile your soapoperameltdown and blatant malfeasance is pretty hilarious you are an obstacle to getting sensible improvements in the game brought to the attention of the devs
i would ask you to read my post again i voiced no support of any council member in paticular in fact a large portion of my post was intended to give people some perspective on the goons to shed some positive light on the goons who are on the council so i think you misenturpret my sentament if i could restate your words accuratly i would state the folowting oh hey a star fraction post in support of individuals in goonswarm has a slightly differen ring to it eh as far as jade constantine is concerned i do not feel that everything jade has done in council chambers is in line with the way i would have run things jade made statements in meeting 3 that i see as emotionally driven and counterproductive to the process this however is something that every one of the council members have done this is something that anyone in their position be it chair or member would have done honestly i am amased that it hasnt happened more this is a testament to the stregnth of our council and the dedication they are putting forward josiah do not let your pettyness and simplicity get in the way of rational thought jade is doing the things nessesary to keep this council on track for the record i take no issue with jades use of muting oh and before you call this post a star fraction post in support of jade constantine let me make this as clear as it can be i am an individual i support the entire council
hmm posted by a star fraction member did jade ask for backup
facepalm
bad idea 5 is bad enough expensive implants are keeping people in highsec because they are afraid of loosing them and no way a new player can afford 6 or 7
i would love 6s i approve this thread
zoing looks like this is in the wrong forum can a moderator move this to the correct oneissue that standing orders and constitutional makeupare to be discussed at the next available meetingformal reading of this proposal this is a single issue document that requests consideration of formal standing rules and a consideration of issues brought up by the constitution  in absense of formal constitution read
addendum to issue discussion pointson rereading the minutes some issues have already been aparently resolved feel free to discard points if they have been formally resolved to majority council satisfaction
please add to the discussion what is the formal quorum for a meeting and for a decision ie how many abstains make the issue unresolved noting the conventional interpretation of an abstain as meaning i neither support or dissent the conventional wisdom of the interaction of an abstain with a majority is  majority  number of ayes   membership count  abstains      05 where   membership count  abstains    quorum   is this the formula being to be used or will the council invent a new formula
heres a draft of what a standing orders document might look likestanding orders for the procession of csm meetingsorders conatained within the ccp scope document1   that the attendance quorum be 7 members2   that an issue must be available for comment for 7 days prior to the meeting and be aproved by either 5 of player base or a member of the csm3   that an issue may remain as long as necesary to obtain either approval or disaproval an approved issue must be escalated to ccp4   aproval takes the form of a simple majority for an issue to pass ayes must outnumber naes an abstain is not counted as a nae1  add others as deduced from the document  voted on standing orders5   an alternative candidate may start participating at the point a candidate becomes absent and must yield when the candidate returns2 add others as needed  ideas for standing orders6   at any point a csm member can propose a vote on an issue of standing orders this vote halts the progress of the meeting which does not proceed till the issue is resolved the chair is compelled to follow the vote  this is pretty standard stuff with meetings  7   any move to mute a member must be subject to a simple majority vote which would include the proposed mutee the mutee must be permitted to address the motion  strike suggestion 8 it contradicts simple majority by implying absolute  suggestion on meeting protocolduring a meeting for someone to take the floor they should say something like floor or even an x they go onto a queue and take turns as per the queueif a person wants to directly address a point they should say something like addressing person name they are put onto the top of the queue after the current speaker this must only be used to address a specific persons comments  for instance to correct a mistake   anything else is outside of process for the purpose of decorum other members must be addressed via the chair  for instance  instead of darius i think xyz you jerk you might say chair i submit that i disagree with darius and think xyz   addresses to the chair however might be addressed directly to the council council i submit the chair is incorrect on this matter for reasons xyza motion on meeting procedure constitutional matters or standing issues however interupts the current meeting and thus takes precedent even over the current floor speaker  ie objection chair xyz is speaking outside the scope i vote we move on a vote then ensues   when a speaker has finished  he should indicate with an end or something like that1 note in formal terms a simple majority is defined as a vote where more ayes are recorded than nayes an abstain does not count as a nae where an abstain is called a nae this is refered to as absolute majority ccp states clearly this is not the case this would appear to resolve the issue of the status of abstain votes2 unresolved the principles of simple majority state that a vote can be reversed in the agregate positive this would imply a member can revert the vote of an alternative but its a bit ambiguous does the csm agreeyoud have to fill in the blanks and reorganise it but i think the above would pretty much satisfy everyone think about it csm reps something like the above would be a pretty classy framework thats based on traditional meeting procedure and address everyones concerns  particularly regarding orderly meeting behavior and it would permit the chair to exercise his role whilst allowing the csm members a mechanism to reject a chairs ruling  
look a all dem posts and words
moved to assembly hall
cool with that
thanks mitnal its a bit embarassing to do all them words and then screw it up by posting it in the wrong forum  please take the time to read what ive writen i believe it neatly solves the current problems with the council by making the chair accountable to the membership whilst providing a mandate for the chair to function
personally i think having the csm ask ccp to actually do what they should have done from day one and write the csm a proper set of cast iron procedural rules rather than turning over yet another session of the csm to this a csm that votes itself power only leads to power block voting and disperate factions within the csm fighting each other for control which is something i dont believe ccp wanted particularly
ive drafted a basic constitution for the council of stellar management based on the ccp proposal pdf and placed it in an independant thread
i have the feeling this will be resolved some other way but good work on drafting these sorts of things guys it looks nicely organized and it would be great if there were some recognized order to followalthough like heartstone said id think that would need to come from ccp to be viewed as authoritative thumbs up nonetheless
dippins theres some excelent ideas in there i think we need to keep the proposal simple and basically dependant on the original documentswhat we have o work with is pretty simple1   simple majority voting a very specific idea look it up on wikipedia2   a limited scope3   a very loose mandate of how the council works now by my reckoning that means what is needed is more a concept of how a meeting should run such that we keep a sense of civility between the diferent personalities and such that two objectives can be meta   jades responsibility to keep the council orderly andb   the councils right to full unimpeded rights to speechit would seem the reason  a   and  b   conflict is a lack of standing orderergo what we need is a standing orders document thats simple comprehensible with minimal scope for conflicting interpretaion but most importantly a canonical document to refer procedural debates tojades job should be mechanical and predictable if any member can not work out if an action is permisable then something is wrong jade must thus make a call  and nobody is to blame if they disagree if this occurs something is wrong with the procedure
i agree in principle but in practicality the csm has been formed with no real standing orders its not unusual as a public servant i see it all the time but honestly experience says get this  out of the way first and itll never be a problem again this council experiences pain so the following ones have a clear mandate what we used to do in my days on the local council was make sure a lawyer had ratified standing orders so we didnt need to  prior to committee forming   but this hasnt happened here so i guess we gotta do it ourselfplease take this seriously guys itll save heartache later on
wonderfull having something like this from the beginning would have made this run alot smoother we didnt have this so its good to make it
tldr after the first post but what i read was good
this forum was never intended to be a replacement for the features and ideas forum all the topics in this forum are faling on deaf ears the csm are the only forum members that should have start new topic rights in this assembly hall forum everyone else should have reply to topic permissionsthis whole assembly hall forum needs the vast majority of its topics deleted and the permission masks set
yes this would be a great idea alt only the people who can silence people should be able to start topics and by extension vote on them  a majority of 1 if you willidiot
actually no it shouldnt this is where the people represented by the csm make formal requestsproposals for them to considerits like going to a town council meeting to present a petition or we to the council members in the case of eve if we actually attended one of their meetings it would get flooded with so many lines of text in chat it would be impossible to read for the council  or anyone else for that matter  
a pointless and pathetic post idioti can see your point but this is quintessential for a rethink for this forum since this forum is clustered with threads we all know should belong in features and ideas the csm should pick ideas that have already been discussed and then open a debate in this forum
but the  widely presumed because there is nothing official currently   role of the csm is to identify the topics of greatest interstimportance to the community and ensure that ccp is aware of the issue and its merits much like a lobyist ccp is perfectly capable of figuring it out for themselves the representatives just throw themselves in the line of fire to make sure the message is getting across
isnt this reason for the csm to pick topics on these forums and then start the debate here
no heres a quote on the function of this forum ill highlight the most pertinent section ccp has established how they want the csm to present issues to them as well in two reports and a facetoface presentation all delivered by the csm
thank you for that quote i have bolded a pertinent point as we can see that many of the topics presented on this forum are clearly not relevant since they should be directed the features and ideas forum this should be reason for a moderator to at redirect many of the threads that have been startedthis isnt something that can be regulated easily if at all
features and ideas can be important issues too
yes and many topics on this forum should be moved to features and ideas to be hammered out before bringing them to this forum
theres actually supposed to also be a resolved for debate area or something like that where issues that have been passed by the council go for further player discussion  its mentioned in the longer csm document but i guess that one never made it into practice
disagree with op but thisis good stuff
i propose the council immediately back jade as emperor for life jade clearly has will and strength to rule and he doesnt take crap from any one i propose the council promote our chairman to emperor with a life term the charter does not prevent this we must give our strength to this great man as soon as possibleccp should also build a new jovian titan class ship call it an an executor and make it the floating home of our new galactic emperor jade
you have to post again to support your own topic
is this the sarcasm thread im in
sounds good to me can i have a secret order of latex nun shock troops to assassinate my political enemies while they sleep as well please
dohl is right and this idea is brilliant you should all back it
once we commit you as emperor life the power will be unimaginable jade
as with all born and raised europeans i feel we need to consolidate as much power as possible to in to a single person doing this only greases the wheels of the democratic process i support this
well now that the op has supported his own topic weve got at least one european on board and the person to be named emperor has indicated they would acceptfull support
i see youve got an idea for your next sm roleplay ready to go
definately supportednow that is out of the way can someone give me a lift to the tashi station so i can pick up some power converters
you have to stay for the harvest sorry oz
supported as long as anyone can mute him
not supported because palpatine kicked samuel l jacksons ass and no mere mortal can kick samuel l jacksons ass not even chuck norris
but uncle kelsin all my friends will be there
wow does this thread suck
will support if jade goes 10even for just an hour
only if jade can prove himself by getting the monster truck issue through
technically the csm can only make suggestions to ccp though i guess if you could get ccp to agree that all titans needed to be changed to look like monster trucks you would probably deserve the chair for life
i guess the star fraction will be getting a few war deccs in the days to come who are they anyway
fingers crossed id love to think chairing the csm would get us free wardecs  my corp would love it
t h e e x e c u t o r
csm procedure is not a valid issue here if by the fourth meeting it isnt crystal clear that even token discussion is more valid than the vicissitudes of backup voting reelecting csm chairs after election and other waffle then your suggestions are meaningless anyway gameplay issues or get out
ill support this with two caveats one any csm issues that actually need to go to ccp  eg changing the 5 rule  should still be here two all the other stuff should still be encouraged on jita park these are legitimate issues theyre just in the wrong place
i disagree herschelthese issues are important to the overall efficiency of the csm think of procedural issues as learning skillsthey dont do anything directly useful for the game initially but they make all other meetings more efficient thus in the long term more gets done and like learning skills these things should be done at the beginning  while still doing enough that effects the game  again these issues are important and need to be discussed by the committee this is the place where we can show support for procedure
problem spotted
im hardly against procedural issues  on the contrary i feel like ive spent the last three days talking nothing but procedure here i just dont think assembly hall is the right place for them since theyre not petitions to ccp theyre petitions to the csm in their own right and as such they should go in jita park which has become the de facto csm business forum since the campaign finished
a procedural thread was just moved to this section of the forums by a mod strange huh
this indicates the mods suffer from the same fundamental lack of understanding as to what the csm is and what this forum is for as the players do it does not indicate that my point is invalid
no need for all these changes to mwdswebs and ws just add mid range weapons that can do slighty less damage then short range but has a better rof then long range
first off i am going to say that medium ranged combat is fairly common especially with the proliferation of hacs and the locus rig bug the most powerful ships for most all types of small to medium gang combat are high dps medium ranged shipsit doesnt exist everywhere it doesnt exist in empire and lowsec due to gate guns but it certainly does exist in 00second off i am going to reply to thisthat is the entire point smaller ships being effected by longer range webs worse encourages smaller ships to get closer to larger targets rather than farther away that is to say you have an advantage in getting into situations where you cannot as easily run away rather than having an advantage in staying in situations where you can easily run away doing something like changing webs in the proposed ways however is probably something that should not be done yet if its done at all its a huge change to the game and would mean massive upheavals in optimal fittings that might not be a bad thing because everyone loves theory crafting but it is also something that would need to be tested throughly because figuring out all the interactions we would be looking at would simply be too difficult without testing it out and tweaking it to be right and getting it right is better than ruining an entire style of combat which by ccps record wont be fixed for 12 yearsfurthermore i do not trust the current csm to give any such topic the required community discussion regarding the disadvantages and advantages that it would need to be properly refined with both reservations and purpose
his suggestion of requiring a nonnpc corp to use bargesexhumers is meant to deter macro miners i can see how you would think it would be a nerf thoughaside from that what other things would be a nerf new types of ore would be nice system wide roid fields would be awesome  more to mine   and roid fields to scan down mean you could have more valuable ore in the fields that not everybody could find
loot ownership is stupid whoever loots it should get it a great way for newbies to build up assets is to go around stealing loot and i think it should be encouraged
tier 2 m8 not tech 2 meaning not much higher in cost a tiny bit more training  eg requires lvl 3 of the skill instead of lvl 1but who only trains dread to 1   kinda like tier 1 is dominix tier 2 is megathron tier 3 is hyperion tech 2 is kinda out of the question due to what you just stated
yeah it is true darius your overt attempts to play politics with the council and vote away powers and positions you dont like is a big part of me realizing that any csm involving this sort of personality mix cannot be allowed to change its own constitution in a significant way some of us are trying to make the process work  youre out there playing junta for the fun of trying to fix the system again well consider me convinced ive learned that we are going to have to stick to playersubmitted issues only since any sniff of changing the constitution is going to have your trying to vote yourself increased holidays and tin stars to differentiate you from the alternates ultimately whatever you dont like me darius i dont like you we represent opposite sides of this game from the ground up we can cast votes on gameplay issues  we cant however be trusted to make collective decisions about the csm process in and of itself still at least we got some good issues on the table got to look on the bright side
its fortunate the chair isnt given the power to make such decisions
its like each time your defense fails you just reach into a grab bag of excuses cross your fingers and throw it out there hoping itll stick
the difference being one of us plays by the rules as established and one throws a temper tantrum and insinuates that they can change them by dictatorial fiat whenever they realize theyll lose game hasnt changed for me its now officially gone from a council to the jade constantine hour congrats
who are you to state my motives i want this csm thing to work and find it abhorrent that jade is abusing the process at every turn it doesnt matter if jade did what he thought was appropriate that is the entire point what jade did was not appropriateeveryone on the other side of the issue is looking for a resolution the problem is that they are not looking for the resolution that jade wants because the resolution that jade wants involves creating powers out of thin air and letting jade run roughshod over the rights of all council membershell jade even says it in flat language for us i assure you i have every intention of being the very best representative i can be for those players that voted for my manifesto and want the kind of eve i talked about therethere is another one here on this board where she flatly refuses to deal with anyone who doesnt agree with her
you havent seen me lose my temper darius old boy cheer up at least well get some decent issues through you should actually drop kelsin a line about that 00 sovereignty revamp he might be able to help you with the write up
you were clearly in control in the meeting according to the logs and the requisite email tantrums im afraid much like your inability to admit any fault whatsoever or wrongdoing you also do not recognize when you are losing your cool f13net ring any bells that whole conversation looks familiar for some reason perhaps because its every single one you have if youre cool with ccp allowing this to turn into a joke  and by joke i mean your continued attempts at lordship   im sure everyone else will enjoy their trips to iceland to learn about icelandic democracy
dear god jade is mad hes abolished the senate and declared martial law the chinese are invading isanity
and my dog died and my time was stolen and my gf left and my house burned down  and 100 over terrible things the goons seem to think   makes you think doesnt it maybe internet spaceships really are serious business
yes we have
jade please post the emails you sent to the other csms including their subject line so that everyone can see how you were calm and collected at all times
fly away troll
who is kelsin
one of jades cronies its ironic because sf actually doesnt hold sovereignty anywhere while darius corpalliance holds huge amounts of space
the guy who thinks we should have sovereignty by sitting on gates another one of jades blind followersthis guy
wow i just read that thread and it is possibly the worst idea i have ever heard regarding potential sov changes it cant be serious
yaunless this guy has some alts or something a guy playing less than a year in a empire corp really isnt going to know whats going on is he jade are you trolling darius or somethingive lived in 00 for a year now and im still hazy on some of the issues
star fraction are pretty keen on changing sov mechanics as clearly they are the only thing holding star fraction back from becoming the mighty pvp empire they obviously deserve to be
they would obviously be the next gsratcfbobaaa if only they werent being held back by current sov mechanics it has nothing at all to do with who they are right
so basically you withdraw that statement i wonder how even your own corpmates can stand behind such an obvious liar they should be ashamed
i think they are alts not corpmates
hii expect darius has plenty of ideas for writing up how to pitch it to ccp but simple though the actual topic is if for some reason hes into collaborating im up for itandbroken recordwhile capturing stargates is an interesting jumping off point for a wild revamp of sovereignty thats not what darius is writing upand he already knows thatetc etci love you goonskelsin
you will never get a dramatic change to the sov system like that though ccp anyways they would never spend the timeeffort
i get why you say that butand ive said this a lot recentlyccp nozh actually posted something pretty similar beforehand and my example was just based off of that his version is linked in the op of one of those two links goum postedso my thing was a relatively small variation on something theyre already working on  hence the csm proposal to inquire as to how that revamp theyre already working on was comingdont shoot the messenger im fragile
sorry if i missed it but you guys still havent answered the question many here have asked why dont you use a forum and instead insist on chat based communication although its general consensus that chats are a very inefficient method for the discussion of complex matters and only get worse the more people are involvedits really baffeling to me i know you use forums to manage communication within your respective alliances so why not for the csmaside from that haggling about procedural matters is the norm and the exception in politics as ccp unfortunately hasnt defined a constitution for the csm procedure id guess that we will witness some more haggling in the future until the csm decides upon their own constitutionid recommend joining your local chapter of the political party of your choice if you dont believe me or any other political quasi political organization like a unionlike a fellow  rl   party member once told me after i asked her why so much time is wasted on procedural matters on each meeting procedure is power my friend it allows you to define the agenda and the agenda is the cornerstone of the political process
when did it change from that to you interpreting the csm documentation and having veto power
they are supposed to use the forum for the discussion threads but are skirting the line by considering the issue threads adequate discussionthey are using evechat as a communication manner for the meetings because ccp and the csm document require it in order to officially record the meetings or something but the point is that they dont have a choice in the latter  
when people didnt obey him as their lord and saviour
the first time a vote was called to prevent it
im rather annoyed at the lack of any actual worthwhile discussions on topicsi mean seriously  saying oh weve got this issue well talk to ccp about it is bs  discuss the issue discuss solutions discuss why its an issue or dont even bring it up in the first placeextending aggro timer  variable aggro timer was something that had a 2page thread which did not get any meaningful discussion off csms  and had dissenting voices explaining why aggro timers are fine   and they all said aye without saying why are aggro timers a problem and discussing wether they should be changed just saying aye mehfurthermore the issues like oh wardecs lets talk to ccp about wardecs without discussion wether wardecs are broken why are wardecs broken etc is totally lolfurthermore people abstaining from votes are just lol you were not selected to not give a damn  and someone can push an issue  potentially a bad one   further with just one vote since nobody cares about it dont forget you were elected by the playerbase i assume most people didnt vote so you can say i dont give a damn about important issuesjade did a world of discussing in the thread oh yeah i support it is not a discussion particularly and specifically not when its posted by one of the csm guys and advancing a unpopular topic just because you like it  with a number of other topics far more popular not being discussed   means youre only pushing your personal agenda rather then being a medium for the players to communicate with ccp
i think youll find i expressed an opinion on one of the threads on the topic currently there is a problem with the docking timer being abused by welltanked battleships  and capitals   being able to engage in combat and then deaggress and redock to avoid significant counterattack this problem was caused by general increase in ship hit points over several incremental patches designed to specifically to lengthen combat while there has been a failure to lengthen redockjump aggression timers by a similar degree outcome is that station dock range  stargate range   fighting is currently overpowered since in the environment of increased hit points for all ships it becomes too difficult to destroy targets in the limited aggression window this encourages overblobbing as the only way to inflict sufficient damage on the target before it docks and has the knockon effect of discouraging any combat at allquestion will ccp development agree this is a problem and will they commit to increasing dockredockgate aggression timers to be in line with general ship hit point buffs since castor roughly this would involve lengthening timers to 23x their current valueadditional related question can we have a visual countdown of dockredockgate aggression timer on our user interface pleasein raising the issue document for the iceland agenda several discussions in several threads will be summarized and the decent ideas listed please dont jump to the conclusion that just because ive typed yeah support in one of several duplicate threads i havent made substantive comment in one of them
marius duvall saiddoing an andy cruse became the accepted term for walls of text that sapped your will to livei think most of you know that he was right
as a whole the csm are a waste of time and totally focused on self promotion and private interest and not the best interests of the general eve subscriberif you read the minutes then you will see that it is nothing but a political power struggle to either replace daytime soups or hype their illusionary position as a decision maker in evecomments by some members to describe issues like the player base being lazy when it is obvious that they dont even know about the subject they are talking about is an initial good exampleoutright rejection of adding any content to the game based on it use in a solo playstyle obviously shows who you represents pretty clearlyrather then gathering and talking as a group focused on bettering the world of eve all one has to do is read their minutes and see they are nothing but a publicity stunt  as some have called it though i tried not to believe   or self interest group that has been given license and a personal forum by the eve staffit is not that hard to just sit down and rationally discuss items that may or may not need ccps attention but you cant even do that you run huge corps but cant stop waisting the time of the general population of eve with your infighting and power mongering long enough to have one sane meetingone meetinggiven your various positions in large guilds i find it hard to believe this is unintentionalmany of the csm members are part of an organization that has sworn to actualy destroy eve your organization or at least their leaders have made these statements of their own free will so please dont come here and say otherwiseruining a route of communication and problem solving directly connected to the player base would seem a good startand saying that is not what you are up to is like running down the street with a chainsaw saying you were gunna kill everyone and then saying i didnt mean it when the people dont unlock their doors to let you inyou have been electedbut it can be argued that if the votes were counted up and compared to the player base you represent then the results would correlate with who was elected pretty well i am not saying wether it is true or not but it could be successfully argued given the evidenceyou csm members have had several meetings to actually do your jobs and have no proof that you are actually focusing on the needs of the players of eve or that you have done anything to promote their needs understand their issues or expand the player experience to new players or oldalmost every communication between the csms is a cat fightthe minutes of the csm meetings are childish fights and when issues are discussed it seems most of the csm either dont care dont want to waste the time on the issue or activily oppose it because of some hidden agendayou can not have members who have stated they want to destroy the game on a council ment to improve and better ityou can not have leaders of large corps who publicly denounce a viable playstyle also be the people who represent its best intereststhe do not represent the general player basethey do not represent the best interests of evethey do not represent the general eve player anyone or anything outside their own interests for themselves or their corpsccp never intended these guys to be eitherthey dont care about the general player base only the large subscription blocksproofthey had allowed these self same corps to use third party programs unmolested but when one of those self same programs gets released to the general public it is a problem they fix immediately large corps can use programs that are considered wrong if the general public uses them and ccp admitted they have known about it for a whileno the csm are simply reps of the biggest subscription blocksnot the representative of the general eve player basenot representative of the best interests of eveonline the game and communitya daytime soup and game
crossposting another goonalso as another goon said we dont want to ruin the game we want to ruin your game
main post is a mess but if im understanding you correctly your biggest beef is that you feel that the general player base is not being represented properly by people you perceive to be just alliance leaders with their own agendas is that a decent enough summarypersonally i dont care if the whole council was goonswarm or band of brothers or my own comrades as long as theyre able to take issues raised in the csm forums which gain popular approval and take them to ccp that seems to be the case of whats happening there are lists of issues that are going to get talked about and those issues came from the forumsso if theres a failure somewhere of issues reaching their attention guess whos shoulders that gets laid uponthe real test is how those issues are presented to ccp if the people being assigned the issues do their job and bone up on the subject at hand and present it not as an opinionated blowhard but as a representative of the community im happy thats where the real test of the process will occur
the key question that council members must consider before casting their vote is whether or not the issue at hand has the potential to improve or otherwise benefit the entire eve society and not just a select group within the community that was successful in bringing attention to their unique case seeing the big picturein this case the needs of a society with over 220000 individuals is the primary responsibility of a csm representativefrom the csm summary paper nothing wrong with the idea of the csm so long as they adhere to the structures put in place by ccp many of the issues fail the italicised part above many more will fail if the csm council keep considering their job is to just bring numerous issues to the ccp meetings without discussing them fully beforehand in meetings from the chatlogs i see little discussion or debate on many of the issues raised the same could be said for many issues on the forum i have been urging csm members to look at the structures carefully to make sure they are fully aware of their remit and the structure they work within i think much of the infighting and confusion stems from stepping outside this remit and a misunderstanding of the purpose of how and what the csm actually is forbruce hansen
to a degree i agree with you white ronin i did expect some degree of political maneuvering and headbanging in advance i did see a danger of the appointees of big alliance blocks becoming poor csms and said as much during the campaign  but i had hoped wed be able to get by that with some simple decisions on interpretation of csm docs and spend our time discussing the issues instead it has turned into a straight powerplay slug fest with the least and simplest issue of chair moderation launching 1001 threads and sparking the most ridiculous histrionics ive seen in many years on these forums and many csm reps involved in actively stoking the flames rather than showing collective responsibility to the organizations best interests so im now convinced that the csm should not be allowed to rewrite the founding rules with its current composition because frankly  i dont trust people involved to make the decisions without selfinterest and political bias coloring their votes in order for us to actually get down the business we were elected to do  actually considering substantive player issues and bringing them to ccp attention we are going to need a full and unambiguous guide to how the council offices work how the meetings work how moderation works what sanctions can exist for handling bad behaviour in meetings all this stuff is going to need spelling out and underlining in a position document from ccp because at the moment any ambiguity in the process is being seized on by opportunistic forces trying to subvert the process of the councilour biggest failure as a collective body is the way more effort has been put into factional infighting on the council than actually reading and casting informed votes on issues i too was absolutely disappointed with the outcome of the exploration vessel vote white ronin and its shameful what we spent more time discussing a motion to allow csm reps to come and go in meetings and contradicting the stated role of alternates than we did on supporting a gameplay profession and focus for solo players and people interested in exploration calling solo players lazy for not bringing friends was shocking and im going to apologize for the fact that happened  it was inappropriate and insulting and is not the kind of language the csm should be usingbut im going to try to put this right ive started by making a ruling that all potential changes to the constitutionfounding documents must be raised in the form of documented issues and join the queue with the rest for ccp approval i hope this will stop these things clogging up the beginning of meetings ank has gone a step further with a motion effectively saying we should agree that we have no say on these changes and ccp must be asked for a ruling on all issues of interpretationchange of the documentation at the moment though you are right its a warzone and it has to stop i would like here and now to call on my fellow csm reps to stop briefing against each other publicly and privately  we shouldnt be fighting over matters of procedure on the forums and we definitely shouldnt be taking disagreements over meeting moderation to the court of public debate nothing will come of this except noise and mob stupidity no good result will arise all that will be achieved by playing politics at the expense of fellow csm reps will be less time for substantive discussion of gameplay issues anyone carrying on this behaviour should stop immediatelyi still think this can recovered but yes we do need to make changes and from this point forward anyone seeking to bring adminprocedural items onto the agenda above player submitted issues needs to be demonstrating clearly how these things are in the interest of the electorate and the general good of the csm
this is insane for you to have the gall to put this on the other members of the council when you have undeniably been proven through the chatlogs to have been one of the two main instigators of csm rulemongering and bureaucracy for the sake of bureaucracy i simply cannot fathom how you can have such a break with the reality of this situation
and so it goes your side say that another side says something different my supporters say that other side has behaved appallingly the goons say ive behaved appallingly rules lawyers of both sides go through the chatlogs and interpret things from that interpretations get challenged insults get exchanged  blah blah blah and so on reality is nothing will be changed by forum frothing and faux outrage you are going to have to live with the current csm you have now for another five months so decide youre going to flame and troll with the rest for 150 days and then wring your hands wondering why its all gone wrong or maybe you take some responsibility for your own behaviour too and move onto taking an interest in actual decisions rather than childish temper tantrums and petty political gamesgrow up learn to listen rather than simply mash the keyboard with the mob concentrate on the issues not the political powerplays and maybe you get to have a good influence on matter and preempting your inevitable mock outrage that i dare to hold you responsible for frothing inanities on this forum  tough if think you are posting like a fool ill tell you that if you can tell me you look at those chatlogs and claim that one person is responsible for that trainwreck then im going to say you are either blind or have an agenda to wreck this process either way your input is not helpful to this thread
im on no side you presumptuous twit except my own im a low sec pirate with no ties to any entity represented on the csm i care about the game and i saw the csm as a chance to change it for the better but continue along your merry way with your wrong assumptions and arrogant demeanour meanwhile the chatlogs are there for all to see
when was this voted on or should i assume it will be voted on at the next csm meeting
by inferring there is some political powerplay conspiracy you insult any csm that has voted with a goon member any eve player that voted for said csm and by justifying your fiat with this nonsense you are destroying the whole proceeding
im a prophet apparently all i can say is read again take on the range of 3rd party opinions read the op post and have a think about this or better still get over it if you are interested in the csm go comment on some actual issues and stop whining about the fact were in the jerryspringer show while youre the one trying to burst onto the stage chanting jerry jerry jerry
man if everyone would just shut up and agree with me we wouldnt be arguing
i am sorry jade but i have to inform you that reality is in fact objective and can be measured as suchlord if everyone would just let me take over the csm and use it to do whatever the hell i want we wouldnt be having a problem why wont you people just shut up about my flagrant usurpation of power if it wasnt for you making a fuss about this no one would care
maybe if you actually did what you say id have an ounce of respect for you but your hypocrisy knows no bounds i stopped reading your crap after the first paragraph but continue you apparently seem to love the attention
still bitter your interpretation and lack of reading comprehension is not shared by all the csms i see i guess the csms that voted for this are just ignorant good thing you overturned it by nonexistant means
quotin this as csm fact
eryou cant actually do that
he is like the vice president he can do anything even shoot someone in the head and not get in trouble for it because he is emperor palpatine 
you guys are all hilarious its politics real politics you think that everyone is completely objective at the un you think people genuinely step away from their country for the betterment of all of the members of the un hahaha the council members just havent learned how to hide their true motives yet they havent learned how to smile about one thing while stabbing someone in the back they just do it openly right now its a brand new council remember the first attempt at the un wilsons league of nations failed miserably before wwii and had to be completely remadenow i cant say everything is 100 just like real life but it was naive to believe that the council would be completely unbiased the members will always have their own interests in mind a good analogy to the situation is the energy crisis the solution to this crisis would result in the betterment of everyone in the world as a whole why would agreeing to reduce your countrys emmissions be a bad thing yet at almost every international meeting on the issues staleamtes are reached and no representative ever comes out and says this is a fing nobrainer lets save the planet reduce emissions by 50 if that happens the conferences would be 2 minute teleconferences while everyone involved says yay to saving the world but those conferences last weeks and most of the time nothing is solved cutting emissions would reduce industrial output or cost money to implement emission reducing technology etc etc its never so simple as lets solve problem x yay or nay im not shocked that the council is the way it is it would be inhuman for it to be unbiased real world experience has shown us that whining about the situation is like whining about the un but at least we can read the meeting minutes and laugh because nobody is listening anyways
wow you are a pompous little twit i too feel your not able to conduct yourself im not a goon im a player one who you are suposed to rep keep you goonswarm crap out of the issues i elected you for your little preschool crap has got to stop you wanted to have the job doit and doit rite not keeping others from a vote not muting others not making snide comments after every vote others seem to take what there doing with high reguard your just on some agrophobic pre pubecent power trip i swear i wish i voted for someone with more maturity hell goontards would have been better
whilst im watching you each flame the other here i do have to ponder the followingi concur that all the csm would be better serving the electorate if they would moderate their tone and act more reasonably but these public fora are basically the place presently provided as the quote goes there are two things you dont want to see made sausages and laws well we arent making laws but we are certainly trying to sort out policies and procedures which is a close thing and just as you wouldnt expect our state legislatures to hide away in private i do not believe the csm should either we were elected in the public eye and should be seen to serve in the public eye oh and yes i include myself in that could all do better piecebut then  after enjoining everyone to create world peace and harmony  you then go and writeagain editorialising a decision of the csm nobody asked for the ability to come and go and your rewrite to suggest they did is the opposite of definitely shouldnt be taking disagreements over meeting moderation to the court of public debateiz
re the op i must disagree with it in the main i especially dislike the accusations thati am primarily a solo player and am very much supporting reasonable moves in this areaguilds i believe are in some other passtime but my corp has under ten members  that ive even been online with anyway   and electus matari is an rp alliance which is certainly not large i have no position with either groupingif this is meant to be describing goons then there are two of them of nine members not really many by any stretch of the imaginationatually it might surprise people but the ingame channel is usually a reasonable discussion  out of meetings   and is friendly generally in fact i feel we are friendly towards each other excepting the occasional heightened discussion over some matters which we may not all agree on  yeah ok cat fight might be a bit accurate   and i certainly have no animosity to any of my council colleagues in person at all whatever happens in csm meetings  or indeed in game should i meet them near some dark asteroid  that the issues presently on the table that we will take for guaranteed response from ccp next week are this time around ones where there is a high level of general agreement oth from pilots  on this forum   and within the csm  as i said not all discussion happens in the meeting itself   so i think were doing pretty well so farbut thank you for your inputiz
i guess by saying you it means us right 1 its not editorializing its a csm representative expressing an opinion as to what was voted on 2 i didnt say you explicitly asked for it i said you have voted for the option that allows you to come and go as you please 3 in my opinion yes it does contradict the stated role of alternates in the documentation4 this is not a disagreement over moderationdont accuse me of rewriting when im expressing an honest opinion of what went on and how the vote contradicted the documentation you seem to think you have free reign to make accusations of the chair editorializing issues and chair bias while simulataneously opposing all notion of chair authority to moderate meetings inanna obviously we disagree we will continue to disagree and this argument will continue as long as you choose to sustain it i have my opinion over what went on i have my opinion on what was voted for i have my opinion on the implications of that vote and i have my opinion on how it contradicts the documentation we were supposed to be basing csm processes on as a result its now my opinion that this csm committee is not an appropriate body to be voting on these procedural issues at the current time and wed be much better doing as ank suggests and asking ccp for rulings in these cases while we get on with the business we were actually elected to perform  selecting and presenting player issues for the forthcoming summit
please reread the motion which was passed and accepted by the csm it is quite explicit and does not state come and go as you please there is no opinion about that now the motion had its form of words and was passed in that form of words it cannot be rewritten now  or at least should not  please do not try to put your words in my mouth you have editorialised some issues which you should instead now just put behind you and accept the wording the csm agreed and you have showed bias  cf many threads and comments on these fora noting that   i do not oppose the chairs authority to moderate meetings clearly it is a prerequisitei do however most strongly object that when i ask you to explain your view about something that instead of answering you muted me and have repeatedly refused  on these forums and on the closedcirculation csm email list   to explain yourself demanding that i ask you in a private channel only the csm is a public  fsvo   body and all communication regarding the activities of its members should therefore be publiciz or anything else p
well inanna for the record i also strongly object that rather than asking the chair and vice chair to clarify the muting decision in a private channel where we could address the issue in a calm and adult fashion you chose to stamp around making accusations and accusing me of lying in a public recorded csm chat and directly sparked this current ridiculous flamewar over the issue of a moderation decision that most sensible people have admitted that the chair of a meeting has the right to makethis was a decision supported by the chair and vice chair you have also been called out by the general public on the issue in many places here here and here for example you have never approached me privately and asked for explanation you have constantly pressed for a public showdown on the issue and are trying to grandstand and stoke up controversy for its own sake you know perfectly well that there can be no public discussion of csm matters at the moment without extreme goon trolling and you are playing to that crowd so the only public answer im going to give you is the same answer ive given you all along you were disruptive in the meeting you were warned several times in the end i felt i had to mute you in order to get the terms of a vote stated between your increasingly insulting and badtempered interruptions these are matters of public record people can read the chat logs and dont let the chorus of goons convince you that the public is truly behind you on this issue inanna at this moment you are the person who will not get over this and its becoming quite obvious you have a chip on your shoulder about csm moderation authority and wont let this go
you were mad that you lost the vote and tried to twist the verbage in your sick little mind to show that 9 adults couldnt agree on menial tasks that ccp asked you to fill inand you got called out on it and i hope the other csms watch for this sunday
5th csm meeting 15th of june 1800 eve time1 nighthawk needs a powergrid increase  jade  
oh where to put my face sunday is not a working day
from the email discussions there is clearly a difference of opinion between different council members over whether the csm mailing list has ever been private might i suggest a more neutral term to use for this discussion therefore would be this will include the closedcirculation csm mailing listizrelated informationfollowing the start of raising of this topic by darius i statedi am completely happy with this including all retrospective emails inpart because i had presumed that this use of evecsmcom was to be a verytemporary measure whilst ccp played catchup and that we would then eitheruse ccpprovided forum space locked to our use or an email list providinga similar service where ccp would receive copies of all mails anywayi was elected as a member of the council as such all my activities asthat elected member are subject to public  voter  pilot   scrutiny andthese emails are no different in that respectwith which a number of other council members have associated themselves whilst others have not commented this provides part of the background on this topic
re item 1 darius motion  im not convinced this is a good idea in my experience most committees function far more smoothly when there are informal channels to use in advance of the meeting you wont hammer out contentious stuff there but to make sure all the stuff everyone agrees on goes smoothly a private list that doesnt get seen by anyone else is invaluable if only because you dont need to worry about keeping up false pretenses similarly your private conversations should be sealed even when theyre about csm business i know darius is our resident anarchist and i know hell disagree with me on this but theres nothing wrong with the occasional back room
yeah for the record i think its a terrible idea too and will be opposing it and if the measure passes i wont be using the csm list for future communications but were not talking proposals for the good of the csm here herschel were talking personal power plays and strategies for personal gain and more time wasted on admin wrangling and ego wars between people that dislike each other rather than actually talking about the issues on the agenda cynical perhaps but there you are end of the day though he asked for the administrative issue and it had to go on since it doesnt contradict the founding documentation
so you want your transparent player council to be translucent or opaque you are here to serve us and serve us you shall i dont understand for one moment why you need to have private communications for a player council that is supposed to be submitting player issues to ccp for them to review
actually alot of companies doit this way the csm is made to rep a sector of the game however most dont put it to a player vote most use the devs to make the vote for you im glad to see it i think if certain members could growup and realize its a postition out of game character and there working for all not one allience they seem to have issue with
that doesnt make sense from reading the logs can you corrolate that scenario to the actual minutes of the meetingare you saying inanna was muted unmutedkicked reinvited didnt say anything muted unmuted kicked and then reinvitedi dont see how someone could be kicked twice in a row through the unmuted system without jumping through hoops
look at the minutes and go test it yourself its not difficult just create a channel and then fiddle with the settingsed we cant really go any farther if you doubt my testimony in an easily testable scenario you have to test it yourself if you think i am wrong let me know and let me know why
this entire thread clearly shows why you children need parent chirriba or verone or someone with the ability to enforce the rules who has absolutely no say on the council i agree completely with adhamhnon
really i agree with the player that you quoted and im not a goon also when a member asks what the disruption they are getting the warning for the chair is required to explain why but not jade no he has his own agenda to press on btw does everything with revolve around goon swarm are you that tunnel visiond that you cant represent those who your charged everypost and i mean everyone you have to make some sort of goon remark as to make the post against you invalid news flash kiddo not everyone in eve is a goon and not all players who post side with you that arent goons get the clue kid and make it fast
no such person exists
really chribba comes to mind off the top of my head seems a very trustworthy individual who is completely neutral in the situation personally i think im fairly neutral in this as well i think everyones coming across looking like an idiot if not a community member what about a ccp representitive whos sole purpose is to keep the peace seems like theyd have an interest in it as well
thats not true im sure there are more then a few people who could do such a thing the real issue is the power of the chair and the rights ccp have given said chair if you look at roberts rules of order and how the chair is not supposed to come into play into the discussion at all unless he is there to break a tie in the vote and run the agenda he is not supposed to set said agend only add the items requested of the members this is the real issue with whats going on jade isnt being a chair he is being a dictator
the tldr abandon the csm document create a simple council forum with no votes only discussion there should be no moderation just the discourse of adults what follows are an excessive amount of words to justify my beliefsthe council of stellar management or csm has collapsed upon itself the players do not trust it the council members are trading insults the leader is embroiled in scandal ccp has not provided any real guidance on what the csm will entail if anything the csm has managed to replicate the power grabbing and squabbling of a third world democracy the csm document has failed to provide a framework for a functioning council and must be abandoned if csm document is to be followed to the letter the meetings at ccp will be a parade of extraneous votes and pointless proclamations and seems to me to be an impending clusterto understand how to fix the csm we must look at why it was created the csm was announced in a new york times article after goonswarm had trolled and threadnoughted all confidence away from ccp the players felt ccp was not listening to them and ccp felt the players were not listening to their reason ccp created the csm so that they could communicate with the player base and so that we could have a say in the way the game runs this is perhaps the only thing communicated clearly in the csm document thus if we should dare to fix the csm we must remember its function is solely to communicatethe mistake ccp made was giving the council members the pretext of power by giving them the ability to vote no csm can implement any idea no csm can prevent something from being added to the game the only thing the csm can do is communicate by giving the csms the right to vote ccp has given them an artificial power they do not have and like any group of politicians they are squabbling viciously over every scrap of power they can get votes split things into a binary issue and the issues in front of the csms are far more nebulous and unclear than simple yesno questions the csms should not try to be game designers and balancers they should be representatives imbalances are an issue but time should not be wasted discussing how much powergrid some ship needsmy solution is simple strip the csm of the right to power and any illusion as to such make the csm a body for communication only and make it clear as such the only position within them csm should be a council leader whose job is to moderate as an adult and ensure that all ideas are discussed and all view points heard the csms should vote on who they want to be the council leader there should be no moderation at all as we have hopefully elected responsible adults who can function as a body the removal of the illusion of power should remove the need to bicker so fiercely there should be no voting just comments ideas and questions on the issues discussed votes make nothing clearer and only draw artificial lines in the sand there should be no decisions made by ccp as any that are made will be pressured and hasty ccp should not be required to do anything as any requirements will end up in false promises
what follows are the mere details of such an implementation and should be read by only those that carei propose a very simple structure there are a series of 12 meetings beforehand where all the csms list every idea they want to discuss the meetings should take place on team speak with an irc chat running simultaneously so while somebody is rambling others can discuss related stuff with little interruption all issues raised should be discussed the middle set of meetings should focus on discussing those issues each player should be granted a brief period of time  1 min   to speak on each issue and then general discussion should ensue for 510 minutes unless people want to talk further which should be determined by a consensus or a quick vote the last one to two meetings should determine a short list  1015   of hot button topics for priority in discussing with ccp and should be sent before hand i think presentations should be avoided as much of the content will be dependent on presenter and that seems ripe for bickering if you guys think you can handle it then go for itthe visit to iceland should be similar the first thing that should happen is a tour of ccp so the csms can understand how game design decisions are made ccp should then present any issues that they want to discuss and the players should begin discussion of the hot button issues powerpoint would probably be useful for ccp at this stage the next day should be focused on player raised issues presentation could be made here but im against them these discussions require nothing more than water snacks and a conference room if there is time there should be a break for the csms to have some fun on the third day and game designers to discuss in private of what they think of the player raised issues there should then be a final meeting where ccp talks about what they found interesting from the meetings and any final discussioni think such a format would be simple and easy to follow and provide a constructive dialog between the players and ccpto ccp you guys need to step in and run this thing there has been a severe lack of leadership and the council certainly doesnt have a leader they trust youre the dictators of this sandbox so if youre going to run a puppet democracy at least try step up and provide some direction everyone is asking for it including the csms
the document is fine or would be fine if the council wasnt chaired by jade constantinebut it is
matin the document isnt fine it has serious issues that need fixing but its a good basis to work with
the vast majority of the document is oh hay guyz lets have internet spaceship democracy so the players can participate and then has a page and a half of poorly thought out implementation details the 18 pages of democracy is cool is fine but the 15 pages are not it is unsurprising that people have brought up roberts rules of order as a way to run the council as ccp has attempted to reinvent the wheel with their csm plan and done so poorlyjade may or may not be part of the problem but the idea behind ignoring the document is to prevent anyone from having the scraps of power to cause such a fuss jades actions are the symptom not the disease
you guys realise that the csm is just a publicity stunt that will suggest a bunch of  to ccp and ccp will just do whatever they feel like and completely ignore the csm right
as i said the document would be fine if the chairman wasnt jade blaming the document is just folk trying to be civil and keep away from a confrontation
we is plural please say ifurthermore please quote the part of the csm documentation that gives you the power to void votes and veto them its nice that youre using community outrage to attempt to usurp even more power but i dont think its going to happen
ill just reiteratethe alternates were elected and when serving in the place of an absent representative should be treated the same as any other rep that they can be displaced at a time not of their convenience demonstrates inequalityreading over the documentation about alternates theres a consistent theme that their substitution is not meant to be taken lightlyi think having them act as placeholders or seatwarmers runs counter to the spirit of this sort of language and as i said above runs directly counter to the concept of them being fully equal to other representatives when serving during a council meeting
the council felt otherwise and voted as suchedit this was before of course our right to do so was unilaterally revoked as a matter of convenience
yeah i know  but you seemed pretty concerned with the csm documentation and what it said regarding the powers of the chair so i would think the same thing would apply hereside note if the csm documentation doesnt give the csm the power to change these rules on the fly doesnt that conflict with your prior opinion
yep the council was wrong on this instance and we cant be voting constitution changes that contradict the founding documentation next time lets all read the documentation a little more closely eh
or we could simply change the rules midgame to suit our own purposes whichever interpretation floats your boat
yea i was just gonna dig this part out it clearly shows they are supposed to sub in when an elected member cant be there but are relived when they come back
jade its been proven time and time again that you do not have the capabilities to read this has been shown through your inability to construct a clear concise and brief argument i promise you the only one here who needs to read it is yourself so until you get hooked on phonics stop posting about things you do not understand
it doesnt show anything of the sort they fill in for meetings when a representative cannot be there they get appointed to rep status and they act in the meeting with the full and equal powers of a representative for that meeting good heavens talk about clutching at straws
1 they are not being replaced at any time the csm voted on that and reached a contradictory outcome despite how jade and yourself want to continually editorialize the decision2 if they cannot be removed then when does the first elected representative get to vote do not they also have equal rights if the first elected representative never gets to come back because the alternate cannot be removed then the elected representative has become lesser than the alternatethis isnt difficult the issue of when isnt an issue of equality
there you go thanks for clearing that up for us as soon as the representatives can be there the alternate is displaced since the alternates only serve when the first representatives cannot be there and since by definition if they are there they cannot be of the status cannot be there this means that as soon as the first elected rep returns the alternate is displacedi am kinda wondering why you voted against delaying that return until after the next agenda item though it seems kinda harsh towards the alternate
im just going to chime in here and note that constitutions of any governing body are always up to interpretationthis is why most countries have levels of courts and the likes in the us is is the supreme court which as a body decides on  votes on   what the interpretation of a given point of the constitution isjade  you hold no more power over the outcome of voting then any other member in there and have no right to vetovoidnullify a vote even if it were a vote on the specifics of the constitution the majority vote should apply even if you feel it violates the constitution and you should be careful to not try to interfere with that process based on your personal interpretation of the constitution you should also not assume everyone serving with you are a bunch of mindless illiterate idiots or rather if you do feel that keep it to yourself and keep the inflammatory remarks about your colleagues reading abilities to yourself if you feel a topic violates the constitution then vote against it that is all the power you have  one voteyou do not hold sole domain over the interpretation of the constitution and you may be better off remembering that
i find this conclusion that people not elected are equal to people who are elected quite amazing there is no artificial distinction between the top nine and five alternates there is an absolute distinction between them only that top nine have been elected the others have notlet me make a real life comparison if i maythere are a number of rl elections which take place on the party list system the gla in london is one another it the uk european parliament elections  i use uk examples as you are based in the uk other countries also operate list systems however  if party a wins five seats and party b wins 4 then the top f on as list and the top 4 on bs list are elected and serve nobody else is part of that parliament or assemblysome time later someone dies  resigns  goes off their trolley and cannot serve anymore at that time the next person on the list of that party takes over from the member leaving from that point they are the new elected member before that they had nothing and now they dothis is the same distinction as between the top nine and the next five those five are not elected they just happen to be the people ready to step in if required indeed should some dread illness strike pilots down and six of the nine disappear into the night then the next person after those five would get their callup papers the csm results were a list system and the top nine of those available  able  willing to serve the electorate are those who are the elected membersand nobody elseiz
ill check back when i wake up  about to fall into bed as 215am here  ah the life of a csm member   but whilst i recall a pointer about this thread i dont recall it being specific to ask us to comment ill check properly lateras regards my own ui issues in writing them up for ccp consideration i had already split them up individually so far as i can see in my own cases all the comments were  s   positive and  b   covered all the contained issues so i see no reason to suggest that they need additional time in what is solely a different presentational format what other csm members feel i cant say but i would suggest that where a discussion thread has covered the proposals then it has covered the proposals no matter what the exact presentation ymmv though clearly iz
jadeyou are an advisory board specifically given no power because none is needed as such you will not change anything your job is that of a focus group for ccp an informal and neutered watchdog and a gameplay thinktankit was not in ccps best interest or original intent to give you any kind of actual power whatsoever and certainly you should not have the right to mute void or negate any opinions of the other elected representatives your position exists because somebody needs to call the meeting to orders and keep things on topic if someone starts talking about the latest sports scores or some such you achieved chairman be receiving the most votes from a tiny fraction of the gaming public who all thought that you were going to be equals everyone in the csm seems to understand their marginal usefulness in this role except you
they need to have time for discussion because they may or may not be valuable and they may or may not be as optimal as possible part of the discussion is refining ideas and changes so that they are as good as possible in a reasonable time frame giving the players the time to discuss allows the players to contribute to issues that they know will be addressed in some way frankly its rather important
ianna i think the csm documentation contradicts you pretty directly as described above where it says that alternates serving on the council in place of reps are fully equal to reps themselvesto say an alternate serving on the council in place of a rep can be displaced at a nonserving reps leisure is to treat them unequally since the nonserving rep cannot displace another rep instead the rl example being the usas brown vs the board of education which said that separate but equal is not equal if a serving alternate is subject to some effect that a serving rep is not then they are not being treated equally
you didnt really just compare the csm to brown v board did you yeah you did christ
are you going to read the direct counter argument to that or are you going to do like your dear leader and cover your hands over your ears and scream la la la la i cant hear youbut lets deconstruct this one and go over all the ways its wrongs1 this is not the us judicial system brown v board has no precedent2 even if it did it would not apply because the language of the statement is very clear on when they are equal and when they are not they are equal when they are serving they are not when they are not the document does not state when they are serving except to state that they are serving when the first elected rep is not present and that issue is not in question except how to best facilitate a representative returning to the debate if anything the specific wordage of the section is more strict towards the alternates for when they are removed3 the document does not contradict what inanna says as she says nothing towards how alternates are treated when they are being an alternate only how they are treated when they are in transition
precedent
arrrg too quick trusting the firefox spell checker woe is me
ok jailhouse lawyer time is there a document that lays out standing orders for all this
i am having a hard time believing that someone seriously compared issues in the csm to brown vs board of educationthe only reason an alternative is allowed to vote is because someone had stuff that was more pressing then internet spaceship politics when that person come in to an already started meeting it is only reasonable they assume the position they would have held normally at this time jade has complete control of what topics are talked during the meetings he also has control of when the meetings take place jade can stack votes by scheduling meetings to exclude members of the csm an example of this is happening thursday us based reps who work a normal 8 to 5 schedule will not be able to attend the meeting this specially targets bane and darius and to top it off he has the ability to mute people he views are being disruptivemembers of the csm have expressed the intent to put forward a vote to elect a new chair in response jade has clearly stated he has no intent of letting democracy runs its course he stated he will not allow any vote that reduces his power or threatens his ability to decide what the provided documentation means jade has even gone a step further he essentially vetoed a passed resolution because he decided it not inline with the documentation provided by ccp at the very least he could have raised his concerns to the other reps and held another vote not jade he just decides it is not valid i am saddened by these events the entity i am most upset with is not jade which is just being himself ccp contrived this entire mess and has remained silent the entire time it is about time ccp starts clarifying the documentation it wrote and not leave it up to the csm
you dont get to declare anything void sunshine the whole reason you are having these excrutiatingly boring votes is because the meaning of a lot of the csm documents are unclear the votes were meant to clarify existing issues such as how do alternates work what power is available to the chairman to direct conversation etc given the lack of direction from ccp you have a responsibility to ensure that all members agree on how it should work and then act in the agreedupon manner until ccp explicitly states otherwiseyou were quite happy to go along with this process until a decision was made that you didnt agree with as soon as this happened you began acting like a spoiled child showing zero respect for the wishes of your council members you tried to change the wording of the resolution after it had been adopted because you didnt agree with it you tried to bully people into changing their vote you muted people that called you out on your unjustifiable actions and now after presumably losing the confidence of your peers in your ability to run the chair youve decided that you have the power to void the entire process in effect making the hours and hours of tedious debate youve presided over even more worthlessit bears repeating who the hell do you think you are you casually write off what the csm has done thus far because youve changed your mind and consider yourself within your rights to do so how do you propose to deal with the vagueness of procedures governing  for example   alternates now that youve grandly declared that agreedupon measures dont apply
actually thats one power he really ought to be exerting more often the rules of order exist the chair interprets them and the council can overrule with 23 thats how it works in roberts rules and its fairly common in other rules of order too would have neatly cleaned up the issue of abstaining too  interpret maybe get a challenge but its disposed of
i am sorry but we are not using roberts rules and there is nothing to interpret there is no sworn in nor was he accepted for the duration of the meeting all of these are made up fantasies of jade constantine except for the roberts rules part those are fantasies of everyone else who has to deal with jade constantine subverting the process when things dont go his way
even if we take the fanciful assumption that scotus decisions are binding upon an icelandic private corporations advisory body the comparison still doesnt follow this isnt separate but equal its alternate but not delegate youre not supposed to be equal  the delegates won the alternates got the consolation prize when theyre both members theyre treated equally because members are treated equally but theres no equality rights when it comes to exercising somebody elses vote when that person gets back to the table
it is a procedural issue however it should be addressed better before it leads to a problem such as a delegate returning midvote and demanding their vote be counted even though the alternate has already voted or some suchanyway not holding out much hope most of the folks on the council seem to have their head up their ass or an agenda
no were not using any rules of order and thats the problem but that said ive never seen a set of rules of order anywhere  legislatures committees courtrooms whatever  that do not give the presiding officer the power to be the first interpreter of the rules of order that the meeting is operating under the two powers fundamental to the chair are the power to moderate discussions including ejection in extreme cases   and the power to interpret the rules of order  its what being the chair means any conceivable rules of order give those two powers to the chair because without those powers being somewhere the meeting will almost inevitably descend into anarchy at some point cf half of the last meeting   and there is no logical place to vest those powers except the presiding officer of the meeting  ie the chair trying to operate without those powers in place is insanity  itd be like deleting the crown from the westminster system the whole thing just falls apart in extremis and given how this csm seems to be functioning in extremis is a thrice weekly affairactually that one was dealt with correctly at the beginning of the last meeting full points to the csm there for a rational compromise
quoting myself from page 4 nice to see so many of you agree with me
well that is great and when the council agrees on rules of order and when the rules of order give first interpretation to the chair then the chair will be right within their power to do sohowever rules of order come about by votes in the political process no body starts out and before it gets going has everything in place no they vote it out and get their rules of order in order by consensus or majority roberts rules did not spring miraculously out of thin air and nor have any rules for any governing bodyjade doesnt want to play by the rules he usurps power he does not have he invents rules and order that do not exist he interprets original documents which is outside his scope and attempts to modify the result of votes already recordedits perfectly reasonable especially for a small body such as this one to operate by majority or consensus and adopt rules in such a manner there was a problem how do we deal with x they voted on it it was accepted except that since it didnt go the way jade voted he mischaracterizes the vote and then when another vote does not go the way he wants he badgers equal representatives into changing their votes it simply does not work that way and if there is any passage of the original document that directly shows that it is the one where it says all voting members are equal equal does not include more rights than others ever and that means that there can be no right of the chairman to interpret anything first and there can be no right of the chairman to veto and there can be no right of the chairman to prevent others from discussing or votingsorry if anything the powers described and actions taken are expressly forbidden
wait goum is still hounding the csm after losing miserably  both in votes and behaviour  
no where have you been
there we go fixed that for you
hey herschel  im not saying anyone is bound by a decision made in any other system im just drawing on the logic used there because it applies here given what is in the csm document  if you like forget i brought up that example the argument is the same without ityou say youre not supposed to be equal but the csm document directly contradicts you and thats what needs to be recognizedhaving some special status while serving at a council meeting whereby you can be bumped as soon as some person not at that meeting decides its time is not being equal to other people who do not have that special status thats my pointand maybe its an arcane point and it probably doesnt matter  but ianna clearly doesnt get it and i think most of the rest of the council hasnt considered it much but the equality argument based on the csm document is pretty solid
they are only equal in the context of when they are substituted for an absent member i dont understand how you guys struggle with this concept so much alternates are clearly not equal to standing csm delegates by virtue of the fact that they dont get to vote unless they are substituting the key point is when they attain equality and when they lose it
bah stupid alt
halca i think the bit while serving on the council indicates clearly that they gain that equality when they are asked to step in and they do not lose it until the meeting is over at the next meeting the chair calls in the representatives  and any alternates needed in order per the csm document   and the process begins anewwhen is pretty clear  and its strange to think that the when is arbitrarily based on when a rep chooses to reenter the chamber because that gives the absent rep power over an alternate that they do not have over one of the first 9 reps which is unequal
they are substitutes for someone absent if the absentee returns they are no longer needed they are not equal when the person they replaced returns this is logic insisting that this is some sort of subversion is sensationalist for the sake of it we are not talking about life changing decisions here were talking about spaceshipsthe equality statement is there to allow alternates to vote with equal voice while they are substituting it does not state anywhere that they should remain in the meeting for any length of time it makes sense to allow them to stay for the conclusion of an issue they have become involved with in the process of substituting for an absentee but once that person returns it is simply an arbitrary decision to say whether they should stay for the remainder of the meeting or leave once the issue has been concluded and in this sense they are not equal and implying thats what the document states is clearly disengenuousnow you have got me talking on csm points which i argued against the csm itself doing yesterday if there is a problem understanding something  and there clearly is   then ccp should be approached if ccp want the csm or the chair to arbitrate and construct rules then they should unequivocably state this all arguments about the finer points before this occcurs are pointless and irrelevant
 heh sorry for getting you into a debate i just find this stuff interesting and it is funny that were having a constitutional argument over internet spaceship politics  its not disingenuous thats actually what the document says  and all it says  about alternates youre adding an additional interpretation when you say that the equal clause only applies until the rep gets back if you read over the csm documents theres nothing at all about reps stepping out of the chamber for a while and having an alternate take their place until they come back all it says about alternates is that if a rep cannot attend a meeting the alternate replaces them and when serving in that capacity they are equal to all other repsi maintain the argument that if you can be bumped out of the meeting at any time you are not equal to other reps who cannot be bumped out
if they were equal then all alternates would vote all the time they do not they are only equal for the purposes of replacing an official rep and when the rep cannot be at the meeting you have stated this yourself if a rep returns the replacement is no longer needed this seems pretty simple to meyou are talking about one case where someone cant attend a meeting and extending it into the situation where someone is late to a meeting or someone needs to step away for a time youve also stated yourself that the document does not state any rules in this regard so why are you also extending an argument to say it does in my estimation common sense would dictate that while a rep cannot be present a substitute should be called for and when they are present the substitute should step down i dont think that is too much of an extension and does not in any way impinge on the rights of an alternate in voting when they are thererules and exceptions should be made to err on the side of the reps not the alternates because they are alternates
if the equal standing does not end when the first elected rep gets back when does equal standing endsince the document defines no end point except by defining the terms of which alternates serve when the representative cannot attend if you are saying that when the representative returns the alternate is still entitled to vote then either the alternate can never be displaced and the council is now 10 members or the representative can never returnboth of these interpretations are ridiculous and they are the only options that must necessarily flow from your interpretation of the language but you support neither of these you support something entirely different you support the representative coming back at the end of the meeting regardless of the duration that he was unable to attend this is a direct contradiction of any reading of the languagefurthermore there is no additional interpretation about it only applies until the rep gets back the equality clause states that the alternate has equality when acting as an alternate such the equality clause only applies during the time that the alternate can be acting for the first elected representativesuch you then find in the document where it says when alternates take that position only during the time in which the document says alternates take that position does the equality applyhere is a good example suppose you and your mother were having an argument you wanted to play video games and stay up late and your father wanted you to go to bed at 9 pm sharp so your mother says you can stay up and play video games as long as you want when your father is not home because she doesnt care so long as your father doesnt find outnow if you went to her later and said father left for an hour then returned so i stayed up and played video games for four hours because that was as long as i wanted to she would say youre grounded the section regarding as long as you wanted only applied when your father was not here once your father returned that part no longer applied and you could no longer play video games as long as you wanted but had to go to bedyou are the one saying that the result applies regardless of the condition when instead the result only occurs when the condition is metwhen do they have equality when serving in a voting capacity for a representative when do they serve in a voting capacity for a representative when the representative is unable to attend if the representative is present is the representative unable to attend no if the representative is present the representative is able to attend since if the representative were unable he could not be present if the representative is able to attend does the alternate serve in a voting capacity no if the alternate is not serving in a voting capacity do they have equality nothe resolution reached by the council is actually more lenient than a strict reading of the language it gives more rights to the alternates by ensuring that agenda items are completed as a whole its the equivalent to your mom saying its ok if you finish that level so you can save instead of her walking in and shutting your game system down its a reasonable compromise that both upholds the integrity of the representative while not wasting an alternates time by making him take part in a discussion where he will not vote or the councils time by having to repeat information or wait for the representative to catch up and state their case
good lord look at all these interpretations lets be clear on something the statement in the document regarding equal standing is in effect only when people are serving as representatives the equal standing clause only applies to representativesthere is obvious ambiguity when it comes to whether or not an alternate can be called in during a meeting and then unseated when the elected official returns we sought to clarify this with a vote the results were not liked and were unilaterally overturned hopefully ccp will provide further clarification since voting on the issue democratically has been deemed by one to be insufficient i have to wonder what the whole point is at that point but it is what it is some of us think its a council and others a dictatorshipi believed that line to be a boilerplate and common statement in documents of this type which in essence merely states that for purposes of voting all votes are equal jade got 43 or so votes more than hardin but in terms of voting jades votes do not count for any more i believe that to be pretty much the sole purpose of this paragraph of the document that all reps are equalccp openly stated that they wanted us to fill in the blanks we attempted to do so someone didnt like the results now we have to wait for ccp to say again fill in the blanks because obviously the first time wasnt good enough really as far as im concerned its all just a waste of time as there was never any need for this stupid circlejerk of a leadership structure in the first place someone has interpreted a chair as being some form of absolute leader over a council of adults and weve wasted loads of time debating that when in reality everyone should just shut up and talk about spaceships sure someone needs to schedule meetings and organize the agenda but 9 adults do not need to be lorded over muted or told how to votethis only works if the person asserting they have some form of power doesnt use it or abuse it i dont think im wrong in stating that there at least 8 people on the council that would love to be discussing eve discussing and voting on issues related to a videogame as adults not as insignificant children who need to be herded or lead by some selfappointed demigodall of this debate is an unfortunate distraction from the issues at hand and has really shown the worst sides of some people but i also dont think many are surprised whatsoever personally im going to remember that a snake is a snake if someone brings it into your house its going to bite you you cant hate the snake for being a snake i believe ccps hope was that these things could be worked out reasonably internally but i believe you can all see from the results of last weekends vote and subsequent overturning of that vote that this is simply not going to happen i personally hold ccp far more accountable for the current status than i do jadei dont like snakes but common sense dictates that i blame their appearance in the chicken coop on the people who put them there this is just plain stupid and unfortunately a democratic solution will not be allowed to prevail at least if nothing else were proving to ccp why their proposed structure is silly at best
hahaha a goon being the voice of reason the csm really is that terrible
i hate to admit this but i have to agree with goumindong it seems quite straight forward to meat some point in a meeting if one of the 9 csm representatives is not able to be there for what ever reason then an alternate steps in at this point the alternate is an equal member for voting purposes their vote counts just like the rest of the 9 if the missing representative arrives returns or otherwise shows up the alternate would be required to step aside  if midvote the elected representative may wish to allow the alternate to complete the vote if they feel their vote after missing the prior discussion would be uninformed but this would be up to the representative not the chair or the alternate  regardless of the make up of the csm rules like this all need to be defined in a way that limits the ability to interpret them in this case i think they were  the not available clause   if you wanted to clarify this better there is no reason why all 14 representatives  9 csm members and 5 alts   should not make an effort to be in and be included in all online meetings this way the alternates are informed if asked to step in for a time the alternates could add to the discussion  within reason   but would only be able to vote if they were acting in the stead of one of the 9
a meeting is not considered valid unless seven council membersin any combination of alternatives and representativesare present the published meeting notes will display the members in attendance and the main transcript vault will keep a running tally of the meeting attendance of all representatives where applicable representatives are encouraged to post chat logs as a supplement to the meeting notes as well the recommended guideline for meetings is at least once per weekwith a minimum of nine representatives presentthis is from the csm documents the interesting part is highlighted by italicsmaybe alternates once given voting status keep it for the rest of the meeting regardless of how many representatives come after they dotake carebruce hansen
another way to look at that is that a meeting needs a combination of nine  reps and alternates to begin   but it remains quorate as long as there is a combination of seven reps and alternates present of course this is me guessing and its very ambiguous  lets add it to list of things we need clarified by ccp i guess
inannayou need to split the issues apart for presentation to the players and for discussion and voting by representatives the issues if successful through the csm vote then are presented to ccpcurrently by lumping issues in together players can not coherently discuss and debate each issue seperately and arguments and discussions are hard to follow through a thread it will be even harder when a particular issue is a source of contention or needs changing due to overlooked ramificationsadditionally when presented in a csm meeting having multiple issues makes discussion about each one much harder if not impossible  eg 60 issues on science and industry   each issue must be able to be discussed and debated in a csm meeting by the representatives a clear yay or nay vote on each issue must also be made by the csm by having multiple issues together this is impossible poor issues get through the entire process and csm representatives get no opportunity to vote them down without rejecting many good issues the same is also true when a few good issues are amoungst many bad onesyour issues may all be good and serve the greater needs of the eve players however it is important all issues are presented the same way and equal opportunity given to each issue for every player and representative to discussdebate and the representatives to vote on take carebruce hansen
the point i think all of us in the council were in agreement on is that the document in this regard is ambiguous as i said it doesnt say when voting status is given or whether an alternate serves for the entire meeting or only until the representative occurs it gives precisely zero guidance in this regard thats why we held the vote we dont vote just to vote there was a gap we tried to fillwe can posit 101 maybes as regards this but at the end of the day the fact is that the document does not give guidance in that regard and the chair decided the vote didnt count what this means is on ccps lap as the chair has the potential to simply mute anyone who doesnt abide by their interpretation of the rules and has removed any ability for the council to remedy or reconcile thisits effectively the chairs show at this point until ccp does or doesnt say otherwise i dont believe the document says that the chair should wield supreme power or even any really either but the ability to kick and mute without any recourse pretty much seals the deal as the chairs show there is no remedy except via ccp they made that possible
i cant believe im doing this but im quoting goumindong for truth hes exactly right
well when the meeting ends the alternate ceases to serve in the meeting and the equality issue goes away when the next meeting is set up the first 9 reps are again requested to attend and if one or more cant alternates can be called in their place youll note that the csm document doesnt say alternates jump in when a rep has to step out it says they are asked to attend the meeting when a rep cannot make the meeting so the whole subbing in subbing out thing is not covered in the csm document except where it cautions against using alternates lightly technically i think according to the csm document you could start a meeting with 8 reps  the minimum for a valid meeting is 7   if someone is going to be five minutes late likewise if someone has to step out as long as the total doesnt go below 7 theres no conflict with the documentation its only situations where a rep says they cant make it or can only be there for a small portion of the meeting that the documentation suggests an alternate should be called in to serve for the meetingthat said its academic as darius noted its only of interest because obviously nobody considered what the csm document said before the vote and there are still some reps including ianna holding an interpretation that runs counter to what little can be found there
brucethe issues weve been putting together to discuss are being put together as the players presented them i think we can all agree that the issues forum is less than optimal in many many ways given that all we can do as a council is attempt to take the issues as provided and stated and attempt to reframe them for discussion if you dont like the way an issue is framed in the issue forum frame it yourself another way the council does not create issues we pass them oni understand your calls for clarity and agree with you perhaps your call should be raised as an issue on the issues forum so we can discuss it wed actually discussed the idea of even having all of these issues submitted by players in a template the bottom line however is that its our obligation to address these issues as theyre presented if theyre given to us poorly in a lump by players then thats what we have to work withthe end result will hopefully be much clearer when its presented but its not to us to take one issue and make it 20 its not to us to do that in order for players to debate the forum for debate is there though crappy and we have no control or input into the environment that takes place in aside from telling ccp we think it sucks
i will ask you not to put words or thoughts into the heads of people who voted the document in no way runs counter to the results of the vote as ive stated to say that the people who voted clearly didnt take into account the document is assinine and unfounded the document is subject to interpretation the interpretation that the majority of the council holds is different from yours there is no one right answer to this question but only one way to follow it thus the council votingedit to clarify the document says nothing about lengths of terms youre deciding it does it doesnt that was what the vote was can alternates serve temporarily or do the rightfully elected representatives resume their seats upon return that is in no way mentioned in that document as much as anyone may try to wordsmith it to make it say so
im not talking about the results of the vote  i think theres a fair argument to make that you work with what you got im referring to iannas statement that representatives and alternates are not equal when the documentation contradicts that and says that when serving in a meeting they are thats all
inanna is right as well representatives are equal alternates are not representatives only when they are appointed and become representatives due to the lack of an elected one being there do they become equal this paragraph states nothing more in my opinion than that all votes are equal and its been overblown to hilarious proportions by sideline wannabe elawyers
darius there are clear and easy steps that you can take to remedy the situation you can vote down multiple issues presented and send them back to the players with the explanation we cannot vote on multiple issues you can provide an area to discuss each issue in this very own forum where no one would be hindered by the support mechanism and could present logical arguments under threat of moderation by ccpthe problem comes in that the csm is fundamentally shirking its duty to have the public discussions required one each issue before voting it is the result of these discussions that are to be taken to ccp based on the judgement of the csm it is not the csms duty to be a messanger to ccp they can read the forums as well as anyone else its your duty to examine and judge what is important to explain why and explain reservations against possible fixes ie to convey legitimate do wants and do not wants its not happening but beyond that its out of order according to the csm document when said lump issues are presented since each issue needs to have its own separate discussion and vote just as it is beyond jades power to veto bills its beyond the csms power to vote on the block issues and present them to ccp
i am going to bold this so it gets thoughunless the csm document specifically says that the alternate serves an entire meeting regardless of the attendance of the first elected representative then there is no reading of the language which can make that a reasonable interpretation unless the csm agree that that is the point at which they will return you are outright fabricating rules out of whole cloth
goumfirstly theres a huge pink elephant in the room that everyones ignoring in this regard and thats the fact that we were given a very limited timeline to get issues on the table to even bring to iceland that doesnt leave a lot of room to get the process perfect as were having to spend all our time scrambling just to have issues to bring the reason theres no time being given to debate is that ccp did not give us the time to debate as many things as i have problems with this is a huge one and its simply not the councils fault again pretty cute idea but i feel the ball was completely dropped in the executiontldr the debate isnt happening because we havent had sufficient time blame ccp regarding the csm document discussing that at all is a moot point because no votes will be allowed to be had on that raise it as an issue in the other forum and well see if bringing it to iceland doesnt get unilaterally vetoed  hint its too late to do this as an issue has to exist for 7 days before brining it to council and ccp needs all issues 7 days before the meeting  
i can accept a standard of interpretation like that no problem but the same kind of standard applies to ruckuses about the definition of what powers are involved in moderating a meeting what constitutes discussion etc
i agree the difference of opinion lies in the difference between democracy and dictatorship in one case the group decides its a problem and steps up in the other one person gets to decide what conversation is allowed by their own judgement i do not think this was ever remotely the intent of the csm whatsoever
youre incorrect on all counts despite the bolding we can only agree to disagree goum as usual
and i am sure you are going to quote me the section that says alternates serve an entire meeting regardless of the attendance of the first elected representativei am going to be very clear on this a second time if such a passage exists i am wrong and will retract all statements if such a statement does not exist then i am right and you are wrongso you say i am incorrect on all counts prove me wrong that is all you have to do page number and paragraph preferably with the small or large document so i dont have to go fishing through two   it will be quite easy since as you say i am so clearly wrong right
then you bring less youve had 2 official meetings 7 days apart you were not required to have game issues at both it sucks but its what you had to work withits better to do it right and bring less issues but more important ones with better input than it is to do it wrong and bring more issues with no direction and inputits too late now but it wasnt when this was brought up 1 day after the first official meetings agenda was published which was the second meeting by jade constantines reckoning  
this is what you were incorrect about1   there is no reading of the language which can make that a reasonable interpretation2   you are outright fabricating rules out of whole clothneither is correct what i outlined is a reasonable reading  there are others   and it was based only on the csm document and so not fabricated out of nothingtime to let it ride cause were not going to agreealso i agree with darius regarding getting stuff done  rules lawyering its just fun to play constitutional law with internet spaceship councils
not much i can do about it now theres a lot about this process we clearly didnt anticipate i personally could not conceive that ccp would allow this to be run this way next time around well put a goon in the chair instead of assuming its a democracy and well deal with it from therefor now i work with what i have to work with
where did you outline it i have explained three times how your outline based on equality is false all you have said is nuh uhyou and jade constantine do not get to declare things the truth you must present your argument or show the truthshow it or make your argument where is the statement in the document that defines what you are describing
so you guys pushed two representatives in order to have more votes expecting a democracy and for the next csm term youre realizing that the way to powercontrol is to grab the chair position rather than more council votessounds like thinking has changed from lets control the issues to lets control the whole csm process due to whats happening now yes its completely politics on all sides involved and has always been dont know if ccp expected anybody to do all the work of separating the signal from the noise for them for free and with their  or the games   best interests at heart but they were stupid if they didthis is eves community after allactually let me edit thatif the csm is a political body whose purpose is to alter game mechanics in the interest of various groups within the community then everyone is on the right track here and in fact you should form parties and have campaigns and all that stuffif the csm on the other hand is supposed to just be a bunch of secretaries responsible for pointing ccp towards the various issues then why the hell did anyone sign up one lousy trip to iceland doesnt seem to be worth the effortwork
dariusactually the multiples were presented by representatives for example science and industry  lavista pdf document 60 issues  issues should be presented seperately representatives should not support multiple issues  presented together as one topicissue   in the issue forum or propose multiple issues bruce
brucemy apologies then i cant speak to what other people do ive personally only adopted issues which were raised by others with the exception of one which is pretty cut and dried sorry for the misunderstanding ill let lavista handle his own laundry
the csm wasnt defined well at all by anyone youre right as it stands today its not worth the effort in my opinion and had it been done before and turned out this way im sure many people wouldnt have run if it gets fixed then awesome well just have to wait and see
you may reread all my posts above at your leisure
why theres nothing of actual substance in them
treat me like an idiot who is unable to scroll up lay out the argument step by step feel free to include a rebuttal to the csm document which clarifies when the alternate is equal and when they are not
its called the lalalalalalalalala i cant hear you defense
how on earth does this make sense its like asking a president about to get impeached if impeaching should be allowed this should be delegated to someone that isnt gsyoupeople you muted
how about the fact i want to measure to get through i want it written into the constitution and i want to make sure all future csm chairs are elected by the committee kinda gives me a decent motive to make it happen doncha think
someone seems to have conveniently overlooked this comment
thats not the point being made
sorry darius couldnt find a way to do it this time still we do have two meetings this week im just posting up the details of the sunday one where you can bring up your votes and motions and whatnot as we all agreed last week this midweek one is for confirming the issues are properly documented and sent to ank make sure you get yours done and emailed by the deadline on thursday and all well
so why not have them saturdaysunday how does it make any sense to not allow the elected members to participate
i never agreed to this meeting it was scheduled so that american attendees could not make it this is actually your second attempt at this should i reforward you the note from ccp regarding meeting scheduling from the last time
were having one on sunday this thursday one is a signoff meeting to ensure weve got relevant documentation agreed for all the issues submission templates were taking to iceland  agreed from the previous weeks   they need to be bundled up and sent to ccp by ank by thursday evening at the latest the meeting in this case is a formality to let us sort out the last issues and double check everyone has done their stuff if we had to wait till sunday wed be flying to iceland with no issues to discuss while i can understand that might make darius workload a little easier its probably not the best use of our time or ccps isk
i guess if all your trying to do is steal votes sure
in that case why arent all the issues posted in the proclamations forum for everyone to seeas long as they are all there with the relevant csm reps commenting i see no point to this meetingoh and as an alternate i again will be unavailable due to timezone issues
removed stupidity
its not a question of making a workload esier its that you continually schedule meetings that conflict with at least two delegates and one alternate there could be more than this but as far as i know you are forcing 2 elected delegates to skip out of their paying job or visiting time with their family so you can get an extra hour of sleep the meeting doesnt have to wait until sunday and when you are unyielding to the other delegates needs it shows how well you are at doing your primary job of csm that of scheduling meetings if you cant get that right then how can you do the secondary job that you gave yourself of moderation
chair could i please ask what a way to do it this time means despite over 50 emails flinging their way around the internet today on the csm group email there was nothing that i saw asking council members about their time availability similarly i made a comment above about using the third forum channel here for what is its apparent purpose and making it clear to everyone which matters they will be receiving guaranteed responses from ccp about as we put them forward the matters for this coming meeting are not ones which actually need everyone online at the same momentaside given that you have scheduled this when at least two elected members cannot make it  and can clearly be deemed already to have sent their apologies which i am sure they will also put on record before the meeting if you still go ahead on this schedule   then have you asked the top two pilots on the alternates list  ie 10 and 11   to stand by and have they indicated that they are able to make this timeslotiz
this thursday meeting is there purely to check we have the adequate documentation for the issues we have already voted for and to vote on the individual elements of multipart issues weve included on principle but havent yet individually decided onits not going to be a formal meeting in the form of agenda and administrative stuff its mostly a documentchecking collaborative session members that cant make this meeting are welcome to send in the votes on individual parts of lavistas yours and anks multipart issues and well record them for the record as for the timing it cant be helped really we had to do this by thursday as you know it cant wait till the weekend and on a weeknight we have an issue with whats doable for the us people is too late for some euro people i took a decision based on what we have to achieve at that meeting if it turns out to be me ank and you and six sets of mailed in multipart votes then we wont be officially quorate but we can still help ank on the secretarial duties of assembling the documents for ccp all these things have already been voted yes on principle and we are within our rights to send them onre the proposal to use the proclamations forum for this  we havent yet been told what that forum is for it wont be read only and in the current climate of extreme forum trollingspam campaigns from a certain group i dont believe it will be a conducive environment for this also its a waste of effort on our part were assembly word docs that will be available for all csm reps to examine via the evecsm list at the moment i see no reason to increase the administrative burden on everyone further by reproducing this stuff on another forum sectionwell get the job done
to be frank provided its not an actual voting meeting but rather an informal gettogether where our opinions and such can be mailed in its not really a big deal in my opinion
that was always the point darius its what i said when we brought it up last week the formal meeting this week is sunday 15th 1800 hours this one was always a document checking thing first and foremost the mailed in votes we will need are on these 3 issues  ui  separate issues discussed in the op  
so are you going to document checkeditorialize like you did with hardins idea
youre an awesome chairman really you are
something ive just noticed whilst rereading some stuff in preparation to complete my submission documents ignoring a moment that youve repeated yourself the time is actually unclear and depends on your country of originin some countries the use of a 24hour clock is normal at 0100 would be read as 1am not pm but given the thursday afternoon you quoted twice i believe that 1pm  aka 1300   was intended and will act accordingly  i also dont believe it likely that ankh is intending to be awake at 1am to edit them all  izps tq came back early and stable yayps2 jade you didnt answer about the two alternates
a simple solution to this matter given that you guys are all in different timezones would be for you to make any future deadlines in 24 hour format using standard ingame time as the guide
ok i guess i post this question here for the csm reps since i can not find a decent thread to post in that is not either a  buried on the 13 page or b   is not strewn with eye poking i would like to understand how an issue is brought up to the csm from the assembly forum that has an overwhelming non support from the player base that clearly does not have the supportit does not seem right how can ccp sit there and with a straight face and look at the suggestion brought up by the csm when the player base says they do not want itarent you a little bit concerned that by pushing agendas that has no or very little support from the player base makes the csm look foolish in the eyes of ccp so when you do ask to push a hot button item that has the support from the player base ccp is not going to look at you and not take you seriously
thats how weve been doing it so far
takes personal judgement really if an issue has 30 decent supports and 200 iterations of the same argument against by the same corppressure group then the issue can still be raised by the decision of a csm rep we all have to learn to spam filter the issue threads and ignore the background noise our job is to get what we believe are decent suggestions that will be of value to the player base on the agenda its not our task to be popular by agreeing with the barking of a mob that said i think weve presented a very good crosssection of issues for this first session that do represent all the best suggestions made on the assembly hall that could be raised within the time constraints and 7 day advance discussion rule if you feel weve forgotten something important that will have been up for open discusion for the 7 day mark by sundays meeting then feel free to ask one of us to take a look
no jade there is nothing in particular that i have in mind i have no aspirations of any of the topics presented by the csm or the player base i just try to look at them with a different eye  playing eve regularly for little over 5 years now i have learned to accept and adapt what has been handed down to me   i have been reading a lot of issues about game mechanics i am not even going to touch the other crap that has to deal with goons or your self it is when i see a thread that has 20 support votes and 200 posts like you said that is a red flag for me when the thread came up about changing ammo and i saw 84 posts and 82 support i just peaked at the initial post and knew that was a no brainerwhen there is a disparity of the number of votes i have to wonder and i take the time to read some of the posts and gloss over the repeat threadnoghts and look for new posts that would easily be counted to show a majority of nonsupport
as discussed during the last meeting i will be unable to make the thursday discussion due to previous nonnegotiable commitments please arrange for an alternate to stand in my placeserenity
so your saying you would not give it any time at all even though you issue has less support just because you ducks masterbate to the thought of you
so anyone who opposes you is automatically a goon and some insultingsounding variety of animal and as such their opinion can be discounted without further consideration there are thirdworld dictators with less ego and chutzpah than that
you might have a point if the titans into monster truck thread didnt exist
you do remember that not too long ago 4s where selling at 100 mill plus and 5s at 400 to 500 mill each so expensive is a non issue if someone wants somthing they will save isk for it d
back on may 23rd i posted an issue i would like the csm to look into and bring to ccpthis issue has somewhat substantial discussiondebate  decent amount of support  over all  a good amount of attention to it  or some would think  atleast compared to other issues out there that are  less discussed  low support votes  low thread viewsissue looting from my kill should  looter flagged to me  214 responses  99 votes  3823 views  for some reason this issue and other issues are being treated to the left by the csm  whilst issue like the following have jumped to the front of the line here is just a few on that list1 issue bacon and basic logserver exploitation  169 replies  77 votes  3082  2 issue fix the forums  66 replies  62 votes  716 replies  3 drone implants  39 replies  30 votes  546 views  4 issue reexamination of 00 sovereignty system  73 replies  13 votes  1240 views  5 minor issue option to change all ammo at once  86 replies  83 votes  967 views  6 issue bombs need a boost  36 replies  24 votes  533 views  7 issue 5 rule way too strict  97 replies  70 votes  2467 views  8 issue evaluation of empire war dec mechanics  55 replies  11 votes  952 views  this one i find very humorous  especially since the war dec fiasco between privateer alliance and ivy league  thread  clickymainly because dierdra vaal posted this one  and is now in charge of the followupcan we say youre putting the mouse incharge of the cheese anyway  the list goes on and the trend continues when asked about how each issue is selected to bring to ccp this reply was given in a previous thread clickyso the question is  whos interests are you looking out for the general player base who you were voted in by to represent themor your personal interests andor that of your buddiescorpsalliancesrespectfully
isnt that obviousthough i will say some members are looking for general player base issues or at least they try to i guess
you continue your love of good grammar and restrained capitalization from the previous thread i see cheap shots aside while your thread may have more votes than the others its also had a lot more opposition my two  fix the forumsoption to change all ammo at once   are both wholly uncontroversial with the majority of the nonvote posts being supporters who forgot to click while they may have less raw support theyre something everybody agrees on and as such not only can they be passed through easily allowing for faster meetings which means more room for business to be conducted   they can be delivered to ccp easily and hopefully implemented quickly which gives the ccp concrete achievements to use to defend themselves from accusations of various types besides theres been two weeks and 24 issues considered  therell be time for your complaints to be heard just like everybody elses if youve really got that big a problem evemail the most receptive csm members and ask them to put it on the agenda  itll work a lot better than a whine thread on csm issue selection methodologies
this sounds like something the fine people at omg labs might be interested in looking at id imagine that there might even be a way to get eve search to do the kind of sorting you all are discussing here
the council of stellar management is the most useless thing ccp has ever come up with and that must have taken some effort 
please impeach him for the love of god jesus ing christ also have you seen his hair what the  is the deal with that rofl its white its all white havent you heard of just for men jade constantine i know theres normally a picture of a guy with a full beard on the front but dont let that deter you
vote on the motion as stated by tetsujinaye
make it so
you fools only jade understands the csm documentjade is all powerful jade tells you to vote you votevote or die2008oh and aye
jita park what a perfect name as that is the only thing that system is useful for parking ya 40 minutes now staring at the jumping dialog
instead of extra content ccp why dont you just finally make your game work properly i have been playing over three and a half years and it still has all of the same problems it did on day one but minus some of the cool things like massive drone hoards and most importantly missiles that didnt magically fly threw shtfix the dmn game before adding more useless trash
goons thinking before they post ittall discussion should be directed to this thread insted
zoing looks like this is in the wrong forum can a moderator move this to the correct oneissue that standing orders and constitutional makeupare to be discussed at the next available meetingformal reading of this proposal this is a single issue document that requests consideration of formal standing rules and a consideration of issues brought up by the constitution  in absense of formal constitution read
addendum to issue discussion pointson rereading the minutes some issues have already been aparently resolved feel free to discard points if they have been formally resolved to majority council satisfaction
please add to the discussion what is the formal quorum for a meeting and for a decision ie how many abstains make the issue unresolved noting the conventional interpretation of an abstain as meaning i neither support or dissent the conventional wisdom of the interaction of an abstain with a majority is  majority  number of ayes   membership count  abstains      05 where   membership count  abstains    quorum   is this the formula being to be used or will the council invent a new formula
heres a draft of what a standing orders document might look likestanding orders for the procession of csm meetingsorders conatained within the ccp scope document1   that the attendance quorum be 7 members2   that an issue must be available for comment for 7 days prior to the meeting and be aproved by either 5 of player base or a member of the csm3   that an issue may remain as long as necesary to obtain either approval or disaproval an approved issue must be escalated to ccp4   aproval takes the form of a simple majority for an issue to pass ayes must outnumber naes an abstain is not counted as a nae1  add others as deduced from the document  voted on standing orders5   an alternative candidate may start participating at the point a candidate becomes absent and must yield when the candidate returns2 add others as needed  ideas for standing orders6   at any point a csm member can propose a vote on an issue of standing orders this vote halts the progress of the meeting which does not proceed till the issue is resolved the chair is compelled to follow the vote  this is pretty standard stuff with meetings  7   any move to mute a member must be subject to a simple majority vote which would include the proposed mutee the mutee must be permitted to address the motion  strike suggestion 8 it contradicts simple majority by implying absolute  suggestion on meeting protocolduring a meeting for someone to take the floor they should say something like floor or even an x they go onto a queue and take turns as per the queueif a person wants to directly address a point they should say something like addressing person name they are put onto the top of the queue after the current speaker this must only be used to address a specific persons comments  for instance to correct a mistake   anything else is outside of process for the purpose of decorum other members must be addressed via the chair  for instance  instead of darius i think xyz you jerk you might say chair i submit that i disagree with darius and think xyz   addresses to the chair however might be addressed directly to the council council i submit the chair is incorrect on this matter for reasons xyza motion on meeting procedure constitutional matters or standing issues however interupts the current meeting and thus takes precedent even over the current floor speaker  ie objection chair xyz is speaking outside the scope i vote we move on a vote then ensues   when a speaker has finished  he should indicate with an end or something like that1 note in formal terms a simple majority is defined as a vote where more ayes are recorded than nayes an abstain does not count as a nae where an abstain is called a nae this is refered to as absolute majority ccp states clearly this is not the case this would appear to resolve the issue of the status of abstain votes2 unresolved the principles of simple majority state that a vote can be reversed in the agregate positive this would imply a member can revert the vote of an alternative but its a bit ambiguous does the csm agreeyoud have to fill in the blanks and reorganise it but i think the above would pretty much satisfy everyone think about it csm reps something like the above would be a pretty classy framework thats based on traditional meeting procedure and address everyones concerns  particularly regarding orderly meeting behavior and it would permit the chair to exercise his role whilst allowing the csm members a mechanism to reject a chairs ruling  
look a all dem posts and words
moved to assembly hall
cool with that
thanks mitnal its a bit embarassing to do all them words and then screw it up by posting it in the wrong forum  please take the time to read what ive writen i believe it neatly solves the current problems with the council by making the chair accountable to the membership whilst providing a mandate for the chair to function
personally i think having the csm ask ccp to actually do what they should have done from day one and write the csm a proper set of cast iron procedural rules rather than turning over yet another session of the csm to this a csm that votes itself power only leads to power block voting and disperate factions within the csm fighting each other for control which is something i dont believe ccp wanted particularly
ive drafted a basic constitution for the council of stellar management based on the ccp proposal pdf and placed it in an independant thread
i have the feeling this will be resolved some other way but good work on drafting these sorts of things guys it looks nicely organized and it would be great if there were some recognized order to followalthough like heartstone said id think that would need to come from ccp to be viewed as authoritative thumbs up nonetheless
dippins theres some excelent ideas in there i think we need to keep the proposal simple and basically dependant on the original documentswhat we have o work with is pretty simple1   simple majority voting a very specific idea look it up on wikipedia2   a limited scope3   a very loose mandate of how the council works now by my reckoning that means what is needed is more a concept of how a meeting should run such that we keep a sense of civility between the diferent personalities and such that two objectives can be meta   jades responsibility to keep the council orderly andb   the councils right to full unimpeded rights to speechit would seem the reason  a   and  b   conflict is a lack of standing orderergo what we need is a standing orders document thats simple comprehensible with minimal scope for conflicting interpretaion but most importantly a canonical document to refer procedural debates tojades job should be mechanical and predictable if any member can not work out if an action is permisable then something is wrong jade must thus make a call  and nobody is to blame if they disagree if this occurs something is wrong with the procedure
i agree in principle but in practicality the csm has been formed with no real standing orders its not unusual as a public servant i see it all the time but honestly experience says get this  out of the way first and itll never be a problem again this council experiences pain so the following ones have a clear mandate what we used to do in my days on the local council was make sure a lawyer had ratified standing orders so we didnt need to  prior to committee forming   but this hasnt happened here so i guess we gotta do it ourselfplease take this seriously guys itll save heartache later on
wonderfull having something like this from the beginning would have made this run alot smoother we didnt have this so its good to make it
tldr after the first post but what i read was good

i dont know you could probably find the answer with kyle frost  he was in an npc corp for 5 months when he joined eveo there are reasons to be in npc corps  you cant be wardecd they provide a good place to learn the ropes are they taken advantage of sure just about any game written has aspects that can be tweaked or exploited i may be new to the game but i imagine if the game has been out for 5 years ccp is aware of where their paying customers are and why they are therewardec system needs to be looked at both from the aggression side and from the defending side corphopping needs to be looked at and the function of npc corps need to be examined  both for war purposes and training   jumping back and forth repeatedly should not be an optionforcing play styles shouldnt be allowed either tho eveo is a business and as such csms or no ccp probably wants to keep it running and profitable this means  imho   that ccp will try to keep as many people as possible happy or at least not too discontented thats going to  in turn   means carebears pvprs empire and oo are all going to get less than they wanti support the discussion and hope some good ideas get sent up to ccprespectfullyak
wardecs vs corpsalliances are very much fine nowthe only issue i see is alts to raise wardec fees and inability to wardec specific people in noobcorps for more then 3 months or sowar always  naturally   favours the aggressor to some extent thats only commonsense  he wouldnt be the aggressor if he did not think he would win and naturally the defender has no control over the duration of the war unless he takes it to the aggressor and steamrolls him  thereby taking counterinitiative and making the war mutual so the initial aggressor doesnt have any control when the war ends either   or proves to be too hard of a opponent defensively making the aggressor simply give updefenders are aided by knowledge of territory and friendsetc  well in lowsec in highsec its not so applicable   and fighting from your base always has some advantages  i know in this last war i can just dock podsit in new battleshipundock battleship my opponents cannot do this without moving all their assets to our station  its perfectly validwe do not need victory conditions if someone wants to pursue a war forever then so be it he should have the right to take it to him and make it impossible for him to live with the wardec or alternatively hire mercs to take him out and keep hiring themthe whole eve needs to cater to x or we dont want to force playstyles talk is bs  eve is a computer game with its own ruleset nobody is forcing you to play eve but by playing you have to acknowledge its a game with certain rules and objectives pvp is a central part of it theres no nonpvp playstyle in eve much like theres no nonpvp playstyle in multiplayer doomsure you can play it to pick up the next gun but dont be suprised when someone shoots you in the face or back
agreedthis is a game with its own rule sets so far as i can tell noone is saying cater to this or that group just that the wardec system needs to be reevaluated right now there certainly is a nonpvp play style in eve its npc corps and hisecurity space thousands of players there while pvp is a central part of eve its certainly not the only part ccp has made it that way and even there pvp is possible if your willing to take the security hit and loss of a craft to concord i most certainly am not in favor of removing danger from hisec  keeps it interesting if someone wishes to wardec someone forever right now they can there are however mechanisms  exploits whatever you want to call it   that increase the isk cost to run those warsface it empires dont become empires by allowing unrestrained combat wherever whenever this is reflected in eveo by the wardec system which is what this thread is about the need to have it reexamined
what about some sort of new corperate skill imperial contactsit grants subconcord level npc assistance when attacked rising with level to quite something quite tough in the end wouldnt stop wars but would definitely give more of an advantage to the aggressed would make ganking unarmed ships in a single cruiser impossible even in war but would not stop a fleetof course the argument is irrelevant anyway there are only 2 types of people in hisec anyway those who want it to be a free fire zone and those who want no pvp there at all
but its working as intended for the most part any serious retooling of the wardec system is not necessary as it is working as intended npc corps and highsecurity space and mission grinding is a nonpvp play style until someone suicides your ship as you pointed out yourselfwhich are rather borked i agree but these are fine details  wardeccing as a system works rather fine with a few annoying bits fundamental changes such as objectives are hardly necessary
agreed there has to be some way to make this a little bit less time consuming
i set up a small pos on sisi to see what my own pos would be like and setting the thing up took a ridiculous amount of time allow the tower to anchor and online multiple mods at once that way you wouldnt have to sit idle for hours to click 20 times
damn poses even fueling is a pain in the ass
also why not have the anchoring skill give some functional bonus to the speed of anchoringonlining pos modules
yeah pos interfaces could use some love

im totally against this proposed change as ive said the pirates already have things going for them in their favor the only thing you could do more for the pirates is to give all of them an i win button making local an optional channel will only make things perilous for the nonpirate players
im not even a pirate and i lold at thiswhen you enter low sec00 you are agreeing that you are a viable target to those players who want to shoot people so you should always be ready to defend yourselfi have done a lot of cov ops work for my currentprevious corps and the only time i worry is when jumping into a system which maymay not be camped on tother side if local is hot then i have ways of getting to next gatewherever without putting myself in danger however if local is empty i just warp to next gateif i have no idea how many people are in local then i have to fly by the seat of my pants in every system surely this is only a good things as it make life more fundangerousentering lowsec or 00 and moaning you have been killed is ridiculous because eve is all about the intelplay smart adapt to the surroundings
hey look all the carebears are still nerd raging and havent contributed anything to the thread except whining even if this change made it easier to gank miners ratters etc  which it would not   pvpers would actually want to hang around where their buddies are rattingmining in order to protect them and get fights at the same time you must admit that to see a group of industrialists and a group of pvpers working together is rare in this game and to me that is quite absurd why are things like this because if you want to be 100 completely safe in 00 you can be if you know what you are doing basically what you are saying is thisi want all the rewards and none of the risk in an area that is designed to be a riskreward environmentas coceo of a corporation the idea of my logistics and pvp players having a reason to work closer together a   makes sense and b   makes my heart sing with joyscenario there is no such thing as local chat and mr jones rat killer extraordinaire is happily blasting away at some serpentis in his laser raven without a care in the world a crow warps in and a rapier decloaks 15kms away from him because he was too lazy to be watching his scanner luckily he was aligned he hits warp and is gone before either can lock himso basically i am saying that any argument you big girls have brought to the table is not a solution to the discussion at hand get a better argument or get out of my thread
there should not be any mandatory chat channel that autoshows everyone whos joined the intel function of the current local should be performed by an improved  but still limited in range and other functionality   ships scannerlet me reiterate a constellation chat as described by the op is a very bad idea  as bad as current local  
i vote no and here is why you can spend long amounts of time scanning in local and find dozens of ships on scanner how am i supposed to know if those ships are being flown or if they are parked or what i dont want to come into every system and ask is anyone in here and have to constantly scan to find a target and see if it is actually moving local is fine the way it is you say it helps the miner not really the miner will have to constantly scan if someone could be warping in on him helps the potential attacker i disagree you just made him have to scan local to find out if anyone is actually in it now then pinpoint him and this just adds time to his overall game play where as previously he could just warp into a system see zero targets and move on i can agree with your point that it provides information that there are people in the system but you dont neccessarily know where and what they might be flying or if they are cloaked etc it doesnt give that much intel just a heads up hey pal youre not alone in here so again i vote no leave it alone also please notice i know how to spell and i am giving you a reason per your request op edit what may be a solution is a ticker that actually shows how many people are actually in the system currently but not who but again i have been playing for a few years and this is a constant that i and many other players are used to removing it is kind of like losing a thumb
why couldnt local work the way like many other chats as in  only show those who chatmaybe keep number of people in system still there though
pro local changeagainst constellation change
even if they did nothing but boost the base optimal by 10km id be far happier
a quick glance reveals that minmatar encryption methods is required to invent t2 tracking computers and tracking enhancers so id say they are fairly focused on tracking  not to mention that autocannons have pretty good tracking  my main issue is that the 1400mm artillery uses so much powergrid in comparison to the fitting grid of all minmatar battleships meaning that you are almost always better fitting 1200mm insteadall the use of battleshipsize minmatar weapons are exactly what i expect from them high alpha low dps if anything id have to say that im only in favour of a possible grid reduction on artillery fitting if any change at all
artillery needs a boost at all sizes just 1400mm is the most visible because it has the largest gap when compared to rails and beams especially now that there are ranged bonused ships that use those weapons additionally the issue isnt entirely with the guns themselves  though they do need 75 better tracking and 10 more range and maybe a bit more damage   the main comparison people do with 1400mm arty is the sniper battleships and the tempest is just terrible compared to a rokh or apoc and is even bad when compared to a mega or abaddon the tempest is the only one that cant dd tank and hit to 150km it relies on midslot trackingopt modules where as the others rely on lowslot mods which are far superior also they use too much grid or alternately the bss doesnt have enough grid just freeing up the low slot that we currently need for an rcu2 would help slightlyfix all arty and fix minmatar battleships
i fully support this issue
this thread shows exactly why having to post to show support isnt the worlds greatest idea  they certainly have made improvements but it still occasionally  and randomly   decides that one login isnt enough but 15 is just right

theres a search function where
the one im referring to is at the top of the right sidebar on all pages youd think itd search the item database and guides and stuff but it only seems to return forum hits from about 2005 the real search function is at wwwevesearchcom of course but as useful as chribba is to have around we shouldnt need thirdparty tools to implement a forum search algorithm worth a damn
hello this shouldnt even be something we have to ask for its like asking nicely to please have your car fixed the right way
i support the discussion of this issue with ccp
yes a capital hi sec miner would be great while we are at it can we add better ore to lv 4 missions or have mining missions that dont suck like a hoover
its quite simplewhat we need to do is get rid of macros  mining will get a lot more profitable over time as theres none to seed the mineral market 237   heavily limit the 00lowsec minerals you get from refining stuff  megacyte and zydrine    would make lowsec mining more attractive  thoughts
i personally think mining yield and such are fine and im quite happy with my oretime returnwhat i am not happy about is the severe lack of shipsequipment which i can use when mining where are the named variant strip miners with lower fitting requirements and maybe a little better range where the faction mods we received mlus like this but wheres the rest and i want more mining platform choices why cant ore have 4 mining cruisers each with a mix of procon one with a 5 mining laser range per level bonus with more cargo space or one with less range and space but fast as a nano frig for the ninja miners give me options from ore  true mining ships not a vexor with a mining bonus as a work around   so that i can improve my mining experience that doesnt involve increasing yields as it stands now once you start a mining career your only general choices are mining barge or exhumer no other race versions etc just like pvp some people would prefer range over yield damage   or speed over yield damage   in some circumstances but miners dont have these optionsas a combat pilot i can have my choice of 40 ships with which to pve or pve just in the frig class in the same amount of training time as it takes to train for an exhumer  all racial frigs to 5 assault ships to 4 interceptors to 4   the more choices i have means more fun in being able to find the right ship for the right environment but with mining there are very few choices and a pet peevewheres the mining command ship i dont think they require all command ships to remove their weapons slots in order to provide gang boosts so why are all the mining gang boosting ships unable to fit mining lasers wheres the cs hulk with 2x strip miners and one gang link slot a 2man pvppve gang can benefit when a cs is one of the ships so why should mining require 6 miners before a cs pilot will be more beneficial than having them mining
well considering i guess no one wants to really know or ask from the developer what is the future of the t2 bpos will be i mean we have a thread full of whinage screaming and yelling to removed them  yet not one of those whiners came here  even though i linked the thread there  to actually do such a simple thing as to askanyway if you actually want to know what do the developers think about t2 bpos not engage in pointless discussion about the merits then show support and request for a new dev blog on t2 bpos
awww you forgot to stipulate that there shouldnt be any invention vs bpo isk profit calculations so expect this thread to get derailed by all the john maynard keyes wannabes like every other thread on the topicit would be nice to hear from this devs on this topic more often than once a year at fanfest its obviously one of the topics they wont touch with a 10 foot pole in the forums so csm any chance the topic can be riased
while i support this and would like to have a dev response i do not think we will get one  here   until and unless the csm brings the issue to ccpperhaps the issue should be a request that the csm bring to ccp that a weekly dev blog or response to a player defined issue  in this case the future of t2 bpos   problem then being how do the players define an issue to be discussed
sure id like to know what the devs have planned for bpos
supported
i would love to see one though i doubt it would help the whiners will continue to whine dev blog or no dev blog at least then ill have a onelink answer to them
supportedi stand for bringing those bpos back into game however instead of the lottery it would be nice the be able to get them through achieving high ranks in faction militia or through lp stores  additionaly having a higher faction standings would be required to be able to get better bpos  invention is great i believe though in my opinion while it its a chance based thing it is not much interresting for some of us imho as it is chance based bpcs from invention should be given ome extra stats rather than minus  like base me20 rather than me5  that would make getting bpc still a bit profitable while researching t2 bpos should be very hard and expensive   the thing that some peoples had the chance to get the bpos and now noone else can is a bit unfair to methats my opinion   
i support the issue of asking the dev team to make it known to the community at this time the plans for the t2 bposps dont forget to tick the support box or it wont show as support
tech 2 bpos reward the people that put the time and effort into the gamewhen ccp decided that they were going to remove tech 2 bpos from being brought into the game nobody received any more tech 2 bposthat is fairccp has also openly stated that they will not be reinstating the t2 lottery
agreed please buff
i was quite excited when i heard about these ships and totally disappointed when they finally came out the jump drive uses way too much fuel and for the cost of the ship it really isnt that much beter
i agree the gap is too large going from a 1m isk ship to a almost 1b isk ship is not an easy task a ship around 100m and 70100k m3 would be greatgreat idea
having just recently gotten my freighter on an alt i realize just how big that thing is compared to the medium amount i need to moveso i of course support this as well d
i agree we need something that can haul more than the t1 haulers i believe that the deep space haulers should have had a much larger cargo capacity but im willing to take a minifreighter instead if this wont work

if someone was banned for anything out of game that wasnt illegal that doesnt involve time codes yes it should be reviewed there is no pandoras box thereedit basicaly what im saying is you dont know its opening pandoras box id ont know of anyone else ever who has been banned for something out of game that didnt invovle time codes even if there is more then him we dont know that you should error on the side of protecting the playerbase then error on the side of ccp is right because kugu proved already they arnt always rightedit2 the whole reason the council was created was to prevent abuse from ccp employees on the game to me that should include looking into kugu getting banned because from my point of view thats exactly what it is
baemp
posting in a thread i support
i guess the point is that at the time he was being banned ccp was pretty much going emo on his a and they basicly banned him for giving them a hard time a good reason would have been because he posted rl information on the forums but so did molle at the time and he didnt get banned for that  i wont link to the blog where the most of this is explained but it isnt hard to find  im no fan of the man nor his play style but what ccp did wasis wrong imho and id applaud the csm if they try and sort this out with ccp
i think you misunderstand the purpose of the council the council is there to review gamerelated issues brought up by the players and determine which are worthy of ccps attention as has been pointed out by those on both sides of the argument this is not a gamerelated issue everything about it happened outside of the game and it in no way affects the functioning of the game this is a customer service issue if kugu has a problem with it he needs to work through the channels of customer service if people feel strongly enough about it to support him they should write letters to ccps customer service department stating that support this should not be brought to a player council designed for reviewing gamerelated issuesit most definetely is opening pandoras box as you are asking the csm to consider the case of an individual player and grant preferential treatment based on the popularity of the individuals case it is opening the door to potential corruption of the csm through favoring individuals it is setting a precedent of favoritism to the popular and wellknown and it is involving the csm in issues beyond the scope of where they should be focusing their timeas i said before if the csm wants to push ccp to develop a review process available to all banned players that may still be stretching their jurisdiction but i could find acceptable the csm should definetely not start looking at individual cases its not their place and in the end its not within their power to do anything about it the csm exists to suggest ideas to ccp about how to improve their game not to tell them how to run their business
i believe that a clearer banning process and implementation should be looked at along with appeals
i wouldnt disagree there but that is not what you are supporting by giving this thread a thumbs up
supported
unban the guy hes a genuine eve martyr as far as i am concerned
this is actually what the csm was created for this incident should certainly be reviewed as its the big things that was the cause for csm to be started the members of the csm should look at ccps actions here and see if they were reasonable
supporting because i think the whole business was shady
the whole purpose of the csm is oversight thats why the idea came up i dunno what you think it is but it was created in response to devs playing the game and cheating while they doing it that oversight should include dealing with the emo reaction that was banning kugu plane a simple as its directly involved with the reason the csm was created and the only unresolved issue involving the incident still out there
yes
given thisim voting yes because id like a more uptodate response than 2005 id also like to hear a good argument as to why a next skill causes any issues with character farming and ebay and so onbtw a workaround is not a solution eve is still irritating at times because of its intrusion into life when you just dont need it heck at least in the other mmos where i have to grind xp  and i hate grinding   im doing so on my terms
my support
doesnt even need to be a full queue id be happy just being able to set a backup skill that kicks in whenever the primary skill im training runs out
a 48 hour queue would be fantastcfailing that at least allow us to set 1 or two skills to train in succession
supported
i support this but it should only be one skill deepimoalsobefore it starts the new skill in queue it takes a minue break to check if account is still activeif it isnt then no more skilling will be done
the how long the player plays should be determining how long the skill queue can go1 month  6 hours3 months  24h6 months  48h1 yr  4 days2 yrs  one week3 yrs  two weekno problem with char grinding anymore   orat least 2 skills at lvl5  6 hours5 skills  24hoursand so   
yes lets hear ccps reasons for not having one im sure we could work together to smooth out details to prevent it from being abused its just rather hard to discuss something when one party isnt saying anything
what is wrong with just not automatically stopping a skill at the next level
gankers suck and fear this thread
ive done a bit of ganking in empire over the years and the risktimereward does not lend itself to removing insurance at all well unless your a total empire carebear mission runner looking for a 100 safe environmentin fact the gankers need a boost as less and less empire rats are dropping faction loot
no insurance payout
i agree mission runners should not get insurance
yes a thousand times yes
the devs considered removing learning skills from the game but at present they have no plans for removing them i really dont see what the problem with learning these skills are learning skills were introduced to increase the speed of which you learn they dont slow you down at all before learning skills were introduced the attributes were no different and learning skills were there as an investment in time which helped players learn new skills if they took time to do so with this in mind i find it a difficult pill to swallow when i see players say that they slow down you overall learning as they are seen as mandatory the net effect is that increase your sp per hour not reducei can see the differing points of view in this thread and i can understand that some players may be put off with the prospect of putting 2 weeks into learning skills i however have seen most of the players i have talked to been actively encouraged by learning skills and feel they add to the game i feel i have kept and introduced new players to the game not lost themthe eve community has mixed emotions about learning skills i cant see learning skills being removed from the game and if they were you can be assured that ccp would reimburse the investment made saying otherwise is outright foolishthere is one possible work around for learning skills if they do eventually fall into the grey what could be done is to give all players in eve 800000 sp and include this in the new character creation and invest these skill points into learning skills this way new players would gain a great deal jumping to 16 million skill points and they wont need to spend a great deal of time in learning skills older players such as myself will almost not notice an 800000 increase and would in fact serve to close the gap a little between veteran and new players which in itself is an issue for debate ccp did do this once before in a patch not long after i started playing it was the most fair and equitable method conceivable at the time
maybe you should go back and read the part where i trained the skills myself past tense been there done that i think that buys me a little authority on the matterso far as compensating those of us who have trained the learning skills i gave my suggestions for it i dont think that it is a bad idea to do so my point was just that i hated having to go through those skills so much that i personally could care less whether i was compensated as long as it meant the skills would be gone i never said to take away anything from those with the skills just said that personally i would feel little loss if the skills were removed without compensationwe did it so should you is not a valid reason for a decision if there is a better way to handle the situation why not take it
no support for this ideai would infact suggest even more advanced learning skills being introduced
the role of the csm chair was intended to be a person who simply controlled the duration of the discussion and made a call to vote they were not supposed to be the one that set the agenda and decided how the various issues would be approached and solved it was not an administrative position as much as it was an organizational positionjade is trying to make it an administrative position where he has power over the others more equal than his equals so to speak
moar support
ill give a thumbs up for this idea i like both points but point 2 wouldnt work for me at home i have a dynamic ip and work is static and i play from both locations nice idea
id be very interested in seeing some metrics on hacked accounts before i could subscribe to a particular strengthening of account security especially if it makes it more difficult for me to play the game from multiple machines without static ip addresses which i often doi am assuming that a very large majority of hacked accounts are simply people sharing their login information with other people and no amount of security measures will reign in stupid people even malicious software that reads your login information is easy to prevent if you are careful
supported but i favor serenitys ideathat toghter whit ip logs that you could access thru your account page
never can have enough security
mutes you
sometimes this site advertises the ebordello sometimes its that penandpaper rpg thing the last time i heard of it the google cache  
can i bet isk that this will get more support than jades destructable outpost thread
what doesnt
if i was going to complain about anybodys rp characters id go after the guy who fights wars to protect and expand the territory of slavers fortunately im not a moron
should i be considering this goon threadnaught with all due respect herschel
i dont think ive ever advocated obvious parodies making it onto the agenda which of my comments are you referring to
scandalousrabble rabble rabble
if this was a threadnaught it would be huders nay thousands of posts long and the forums would be locked down this is peoples opinions of your life where in which they dont feel confided in your ability to make sound decisions
a space bordello great
is this even legal
its actually kind of sad when you think about it  
horrible idea no support
i would love for the invulnerability of outposts to be discussed but im not sure this is the way to do it
really he was talking about things on our private email list thats a little bit unprofessional
hes allowed to talk about anything he said himself i dont really see an issue with it i can understand if he was showing us your emails or anyone elses emails but showing his own is perfectly fine
you of all people talking about something being unprofessional is peak irony at this point
well you said he told you what i said too i didnt give permission for him to talk about my emails
the general gist of the information is not whats at stake here the only thing would be an actual quote
not true  a private list is private and breaking privacy on such a list short of admission of criminal acts and i mean real crime not the odd joint or jaywalk   is a really low thing to do  both on darius part and on yours if you cant keep a secret you wont get to see any in future besides breaking privacy on what happens on such a list just shows a lack of imagination  we have a history in the csm now of issues being added via csm member request on the forums if darius wanted to  about jade not adding this issue he should have just calmly posted a link to it in the meeting 5 thread on jita park and asked for it to be heard at that meeting the private is kept private and the same ends are achieved everybody who needs to know what happened still does and he comes out of it looking better and embarrassing jade even more to the other csms that would be the case otherwise not only is it stupid and immature to break privacy on the list it shows a terrible deficiency of deftness
wow hello pot meet kettle dude you make gw bush look like a einstein
anyone else on the council can talk about their emails just fine and we all know anything and everything youve been saying has been footstomping and temper tantrums
if the majority of csm believes you incapable of doing your job and disruptive you should step down it shouldnt have to fall to ccp to tell you that
there has never been any implied or otherwise expectation of privacy on the mailing list i talked with people about what we were discussing as im sure others have i have friends i tell them what im doing now if i went and forwarded all the emails id agree that would have been wrong but merely saying hey heres what i was discussing is far from a breach of privacy and i submit that the only reason people are taking umbrage with it is that theyre ashamed of themselves and their actions they should beedit id like to note as well that you were aware of this before ever posting your response and acting ignorant because i told you yesterday i also included everyone else on the mailing list in that statement oh my god ive done it again
but it is his job to tell them how to behave and they have been misbehaving naughty little children and are deserving of a timeout
but but but democracy
i think you should view the terms of service you agreed with when you signed up to that mailing list darius serenity is the provider of that mailing list and you should go and have a read of his last message before you continue this line of argumentyou might also want to review your decision to raise the publication of emails from that list on sundays agenda up to you but might save us all some time
if you mentioned it to aprudena with the expectation of privacy then ill largely let you off the hook  i dont mind confidantes but its still on you to make sure that it doesnt go public also im not sure that youre referring to me with the edit  weve never had a conversation of any type that wasnt through these forums so i doubt that youve told em anything
are you threatening to have him sued
you read my response to this exact question yesterday thats fine though im not afraid of it being public i republished nothing therefore ive violated no terms of service if serenity wants to remove the email account i dont need and never asked for thats his business one less mailbox for me to monitor i still intend to motion to have the emails published on sunday its not mine or the csms problem if serenitys mail system ends up being incompatible with the needs of the csm in that case we picked the wrong tool for the job
sorry on the last point i was talking to jade regarding the expectation of privacy the conversation was mentioned on a private forum but so what if i decide to share my discussions with others thats my prerogative im a public official my voters have a right to know what the council is doing
quality drama here moar plox
i assumed something like that had happened as for the its my right defence it probably is but i wasnt arguing legalities or even moralities i was just saying thats not how you should do business  public is public private is private and never the twain shall meet even if you had the right to republish every csm internal email of your own accord you would not be right to do so its one of those unwritten rules about how to conduct yourself in general and in politics in particular  dont rat people out and break confidences without a damn good reason
i had no reason to believe any confidences existed now the point is moot because ive made it clear that nothing said to me is private when it comes to council discussion again nothing whatsoever save some of my own emails was published all of this was known and explained to the entire council yesterday a good question would be why is jade feigning shock and indignance today this is old news at this point
as long as youve made that clear fine im sure the 8man mailing list will get lots of traffic as for jades reaction i havent seen too much shock and the indignance could well be legit
here ill quote the bits im referring to for you
not much shock thats true and not much actual drama i think its poor to break confidences once agreed though
okay yeah if what you say is true then hes hamming that up
dont imply that ive agreed to anything i havent and you know that i said as much in the email youre pretending i didnt send yesterday
i wasnt referring to your jade quotes with the if what you say is true i was referring to the bit about how the council already knew
we have a long way to go i bolded where we are at the silly part is jade has brought this grief upon his or her self denial anger bargaining depression acceptance
well add this to another reason jade will be voting against releasing them
theyre my emails jades consent doesnt come into play nor does anyone elses
quick somebody go back and find those posts where jade was saying he supported full transparency and such im getting lazy also i support my own topic
oo
what is the constitution that jade keeps talking about was it written by the council was it written by ccp can anyone link to it
their is no constitution he made it up
i guess we all know that feeling
but i think we can all say that a tool certainly was picked for this jobsupported
i care alot about this game which is why i invest alot of my personal time in it jade has shown his character and it is one that is not suitable for running on the chair of a council that i have entrusted the future of my game to supported
jade is a loose cannon he should be taken off the case
i havent really cared about this csm and decided to poke into it i read 4 threads thoroughly and ive gotta agree jade cant handle power or things beyond his controlmaybe thats not enough to say anything on the matter but thats what ive gathered
clearly unsuitable for the task
from what i have seen on jades behaviour i must support the removal of jadei will be very highly surprised if anything comes of this though
any place i can find the chatlogs of this event
i am not exactly known to be jades bumchum but this is taking on ridicolous proportions i think the message that people are unhappy with jades conduct during the last meeting has come across by nowif this persists all the important issues will get burried in all the outrage threads or maybe that is exactly the plan to just undermine the csm and make sure it gets nothing done which would be a shame as it is in general a good idea
after reading the logs different threads and observing the behavior of the main actors of this drama i wanted to make a comedy post here asking to not throw jconstantine out of his  so loved   chair just for the sake of the good lulzbut i came across a  now locked  thread in an external forums  shc   about this csm thing i was literaly shocked to see the posts of that guy there and i was even more disgusted when i saw his website linked there  concerning his roleplay  so i decided to come here and vote against thatguynot only because of his roleplay choices but mainly because of his psychotic dictatorial behavior and his inaptitude to handle a process who will maybe decide of our future gameplaynow to get back on his roleplay choices i would like to tell him that its the kind of stuffs that made a bad name of roleplay in general and you must not forget that there is also kids playing this game roleplaying in an internet spaceship game should be about  spaceships politics and economics nothing else lets cut short your paranoia  im not a goon alt i think i even shooted at them once  
if it was only the last meeting things would have blown over by now but jade keeps putting more fuel on the fire with practically every post he makeshe should have just said sorry and moved on
jade seriously step down you have gone way way to far your refusal to even look at the fact your wrong you are a goonswarm hater you see them everywhere you turn do you check under your bed too read up on mccarthyism and read up on how much of a nut he was your rite up there with him seek some rl professional help
actually he said screw you  or words to that effect   and then moved onunfortunately the rest of you did not so he is still responding to your crap he should have joined goons as the sort of behavior they are criticizing in him is something they applaud in and from their members
the whole idea was to make the csm a channel whereby we  paying customers   may voice our issues with ccp via community reps after reading the logs of the meeting where all this occurred and the subsequent postings by jade on this subject ive come to realise that the csm is chaired by someone in it for his own benefit and who has no intention of being a neutral chairbasically get out if you keep this crap up the csm will get nowhere
disappointing behaviour
isshould it even be possible for the council to alter a position determined by popular vote in the csm electionsid say noalso goons continuing to stir  up just shows that despite all their talk they are undemocratic they are all in favor of democratic elections they are not in favor of the results of democratic elections
after giving this a long thought i just started to wonder if jade seems to realize that he has a huge responsibility on his shoulders representing all those who voted for him and same goes for the rest of the csmyou all have to learn to work together and really think about improving eve by representing the views of the playersas csm your actions have rl consequences with possible influence of jobs at ccpthink about it
whats kept my attention is how jade has managed to make goons look good with his actions considering they are generally a group of rowdy hooligans who happily play to the limits of allowable behaviour in game  hi2u jihadswarm and recruitment channel people   this is quite an accomplishmentim also gonna disagree with some of the views in this thread about darius being disruptive and trying to break the csm process if anything hes trying to get its sorry ass up and running and looking to actually get stuff donejade can you either sort this mess out asap or just give up the chair to someone who will actually treat the position properly the csm are the players chance to voice their issues to ccp through the csm and you have so far managed to sandbag it terribly
inanna had every right to act as she did i think she acted very reasonably after having one vote editorialised and then being locked out of channel  apparently accidentally   for a revoteafter reading all this thread and all the logs  good grief   yes
id say yes lets go for a rl analogy here if your presidentleader of choice goes bat insane in the middle of hisher term and starts firing nukes off all over the place do the vicepresidentleader and all the other elected leaders say oh crap we voted for this idiot we got two more years of this no there are ways of removing incompetents as there should be a way of removing jade
yawn i cant belive you started yet another thread about it since he got elected as chair people started campaigning to get him out of this position the only thing jade should be sorry about is giving this bunch another reason by an not needed mute even tt and verone  who stated that he is happy that he stepped out of csm so he cant be that worried about the outcome of it  jumped into it crying censorship where there was moderating and waving their names to score some easy eveceleb pointsalso ccp wake up and help the guys to sort some basic rules out if this fails its to a great part your fault giving it not enough consideration dont think you can hide behind the poor sods  thats all the csm reps  who stood up and tried  more or less   to make this workno support for this only ccp should be allowed to replace the chair also ccp should indeed get a dev to do chair as no player will be neutral and able to defend against claims to be biased
i am sure that if jade does go bat  insane and starts trashing ccp offices they will do something about it but until then comparing his muting of a disruptive member to mass world wide murder is just pathetic
not supported iUFFFDm a pretty new player and all these things about goons or whatever donUFFFDt interest mewhat interests me is if someone speaks mature  so far as it is possible in a game environment   with reason and is open for dialogue and not just sending his opinionsanother point is that this is a destrucive issue a construcive would have been to propose another csm member for chair but even if the issue about how the chair is chosen out is already on the agenda with ccp as far as i understood
do you fear the apocalypse
keep posting you are giving a good example for your bat  crazy theory
i was giving an extreme example of why most votes isnt the beall and endall of a good leader get over yourself you oversensitive crybaby
yep the  electable chairissue was raised by me  ironically   it was posted on the assembly hall for 7 days public discussion  tick  it got public support and csm member endorsement  tick  raised on the agenda in a formal csm meeting  tick  got voted for by the csm committee 422  tick  i documented it yesterday and sent it to the csm secretary  tick  and its getting submitted to ccp 7 days in advance of the conference as specified in our docs  tick  this is how you get issues that can impact the constitutionfoundation documentation of the csm into formal discussion ive explained this quite a few times what would have been nice to see on the agenda as well would have been issues raising the question of a nonvoting ccp provided chair a rotating chair proposals of that sort i think there is a problem with a voting csm member acting in the role of chair and its something we need to consider but we do need to raise issues in the proper fashionthis kind of thread  op post   doesnt help much because its just a lot shouting and no csm advocacy as long as it doesnt gain 5 of total player base in support  or specific csm advocacy   it wont get added to the agenda automatically but even getting a thread like this onto issues agenda doesnt mean the issue  itself   could get voted on there and then in any case the principle of whether we in the csm think its an important matter for the player base as a whole will be considered on the csm and a vote held on the subject of whether we commend the issue to ccps attention if it gets through that vote then it must then be raised in the csmccp discussions at the formal conference since ccp need to have final sign off on any of these constitutional changesid like to see more people actively trying to understand the process at work here since it would render the apparent motivation behind a lot of these threads void and let us see more important issues getting the air time they deserve
you think this isnt importantif csm wouldnt be able to get their act together all issues wouldnt get handled properlyyou dont have to agree or even like each other just that you accept your responsibility to give this your utmost best to make it work that applies to all members that you owe to all the people that voted for you
 sorry the morgenreiter was the first try char  just some thoughts out of political experiencethe chairmanwoman of an institution  the council in this case   and of a meeting donUFFFDt have to be the samein rlpolitics the chair of an institution it can be several but this makes some things more complicated is the representative for outer relations like media and so onthe chair of a conference can rotate or be elected at the beginning of each sessiona big question is if the council really must publish the whole log of a meeting this is a source of endlesslike it is now a short protocol is much more useful even for the public these are normally to be confirmed at the beginning of the following meeting the discussions to the issues happen already here in the forum if the council spends much time discussingfighting with each other its the councils businesstransparency would be given if it stood there how each member voted on an issueit would certainly reduce the gossip factor the question is if this is wantediUFFFDd really like to see what kind of figure other csm members would give as moderators to the question of alternates as substitutes itUFFFDs the most normal thing of the world that when a regular member steps out an alternate moves in and vice versa when the regular comes back on big party conferences you just cant sit there three days 16 hours each at all time for exampleby the way many seem to think of the council as some party thing like highsecpeopleparty pvpersunion certain alliances and so onthe mechanics of the council and its election are not exactly designed in this way and this has not only consequences for the questions concerning alternatesthere is a gap that needs clarification over long
no i like jade some good stuff in the manifesto
nope this thread isnt important latest meeting of the csm thats what people getting down to the hard work of actually being csm reps looks like
holy sweet jesus batmanthis is absolutely ridiculous ccp should reduce the number of standings slots not increasei cant believe the nonsense and ridiculousness by rp nrds people of course cva and paxton buddies are all for this to keep people from shooting themthe problem with 00 in this game is the napfailtrain 300400 man super gangs of failure blues should be extremely restricted based on alliance size if you cant get what you want done on your own or with a proportionate amount of friends you shouldnt be able to wither up and call on every failtard out there to serve your intereststhe servers cant handle the player base cant stand the lag and if there were a simple overview change to limit naps from being removed these nod crashing lamegangs wouldnt happen good thing the csm has no power other than to act like a internet beauracracy
im with matrix cut the ing naptrains already less standings slots
with heavy missiles hitting outside web range no real need to fit a web tbh with jav missiels they are also fast enough to hit most nanoshipsa pdu and a rig are better than multiple rcus as in the other setups and a pdu actually helps shield tanks and recharges captheres another rig slot in the fit that can be used to fit an antiem shield rignothing wrong with using a named mwd as it still gets the job done usues less pg and cpu and uses less capeditabove there was a sugestion made to compare using the long range turrets vs the short range in the comparison think it is valid as heavy missiles hit from further away using the close range guns in the comparison you dont actually calculate the captime used in getting in range for the guns and the cap used staying in range while the longer range guns can hit from about the same distance as hmls canand why so intence on fitting a gang mod on the nh when the vulture was designed perfectly for them
what you are conveniently ignoring is that the nighthawk is an antisupport ship the very ships it is designed to target are fast enough to nearly entirely negate missile damage thanks to a generally low missile explosion velocity a web is actually far more important than a scram for the nighthawk fitting a scram without a web is simply stupid as frigatesixed ships will simply ignore your damage get out of 20k and then wave goodbye as they warp offthat isnt really the freaking point is it the point is that other command ships dont have to waste slots or rigs to make things fit a basic setup for the nighthawk requires  as in not optional   two or three fitting mods or rigs other command ships can fit similar setups with one or noneread above other command ships wont have to sacrifice even one rig slot why should the nighthawk  oh and ps his posted setup doesnt even fit the nighthawk will have to use two fitting mods and rigs to even fit such a pathetic setup  true but other command ships dont have to use named mwds so again read abovebecause the nighthawk is the only missilebased command ship some people spec certain weapons and expect the ships theyve specd for to actually work however lets theoretically fit a nighthawk and all the other command ships without a gang mod guess what the nighthawk is still exactly as far behind all the other command ships as it was with the gang mod
please can we get away from the pve fixation this is pvp missiles are very poor longrange weapons despite what eft says because of flight time and target velocity issues especially on a ship lacking missile velocity and explosion velocity bonuses the nighthawk is best regarded as a close range cs whether fitting hmls or hams broadly comparable to a pulse abso or sleipniras for the gang mod comment oh come on not only is it the nighthawks role to fit one role bonus 99 reduction in warfare link module cpu need but also as weve shown many many times the other field cs fit a gang mod with only minor fitting compromises is it really too much to ask for equality for the nighthawk or is the nighthawk just a bad joke designed to prop the rcu ii market up
lets look at say scourge precision heavy missile base speed 3250 ms base flight time 525sec add skills in there and thats one fast and farflying missile most nanoships do not orbit with their mwd on other than in some cases and with most of them even when they do mwd they will get hit with these misseils they are afraid of missile ships for this reasonand warp dissy range is 24km not 20kmfast ships tend to stay outside web range so kinda a wasted midnot every ship in eve is the same keeps thing diverse and makes you use your brain when fittingso fit what ya gotta fitfalse nh is notthe only missile cs the damnation also is missile specd
missiles arent bad for pvp and im not in usin eft ive played this game for the past few years and can tell yo uby experence that missiles arent too terrable for pvpall battlecruisers have that same roll but do you see every brutix ferox and proph fitting gang mods nopeand yes it is too much to ask forjust came back from sisi and it took multiple bcs to take out a nighthawk it absorbed more than 50k damage easy
posting in this storm because hes banned again
signedits not just the nighthawk that is issue the caldari hacs are awful the eagle is the worst hac in the game bar maybe the cerb which is paper thin and a flawed concept sniping with missiles is silly especially with the magic 4000 ms where missiles no longer deal damage fix precision fix the eagle fix the cerb fix our command ships caldari uses the worst 2 weapon systems in the game right now long range missiles and rail guns

i use missiles exclusively in pvp i think i know what im talking about theyre excellent closerange weapons but rather poor at range in any case a nighthawk has no way of keeping range thanks to all those rcus so typically it will end up fighting at close range anywaywhy are you bringing up battlecruisers the nighthawk is a not a battlecruiser what is this rubbish the relative ease of fitting of gang mods on battlecruisers is as irrelevant as the colour of the sand on the ocean floor we are talking about the relative balance of fitting of gang mods on field cs and the nighthawk is far far out of linemultiple bcs to take out a nighthawk ok you really are being thick here you cannot fit a good tank on a pvpfit nighthawk you need to understand why this is or this thread will be a morass of confusion for you the nighthawk does not have the pg or medslots to fit a strong tank in pvp any time you see a nh taking 50k damage it is a uselessbrick passiveregen tanked pve fit utterly without merit or use in pvp again your belief that it is useful indicates that you are still stuck in pve modeand last but not leastwere currently discussing the relative ease of fitting a gang mod on the field cs of course its modulecentric thats the entire bloody point and even if it wasnt a nighthawk without a gang mod typically requires fitting mods in contrast to the other field cs which dont even when fitting a gang mod your failure to follow the line of discussion staggers me  you are bringing nothing to this thread but confusion misdirection and terrible fits that dont fithead explodeslateeditan extra launcher slot on the nh is not necessary all is needed is the pg to use the ones that it has
so the nighthawk pilot must use a fitting implant instead of a damage or speed or tanking implant that any other command ship pilot could be using even in your nonsensical strategic fitting terms youre once again behind because youre not bringing as much utility to the gang as you could be even if were assuming that people are going to have a clone specifically set up for their command ship lets see what we else we could be doing with that implant slot oh look noble zet101001000 which reduces armorhull repair module duration so thats the astarte and absolution taken care of oh look rogue ay012  ship agility   and ey012  afterburner cap use   both having utility for all four command ships the board but especially good for nano sleipnir while theres nothing in that sixth slot thats especially good specifically for the nighthawk  even if the agility bonus is always useful   if you plan on flying anything other than ships horrifically short on powergrid the 135 grid implant is worthlessthis is ignoring that mediocre fits that arent even competitive with other ships of the same class shouldnt be needing a powergrid implant to begin with
i really cant believe you posted this it is so horrifically ignorant i had to read it twice to make sure i wasnt misreading it
i support this as i see it the nh doesnt really have a role outside pve if you want a bait ship the vulture is better if you want a buffer tanked damage dealer the drake is better command ships will always be outclassed by bs in a straight up fight but they should not be outclassed by t1 battlecruisers
thanks for out of context quote its just supposed to be a possibility thats more useful than 6 decrease in probing time or whatever other crummy implants are in that slot but yes snake omega  rich people   or the agility one are much more useful and i guess it my fault for not making that clear
i agree the nighthawk would need more powergrid
i definitly agree with this
moar powergrid
you entirely ignored my point fast ships can entirely negate missile damage check the explosion velocity on scourge precision missiles tell me do most frigatesized ships go faster than that yes meaning missiles do no damage to them they will have to be webbed regardless the discussion about fitting a webscram or not on the nighthawk is pretty much off topicnice try at avoiding the obvious ships in eve being diverse and different does not excuse one ship out of a category from not being able to fit a basic setup properly luckily most people responding to this thread can do math and have reason and logic enough to figure this out your inability to admit you are wrong  along with erotic irony   is slightly entertaining not to mention neither you nor him are fooling myself or others and you are both keeping the thread bumpedagain thats the whole point if you would bother engaging your brain the nighthawk must fit upwards of two or three fitting mods  along with rigs and implants   to even fit what other command ships can fit using no fitting mods rigs or implants if you cant see the issue with that then you are truly and definitively dense  or a troll  great answer were talking about caldarimissile specd folks here i didnt think id have to spoon feed you and state the obvious caldarimissile specd pilots shouldnt have to cross train for amarr command ships simply because the one ship they have access to has had its powergrid castrated
hahaha so now that erotic botches a setup he thinks nighthawk pilots should  let me get this right    use a pdu  fitting mod   ancillary rig  fitting rig   and a powergrid implant  fitting implant   to fit an absolutely terrible basic nighthawk setup using all of its lowest powergrid components and in the meantime all the other command ships can fit similar setups without the use of a single rig implant or fitting modseriously could i ask for a better illustration that the nighthawk needs help
you stated it was the only missile commandship i was just correcting you
a were talking about field command shipsb were talking about caldari field command shipsit was pretty clear to most anyone what the meaning of my statement was within its context most people dont get huffy about offtopic semantics when they have a good argument
the only one getting huffy here seems to be you
lot of ingorants in this thread trying to defend a gimped ship by claiming that we dont need parity or that it will increase diversity the fact remains that the nighthawk needs significantly more fitting modules for an equivalent fit than do any other command ships that is obviously bad moreover my argument that the nigthawk shouldnt lose grid compared to the drake has yet to be addressedare there any other ships that lose grid like that going from t1 to t2what is a drake fitting that a nighthawk is supposed to ditch if anything the nighthawk is basically a tii drake  gang mod this chart says all that needs to be saidpowergrid of tech 1 bcs compared to tech ii versionshurricane 1350  sleipnir 1460myrmidon 1175  astarte 1450harbinger 1500  absolution 1575drake 850  nighthawk 710  huge decrease wtf  
also yes missiles themselves have all kinds of problems particularly sniping with missiles or trying to hit nanos with missiles or heavy precision missiles and yes the cerb is far less good than the vagabond or ishtar or sacrilege but this thread is about how bad the nighthawks power grid is its a relatively simple and specific fix that i hope to see implemented

am i getting huffy no if youd keep up with the thread youd understand my pointits pretty disconcerting to see people walk in here conveniently ignore 99 of the facts and then present misinformation or offtopic opinions as facts none of this is directed at you by the way  seriously though its almost laughable that people could read all the information presented here and then draw the conclusion that nighthawk pilots should be singled out as the only group of  field   command ship pilots that need to use some variety of powergrid modules rigs or implants in order to make up for the massive shortage of powergrid with which the nighthawk has been burdenedlets take these two options  what makes more sensea nighthawk pilots should use a combination of several powergrid fitting mods rigs and implants in order to fit what other command ship pilots can fit with none or b the nighthawk needs a powergrid increaseafter looking at the facts making one of the above two choices is essentially a nobrainer
at the stupid arguments in here saying it losses pg from a drake when it isnt even designed from a drake but a feroxthing is if you take all the tier 1 bcs youll find theyre pretty poor compared to the tier 2s so of course comparing the tier 1 based commandships to the tier 2 bcs will look daftoh and when comparing your passive setups remember to mention the recharge of the nh it passive tanks what a abso would need a mar to repnot saying nh doesnt need anything just laughing at some of the extreme arguements being used and dodgy setups hint if you want more diversity dont try and force ships into practically same setups then whine when they dont fit
oh wow how could we have missed this ok lets see now ferox 1000 mw nighthawk 710 pg so we now need 290 pg for balance nice one einstein the drake  nh comparison is perfectly valid because both are missile spammers with similar pg requirements even the bloody onyx with one launcher less and no gang mod to fit has more pg than the nighthawk  710 vs 835this is not true firstly peak regen only occurs at 30 shield so would only be equivalent to a mar across a very brief range secondly its not true anyway dual mar abso tanks with one mar active around 300 dps depending on fit peak passive regen on a buffer nh is around 200 dps the abso is 50 better even if the nh could somehow be perpetually held at peak regen which it cantnow what were you saying about dodgy arguments
i was going to respond to this inane post but gypsio already pwned youedit  i will address the following ridiculous comment though as several people have been dense enough to make ithow many people are truly stupid enough to believe that a ship not being able to fit what it is intended to fit creates diversity how about we tell the devs not to bother tweaking any ships for fitting ever again because theyll ruin the diversity in fact lets just double the grid on tachyons to really add some diversity to the game
uhhh if people think diversity means not being able to fit a ship the right way then they need to lay off the stupid pills

this is a good question it needs resolving
i knew id find some support sooner or laterim just looking at options really for me and others who do what i do aggro against the salvager is not an option there will never be a day when i will vote yes to give the mission runner the right to shoot me for salvaging a wreck in spacejust thinking out loud
they have said coutnless time that this is working as intended if you arent going to salvage your wrecks right aways its your own dumb fault
ccp have already provided you with a solution to this issuethe marauder battleshipthere is a reason these ships have utility slots and additional cargo space
no no ninja salvaging works fine
too complex simple fix is mission gates only work for ppl in the mission or ganged with th person who got the mission
also known as the thin edge of the wedge in making eve an instancegame well actually its the chubby end of the wedge deadspace is already hard enough to scan downand imagine how 100  safe zones in space would affect pvp
hrmm an animation which could be remarkably similar to many peoples custom war or 50 pirate target animation for new arrivals on overviewi dont see this being fraught with peril
i like the idea of this being an option not sure id use it but ti could be there
i dont agreewith fleet fights when youre lagging your asses off and have the option of flash when you enter the battle then everybody would just target you because youre not loaded yet so there is no way in eve you can get out or return fire
i disagree with your opiniongame mechanics in eve fleet battles are sort of out the window anyway so you are bringing a normal game mechanic to a very extreme point of view
good one
very nice supported
if this was an option then itd be a good idea using it in small engagements fw etc then its amazing but 00 fleet battles itll lag you out i like if it can be done and be toggleable
brilliant idea although the flashy animation in your gifs seems a little slow
nice idea
in order to cut down on the spam in this forum both for and against ideas by people voting with all the alts on their accounts i propose the following changes1 each account holder delegates one of their characters on that account to hold the vote for that account this choice cannot be changed once made2 only those characters marked as holding a vote can post in this forum3  optional   you may delegate your vote from your alt account to your main account this means that none of the characters on your alt account may post in this forum however your main account voter will be able to cast the delegated votes this would be represented in the corp ticker although unlike the ticker this cannot be turned offyou may recover your alt accounts vote at any time reducing the votes of the main on any issue hes voted forso for example a persons ticker will end up looking like thisrandomvoter1 represents 3 accounts  racecorporationalliancethis could also be used as part of the voting process for the csm itself thus boosting turnout as itll make it easier to cast all of your available votes rather than having to log in each account to vote individuallyso what do you guys think good idea or back to the drawing board
posting only to support my own op
sounds nice  and supported   but it might be more difficult to set up than its worth
i personally wouldnt mind that being implemented for all forums  although some people use multiple characters legitimately for roleplaying etc   it definately stops a lot of the trolling in here
definitely agree
sure go ahead i would also ask to introduce an against or not supported option as well that way we can see right away how many support it and how many against because people post in the tread wo supporting it or while they have already supported  and it makes it difficult gauging the popularity of the item
absolutely i dont know how you would make 3   work or if its even necessary but the 1 account1 vote policy should be in place
it shouldnt matter what part of your account votes it should just look to see if yuor account has voted why should some people get two votes when i only have one
i dont really care one way or the other but a simple way to implement this would be that only the character with the most sp on any given account can votebut that would also require ccp to make votes private in some capacity  that is to not require a post for affirmative or negative
verry good idea yes alts should be allowed to post in other forums but this one should be main only one person one vote
i agree that there should only be one support vote per accountwhat you are asking for here is a way to link your accounts together this is a great idea and maybe ccp would consider the possibility of working multiple accounts directly into their business plan and pricing giving a discount on the second and any subsequent accountsyou would then select the primary account and a main character  from that account   and that would be your forum posting character which would reflect the support of your accounts as you have outlined posting with any other character from your accounts could see them with an alt tag just like your proposed representation tag and could be easily restricted from posting on caod and the likeif for any reason  and im sure there could be many   you decide to change your main character that could be worked into the paid changes that are already offered with a small charge attached like the current ability to change your portrait
could be hard to set up but would be nice
you could just put the poll option into the forums you dont have to post one vote per account and it puts it at the top of the screen so you can see how much support it has these forums need a revamp
i fully support this issuedrone pilots should receive the same boost from implants as everyone else
lots of love
just buy a g15 or any other keyboard with macro keys
hahahaha this reminds me of a very old sayingdont speak english f1 f2 f3
great idea and with my 5 missile bays id love it should be easy to have the option to assign each module a key and to just let the keys overlap
one of the millions of little ui edits that would make eve a better place and people wonder why i favour a modfriendly ui
here is a list of things id like to see to give eves universe a better immersion factor many of them dont really change anything in eve to cause serious problems and most of them are simple tweaks or additions1 allow players to rent billboards for a period of time allowing them to put up advertisements for various goods and services or corporation recruitment a  option of having ad appear in missions that already have billboards in it wrecked or otherwise2 comets flying past in the background3 more detail in the planets  do they even rotate   a  home planets which can sustain life have discernible land masses and lights  from cities   b  planets have rings c  massive clouds in the backdrop move about4 more activity in stations  ships landing on other pads observe ships departing being repaired etc5 when firing ship guns empty shells are dispensed  except for laser guns anyway  6 when mining asteroids change physically when mined continuously chunks fly off holes appear char marks etc7 as your ship sustains damage noticeable aesthetic damage begins to appear charred marks on the hull engines flickering armor plates fly off electrical sparks fuel leaks rounds impacting on ships create little explosions and ship chunks if shields are lost   fly off repaired ships would lose this aesthetic degradation of quality8 objects abandoned in the emptiness of space accrue damage over time and require repairs  hit by asteroids or simply decay   ships inside pos shields would obviously be immune to this9 more activity at stargates fast moving npc ships haulers civilian vehicles and transport ships perhaps they have logos for companies on them such as quafe military logos for military logistic services havent decided if they can be attacked10 when attacked neutral npc vehicles  such as haulers   have a small chance of paying a small ransom or drop a small amount of their haul to save themselves from being destroyed11 space particles small asteroids flying through old or wrecked destroyed ships in the background12 more activity observed outside the space stations depending on station owner military vehicles fly in and out support ships fly to military ships or concord vessels to refuel them maintenance crews fly to the sentry guns to repair them  they dont actually get damaged  13 missiles launched at targets out of range dud and burn out harmlessly flying past the ship or bouncing off it14 nebulae15 when ships blow up they have different animations when this event happens some break in half others just blow up in a million pieces16 verbal warnings defined by the player to alert you when your shields are low your armor is sustaining heavy damage you are in structure warp scrammed fired upon etc 17 more notification when you are being locked by another player perhaps a larger target symbol in the overview or verbal notification such as an enemy player is attempting to lock onto you only issue i see is if multiple enemies lock you and your ears might explodethats all i have right now ill add more ideas as i get them
voting for myself
extremely good stuffeve needs a lot more immersion
overall i like the gist of this a lot i have some qualms with specific suggestions but it would be great for ccp to take a look at this as part of the ongoing graphical update that they started with trinity i do think that this is lower priority than game mechanics issues though
thats okay merely considering these ideas is enough for me thanks for the support guys
some good ideas here  some of the aesthetic things here would need to be on a lowpriority load into the graphics card buffer  or wherever stores the textures i cont claim to be technical   so as to avoid lag
i like the idea in general many of the ideas seem to be extra strains on the servers than anything else but if ccp can find a way to implement them without it being an issue then im all for it i think number 17 is a bit excessive i think the current system is fine and an audible warning could be extremely annoying add to this the ability give your ship a custom paint job  i know its been debated to hell   and this would be awesome
support
originally by jade constantine that said i think weve presented a very good crosssection of issues for this first session that do represent all the best suggestions made on the assembly hall that could be raised within the time constraints and 7 day advance discussion rule if you feel weve forgotten something important that will have been up for open discusion for the 7 day mark by sundays meeting then feel free to ask one of us to take a looki propose the inclusion of the drone module proposal considering that when the drone issuses get presented to ccp the module and implant issues should be presented together since there are obvious balancing challenges affecting both
i dont worry that this could get overpowered exchanging high slots  weapons   for drone power is not out of line  make them consume turretlauncher hardpoints if you worry too much   also dont forget that there is still a hard limit on 5 drones to control so a domi wont be spitting out 10 heavies even if it had enough bandwidth to do so drone love will help pve more than pvp anyway supported because drones need love
modules to increase drone bay and bandwidth as well drone bay expanders
i concurbut please please dont let the plot monkeys at white wolf loose on the details of the eve back story their world building skills leave a lot to be desired
white wolf is only so bad because nothing kept them in check

i agreei doubt 11000 people read the forums
my thoughts on the matter from another threadin response to the naysayerswhat you and those like you fail to grasp is that with the current threshold compared to the number of players who are active in the forums the players will realistically never be able to push an issue to the csm agenda which is counter to the whole purpose of the council as a means for bringing player concerns forward i personally have little faith in small governing bodies to do the right thing and an effective means for the populace to set the direction for those in charge is absolutely necessary for success
get rid of the lag and problem solvedbss can outmaneuver capitals any day but not with lag
agreed
bane is cool so does supporting cool kids make you more cool
i agree sensible goon post alsoremoving capital insurance could be a good step loosing one should be a big hit to finances  can you insure supercaps i guess not since they cant dock  
approval here
i agree it needs to be looked at
i have no interest in captial ships at all but i think this is a worthwhile issue to bring up with ccp perhaps you could merge chribbas call for capital mining lasers with this one
this right here shows there is something wrong
signedplease my poor tempest would just like a fighting chance
just the one response guess its not as good an idea as i thought it was
shakari sorry didnt see it earlier this is a great idea it nicely circumvents a lot of the procedural nonsense were dealing with now and could very equitably automate some of the powers of the chairpersonsome functionality it will need1 thumbsdown and neutral  ie abstain   in addition to thumbsup2 threads automatically lock when enough csm delegates have voted on them for the outcome to be certain this cuts off debate objectively ccp folks can still post after a thread has been locked to report on their eventual reaction to issues that made it to them3 the chairpersons ability to move topics up and down would affect the order in which all delegates must vote on issues  a delegate would not be able to vote  although she would be able to comment   on topic 2 until she had voted on topic 1 this way delegates cant avoid touchy issues that are brought before them and delegates can vote at their own pace  be it go straight down the whole list all at once and not need to sit frustrated for 4 hours if theyve already made up their mind or take as much time as they like  4 the default on each thread would be that voting is off  comments only no votes only the chairperson or the poster would be able to turn voting on the topic on so that  for example   more info can be presented if other csm members want more information before voting on it it would be up to the poster or the chair to determine that enough information had been presented to allow voting to begin once voting has been turned on for a particular topic it cannot be turned off
is a nice idea but given ccps speed at addressing changes on behalf of the csms operations i cant see it happening soonalso lack of enthusiasm may be from the perception of oh no another thread complaining about the csm delegatesprocedures  i know im tired of seeing them and its what almost made me not even click into this thread however since i did signed

how about make them 20km full damage area of effect with a 5km damage falloff  half damage at 25km no damage past 30km   but only go straight to where the target was at when you launched it and will unconditionally explode upon reaching that point  think timed explosive projectile   and have damage not be affected by sig radius or velocity this would be counterbalanced by having it reasonably slow moving such that frigates that are awake have a chance of warping out or even failing that fast frigates can be outside the radius anyways by the time it blows up also make it so it cannot be fired on targets closer than 15km away to give said fast ships a chance to reactone reasoning for not being affected by sig radius is that while regular large missiles can have a near miss when tracking small targets thus doing less damage bombs have such large explosions that it wont really matter if it near misses you the game mechanic reason would be that weve already demonstrated that bombs affected by sig radius are rather gimp the reason for the sig radius and velocity effects on missile damage seem to be for approximatingsimplifying explosion mechanics when they are relatively too small to provide appreciable interactivityfun which wont be the case for bombs anyway they make big booms   
bombs are perfect as they are here is how to use them wait on a gate for enemy blob to come thru 20km away facing directly towards the gate and fully stop then when the blob comes unclock launch bomb wait 2 seconds recloak profit ive killed 100mil in frigs interceptors with a 6mil bomb with this tacticbombs are antiblob thats it
amarr has high fitting beams eg tach ii for example i propose that csm looks at the amarr fitting problems since people use apocs with 6 or 7 tach insted of 8 i would like the csm to put forward a request to ask ccp review these weapons since ccp last nerfed their fitting to stop other races from using them 1400s can also get looked at as they have high fitting as well and historically 1400s used to be amarr weapon of choice before apoc range fix
i am hitting t2 large energy weapons and fitting is a pain in the arse looking at this would be pretty awesome
hmmm well ive always looked at tachys as sniper pvp weapons   they are kind of sucky in pve imho   and as a sniper you dont need to tank and then pg is not that much of a problem

pg is not a problem if you fly a megathron or a rokh it is for othersfor example just the following in t2 alone isto fit a geddon with 7 tach ii and mwd  3 rcu iis neededto fit a apoc with 8 tach ii and mwd  2 rcu iis neededto fit a rokh with 8 425 ii  mwd  1 rcu ii neededto fit a megathron with 7 425 ii  mwd  0 mods needed the mega can fit all 425 ii  mwd  2 1600 plates and still have grid freethat is the problem and the only solution amarr has is to drop to 6 or 7 turrets this problem only happened because they increased the grid to stop nonamarr from using them but forgot to fix amarr shipsmy suggestion is that the csm put for this issue for ccp to review
train some damn skills a geddon will fit 7 tachs and a mwd with 2 x rcu ii and an apoc will fit 8  mwd with the sameamarrian snipers are  and always have been   the best by far  look at any sniper killmail your geddons and apocs will likely be close to the top of the mail   if you can get by the cap issue the fitting issues are there to stop them becoming too powerful
what a poor flamei already said you need 2 rcu for 8 tach apoc armageddon  7 tach ii  100mn mwd ii requires 3 fitting mods go try it yourself before you claim you know it allmost killboards show megathrons on killmails but having killmails baised on game balance is rather sillyback to point you are saying that just because you see a amarr ship in a killmail it is the acceptable reason for a megathron to have tons of grid to fit dude you are aware that amarr had no issue till ccp nerfed teh grid to stop other races using lasers right
why do you feel the need to put a tech 2 mwd on a sniper thats not smart use tech 1named then it fits with 2 rcu 2s
when your tachyons do the same damage  alpha as 425mm railguns then it is fair to balance the two based on fittingswhatever this is such a ed proposal theres no point me even replying people have been whinging about the fittings of tachyons for years  nothing has been done about it apocs and geddons still regularly shine in sniper fleets and yet people still feel the need to whinge about it if you want better fittings then maybe tachyon alpha  damage should be reduced to be inline with the other guns and then you can have your lower pg use ok

i would like to start this idea topic regarding the jump clone cool down time reduction to 12hrs or any similar introduce skills if you want i dont care24h is just too much people are not using the jump clone as primarily intended  vat bays on mamas and titans   primarily because of the big cool downit also helps alot people like me with 1 account which likes to rp and try more aspects of the gamei do hope ccp is considering this small boost for the jump clones and i can already feel the players who have their own alts alliance screaming no
8  12 hours with skills would be massivley benifical to everyone
fully agree unless it has some sort of technical reason for being 24hr
i agree
i agree with this you have to plan way too much as it is now
i agree 24h is a long time should at least be a skill that reduce it
make it so
i agree with the op but i also want players to workspend time for the privilege of lowering jc timer as such i would agree with the skill to be introduced that would lower the timer supported in general spirit of things
yes that would be assome

superslam signed
i like the idea of a skill needing to be trained but all in all this is a great idea
totally agree on this idea of learning a skill to lower the time it takes to jc
an extra aproove for scapa and dagas who forgot to check the support box and regarding the potential requirement of a skill we maybe can have one that reduces the time by 10 per level  so at level 5 you would wait 12h per jump  or no skill at all all up to ccp how they decide would be a better solution and up to the game mechanics possibility
i think a skill is a great idea starting at 12 hours and knocking off an hour per skill level would be good enough for me
the problem for alot of peopel is limited playtime eg since the limit is 24hrs it becomes slightly later on the day eveyr time if you want to do it a few times in a row so you eventually have to skip a day a skill that would take off 5 of the 24hrs per level would be enough to fix this
thought there was already a thread about this buyt definately gets my support

this idea would motivate a lot of players to start messing around in lowsec as well players dont want to risk their 200mill of implants or what not and they also dont want to jump into their clone and lose the benefits from the attribute boost especially if they cant get on the next day etc i know i cant get on all the time and i hate having a skill take 12hours longer to train because i cant jump back to that clone the skill training idea is good but i would lower the timer down to 6 hours and perhaps make the jump clones cost way way more to even it out its not a huge issue but mehmy 2 cents shrugs
yes please
hell yes
yesssss can my rokh have more pointy sticks btw
make it happen
i cant believe all these people are treating this council like some sort of game this is totally inappropriateanother reason all goons should be banned
this is just one reason why i cannot support any members of the something awful forums from congregating in this game it produces absurd ideas like the original idea proposed in the first post not only such but it begs to be taken seriously in a forum and place in which it cannot bego ahead and vote goonswarm and friends it wont matter in the end all you will do is raise issues which ultmately will push ccp to taking action against your members as a whole  at least in my opinion  
in my opinion you are a mentally challenged petty person who doesnt realize that goons mess with you but many know this game better than you and want it to change for the better their is no reason that titans are not monster trucks the empires can do what ever they feel like and that would just be cool you on the other hand just see goons like a tool and assume every thing we say is bad do you think we should change capital ships online like bane is do you think we should not make matar cap ships better like yorda what about large auto cannons banes other topic we love you troll but you really are stupid
yes yes i do but then again look at some of the things that goonswarm members have done in the past look at the immature members they contain now look at it outside the box and tell me that people outside your little area dont see goonswarm and this thread by extension as a drain on resources within the game while trying to ruin eve online by conforming it to their own ideal while telling outsiders basically to heck with youthere is nothing wrong with having fun in the game ill grant ya that but the sheer irresponsibility with which goonswarm members hold themselves to especially in this part of the forums is appalling to say the least
i dont think people should care about being responsible it is a game for god sake people do what they do to have fun have you suicided ships for the fun of it riding bikes is to be expected after the massive about of bull we have dealt with have you ever seen a nonnpc titan have you had to deal with fleet fights where you know in anything less than a cap ship you are useless because your enemies can doomsday you ever 10 mins did people in your corp make evemon because they wanted to help friends did your corp start a wiki to help all your new player and get thousands of new players out into 00 space really were you station camped into syndicate by bob when your entire alliance had less than 5 cap ships and told you would never be able to live in 00 space again people have taken a dump on us for years and we fight back grow stronger grow larger because people like you hell bane wrote the titan manifesto that got things changed

yes i have ive also suicided out of boredom stupidity and because i follow my fcs orders to a t even when i shouldnt have i wasnt aware that only people who have see titans were the only people qualified to vote on this issue but thank you for letting me know that something i might seedo in the future is something i cannot vote on now you may as well take your own advice when voting on issues too in the futureyes i have been involved in fleet battles where one might expect only some of the capital ships to get out safely and if any noncapitals came back it was because desync had kept them from joining the fightso what i read here is that i must have been in a corporation of thousands many with attention problems in order to be taken seriously by you i would never be in a corporation that recruited new players by the hundreds i would sooner leave and then to take them to 00 space well ask outsiders what they see gs as they are disconnected from the main of eve and always have been largely that is why it is was nearly required of your older members to create evemon and a wiki you had too many new players lost in eve with too few people to show them how to play properlyin contrast most pvp corporations recruit people either based on skillpoints or may choose to let such slide when talking to an extraordinary person with as much focus determination and maturity that their sp isnt a true reflection of how they grasp the game needless to say this wasnt how gs gained so many members early on recruiting from the get go from the something awful forums as one of the first requirements i am not aware there was any sp limit or any ingame requirements for that matter and as time has gone on and members have left i am sure many other requirements have been lowered simply to keep active member count upin short those looking in will see what i see in the end while there are a number of players who are good at the game are mature or show some responsibility or tact at the least many of your players will always be viewed as being immature children who want only their way and will go to any means to accomplish such and the proof positive is here in the csm forums as a final nail in the lid
i didnt read this but your posting sure seems to be something awfulxd
i know a wall of text sorry but i do expect to defend myself when someone tries to belittle me my opinion or my friendsthat said i can understand why you didnt read it normally i would disregard such a long post myself
i really dont think you read his post your doesnt even seem to be responding to what he said
no i have hes said he didnt read it but references it anyhow so what was your point again
i mean your stupid long wordy post i tried to read it but its like your not even responding to the post your quoting
could you clear that up a bit make it more legible i cannot tell if you are talking as if you were the mapmaker  that is explaining what it is he saidmeant to say   or if you are saying that four lines is a long postif youre talking about my response to fallorn i fail to see how i was not responding to his post if you could give me examples i would most appreciative to understand where you are coming from there
this thread reminds me of my army days when i used to spend time practicing in the tank combat simulators in korea those things broke down and had bugs all the time one bug in particular made the enemy fire humvees at us instead of tank rounds so there were humvees buzzing all around the screen like flies it was a fun day
oh yeah
what kind of action
i hope its girl on girl action thats my favourite
my god i thought this was the eve forum i suppose i suddenly stumbled into the wow forums instead seriously people eve is supposed to have a more mature player base than any other mmo out there why are you working so hard to prove this wrong
i could only imagine bannings temporary or permanent  though i doubt many if any goons members actually get to this point really   either forum or account i couldnt really guess accurately as im a player not an employee of ccp instances of eula violation spamming harassment and of course racialsexual slurs as well as some other things i cannot now think of could bring it aboutof course thats how i see it and doubtless those people in positions to do anything would take everything into account and disregard the goon ticker i would hope they would at least
are you imagining offenses for which you had previously stated there should be punishment either goons should be punished for something or they shouldnt saying goons should be banned imo then i dont know what theyve done when asked why is pretty sillyalso i support this idea 
has to happen or everyone will emoragequit
i never stated to my knowledge that any member should be punished retroactively in addition if i had knowledge of rules being broken i would take my concerns to the proper channels of ccp i also never said goons should be banned nor was asked directly why i think they should be  and i never said they should be   i implied that they are viewed as a whole and act immaturely and may be dealt with as a group for such a reason yes and that is pure speculation on my part i admit but if the past serves as an indicator of future behavior then future outrages would tend to be supported by many other members of goonswarm would you not concuror to put it another way if for instance bob was found to have done something to cause ire to somebody and it caused a drama would you not expect bob to coalesce as a group and either support or kick members involved if over time such instances were occuring often enough where would one draw the line at practices that disrupt business flow that is where i am getting at that goonswarm though inventive as a group will eventually overstep their boundaries in attempting to ruin enough of other players gameplay that ccp may be forced to take action against a group of players with a strong common bond rather than individually and over time  which could cause more drama and more damage  
if you dont support this youre supporting the terrorists

i find it very troubling that the head of the organization designed to bring player concerns to ccp cannot seem to communicate in a manner that does not involve a giant wall of text clear and concise communication is not too much to expect from someone in such a positiontherefore i propose a 50 word limit on any response or proposal jade constantine gives on a particular subject be it to members of the community csm members or ccp
how about i give you the fingerand you give me my 4000 charactersneo
how many post has jade written today on the combined forums he visits and how many characters has he used im going to guess well over 100k that is in one day no one should have to read through his wall of text that say nothing
i guess i support this as you can see i have the required thumbs up
amazingly enough i think youve gotten your wish  nobody does have to read it id be hardpressed to think of a more pathetic request than someone sitting in an internet forum complaining about there being too many words if you dont like it this way 4chan isnt exactly hard to find
clearly you have misread my post kind sir my concern is that the chair of the csm and ultimately our voice cannot make to the point statements on seemingly anything he will have to communicate things to ccp ccp being made up of various producers programmers qa staff of course cannot be required to read 500 words when 50 will do just fine
me adds his signature and why notit could only benefit the headchairpersonthingiewhateveryouwishtocallthem that they have one duty and one only to keep things in order doing so shouldnt require a huge wall of text that makes everybody groan to see this would enforce that as a reminder that this is their duty in a continuous manner
the total absurdity of this suggestion should tell you everything about this issue and its supporters
i just hit random for my character
so you seem to think that you are being forced to read all that text i am sure if he just gave bullet points that you would complain that he was not being descriptive enoughthe real issue is you
not really bullet points work for me
they have implants to fix that you knownow if you can come up with an actual reason other than your own laziness for why you should be accommodated please do
any chance we can get a moratorium on moronic timewasting socalled issues like thisdidnt think sooh well i guess its too much to expect the vaunted maturity of the eve playerbase to spend its time on issues that actually matter i thought the petty wowlike squabbling was supposed to be beneath us
how about instead of one player having a word limit we think about this issue from a different direction and look at maybe having a post limit of 100 posts from each alliance per day on jita park and assembly hall
unfortunately such a rule would be exploited by those dishonorable people willing to corp hop in order to post further my proposal would force the chair to tldr as it were not so that i dont have to read it but so that the poor souls at ccp are not forced to endure such vicious onslaughts of verbal and text based diarrhea my point is that walls of text are in no way helpful in the real world nor do professionals communicate in this manner if we the people of this game and this psuedogovernment are to have any success we need to ensure that the chairman is able to communicate in a professional and realistic mannerthank you for your timesincerlycap iihonourable space captaingoonfleetgoonswarm
i think we could make a fair compromise by making that post limit into a character limit each alliance would have a maximum amount of characters they could use in any one posting day here maybe we should have it scale to the size of an alliance
a fair system would probably be to base it on alliance size ill never understand why you seem so surprised that a 5100 person alliance posts more than your 164 person alliance
bad idea wed never hear anything from anyone else in jades alliance
no supportthe op couldnt even frame his ridiculous proposal in 50 words or less
and an eight word limit to any response ak
you guys need to realise that the csm is all about the comedyjades role as bat insane chairman is an essential part of the show
simple way would be to just ask the likes of the csm council to reply to topics in a clear and precise mannor without adding a load of bull the last thing we need is walls of text when the same post could be made in one paragraph making it easy and a pleasure to read
you see that yeah thats the moral high ground disappearing into the distance behind you
post 1 51 words somehow not clearly communicating the point why else writepost 6 51 words somehow not clearly communicating the point why else writepost 15 100 words to be continuedclearly it is impossible to clearly communicate certain things in 50 wordsbut my main point is that this kind of advise should be given directly to the person in question this is hardly an issue for the csm
i can only assume youre making a bad joke jade may not be concise but at least hes thorough there isnt really any way to misinterpret his posts if a topic requires a lessthanfiftyword response it probably isnt worth debating is italso these are issues were supposed to be voting on so that they can be taken to ccp why the hell would this ever make it out of the assembly hall
once again the easiest way to fix this issue is to make a very hard way of getting new ones into the game i admit there would still be poeple crying that its to hard but it should be an option
and do you know why the t2 market crashed because it went from an oligopoly to something a lot closer to an open market however there is still one significant barrier separating the t2 bpc inventors from the t2 bpo holders and that is the costrisk aspect of inventiona bpo is pretty much guaranteed to have a better me than any invention bpc in fact i dont think its possible to have a worse one and since most bpcs from invention have negative mes that means that at the very least the bpc inventor already has a 10 higher base cost to their production add in the every attempt is a success unrealistic cost of invention with datacores t1 bpcs and time and you have an even higher cost overhead for the inventor tack on the possibility of that t2 bpo being researched to me 10 and it gets even worsethe production cost differences are staggering sure there are t2 items where there is no t1 equivalent but theyre not nearly as popularits why most t2 frigate invention is pretty much a guaranteed lost because of the nonscaling cost of decryptors and the base construction costscrunching the numbers on production costs was impressive and eyeopening to say the leastturning the existing bpos into maxrun bpcs would be too harsh but give them a limit maybe 100 runs or something but theyre still relics of a darker time for eves economy
brann does raise one good point here and thats the nonscaling cost of decryptors i would endorse a plan to make invention take as many decryptors as datacores in order to get decryption bonuses assuming that drop rates and current stack sizes were increased accordingly say x16 or so  
seems everyones prepared to whine about the situation that devs created and constantly critisize their game design nobody gives any thought for the players that continue to save their iskies and buy bpos  the option thats allways been there but sure whine becuase thats somehow unfair  is the last official comment from fanfest 07 of no change for t2 bpos still valid or will people that continue to invest 10s of bil in t2 bpos be screwed over by stealth nurf
using your example serious producer building only vagabondsbpo holder can produce 18 vagabonds from invented bpc in x time plus 3 from bpo  lower production time lets give him a greter bonus than real   so 21 vagabondsthey sell at 100 each gain from bpc 10 from bpo 20 total gain 240equivalent producer using only invnetion 20 vagabonds netting 10 each his return 200the inestment of the first players is something like 40 billions the investmen of the second player is about 1 billion so who is getting the better return from the investmentpart ii selling 20 vagabond each they have crashed the market now the vagabond sell at 85 they switch invention to another item that cost 90 to invent and sell at 100inventor still get 200 from his inventions the bpo holder can choose to use the bpo and get 180 from invention and 15 from the bpo for 195 total  less than a pure inventor   or can stop producing from the bpo and do only invention for 200 but then he has unused a 40 billion asset
notice the bolded part of your citation invention is exactly the duplicating an imitating procedure they citebecause people like you and your friends see tii and stop thinking not doing the math of the returns and because there is people with a lot of isk and little avenue of investment when and if you have 50100 billions in the wallet and not the time to run after good investments in all eve a 1 return from something that require relatively little work can seem worthwhile
thisalthough i am sure reason goes out the window when ppl think that others can make a little more than they can but the fact is that it is not true
the t2 market is know a dual market invention and t2 bpos in the time there were only t2 shipmods prices exploded if you remove the t2 bpos there wont be a steady suply of all kind of t2 goods and the markets will get cleaned out market manipulation   witch will result in verry high prices  the pvp guys wine a lot louder than than the people on this post  we now have a stable t2 market witch is good for pvp and that is what ccp wants loosing a t2 ship in pvp combat is not so expensive if t2 comes from 1 sourge i will be and t2 ships will only be used in mission playthe t2 bpo holders have a adv over invention since they can make it cheaper however they have only one bpo one factorie   and can not switch if the product they produce is no longer hot on the market inventors canadding new t2 bpos will make invention useless and degrades t2 building to t1 building
why the hell are you all talking about market and profitfor me its simple i have a corp and t2 bpo owner has one both have same number of chars in corp who needs to spend more time to produce t2 ships for number of corpmatesand thats all time for copying  time of invention  more minerals means that invention loosessolution  apply one or both  1 change t2 bpos to max run bpcs 2 let mepe level of t1 bpc influence the outcome of invention  mepe of t2 bpc  just to get everyone a fair chance and some competition fun for now new players search for old corp to be sure they will get t2 stuff when its needed for a reasonable price its also part of the problems with blobs if you ask me large gatherings around establishedavaliable resources  for example gallery of t2 bpos most of old alliancesplayers haveedit for supportedit 2 to clear the wall of text a bit
did you factor in the multi billion cost for the bpo and at a margin of a mil or so per item extra profit for using it you need to build 24 thousand ships before you see any return above that of a inventor
ubpc werent nurfed into max run bpc but bpc with massive amount of runs why would t2 bp be nurfed to max runsthe real issue that needs to be raised with the devs by the csm is the continuing investment of 10s of bil for bpos after the 07 fanfest qa response of no t2 change planned
you are 100 correct joe  and that is why i have created this thread t2 bpo future  request for a comprehensive dev bloglinking it here for a second time because i want all the whiners to actually show some backbone and ask a question rather than spout garbage of course all those in favor of bpos staying the way they are should also be legitimately interested in the answers as well
i love people who assume that bpos have 0 cost to acquire for the current owners especially when they then go on about the costs of datacores and decryptors even more so when they whine about how they cant acquire them in the same posti do have to wonder how many bpos are with their original owners the sell orders forum would have me believe its not a large numberhowever topics like this make me want something stronger than simply not supporting it i want a thumbs down
its hilarious people trying to justify t2 bpos to stay in the game with some sort of i paid x number of isk for something as if it means anything at all please really you make me laughwhen items can no longer be acquired by anyone in game they should no longer exist in game this is pretty standard game design stuff which ccp and some people here cant get their head around
youre absolutely right you cant buy t2 bpos at all ever theyre never sold especially since  insert large alliance here   has them all
the mechanism for releasing t2 bpos into the game is gone unless they reinstated the lottery when i wasnt looking
oh i see now because the lottery is gone you cant get them without working for it anymore shobon
because the lottery is gone there is no way to get one that doesnt involve bending over
do you mean paying for themwould you buy a bpo for 40ish bil when all it would save you is 14 mil per ship it builds considering you can put out a almost unlimited number with invention it is not worth it tbhthe only reason i can see that ppl want bpos removed is sour grapes cos realistically they are losing nothing by not owning one and buying one is not financially worth it so we are left with the bitter morons crying about not owning or being able to afford one when they are sold
you just illustrated perfectly why t2 bpos arent realistically acquirable for profit making and leaving them in the game only benefits the old time gamers
i also pointed out that they are of no real benefit to anybody but i see you chose to snip that bit and the reason why ppl like you still want them removed  readded  
they benefit those who got them originally since they didnt have the upfront cost also since the mepe is still better than any invention they still print isk i would accept a change for t2 bpos to make them have worse mepe than invention instead of removing them from the game that seems pretty reasonable you get the benefit of infinite runs without having the randomness of invention
negative ppl like you make me sick you are so full of venom and jealousy that all you can think of is taking from otherswhy not petition for increasing the mepe in invention bpcs instead of thinking like a whiney child and thinking nerf nerf nerfdid you read post 80 btw you realy should
let me restate the same thing in a different way change the balance of peme to make invention more profitable than a t2 bpo for a given item i dont care how its done nerf or buff it really makes no difference to me apparently people have severe allergic reactions to the word nerf even though buffing a different item has the same effectyes you can switch easier what you are producing with invention i thought that much was obvious however nothing is keeping the bpo holder using invention as well to suppliment the bpo income
supplementhow does the fact that you can build 100 ships from invention with enough building slots but only 1 from the bpo make invention the supplemental item ffs the bpo makes a few mil isk per item more than each individual invention bpc but you can have 100s of invention bpc running at the same time as your single bpo
since faction warfare is geared towards newer players and corps i decided to make a new 800k alt and give it a go i ran about 20 missions for minmatar and did a storyline mission final standings 006 so you telling me before i can play fw i need to run about 200 missions or get a bunch of social skillsremove the standings period let the new players play
if you do the intro missions for your own faction that will suffice if you want to take part in a faction other than the one you were born to it would seem so
well you need unmodified standings to participateso social skills would only help you in getting there fasterand 05 is really low i was expecting something like 20
id like to propose a vote to stop goons turning these issues into threadnaughts and have a policy in place that only allows certain individuals from corpsalliances to post eg directorsceos  might be an idea for caod too  
can i have your ceos contact details plz
not supportedif you restrict posting rights in such a way then you also stifle legitimate debate on these issues for example by doing this you automatically lock out all the players in npc corporations as none of them can become directorsceos
last time i checked goons were all paying for their subscriptions and dont deserve this type of discrimination your suggestion is also flawed since it doesnt take corp size and possible internal conflict into consideration csm is about vox populi and i hope their aim is not to turn this into an oligarchy so well have to suffer the goons and everyone elses post bombardmentsgreetingsgrismar  who feels his choice for the strongly liberal and democratic gallente is finally working out well nevermind the gallente elections     
oh noes you sunk mah battleship
well ill admit the goon allience and corp do seem full of forum children but i cant say it should prvent them from posting on issues one player one vote sort of a thing now if they cant conduct them selves in a aporpriate manner then there mods for that so this thread is rite up there with usless spam in a forum meant to be used for game issues we want the csm to take on
no they dont people just say they do
no ive seen alot of there posts they do have them a but again it should have no bearing in the fact there players too and they should have a say they should just realize that when they try to hijack or post stupid comments it hurts there cause is all edit i also wanted to say not all of them and ive seen many other allience with the same sort of children but were discussing goonswarm
what about 1 man alt corps they would be ceo and thats how they post on coad at the moment
csm is supposed to be voice of the players and you want to exclude 90 of people from posting dumbest idea i ever heardno
goonies are not human beings therefore their opinion is null and they need to be banned from the forums and probably the game tooin conclusion please gtfo goonies
no support im afraid i dont like the gs threadnaughts either but every goonswarm player is an individual too and theyre each entitled to their opinions just like the rest of us
if god forbid i ever do join the goons itll be just to see people like you cry
what about well known forum trolls
thats why most of us joined in the first placei havent seen anything even remotely resembling a threadnaught so i really dont know what your talking about
thats because there hasnt been one people simply cant comprehend that in a group of 5000 or so people some of them may all post and some may even have similar opinionsthreadnaught has been the latest term used to describe posting on a forum on the internet by goons its really quite stupid
being the biggest alliance in eve and having a higher percentage of our playerbase taking part in the csm process does not equal threadnaughts which threads are you referring to anyway
not supported id much rather see people who dont know how to spell or even use a simple spell checker be blocked from posting
noes
and deprive the eve community of such intriguing entertainment i think not
do you know what a threadnaught isno
i propose that the op be flogged with a poisonous snake
never stop posting dont stop posting dont ever stop posting
actually threadnaught was first used about a year ago as a description for a famed instance in which gf actively spammed a few threads with the express purpose of suppressing discussion with sheer weight of numbersi would suggest you research the history of the game you were elected to steer before pointing your finger and calling people stupidpersonally i would call threadnaught when the posts dont actually help with sensible debateoh look an example
signed
i know what the term means we coined it when the threadnaught was unleashed we specifically called it that it was used onceperhaps you should do some more research on the topics youre discussing before you start suggesting others should its not my problem if you dont understand a term and use it incorrectly
posting in a goonswarm moral blog
sigh contradicted yourself in your own posts thereandyou cant have both mutually exclusive descriptions and choose which ever suits your argument at the timelets set some definitionsthreadnaught  we will go with your second definition the one where you said it was used onceso what shall we use for everything else where we have posts that seem to have little purpose other than to obfuscate belittle dilute and even sidetrack an issue or entire forum i suggest we call this trolling just to make it easier for us allone issue remains what should we call someone who seems to have been elected to champion the trolling masses i think historically its called agent provocateur
the implied part of the first definition would be since the first one ie thats because there hasnt been one since the first oneyou probably wouldve realized that if you werent too busy trying to make goons look bad in an attempt to recover jades ehonor
i didnt contradict myself at all let me clear it up for you cream puff the threadnaught was used once you have chosen to use the term to replace another term popularly known as posting this is a repeat of what ive already saidnow you can quote this and say im saying something else entirely yet a third time but ive been pretty clear people are posting they are doing it of their own volition if you dont like it leave the internet because it happens on every forum and i cant save you from yourself i can guarantee youll never find yourself in some perfect place where people only post things you like or find personally relevant unless its a private forum inhabited only by yourself and those like you this isnt itdo you get it yet
ehhno
they should be rounded up and put into camps as well
then take their cloths and the gold fillings from their teeth and make them take showers we see what type of person you are you  loving 
makes sense to me even if it only relieves congestion a little every little bit helps
having a ring road could make issues for autopilot settings  eg if it is set to prefer safer  the option that many people flying through empire will be on  then the safety value of hopping around jita  itself a 09 system   would need to be higher than jita itselfthis could perhaps be done more simply by having an option added to autopilot that could be checked or uncheckedavoid systems with more than 100 pilotsalong with of course the other nice wannahave of autopilotavoid systems where an enemy faction holds sovereignty  could also have nil sec useage possibly  i dont go nil sec so i cant speak on the mechanics of sovereignty there  
isnt the chokepoint one of the main reasons why jita is the tradehub
maybe maybe notbut its in place now and people dont want to go through it so an option to go around jita would be nice  even though i wont use it as i use rens for all my trading needs
the title says it all1 you have the dread which  pos killer2 you have the carrier which  uber logistics and ultra drone wielder3 you have the mom which is a beefed up version of the carrier4 you have the titan which can nuke 300 ships in 1 shot5 we dont have a fleet cap ship something designed to take on fleet ships ie bs etc im proposing that a capital ship be invented that is pure anti support support and anti fleet effective something you can hot drop and people actually worry what im thinking is something which is designed to follow a fleet and engage fleet ships and not capitals  have guns geared towards anti non capital ships  we have seen several new ships since 2003 yet theres little in the way of capital ships that are affordable to the average player other then a carrier or dread at the moment capitals are over rated expensive not really effective and only serve as bullet magnets we need a ship that is capable not invulnerable ie a ship that can sit in a fleet of 100 and remove fleet ships  think of it as a dread variant   cos tbh  caps are boring and seriously underused we need to bring back the fun in cap ships and bring back their use
a   carriersms already do thatb   titans w carriersms already do thatc   last thing this game needs is more capitals
this is a bad idea because having a capital ship that can easily kill subcapitals  even more than carriersmotherships   will make subcaps totally useless as opposed to just mostly uselessthis game is already capital ships online to a high degree and it doesnt need to be made more so
fantastic idea you could give it like 8 high slots fitted with high powered lasers capable of one shotting any subcapital and it would have the lock time of a frigate or a better idea would be to give it rapid fire doomsday that wouldnt hurt friendly ships or enemy capitals
i hate to agree with the two goons above me but yeah theyre basically righttitan dd is already anti support par excellence and fighters from carriersmotherships are used to great effect against enemy bs fleetsactually theres more of a need of a conventional anticapital ship beyond the bs then for an additional capital ship that would even more unbalance 00 warfare in favor of capital ship usage
there are many people who have gone out of their way to help make ccp what it is those who teach new players help in events and basically have spent a lot of time making eve a better place for everyoneccp can easily find out who the most influential ingame players are who have done so much to help the game and approach them to fill the role of csmthey have a track record of positive action toward the game as a wholethe current csm do notthe current csm should be disbanded and the institution should be put on hold until enough people who actually want to make eve a better place can be contacted and recruited for this taskthank you rells for the original ideathe only thing i would like to add is the position should be open to anyone with a reputation for helping eve and the general playerbase not just organizations and their constituents thank you
with the introduction of tier2 battle cruisers i expected ccp to change the command ship models to reflect the new additions as it has not happened i propose that the field command ships take on the models of tier 2 battle cruisers cos tbh it would look nice  black drake omg sexy hurricane as sleipnir oooo   the changes i propose are as follows which are purely for asthetic reasons no changes to slotpgcpubonuses etc neededsleipnir  to use hurricane modelnighthawk  to use drake modelabsolution  to use harbinger modelastarte  to use myrmidon model
what ya think
little yellow thumbs up is what i thinkbut the bonuses  slot layouts might need to be changed as sleipner gets a shield boost bonus while the hurricane is more armouroriented
sory to clarify what i ment was no slot change to the current command ships for example if a sleipnir can use 7 guns 4 mids 6 lows then make the new model reflect that so the new sleipnir model slot layout would reflect the old slot layout if you get my meaning

how many of you log into eve just to chat with your corp alliance or girlfriend you met in some shady gallente docking station i think an out of game chat client would be a great way to keep in touch with whats going on in the game while im doing something else and would use much less resources and screen space than keeping the client open
i like it sometimes i just want to log in to talk with corp or alliance and check mail
i like
i support this also an outof game eve voice client would be nice
good ideaa standalone client would be great but i think a web interface right on wwweveonlinecom would be even better  as gmail and facebook do for example  there would have to be some way of marking in the ingame chat that youre not actually in your ship though
its called jabber irc teamspeak ventriloget your own servers cheapskates
when soe had this working with eq2 it was great i could chat to guildies while at work etc it could also make it easier to attend in game meetings etc
maybe for a aditional fee server loads im thinking is all but it does sound good btw if soe did it it must be goodlmao
atleast eq2 runs without constant node crashes and horrible lag that is something they are doing better then ccp
who says that everyone uses those and why not have a single client that everyone uses instead of scattering them cross the four you have listedi would think it would be less of a load on the server as you are only accessing the chat information instead of everything that is used when i log into eve using the client
self explainitory one for each side to help others with info perhaps some strong moderation to weed the epeeen fluff and actually have it a useful info source
i went over this one a while back on eve general after the fw info came out  see this post and this post from this thread its way more ambitious than what theyve actually done but i think there are some good ideas there
very good idea
industrials and specops would be a great addition also war is war and it runs on industry agree let the miners and industry have a place in the fight system control no but the price of factional items yes gallen cant get the supplies in they dont get the shinny ships and vise vesa
you know you never received the majority of the vote out of the nine csms you only made about 19 of the vote bane and darius together for example have more votes than you if there are enough people in the playerbase or the council that feel strongly enough to rethink your position  which is what were asking for   then anything else is less than democratic do your job and let the people be heard
this is a bit ot but where can i read these meetings at i cant find any links to any of them
wwwevecsmcom  theres also chatlog links in the jita park threads of the completed meetings
wow look at all the sf members that support this jade is this another big thread youre going to railroad through talk about ing up the assembly hall
cool thanks im going to bm this website
i have to agree with lumen to get the basics to lvl 5 and the advanceds to lvl 4 didnt take me more than a month it isnt a huge thing these days
no removing them would delete an entire layer of experience within eve
to be honest the argument to train all learning skills to 43 from the start is ed at besti started by training the learning skills that directly effected my training time for my next shipitem  as given to me via evemon learning skills are only a burden if people arnt smart about informing the newbs about them
i think fixing assault frigs could be done by1 reduce sig radius slightly lower than a frig but more than an inty2 increase speed should have a base speed 20 faster than a regular frigate3 increase warpspeed of intercepters and interdictors this will maintain the interceptors role subwarp speed of interceptors is fast enough however i think haf should be able to break 3kmps without rigs or snakes reduce the warp speed of all hacs and hafs4
afaik the hawk needs rethinking it tanks better than its t1 counterpart but the damage is nominal the hawks total damage is lower than the kestrels with the same fittingspersonally i see something wrong with this although it does shoot them a little further which frankly doesnt really matter very much would have if the kestrel couldnt shoot out of webber range but it can and the range increase doesnt change it and make it available to avoid anything else
afs are inordinately slow for what they are logic would put them somewhere between the speed of hacs and ceptorsif afs were actually there theyd be able to play a nice role in the nano game as something that can tackle a hac without getting instapopped however i must say that i did kinda like my ishkur for the little while i had it it might not have been that great at blowing stuff up but the frig sig radius and sensor res do make it much better than a cruiser at picking fights if an af meets a cruiser in passing its the af that gets to chose fight or flight at leasti guess maybe one train of thought is that theyre already very good at tanking things like complexes and such so maybe theyre intended more as a pve ship
slower and heavier frigates are called destroyers a slow and heavy frigate is just gimpfixing afs could be done by gasp actually making them handle like frigates instead of plated destroyers the need the mass and speed of their t1 counterparts this isnt asking for too much given that heavy assault cruisers are lighter and faster than their counterparts they also need their missing 4th bonus
it seems pretty frivolous to designate certain ships as pve or pvp ideally all ships should be useful in both
if you want this to be done properly then you need a clear agenda with all points of discussion prepared before hand and handed out to all members before the meeting a chairman who is unbiased and good at time management probably a ccp employeeas for the muting well i can understand the time constraints but seriously if youre going to give someone moderation of a channel at least make sure they know how to moderate properly the mutekick bug has been there for monthsit was pretty good comedy though next time someone prepare highlights so i dont have to read all the drivel
 a   the thread you linked did not contain this discussion  in fact the visible thread did not have any sort of massive support indicating its an issue you like rather then a popular issue b   your arguments are hugely flawed given firepower has increased as well and player mechanics have been developed  bumping the most popular solution to station hugging particularly when you undock   to offset deaggrodocktank tactics  which are valid tactics btw   all sub bs ships right now are very unlikely to deaggrodock successfully and its preety much only the bs which can do this  and it doesnt work for them often enough either wether due to bumping or just due to having too little time since you spot your tank failing to the final explosion   there is simply nothing wrong with the mechanics for subbs ships and i highly suspect theres anything wrong with it when we consider capitals  which just need to be bumped  i completely disagree it has the effect of discouraging combat at all without the ability to deagress and dock in a reasonable time frame people would simply not agress in the first placepromoting blobbing or no people will blob all the same and now you dont have to worry about the target deaggrodocking on a local spike you know hes stuck there for long enough   so why promote a not so supported topic your personal agendastations with 20km docking range now theres a problem
meh less drama more raising of important issues and issues
this post is gold dust
and i never will do so in a private channel the chat log is a public document and as such everything pertaining to it is also public to permit such an explanation to take place where it is not and could not be made public would go against serving the voters and players generally who as much as i do want to know why you acted as you did  and contrary to your own rules as you have set them out even if not accepted by other members of the csm  clearly i am not going to get an answer from you that much is clear and i have to accept that you will continue to hide behind that statement you must therefore accept that i will continue to feel aggrieved for that same reasoniz
this just in again anyone who disagrees with jade is a goon and a goon troll jade is always right everything is everyone elses fault jades never done any wrong and is not to be questionedyoure an embarassment
yep and you need to accept that i still feel you have acted extremely poorly in taking your complaints over moderation decision agreed by the chair and vice chair of a meeting to the court of public sympathy where youve continued to stoke the flames of scandal and trolling we arent going to agree we clearly dont have much time for each other but we have to work together for good or ill ultimately its a matter for your own conscience whether you want to keep up the public attacks over a moderation decision you disagreed with
it looks like you have no issue engaging in said ridiculous flamewar though how cutealso what constitutes most sensible people would that be a special group of people you havent stereotyped and whom all agree with you as far as i can tell reading the many posts in this forum there are a lot of people who also believe it isnt your right and you were out of line and shock they were not all goons are those people all senseless though and it is ok to ignore their concerns this seems to be the general stance youre taking
what part of public scares you so much the one where youre held accountable for your actions really i dont get the need to hide anything whatsoever although if i acted like you i might try to obscure it as well
unless you propose to have censored the chatlogs before they went live this had to take place in public  the mutings were in there as was the subsequent debate over precisely what had happened even if inanna had done exactly what you wanted everybody else would still be here and wed still be saying the same things about your decision the criticism started well before inanna said anything and i doubt itd end even if she asked it to
slow clapscongratulations csm on proving the op correct as it stands youre incapable of doing your job take a step back think and then shut upthings that could improve your meetingsa   strictly adhered to time limits items failing to be completed in their times move to aob a show of hands if the issue can be voted can be used rather than full votes in a first instance if neededb   agenda order  game issues first then aob then debate about council mechanics if people still want to after 4 hrsc   lobby ccp for an independent chair for all meetings i suggest a ccp employee rather than a player due to the sporting chance that all members of the committee might at least treat them like a human being and also trust in their impartiality
welcome to the real world kiddo and anything discussed should be public this way we the players know if you are trying to push your own agenda oh wait we did system works well dont it
i rather imagine darius the public that jade is trying to avoid  and with good reason   is the threadnaught mentallity that the goons installed in this game and that others have so spectacualarly carried on withi am no fan of jade tbh in fact i voted for hardin in the elections  thought given certain recent actions on other forums i now begin to regret that   however the csm will never operate properly if it is subjected to threadnaughts from  any of the various factions   every time a csm gets there nose bent out of jointthe csms that insitigate this ill serve themselves and the people that voted for them as it is i can see little reason for voting for any of the current candidates with the possible exception of ankh back onto the csm come next voting round
heaven forbid the people who the council is representing provide input or have insight into whats going on im sorry but if you cant accept responsibility for your words or actions then dont commit those actions im not sure what you mean by threadnaught i see a few dudes posting goons were far from the first people to ever post on a forum in any form some agree about some things and some disagree its called community even when you dont like what they have to say or its incovenient
ah and there you go and misconstrue my point i never said that the public that voted  i was one of those 10 in eve that did   and those that didnt should not have input and also not have insight into what was going on with the csm please bold that for me in my post if i in fact did say that in regards to the specific issue regarding the muting i think the csm members should be grown up enough to be able to discuss that amongst themselves with out making the circus out of it that has been madein regards to the words threadnaught  i believe first proper usage of the term was related to a certain goon action regarding a certain developer and bob   and eve then yes goons were the first self interest group in eve to use it succefully i also clarified in my post that in terms of the current issue it was not just goons involved and indeed promoting ityou say we are a community and that people will disagree that is indeed thier right and also thier privalage however what some have latched onto is the mob mentality aka threadnaught tactic whereby in order to try and drown out any possible disagreement with thier pov they drown it out with the mobfurther to the above let me reclarify that i think in balance the way jade handled things in the meeting was wrong however i would also say that certain others involved in the after effects have not exactly covered themselves in glory either and though i am sure you will not be that bothered darius none of the current csm team will garner a vote from me at the next elections  that being said they have 5 months in which to change my mindi closing i am hoping that what we see here is teething troubles because i had hopes that the csm would be an effective body  i also had as many fears that it wouldnt   so i for one hope you alll  no offence meant   get over yourselves and start trying to work for the good of eve
if i misconstrued your point i apologize i also never meant to imply that people who voted should not be allowed to know whats going on to be honest i find it preferable as perhaps seeing a system actually work provided it does will motivate them to vote the next time around regarding creating a circus im a public person if someone asks me a question or states something about me or anything i am involved in i have no problem with addressing it we may disagree or we may agree but were certainly able to have the conversation i cant control peoples perception of that conversation if you find it to be circuslike then im sorry you feel that way it is what it isyour vote is your vote and im glad you take it seriously and actually consider your decision i wish wholeheartedly the rest of eve felt that way i also hope that these are teething troubles i believe they are and i look forward to moving on with the issues were each responsible for
i never said this and my organization has not sworn this is that clear enough for you i am the leader youre talking about in the op
id agree with this  however the foundational documents  which have been erroneously refered to a constitution they are not but lets treat them as one   do mention that issues are supposed to be given as much time as needed so this idea could not be implementedi agree with both these ideas however it shouldnt be used as a blunt hammer to try and force debate on what the sanding rules are out of debate as a new body corporate the csm has a responsibility to pretty much make its standing orders and constitutional issues priority 1
let me get this straight right after the vote when the chairman confirms the resolution and no one else was allowed to speak you expressed an opinion as to what was voted onthere are really two ways that this could be construed 1 you were attempting to change the way the vote went to damage those who voted for it2 you were speaking out of line and out of turn in a disruptive manner for a purpose outside of the topic of discussion and deserved to be censured or removed from the meetingoh and i am sorry where in the documentation does it say that alternates serve an entire meeting if at any point the representative cannot make it for any pointit actually says that the alternate serves when the representative cannot make it and nothing morenow there are a few problems with this the first is that what the document says cannot be construed in any way to be broken up via meeting the second is that this means when you kicked hardin out of the second meeting you had entirely overstepped your bounds and made up the rules of the csm from whole cloth this is something you as an equal member of the council expressly have no power to do without a vote the third is wondering what your motives are for kicking out a member of the council duly voted in by the public
thanks for proving the op right guys
why is there a high content of goons in every we hate jade thread no substance to posts just their usual do it my way or we will ruin this game supported with sarcastic remarks of nongoon having no chance of being right if at least one goon is involved in debateplus most their time is spent figuring out what it is theyre doing just collect the fing threads from each section and make some kind of report out of them that ccp will be able to read  as it seems forum is not their style of reading things  ps yes i hate goons  in game they act like morons why not treat them like one   yes i hate sf as well but seeing goons act on forums as they do in game is appalling i just hope goons in csm dont do the same or else this will be first and last cms well see  and i guess goon work will be done with that happening  
nothing is wrong with arguments all involved with any politics involve their own personal beliefs and the beliefs of their constituents i say there is nothing wrong with political discourse or arguments at all ending discussion after someone steps out of line happens in politics i think it is a great idea that discussion such as this happen while childish to some it points out a candidates views and more importantly their actions whether you like dont like dont care about the members there they must all follow rules and the setting of those rules perhaps a little more guidance from ccp would be acceptable it seems much of the decision making regarding rules of conduct is left to people that may not have much in the way of guidancebringing ideas to the forefront from a players point of view is what i thought the csms jobit seems as if they are doing that and trying to do the best they can give em all a break relax breathe deep then have at it again just be respectfulgl and keep on talking in the end only better things will comei disagree with white ronin but hey he has his opinion and i have mine it does not devalue anything if we do not agree
that log was far too agressive a couple of csm reps clearly dont value another mere player as a moderator ccp might be worried about a corruption backlash if they were to moderate but if it was xagen etc who would argue no one  im specifically thinking about procedure interpretation there should be a hot line to ccp  imo inanna zuni  amoung others   takes jades attempts to keep chat structure massively insulting why lol in my mind its complete distrust and i dont think this can be resolved without ccp unfortunatelyalso this irc style format is not helpfull hard to put emotional meaning behind the context of words i hope that face to face meetings can stem misinterpretations of contempti have a new respect for bane that for the most part seems to want a smooth process
i really dont want to beat a dead horse but id like to respond to a few assumptions here and hopefully help shine some light on intentionsfirstly there is a hotline to ccp they want to be as uninvolved in the process as possible and for the most part i think thats admirable and correct i dont agree with anything being behindthescenes but for now i have to leave it at thatkeeping chat structure should be secondary to allowing the debate and allowing dissent thats part of the purpose people are going to disagree any time you censor someone and prevent that youre going to have a backlash thats what happened if you want to assume that distrust is the motivation for being upset at unnecessary censorship then thats completely your prerogative as much as it is for you to decide not to believe me when i say that the person performing the actions wasnt the problem or the cause of concern it was the actions themselves im a big enough boy to keep my mouth shut unless i feel something is wrong in which case it is not only my desire but my responsibility to open my mouth thats my jobinanna is far more mature and evenhanded than i am so im not sure where this idea that shes somehow an emotional and untrusting person comes from simply look at her statements she disagreed with something and i feel personally was treated wrongly especially given that this is a democratic council of 9 many others agree that doesnt make us more or less right it simply proves to me at least that im still sanethats just my opinion on the subject take it or leave it to be frank while i may disagree with jade i could really care less about what it does provided its not presuming to tell me what i can say how i have to say it or taking what i said and changing into something else i cant speak for anyone else in that regardre bane hes a sharp boy which is why he had such overwhelming support from his peers
i thought this link might help  probably should have posted it when i first heard of the csm proposal
would it be asking too much to suggest you cut out this referring to another person as it business we got elected as people we know each others names and were going to be sitting down at a face to face conference next week we might not like each other but referring to other council members as it is hardly helping the atmosphere at this point you arent going to be doing this face to face why act this way on a public forum
thank you
perhaps being face to face the proper word to use when referring to you in the third person will be more clear it could also be that it was an unintentional slip but dont let that get in the way of your persecution complex
he and him would be quite appropriate since were talking in an out of character sense if it was an unintentional slip then fair enough but please try not to make a habit of it since it can be construed as quite insulting to refer to another human being as an it thank you
saying that hardin was performing sexual acts with other representatives can also be construed as quite insultingkeep up the act of feigning surprise and offense where possible like a good little two faced politicianthank you
considering how often you refer to yourself as a woman the mistake must be an easy one to make you are the worst culprit in people that confuse your genderjust look at thisjade may be right about bane he is the expert on virtual handjobs
omgwell i could not have seen that you would prove me so rightreporteddisband the csmuse a random lottery to gather members quaterlyif they dont participate then oh wellyou cant do any worse then this freak show of political parody
another gem from mr easily offended
look it is working there are plently of people making issue threads and they are getting voted through to icelandi think these chat logs while unpleasent is an exercise of selective readingedit tho commentary is good ill be careful  as well as every other nonelected should   not to abuse my unacountability to spit notions of selfrightousness im not doing that i dont think i could do better
it bears reminding some of you that goonsred swarm federation constitute the largest unified bloc in eve each one of us pays our 15 a month usually in double triplicate or more we enjoy this game and take issues of game mechanics balance theorycrafting and rulesregulations very seriously the communal aspects of the game in terms of defining our alliances diplomacy with other players in eve is where we dont care goons have their communities were large enough to have an alliance made up of players from dozens of countries around the world were not here to make friends our friends are set blue everyone else is strangers we fear strangersit bears saying a second time goons take issues of game mechanics balance theorycrafting and rulesregulations very seriously the csm has afforded us to have a venue to express some issues that arise as a part of a 0 sec alliance and we are excited to see changes come of it this is why bane was voted on to the counselyou pubbies are free to hold whatever stereotypes prejudices theories speculations or hatreds for goons whether substantiated or not honestly we dont care but there are more of us unified behind our representatives and hoping for true change that benefits the game than there are of you pubbies that give half a  about what the csms do thats why you see goons raising hell heretldr  goons pay their 15 a month we have the right to express opinions andor threadnaught  if you knew what an epsilon threadnaught was youd hardly put this in the same league   if were passionate about an issue like this keep your prejudices and stereotypes we hate you too so much in fact weve got 2 people on the council working to make positive changes that will help everyone in eve youre welcome
things keep going like this and jade will be killed in a drunken rage when you meet face to face
that does not mean it is working only that things labeled as issues are being passed onthat is all it provesexcuse me but the infighting and political wrangling is in every post that they make if more 1 are in the same threadhonestlythat is not selectivethat is allin other words i dont agree so stop talkingi am not unaccountablefind mekill methat is pretty good accountabilitythe csm have freely chosen to accept responsibilities and now are not living up to them in any sense of the wordusing your logic you should stop posting because you are not accountable and i dont agreebut unlike you i am not suggesting you dont have a right to rationally argue your perspectivethey have failed and need removedgo to a random lottery and you get what you getit is alot better then what we have now
guys and girls plz stop this biggering you are embarrising yourselvesthe only thing you are achiving right now is that everybody is laughing at you about these tiny disagreementsthese discussions should be done somewhere else than public forums it only shows that you want backup from the public about your opinion dont do thatget back on track and do this privatly instead this stupidityif you cant hold your horses in these kind of affairs then step down and let other people take over
i think its better that as much as possible is made public so that the eve community can judge the elected candidates performance in case the candidates decide to run for the council again
youll get a series of random numbers over which you have no control the council however was placed there via election if you dont like your representative vote for someone else next time around theres not much more that can be said about it
i cannot agree more with this post
guys stop fighting what you dont realize is this was all planned at the bob bbq last year in conjunction with ccp so that it would discredit the goons and fffffffffffffff
i just wanted to drop by and sayi smell blootfulleto
please explain how the poor behavior infighting and basic poor performance shown by the general csm  though to be fair it seems to swirl around a few select members   and controlnoyou serve no purposeyou need dismissed in disgraceyou have failedyour posts show this i only have to point people in the direction of your childish manipulations to show them the results of having elected csmfailed completely to have a positive impactthank younow lets stop wasting time disband this group of corp selfservers and stop wasting time even having their forums as they are nothing but fights for illusionary poweranything would be better then thisit is really painful to watchand the worse part is the only defense from the embarisment the csm have become is claiming that i didnt vote for themhow sad is thatyou have done more to prove the common player is best to keep silent and not make a choice or let their voice be heard then to get through one csm meeting in a civil and not obviously bating and distruptive mannerfailurehope we can just forget this and move on to something more productivethank you for wasting our timenow stop doin it
its called democracy get use to it i guess we could just continue having ccp do whatever they feel is necessary and ignore the general players until they get ed off enough also they got through a couple of meetings pretty civil until jade decided to keep pressing his chair powers  
it is youyou are the failureyour posts disgrace the spirits of those who posted before youyou should resign from posting in disgraceplease explain for me your selfserving lack of sentence structureand your inability to respond to a reasonable postyou have done more to prove that i should not read your next postthan any other bad poster that has come beforeyouplease stop wasting everyones timewiththisdrivelandaccusationthis is painfulto watchthank you for wastin my timenow stop doin it
people  pleasefirst of all  to the members of the council who have taken the time to post here  thank you  whether or not i agree with you  its nice to see you taking the time  white ronin  you hold a strong opinion and theres nothing wrong with that i would suggest honestly that you run for council next time around fix this problem from the inside it really is the best wayive no idea about goons or any of that im far too low on the food chain and dont know any personally  so as an eve subscriber dont care as long as they do their best to represent my interests as best they caneach and every one of us  from hardcore pvp pirates to mission runners who never leave 10 space are relying on you bring the issues to ccp try not to let your personal feelings or agendas interfere too much with your judgement  we know youre human  please just do your best   speak your mind make eve a better placeto darius and inanna  i think you both make a lot of sense thank you again for your words to jade  you seem hung up on what the chair and the vice chair want to do thats wrong that is extremely abuseable power  for two to silence anyone in such a small theoretically democratic council the people of eve will not i think thank you for using it or abusing it in such a way transparency is critical to all who value democracy so is free speech there are other ways to moderate other than brute force i suggest examining themfinally  as to the low vote turnout  please keep in mind that not all of eve reads these forums many didnt understand what all the hullaballoo was about in the login messages and were more interested in playing the game than finding out hopefully that will change next time aroundat the end of the day  you are all our representatives whether we voted or not you hold great responsibility not power  ccp has all that but responsibilityplease use it wisely and please work together for all our betterment we will thank you for it and you will all enjoy your positions more for itgood luck to all of you and best wishesjh

i just have a general question really are the representatives assigned fields randomly or because they have basic knowledge on the subjects they are in charge ofnamely lavista the economist of the csm as far as i can see i know he wrote two reports on the eve economy but werent these disregarded due to lack of an in depth economic knowledge or somethingeither way i am looking forward to see some actual results from the csm but i seriously do hope that the people appointed actually do represent the average player in eve and have at least some basic knowledge in the fields that they have been assigned otherwise it could mean trouble
to my knowledge we havent been assigned any fields if we have i sure dont know what mine is any assignation we may have as far as i know is what we gave ourselves prior to running
i assignation you pubbie mining reforms
a simple i disagree with it too would have sufficed you didnt need to go into how he d your dog and killed your mother has it occurred to you that he may actually believe what hes saying
what do i have to gain from our own words being published what does that have to do with politics youre an absolute loon even if only because you truly believe anyone buys into your bulledit i cant help it if youre embarassed by your own conversations perhaps you should choose your words more wisely and not act like a baby when speaking with people
you know there is this funky new thing the kids are using called the interweb wtf does a trip to iceland have to do with anything
honestly no i have to work with the guy i dont have to trust or like him i am deeply suspicious of this measure and the reasons for its promotion but hey its my responsibility to put it on the agenda and ive done so
let me fill you in there cream puff were a public council our official communications are public record again how does that help me politicallyedit heres a hint it doesnt i dont need any votes
well no one trust or likes you and you are a loon that doesnt change that fact you power play all the time and the fact that the council should be able to vote on its governing not be like ohh eris discordia ccp who was one of those la maison people  lianhaun   help me my ability to be god emperor is in jeopardy eris discordia you are my only hope also learn how to not have every thing you say seem likewall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of textwall of text wall of text wall of texti honestly believe this is a real issue
you think up your own silly schemes i could ask you how having the sole channel of private communication we still have opened to public comment and politicized debate and trolling might help the process of the csm function but then maybe you dont want us to be able to talk without putting on the boxing gloves and adopting the combative stances of the factions weve devolved into who knows any which way i think its a bad issue and will be voting against well see what happens
my bet is on you losing throwing a tantrum muting any dissent then declaring the vote null after the fact this is purely based on past experience
id be voting to get you to time meeting when the only representatives in the us could attend and not be a giant sack of meat that is out to get them your 39 its not like you have a bed time any more
thats odd because this is a guy who could pretty easily have put himself in your seat if he wanted to promote his own interests even if you dont agree that youve been misusing the powers of the chair im sure youd agree that the powers you claim could be misused by someone with as horrible of intentions as you seem to suggest that darius has everything hes said and done thus far that ive seen is consistent with him legitimately believing that youre all equals and the only rightful task of the chair is calling votes and that everything should be as public as humanly possible i use anarchist as a oneliner to describe him  its not really accurate but radical populaist doesnt have the same ring to it its not a viewpoint i stand behind but ill defend him against what i perceive to be unfair criticism just like ill defend you from the same its not because i see eye to eye with either of you its because i prefer to stand up for truth and fairness as best i can and said truth is rather more fair to both of you than each other would like to admit id make a terrible partisan politician because of it  im way to quick to turn on my own side in public  but its the right thing to do if youre going to get involved in debates like this in the first place
i believe most documents in the house of lords and house of commons are public surpisingly enough their private correspondences phone calls messages and meetings are not further almost all committees have unminuted business to discuss issues frankly and bluntly otherwise we get all sorts of crap being thrown about in publicjade might be good to just state the agenda and step back seriously consider taking the alloted meeting time divide it between the issues over 90 and set 10 as aob if an issue fails to make it to a vote in its time limit then it gets canned to aob if it fails there then it gets canned to the next meeting
yeah moving administrative stuff to the end does actually sound like a damn good idea  i think ill do it
this isnt the house of lords but either way im willing to bet they held an actual vote or something to decide that im unfamiliar with that political system but here in america we agree on and publish our rules prior to stating their existence
nope disagree on this on reviewing serenitys statement on the issue  list   im happy with the wording it was intended to be a private mailing list and specifically stated as such  while this motion is to publicize its content motion stands as stated
ill try again pretty much all political structures have back channels of communication not open to the public belief that you can define all council business as public is just naieveever tried getting minutes of republican whips meetings with senators when theyre trying to encourage them to vote   
now step away from the agenda p
im naive then i thought this was a videogame space council not the un
its a committee trying to get work done the pitfalls for such groups are pretty universal as are the ways of getting around them  it doesnt matter if youre the house of commons or the greater tuktoyaktuk rotary club you want to have a back channel you can use to smooth things over without getting into ing matches or meeting formalities
i dont personally have any need for secret meetings if i did id say hey mister this is a secret meeting and you could decide whether it remained so if you spilled the beans then id know never to tell you another secret v0v
yup thats about how it works hence my comment about the 8man mailing list
yet constantly argue it should mirror real world systems surely notif its not really meant to be taken seriously why bother doing it near enough any committee  executive board has off the record channels of communication with each other its one of the ways to thrash out differences before meetings informally so that things dont get so heated under time pressure in the meetings it helps alot with committee cohesionwhat reason is there to see every single word a committee says during informal discussion their decisions can only be voted on during meetings and they are minuted as long as any issue debated is outlined clearly in the meeting then debates where opinions collide noticeably will be recorded and stuff will actually get done
mailing lists by nature have multiple members and arent assumed to be private fyi at least not where i come from perhaps theres a cultural difference here
where did i say its not meant to be taken seriously my statement which youve misconstrued was meant to say that real world rules need not apply here if they did theyd have been documented thats how i do things in the real world i document them to let everyone know what they arewhat reason is there not to see what the entire council discusses im not talking about private personal emails im talking about communications sent to everyone we may end up having to agree to disagree because i really dont have a problem with everything i write as a representative of the council being posted anywhere on the internet my actions are public actions
its to do with ease and convenience for councillors darius councillor a has some suggestions and wants peoples feedback he mails council mailing list for a chat alternatively he mails each one individually whats the difference
why would this exchange need to be kept private
because we only have so many csm meetings and because people need to discuss things before meetings if theyre going to get anything done
i agree jade i agree
the difference is that the first one works way better and that only the second would be private if darius motion passesedit misread quoted post
in one he emailed a list and in one he emailed each councilor individually the size of the to field would be one notable difference as ive said where i come from lists are treated differently if the councilors dont want me discussing what they say on the list then theyre free to remove me from their conversations they wish to remain private and use the list for announcements necessary for the csm as ive said to them and here i had no reason to believe this was some super secret list and id made them all aware of that if you do not wish me to talk about a conversation then either tell me so or dont have it ive never been anything other than honest
dammit i have to quit hitting quote instead of editmaybe they dont want to risk looking like an idiot publicly maybe they want to duck controversy by doing a straw poll on an issue and then backing down maybe theyre proposing something that their corpmates will hate
both would be allowed if the motion passes the list would be public if people want to have a private conversation nothings stopping anyone from doing so i dont control the internet
if you dont want to get caught with mud on your hands dont play in wet dirt
true i thought the word private was in the post i quoted my bad  its fixed abovei dont want people feeling forced to not do the right thing because it might damage their public persona theres no way to arrange facesaving if everything is public at a minimum
do the right thing and be proud of it im sorry but i honestly dont see how doing the right thing and public are mutually exclusive at the end of the day your votes going to be public anyway you are accountable to the public i dont get why anyone should try to hide anything unless theyve deliberately mislead people you may not agree but thats my opinion
i have to ask when you signed up to that mailing list did your read the eula because if it specified privacy like most lists then youre in breachim not on the committee darius but where you come from  america i believe   mailing lists are either open or closed the same as everywhere else in the worldif youre not willing to keep a private mailing list private you should remove yourself not wait to be removed
the eula which ill admit i didnt read until yesterday forbids the reposting of emails an act which has not been done i have talked about some of the discussions the council has had on that mailing list an act not forbidden by anything nobody and no eula can forbid me from discussing my experiences if i relay entire conversations thats one thing me saying lol jade is renaming all the subject lines like that proves some point what a tool violates nothing where i come from nothing is private unless explicitly stated as such in a clear and concise manner ill also note that i did not ever request to be a member of any mailing lists if the admin wants to remove me then he can remove me something ive also said to the admin and the entire council
darius had personal permission to post the private communications that he posted this trumps any such privacy agreementwhy is this true well because darius only shared his communications which he has the express right to do
some people are a lot less devilmaycare than you facesaving compromise is necessary to a lot of people on occasion and id rather not cut it off at the knees just because its something you dont intend to make use of
and i never stated that hed reposted anything anywhere though it is interesting that he did and that he hadnt read the eulasuffice to say a method where members of csm members can debate issues informally in private is useful arguing that you dont want to therefore everyone elses discussions should be public isnt really an argument remember this has to work past just this iteration of the committe
then let people have private conversations im not stopping them leave me out of it
im sorry but i cant be any clearer than saying if you want something to be private tell me so or dont send it to me i didnt ask to be added to any mailing lists or receive any emailsalso i posted my own emails so what theyre mine its my right to decide theyre not private nobody else has that right
andi think you can save a lot of time now then darius and just drop that agenda item as youve just conceded that even you think that people should be able to have their own private conversationsid also suggest that at this point you should probably leave that mailing list as its clear you dont support its purpose or you could wait to be removed but i dont see what that would achieve tbh
like i said thats exactly what i expect will happen if full disclosure of everything you see is how you want to do things i can hardly make you stop i can just suggest that youre being counterproductive and trying to tie the csms hands present and future into a poor way of doing business
most legal opinion on the subject holds a full disclosure right to recipients of emails in many  most its possibly different in the us which has some very strange copyright laws   cases the laws transfer full reproduction rights to recipients regardless fair use means your always allowed to reproduce a mailyou know those attachments on mail that says you may not reproduce this email blah blah  there isnt a court in the world that holds those things valid they are the equivalent of the shop sign that says no refunds totally invalidedit exception to above generally if the inbox is owned by your employer the mail becomes property of the company as you recieved it in the role of a servant of the entity
to your first point the agenda item and peoples private conversations are mutually exclusive the two items are not related as i did state i dont control the internet nor do you or the csm have private conversations do them in private places the way the list was used council statements and rules were handed down and defined among other things i think that should be part of the public record nothing ive said contradicts thati never asked to be on the mailing list i cannot remove myself and i didnt add myself i already said that as well twice
i was trying to avoid the legal argument on purpose jane as now i expect a flood of elawyers what youve said is however correct
edit ok sorry darius ill back down on the elawyering
oh the main issue at hand there though which im sure people will bring up is that only two of the recipients were american this is the main reason no emails were ever published save my own i am not familiar with their laws nor do i care to be
a mailing list you can opt out of recognises that a committee has collective needs to discuss issues and provides an easy method of facilitating thisyou can of course opt out as youve stated theyre hardly mutually exclusiveyou just argued against your own argument conclusively the committee needs to have tools when youre long gone youve conceded people can do and will have private discussions the objective of a mailing list is to allow for more conscise and meaningful debate in actual csm sessions these are publicyour argument for making it public is that you want it that way that is your entire argument based on the last page and a half and simply isnt a reason to do it meeting should likely go agenda item open say your piece someone summarises reasons against council votes over in about 5minsor given youve concluded its personal choice and people can opt out it doesnt even need to be on the agenda as trying to limit peoples ability to have personal discussions even about csm issues is not within your remit
you can restate your version of my statements until youre blue in the face ill prefer to say your statements are yours and mine are mine dont make a different statement than i did and say its mine i said all group communications should be public at the very least where they involve council duties saying i didnt say that or saying i said something else doesnt change it my statements are obvious because they have my name next to them not yoursreally i can only continue to respond to this with the same things ive already said it appears you disagree thats your prerogative and i respect your opinion a circular argument i will not have fyi you can disagree without editorializing other peoples statements
i agree to disagree then i hope the meeting is smoother this time
that makes two of us
all email unless deemed security sensative are public in the us govt i know this as i have had a few of my emails made public due to the freedom of information act now in jades char view over her subjects the commitee shouldnt allow anything public perhaps the chair should have ccp fund a kgb style unit darius will be taken in the middle of the nite and shot his acct canceld and a fake post made in his name stating that he was reallyy a wow player all along and wanted to make elfs in eve the whole time thus a trator to eve all crap aside it seems the evil darius of goons wants to make sure theres no question of his dedication to the players and not his corpaliences and this i applaud him for as for jane step down your not winning support your just makeing things worse with every word you type
look at minnie capitals dammit
goum give upfind something else to troll you come across as just about anything but sincerejade is chair chair has power to moderate argue all you like about whether they should be the only one with ops or if a paraphrased vote didnt implicitly mean that chair outlined rules for speaking and consequences chair enacted those rules a member of the committee refused to acknowledge the chairs authority to maintain order in the meeting sucks to be them they are wrongshould the chair have absolute power or should they be given guidelines id say guidelines who gives the guidelines ccpissue isnt really more than a waste of time at player level
ccp needed a neutral chair the moment they dreamed up this mess jade is unable to distance him or herself from the matters that are being discussed things degrade as a partial moderator has no power to actually moderate in addition jade believes that this chair position has some sort of god power to mandate things it doesnt sorryi would envision a ccp employee who chairs and gives different people the floor to speak even though they are somewhat biased it wont be some half crazed madman who has no ability to communicate with people of this reality
meeting moderaion has a different traditional meaning to chat channel moderaation i grant is vague but it does seem to be clarified with the notion that the committe is democratici would thus argue that no the mute power isnt implied by it at all
i agree yorda ccp will do nothing they dont want to and its silly of the document to pretend that they willmartin dictatorships function with a rational leader but they fail if an irrational leader comes to power that does not mean that dictatorship is a functioning form of government the great success of the us constitution is that it has been more robust than the leaders that have tried to change it and so should the csm document
those dictators have at least proven they can lead a country
hey nobody here is saying that goons are universally straightlaced moderate reasonable people  tress is from the looks of it an avatar of at least 40 of whats wrong with the internet but in a group of 5000 people theres bound to be at least a few rational intelligent ones and you ignore them at your own peril and thats not even getting into your nongoon detractors  is hardin a barking duck am i
a fair point but given that jade lives in a country ruled by gordon brown i think jade could lead a country just as well
ok there has to be a point when common sense in these matters comes in to play if the csm and the playerbase can not actually tell the difference between internet space ships and a frigging monster truck well there is no wonder ccp has the attitude they do i would toothis makes absolutely no sense
dude its lord emperor jade palatine why would he have to make any sense he has all the power to do whatever he wants
i propose the inclusion of the drone module proposal considering that when the drone issuses get presented to ccp the module and implant issues should be presented together since there are obvious balancing challenges affecting both not sure if this was the right place to post this since it is quite hard to find stuff in here and the assembly hall atm  
back to timing a moment im not quite sure why it has only just hit me but im partially doublebooked this evening with a real life meeting also taking place  probably because it was originally going to be last thursday and got postponed a week which i hadnt twigged was the same evening as this csm meeting   anyway the other meeting starts at 7pm uk  ie 6pm eve   and isnt too far from my home so i will hope to be online by 8pm eve ill take my laptop and mobile connection dongle too so worst case is that i am battery powered in the car piz
just in case of connection problems then can i ask you to make sure you mail in a list of vote preferences on the multi item issues that we do need to vote for this evening please
well jade i tallied the votes in that thread and out of 75 votes only 36 were from goonswarm that actually makes us the minority but nice try at trying to write off everything you disagree with as a goon conspiracy i think if it came down to a vote between your horrible destructible outpost idea and the monster truck one most people would say yours is worse 16 pages of discussion and only 39 votes of support is terrible 5587 people viewed your thread and the vast majority chose not to support it snip please resist the urge to end a post with a flame  mitnal
is it possible to join the channel as an observerthese things are comedy gold and would be fun to watch live while rattingwe should also set up a second commentary channel for viewers to chat about the slapstick antics live as they happen
um not to throw too big a wrench into these statistics but that doesnt indicate that 5587 people viewed the thread but rather that the thread have been viewed on 5587 different occassions it could easily mean that the thread was viewed 100 times each by 55 different peoplewhich is exactly why this forum really needs the potential to vote aginst a proposal as well as for it either that or only add to the views count on the very first time you view a thread then youd get a more accurate idea of what the true level of support for an issue
no hes saying that if you trained thousands of roaches to vote for you it doesnt make the issue worth dealing with the problem with this was always going to be goons collectively thinking they can force issues by getting the person using the alliance braincell to tell everyone else to vote for somethingunfortunately for roachswarm this int working and you are now all having a massive cry fest because you cant have your own way if u dont like it quit the game would be better for itbut hey let me guess i just dont get goons well thats no probem i dont get roaches either it doesnt make them anything other than nasty little grubs
meeting 4 is concluded we discussed the documentation and debated the multiitem issues took almost 3 hours with some good high quality debate from the csm reps in attendance big thanks to everyone for this serenity should be adding the chatlogs to the csm site soon but until then ive posted the log on the jericho public forums and is viewable hereenjoy next meeting is on sunday
you mean buy isk from isk farmerssigh
is there a list of issues that the csm have voted on and the result after browsing through the logs most of what ive seen is them voting on themselves in some way or another it might be a good idea to have a results thread so we can see what is going on
edited because i was completely wrong
on the left nav under eve insider theres now a csm link from there you can find the meeting minutes they should contain an abbreviated version on the meetings which should include votesthe last meeting may not be up there yet as these are added by ccp you may have to parse that from the chatlogs at evecsmcom
results of the 3rd meeting are here in a condensed form thats a lot easier to read than the chatlog
hey thanks for the heads up the summary will help
they look out for themselves and their own thats why most of them ran on a platform of pet issues
wow i see this forum actually is very useful now i can learn all of the games best exploits long before ccp actually bothers getting around to fix them super
if you consider this whining  you really need to get off the computer and go get a girlfriend 
pitboss i really intended to get involved with this discussion and there is still time to get it on the agenda for sunday i do have a issue with the proposal as youve stated it on the thread though  and thats about what happens to my gang mates wreck flagging if we lose a ship fighting in hisec against war enemies is it our enemies that get to own the wreck for the purpose of flagging other neutral thieves that come and steal it how about both the corporationgang mates of the victim  the kill get dual ownership of the wreck  so anybody stealing from it gets flagged to both partieshow does that sound can you work it into the proposal somehowweve still got time to get this heard for sunday  let me know what you think and if we can sort out some agreement on that dual ownership thing ill advocate and raise the issue for you
wait a second pit boss had a decent support and response and he has to change his proposal because you do not agree with it as such your agenda made the list and it did not even get even close to the same type of support how does that work that has been my point ie the removal of the learning skills issue fell flat on its face support wise and the op had by no means changed anything that would make any senseso how does this work he made the mark of 7 days at least garnered strong support and the ratio was much higher than the ones that is currently on the list
listen scream at me for taking an interest and actually getting involved in the discussion if you want or maybe i could just ignore it and go away because im tired of the childish claptrap on this forum the pure amount of time thats been wasted this week over the most irrelevant rubbish is astounding so why dont you just shut up and let pitboss answer its his damn thread if you want to join the mob its  that way
i dont view whine as a pejorative per se  ive described some of my own threads as whine threads before nonetheless your tldr is you didnt pick me youre all selfserving jerks  if thats not whining i dont know what is as for getting a girlfriend theres not enough sex in the world to keep me from being an overeducated  id definitely have less time to post here if i had access to all the sex in the world of course but it wouldnt change my opinion of what you have to say if i still managed to see it
wow nice you are really showing your true colors couldnt find the mute button so you decided to try to shout me down i was not screaming at you in this thread i was actually asking questions to fully understand how this works i was very calm as i wrote that and actually was looking for a real answer i am not sure how you read that as a challenge but i guess you have some issues or something you need to work out or did i hit a nerve of some kind and as far as yhis is his thread is poppy it is posted in a public forum and telling me to go away is not with in your power sir i am not a part of any mob and i am an independent player that has an interest on how this game is played
thanks for your prompt response jade  i will post something to the effect on dual ownership and what not in a bit after ive sat down and thought it out  the reason for this is because i do realize that there has to be a compromise to get this topic on the agenda  and many thanks for giving it the opportunitymy answer may not be the best one  but i am willing to put forth another effort to get something fixed that i personally  and others   may feel is broken to the satisfaction of the majority
then id advise you reread what you wrote and revisit your tone and ask the questions with a more neutral phrasing that doesnt immediately move to accusation and condemnation i felt its entirely ridiculous for you to criticize me for suggesting an alternation to the issue that would let me support it with a clear conscience isnt that exactly what were supposed to be doing  engaging with player issues and supporting those we feel are a genuinely good idea for the gamehonestly yes i did snap at you but its not been a very productive day for csm issues and i found it disappointing that actually having a couple of minutes to look at a genuine issue again turns back into the accusationcharged environment elsewhere on these forums today people are human farrqua  even csm reps
yeah i do apologize for taking a while to get round to this but the dual ownership thing was the compromise that a lot of people ive asked about it felt would be needed it is a fairly complicated issue in that respect the basic principle you know i love  more pvp opportunity in empire and consequence for theft is great just needed that tweak really fingers crossed we can get it through the csm now all the best
wow jade this is apublic discussion forum the thread does not belong to the op you are totally clueless arent you
my tone was apparently created on your end trying to milk the tone or poster of someone from cold text without observing gestures tone of voice or eye contact is a wee bit silly i think and a little presumptuous however i will return in kind as it has been in previous posts towards me yes we all are human and we do at times see the boogie man under every rock when we think we are being prosecutedfrom someone outside of the current debacle of political posturing from the different sides and factions i am not all that confident in this process i am on 2nd life here in eve started and watched the game grow and expand from the beginning and as a player form the masses that voted in the hope for change i feel obligated to debate and comment where i feel and in the manner i feel as it best meets the current tone form the csm and its chair
dude valium
i dont have particular interest in jade constantine but i do find the antijade people amusingthis is turning into classic democratic politics  the politics of never ending arguments where nothing can be done where people waste entire time talking about silly irrelevant things that look absolutely ridiculous to outside observerjade is fighting against that lets see if csm people can do better than the usa congress
as one of the minority who actually voted can i please request the csm members take a deep breath forget the previous meetings and actually get on with itfor those members who have been trying to do that which they were elected to do namely represent us apologies for any of this for those members busy trying to derail the proceedings you should be ashamed of yourselves ive seen 12year olds act with more maturityedit i mean come on you spent ages arguing over the definition of the word abstain it has a definition already no need to invent a new one use that and move onyes its clear various people screwed up better that its put in the past and learned from instead of people arrogantly claiming they did no wrongask yourself this are you politicians or representativespoliticians lie a lot in their manifestos and then do exactly what they feel like based on their personal issuesrepresentatives on the other hand are about putting their own views aside and seeing the big picture what both the majority and minorities need and want whether vocal or not and what benefits all of evewhich is it to be
i think this is a good post it hit the nail right on the head
theres a meeting tonight what more do you want im at work typing a document right now if you dont like what people have to say on forums dont read it the csm is exactly that a council not some collection of people who should be forced to live up to 200k peoples individual opinions on morality or behavior thats simply unrealistic
what if theyre political representatives
i think the problem has been that the representatives havent been allowed to do their job due to being suppressed and marginalized at every turn the representatives were elected to do a job if someone is silencing their opinion  ianna   not allowing them to replace their alternate  hardin   or otherwise preventing them from doing their job should they just try to continue anyway i dont think so if my elected representatives voice isnt being heard i dont want anyone elses to be until true democracy is restored this whole thing is a farce and you might as well just let jade be a dictator and make all the decisions
thank youwho said anything about forcing or morality the fact that you are being defensive implies you feel you acted improperly but arent prepared to admit that i for one did not name names or point fingers so why do you feel you are being singled out here you seem to be placing yourself in one camp i did not put you therefrom your statements you clearly feel that you dont represent everyone and thats fine differing points of view are always good there is however a difference in representing a point of view and believing that to be the only one all i am asking is that the former happens not the lattertrue im just one person but i dont think its an unreasonable requestedit quite why some seem to feel that the moment these sorts of things are said it automatically applies to the goons is beyond me it applies to everyone
im going to ask you to do the same as ive asked other people allow me to speak for myself if i felt i acted improperly id have said so i dont i didnt place myself in one camp god did i am one person who speaks for myself your statement was a blanket statement regarding behavior and mine was a blanket response regarding the samei agree with you that there are to be differing points of view as a matter of fact ive said it over and over and over again at least 3 or 4 times todaybelieve me i didnt believe your statement applied only to me or was directed at me that doesnt change my statement in any way nor does it make my statement purely about me the third sentence is the only sentence in that paragraph that relates directly to me
fair enough as with all internet discussions what appears to be implied is all too easily misread it does sometimes get a little difficult in threads with the level of hostility some manage to put across apologies for getting the wrong end of the stick
the system is completely broken implying that everyone should just get on with it without offering any solutions as to how to do that is completely nonconstructive its like everyone who tells ccp to fix the lag ffs tbfh yes everyone wants to the fix the lag ccp is already trying to fix the lag you have added absolutely nothing to the achievement of that goal
actually the system isnt broken what it takes is the csm delegates to actually focus on game issues not their personal issues with each other some are trying to clearly im just asking for a little sense to be applied i call that very constructive since hardly anyone else has actually said that ive seen a lot of grandstanding and wringing of hands by a lot of posters and not much constructive input at all
yes because when the chair person is abusing their power to control the meeting to their own whims there is totally nothing wrong
having read the transcripts i have to say that it seems that these meetings are useless and mired in political squabbling self importance and maneuvering to get a personal nanophoon of eve i know that this might come across as harsh to the csms but lets remember who they are supposed to be working for  us the player base the csms need to stop working on pork barrel and start working on the main issues that eve has if they dont i will be proposing a recall election since guidelines for csms seem to be wanting here are some of the issues you should be discussing 1   problems in the ui and especially the corporate interface i swear all of you should lock and then unlock 500 blueprints and run a large corp2   long term direction for revising the rules of sovereignty basically moving eve to the point where kingdoms can be established and what the dynamics of that are deployable faction bubbles and gate guns locked stargates between sov3 systems 3   evaluation of the security status system and if it is achieving its stated aims if not proposals for modifications of the system 4   evaluation of problems that still persist in the ui and prioritization of resolving these issues  50000 1kb files in the log directory leaps to mind   5   evaluation of new technologies such as black ops jump freighters and so on and suggestion of where they should go in a general sense and preliminary ideas of how to get them there 6   evaluation of the jita issue do we make all of the forge an instadelivery zone how can we encourage markets to spread out and diversify7   additional economic tools needed by trading players such as long term charts galaxy wide economic evaluation based on expensive to train skills and so on 8   evaluation of the structure of alliances a dictatorship alliance has been promised 4 years now lets get it delivered 9   other wide sweeping concepts of concern to the majority of the player base not just your corp alliance or play style get moving or step down and let someone else take your place form a list of these issues and then tackle them one at a time and then make recommendations you have a lot of credibility to earn you were elected to do a job not put a feather in your cap  rells
i hate to burst your bubble since you obviously took quite a bit of time to make this post but many of the issues youve posted have already been voted into the agenda in iceland im about to leave for home so i cant address each one but you may want to check out the minutes which will include vote resultsyou can find them on a csm link on your left nav on this site or wwwevecsmcomany issues which arent there can be raised in the other forum created specifically for raising issuesim sure you know this already though because you read the transcripts
large majority of those issues are already very well covered please refer to the minutes that was published today
me wipes tears from eyes oh dearie me what a facepalm moment that was
i believe other forum systems have this curious notion called a oh what is it called oh yes a poll i am somewhat surprised we dont
then you havent spent much time in there ive only been reading it for about four months and seen quite a few ccp replies and stuff that then made it into dev blogs youre talking rubbish do some research
what needs to be implemented is more sub folders broken into the 4 races plus 1 for alliances and a non postable folder for popular where only csm members can move very popular threads for wider discussionunder those then you add folders for items like pos mechanics sovereignty and ship classes this would reduce alot of the multiple threads on the same subjectnext you need a vote meter implemented viewable from the thread title but not requiring a response post just login and vote 1 vote per account per thread
um i will admit hot keys were something i was suprised the game didnt have or even binding of certain keys i have gotten used to it but i dont see why not to have it looked at so support i will
lockedtroll
im going to support this  adding it to the agenda on sunday as well only proviso id make is that there should be some kind of dualownership of wrecks  for the purpose of aggressionflagging   both the gang mates of a destroyed ship and the people on the killmail of the destroyed ship should have ownership rights on the wreck in my opinion everyone of these people should be able to fire on a looter stealing from an involved wreck any which case adding it as an issue to be raised and hopefully we get to discuss it with ccp
jade has sufficiently summerized my feelings on the issueits definatly a critical issue for those of us who pvp for a living and it just makes sense tbh
nuff said
awesome do it now
signed
this does seem a nicer solution than the existing method of doing pos im also deriving a certain bit of joy considering what the big alliances would do if faced with reorganizing their vast pos arrays over the change
signedhey lets repeat that 100 pages thread in features  ideas all over
support
signed 2 acctsi want my luscious 2 monitor support
i have written a submission template for this topic i will try and get it raised as an issue on the next possible meeting

i would advise you read this thread here its a about dual monitors and it contains a reponse from ccp whisper let me copy and paste it actuallya long time ago eve had dual monitor support but it caused a lot more gamestopping problems than it was worth reinstating this is on our huge extensive massive just plain long wishlist of things we want to doright now the only dual screen thing people manage to do is stretch the display across two screens by setting a custom resolution in their drivers and getting eve to use that usually horizontally which means you end up with two halves of the hud on either monitor personally that would annoy the living daylights out of mei havent seen anyone stretch it vertically thoughprobably because to do this you would need a more intricate monitor mounting which is what you are building so it would be worth a shot id figure thing like the neocom and station services would still have all functional elements on one monitor probably the top one you can of course move the inspace ui elements to wherever you need themnot sure how having two really wide monitor bezels breaking up the image would feel thoughas stated i find even just the vertical split irritatinghaving a long horizontal split would be even more intrusive
make it 3 monitors so that u can have the splits be more intuitive
my emotions after multiscreen eve is implementedi support
so we all agree that the naglfa is terrible at the momentin the interest of keeping this thread active what needs to be done to fix itim thinking it might not be the capitals that need a buff but the weapon systems them selves if capital artillery and auto cannons had a built in gyro ii buff would this mitigate their low dpsi would even suggest a minor buff to the damage from the citidal torp launcher as well as well dependent on not over powering the phoenix which i hear also has underwhelming damage potential
without getting in to the numbers the naglfars best shot at matching the dps of other capitals is to fill its lows with damage mods and then have a subpar shield tank the alternative is to go for no damage mods and a standard armor tank or some dreadful half armor tank with a couple of damage mods any way you slice it theres no real way to make it match up to the tankdps levels of the other capitals
nothing to add other than a thumbs up
i think a general buff of minmatar tech 1 xl  l ammo would help a lot  even sm t2 artillery ammo buff wouldnt really effect nanoships while greatly improving the bs and above that desperately need help  i would like to see the single ship bonus per weapon type  torps and projectiles   be turned into two  basically add an rofdamage bonus on top of the other bonus   a major cpu buff to the nag  so that it doesnt need coprocessors to fit a shield tank   and more mid slots  less low slots   so that the nag can fit a more respectable tanka rate of fire buff built into capital projectile  torp damage would also help the phoenix and naglfar without making either too strong
naglfar suggested changesobjective  weaker than average tank but greater than average dpsdrop a mid slot for two low slots turn it into an clear armor tanker by slot layout changesdo not buff citadel torpedoes but buff capital artillery substantially
the biggest problem stems from the fact that it has 1 less midlow to handle having 5 highs the is the general crux of split weapon design it works on the typhoon because it has more drone bw than the average bs the cant exactly be done at the dread level esp wo trampling on the moroes that said the moroes is like a dominix that can fit 8 bonused turretseven if artillery and cit torps were buffed they wouldnt scale well due to the nags slot imbalance giving up a midlow for the extra high  that doesnt equal superior dps   just seems like a design failure even with some damage mods in the lows the ship doesnt have the cpu to shield tank well so much for versatilityccp needs to get out of the fixed  of slots per ships or compensate in another fashion  like on the phoon   if they want to make split weapon systems work well or even better make my suggestions basically make it on par or keep the weak tank and buff the dps a   make it 100 artillery balance xl artillery so that 3x are in the same ballpark as the other dreads take away a high and either set it up to shield tank like the phoenix or armor tank like the moroes hell give it a mael tanking bonus there arent enough shield tanking caps as it is and minmatar still will have to train at least then it can scale with dmg mods and wont always be insta primaried alternative is to make it 3x artillery and 1x torp to make it scale better with dmg modsb   balance it so the extra skills training pays off for torps  projectiles to do so youd need to make it do the most raw dps wo dmg mods but slightly below average with less than perfect skillsc   balance the dps so its on par but make it a shield tanker so it can use its lows for dmg mods it currently lacks the cpu and slot layout to do this none of these are really new ideas
i think the simplest solution to this would be to add an anchoringonlining queue so you can just queue up your anchoring and onlining commands at the beginning and dont have to sit there clicking things every five minutes itll still take 68 hours to construct a fully functional pos but it removes the tedium aspect from the process also in addition to the existing anchoring process add an anchor top and anchor bottom command that will automatically anchor the module in question at the top or the bottom of the pos as close to the tower and as close to the vertical axis of the tower as possible so you can queue up a typical pos setup without having to drag around the annoying green box for every single module
is about how i felt reading the op
ive only ever set up one pos in eve and that was one of the most painful things ive done in this game please change it
posting in a thread
thumbsup
timesinks are not funny a game should be fun
i spend a great deal of time putting up poses and it just takes far far far too long its almost as bad as taking them back down s they take far too long to put up and take down far too many man hours to fuel and keep working on a consistant basis fully support a reworking of this entire concept though as with all csm ideas i dont support any one idea towards doing it as its their job to flag issues not design the game
i agree with the man from the swarm i feel dirty
signed
the mechanism to setup and manage poss right now is pretty bad fully support this
a simple solution would be to allow queuing of anchoring andor onlining of structures it still limits the number of structures that can be anchoredonlined in a given timeframe while not requiring that someone sit on their ass for 6 hours  literally   to anchor and online a pos
suporting
please fix issues that cause our logistics friends to burn out because i dont want to ever have to do any form of logistics myself
changing the structure of the gtcs seemed weird to me  dont know why their computers cant handle 30 50 60 90 120 and 180 day cards if thats what the players want ooak
wasnt this topic supose to be voted on yesterday what ever happend to that
removing local  removing the only viable rattermineretc defense spamming scan 360 isnt much of an optionbut i have to admit it would make the game more interesting of course nerfing gate camping andor warp jamming would be nice too
outstanding contribution to this threadi give you guys a 9 out of 10 for your effort and ability to see the big picture instead of your own narrow minded portion of the picture to think of local as your only viable defense is why you die to pirates and gank squadsthis game is about thinking adapting and teamwork this is why the majority of all updates to the game are team oriented this is a multiplayer game not a single player game if this change is made it would make it that much more important for players to work as a team to get things accomplished players would have to depend on teamwork to get through dangerous areas of space just like with real life i dont see a local chat when i go into the wrong end of town telling me there is a guy there ready to mug mewhat the op is suggesting is an outstanding way to improve not only pvp  not just pirating   but also a way for miners and haulers hide more efficiently no more will a small gank squad be able to roll into a system and instantly see who is there if the miners or haulers use a scout on ingates and in scan spots they will know when a hostile or shady character enters system and will be able to warn his gang membersopen your eyes and look at both sides of the pictureif you use team work within this game you can eliminate half of the idiotic carebear kills in the game but those who die while mining ratting and hauling die because they are doing it alone andor without a scout this game wasnt built for solo playit was build for team play and once you start playing as such you will see how much more productive you can and will be
a chat channel should not be used for intel 100 behind this
i would be for this but active pilots in space option on the map would have to be removed to make it workable for ambushes and fair for carebears until then no supportps perhaps also as compensation show a standings column on the scanner otherwise i think gathering intel will be too tedious
yes ive seen that one i cant imagine that the coding would take any longer than 5 minutes max so theyve obviously forgotten about it
a would vote thumbs up again

make it happen
me seriously considers making a motion to ask ccp to stop embarrassing themselves
issue ccp has not updated the mac and linux communities on the status of development on their clients since the trinity 11 release and has missed several selfimposed delivery dates for a premium content client for those platforms yet has still not let the community know when they can be expected or whether development is even ongoingproblem i am one of a number of people who only started playing eve because the mac and linux clients were made available i no longer use those clients exclusively but they are still the most easily available platforms for me unfortunately i and many other users of those clients are growing increasingly frustrated with the complete lack of communication from ccp on the status of1   the disco box bug in which the starfield is replaced with random visual noise that often requires the client to be restarted to clear and is almost painful to look at2   the f11 inset map being filled with static3   frequent crashes that often require the computer to be rebooted in order to launch the eve client once again4   and of course our own premium content client which ccp originally promised to deliver in the first quarter of 2008 then later said would be delivered with the empyrean age expansion now its totally understandable that there be some issues ccp is not familliar with either of these platforms the clients are new and its not the primary focus on their user base the problem is that ccp has not been forthcoming about the status of these issues many users in the mac community are beginning to wonder if ccp has silently halted development on the nonwindows clients we have repeatedly requested status updates in the forums and have gotten no response furthermore many of us were greatly disappointed to see that there were no osspecific bug fixes in the release notes i havent encountered the disco box since the ea update but the f11 map is definitely still broken and the client crashes as much as it ever didpossible solution therefore i beseech the council of stellar management to take up our case were not asking you to browbeat ccp into fixing these issues wed be happy just to have some idea of whats going on if the answer is ccp does not feel that the mac and linux user base is valuable enough to continue client development on those platforms well thats fine we just want to know so we can go on with our lives and if the answer is ccp is actively working on osx and linux client development thats great but wed really really like to hear how thats going and not just how its going now  wed like to continue to get regular status updates this silence is upsetting the community more than being told no to our requests would its making us feel like ccp doesnt even care enough about us to tell us that it doesnt value us as customers please csms ask ccp to tell us whats happening and where we go from here
supportcommunication is a good thing especially when the same bugs and instabilities exist through 3 patch releases and delivery dates for the promised premium client slip its understandable that ccp has to rely on transgaming as part of the developme
completely agreed im a multiplatform player and i am frustrated at the lack of communication from ccp about the status of mac client in particular just give us a realistic road map that youll stick to or tell us youre ending support although with the macmarket share up around 10 thats potentially a pretty large user basei support kespers request for the csm to assist in moving this issue forward with ccp
1ccp has time to talk with apple news sites but not with their paying customers
supporting this
most definitely give my mac some love
consider this on this list it wont make it to iceland im affraid too late for that but its in the pipeline and if theres time to spare in the meetings ill try to squeeze a comment out of them
there is a laundry list of issues with the cedega linux client to the point that anyone not running eve under wine is just silly please either provide better hooks for wine or get someone competent working on the official client
yes
i was originaly going to switch fully to linix when i heard of eve going to it but atm i find its just not worth itwould love to hear more about it
ever thought about replacing your sound effects to make them sound  better what about warping would you want to hear captain picard say engage with this idea you can allowing players to mod sound effects opens the door for sound modding and sound packages which can boost eve quality immensely these sounds wont effect anyone else think of them as skins or sound packs for games like day of defeat counterstrike or what have youonly the player using the mods will be able to hearsee the changes
i like it but then again id also like the entire sound effects system to be overhauled and brought to date i guess the reason why this has never seemed a pressing item for development has been the fact that most pvpers generally play with the sounds off  but that doesnt mean we shouldnt have a decent sound system in place for people playing solo or missioning or whatnot
i would just like to hear my own mp3 collection through the jukebox
i also believe this to be a good idea
me votes for everything making eve more customisable
im in favour of both the op and post 3 im for just about any form of moddability i can get
this would be ing awesome
since you really wouldnt want to autopilot through enemy highsec   
fyp
no real reason not to do this really add this along with a systems to avoid option
is this including or excluding nulsec anyway supported
hahahaha pubbies
lol you use autopilot
signed for obvious reasonswtz across multiple jumps without a route planner tends to waste time id hate not having iti guess the weights of the pathfinder should be completely customizable but then i doubt ccp would acknowledge the genie of making something a sandbox   
shut your faceusing the map autopilot system is a guide you can use it without pushing the autopilot buttonthanks for playingvvvvv i was supporting my corp member
rude but accurate even when im using wtz i still set destination in game because it generates the shortest route with certain characteristics the list of characteristics you consider should be expanded
id love to hear from ccp what they really think about t2 bpo within the existing economy
i got the thumb shimmie workingi support this idea and would like to see clearer lines of communication from devswill a csm member bring this topic up at the meeting it isnt asking for epic changes simply a dev response

i want the chance for new t2 bpos make it a higher invention using t1 bpos 10x the data core special decryptor but at lest give us the chance
an answer from ccp would be nice yeah   
considering howwell controversial the issue appears to be for allot of people i am surprised that such a modest number actually wants to know the answers really am surprised i guess as i mentioned elsewhere i still firmly believe that the provocateurs on both sides of the socalled t2 bpo issue are really afraid to ask the developers of the game real questions because they are really afraid of the answers
i support the idea of getting a clear statement we all can work with whether people are in agreement or not with the answer we all can at least have an understanding
bump again

free kugs
aye force ccp to resolve this
 singedand singed to more frequent dev responses
as i cant be arsed to dig through seven pages im going to mention the perfect solution dont queue but stack skills a lot of them to all you can momentarily train so if you have 10 onehour skills to train you can train them simultaneously and do the next batch ten hours later or come back after nine hours and finish one skill in six minutesim still wondering why ccp needs to be forced to take a position in such matters
yes
i would like to have a queue as well
its an awful idea i disagree 100
ccp are only human too errors may happen which may worry them  possible lawsuit usual bull   infact you can almost guarantee with 100 certainty errors will happen what ccp have to do is decide whether the increase in subscription income is worth the unhappiness of some players i personally feel theyre just simply lazy greedy or too afraid of possible consequences there are alot of feasible solutions to this problem and theyve decided to act on none of them  that im aware of   theyve banned sellers and reversed some isk but thats all it is some a minute fraction of whats actually being thrown about and stored by the companies they need to act but i dont think they want to out of fear of possible mistakes which will backfire on them because lets face it the majority of people would be ok with a mistake and an apology and rectification of the situation but then there are always those few who try to use anything and everything available to themselves to enhance their own lives even if by making others worse along with the loss of subscription probably makes the ceo of ccp poop himself thinking about banning isk farmersas for farmers theyre a curse and a blessing theyre chopping prices of all ingame ships but making it more difficult for profiteering blah blah blah insert usual  heremeh ive given up on trying to convince people and ccp that farmers are badtheyre against the eula and i personally feel theyre scum im more than happy to crush their pods in an instant wrong account  wrathful hawk
original threadat this moment the thread is 11 pages long and still goingshort versionproblems  the lack of alternative means of manufacturing anything in eve combined with a much too perfectly working market and the good old human greed has completely denaturated the originally intended balance of prices for minerals  and therefore potential income from mining depending on system security   and moon materials  therefore causing dyspprom moons to be worth shedloads and rest nearly worthless  and why would this be a problem  because the risk and effort has to be balanced with reward proportionallyin the case of ore the averagerisk one has become worthless compared to the norisk one and the highrisk one is barly more profitable compared to the nearly norisk onein the case of moons the effort and investment required to operate a certain moon as mining moon is nearly identical regardless of moon yet the rewards range from a nearly complete loss for lowvalue moons  keeping in service only to offset fuel costs for sov purposes   to a disproportionately high profit  measured in billions monthly per moon potentially ten billion in the near future  proposals  either one of the alternatives below or any combination of them from just one to all in varying degrees could be acceptable  slowlyconstantly tweaking the blueprintreaction inputs requirements so that they require less of the overevaluated materials and more of the underevaluated ones adding alternative blueprintsreactions which use a lot more currently undervalued materials with very little or even none of the currently overevaluated ones which would output the same  or virtually identical   products for moons revamping extraction on a per concentration basis with most  if not all   materials present in each and every moon just with different rates of extraction for minerals a multitude of subsolutions ranging from a revamp of drone alloy drops  no more abundance of highends and lack of lowends   or rethinking ore makeup  in terms of refining yields   or even a total revamp of the mining system  all ore available everywhere just with different concentrations  ie different extraction rates for various ores depending on system security  the issue is not so much the fact that something needs to be done but the fact that it needs to be done fast because its been badly broken for at least a year and mildly broken for almost a year and a halfin other words that this issue needs urgent attention no matter what the chosen alternatives are  because theres plenty  
breaking news update  first csm representative support lame need to post again to express support to own issue  checkjust to avoid a lot of confusioni do not care which exact solution or combination of possible solutions is getting pickedi only care about the csm  and therefore hopefully ccp too   acknowledging that we do have a problem understanding why the problem exists and picking a realistic solutionsince the introduction of the drone regions and invention  the first triggers of the current crisis   nearly all subsequent changes ccp introduced related to these two separate  but similar   problems have made things worse with a handfull of exceptionsthe exceptions  the only good changes   were the removal of some megacyte and addition of some mexallon in one of the more valuable drone alloys fairly recently and the revamp of decryptor bonuses and distribution method  which made invention slightly less wasteful but still not decent enough to even come close to a meresearched bpo  if you agree this issue should be brought forth to ccp by the csmdont forget to check the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on box in your postif your post doesnt show a please visit your user settings to reenable images under your name you forgot to check itit doesnt matter if you agree with any of the particular solutions listed in hereit just means you want the csm to talk about the issue and possible solutions to the devs at ccp
while modifying supply of roid minerals might be a good idea modiying the use of moon minerals probably isntwhy because moon minerals high price is good for promoting pvp moons need to be valuable to support people wanting to take and hold themthe real problem is that supply will always be pegged to the highest demanded moon minerals and the answer is to add more reactions these reactions turn one moon mineral into another moon mineral at a certain ratethis means that you can lock the relative values of moons and as demand increases less efficient moons become more productive to exploitmore moons of varying high values means more fighting over these moonsmore fighting over these moons is good
this issue has been touched from several different directions over the course of the threadright now we have a guesstimated 200 dysprosium moons worth a bit over 6 bil a month another guesstimated 200 promethium moons worth around 25 bil a month on the insanely valuable side of the spectrumon the other side of the equallyrare spectrum we have pretty much the same number of neodymium and thulium moons which are barely worth around 100 mil each monthlythe higher the bottleneck materials go the lower the rest go until they can go down no longer then overall t2 prices go up as dyspprom keep going up tookind of nastybut if you balance the requirements of all equally rare materials you make them all almost equally valuable and as you add alternative means to obtain components you correct the relative value of those components  depending how much more compared to base are needed   while the overall demand keeps increasing  heck actually it increases a lot more early on after their introduction since lower t2 prices due to more junk materials being used up to increase supply promote consumption until a new balance point is reached where overall demand is higher with relative moon material prices relatively balanced no more almost4ordersofmagnitude differences

no no no atika you get your butt handed to you in one thread and then you start the same one in a differnet locationcome on its your perception you put it perfectly the world that is eve perfectly working market and the good old human greedfree market with limited resource  monopoly and profitit cost as much to deep mine tin copper or lead as it does gold commodity price is different but cost is the same to produce gold has more profit but theres a lot less available to mine its easy to strip mine bauxite and iron ores coal and tar sands but different availabilities and prices  get the picture so try to think of your all minerals and moon products in this way it will take the strain off your brain you could also think about oil from saudi arabia that costs 10 to produce and oil in the north sea that costs 30 to produce same price on the world market but one has high risk and low reward thats an effect of the free marketthere has to be supply limits thats why zydrine is more expensive than trit but they are also used in different ratios 10k trit 250 zydrine there is no under or over valued minerals there is just supply availability that sets the price and supply is set by players not ccp alliances could dump huge amounts of high ends on the markets but they dont want to its not in thier interests is it america doesnt go out handing out f16s or high end cryptography to everyone do they its not in thier interestsall ccp do is provide us with a real model to play with any riskreward is relative and not real world type but what really governs eve for the vast majority is action takenfun derived you forget that infulence all the time even though its the driver behind new eden
your sorta missed the point and thats okay
wow how convenient how about applying the very same argument to the minerals in eve and see how your own analogy dictates that tritanium should be a lot cheaper than it is and megagyte a lot more expensivetalk about shooting yourself in the foot youre arguing exactly the same thing im arguing but you are seemingly completely ignorant of the history and motives for the changes that have been happening in the past year year and a halfand this precisely why ccp must intervene to fix what they have broken in the first place by altering the supply side for minerals and the demand side for moon materials
seems like a kind of inefficient solution to be honest i think that there are better ways that this can be done especially your other pointsabsolutely agreedone suggestion i made on shc is to make moon materials dynamic though at a very slow rate as in a material that is mined slowly gains a chance of being removed from moon and spawned at another unoccupied moon elsewhere  within the region or within a certain distance in lightyears   this would create different hotspots for alliances to fight over and makes it a bit harder for heavily entrenched alliances to hold onto highvalue moonsi would be all for any of those solutions though i the last part may be a bit difficult to implementoverall definitely supported

recap of opproblemsa true free market is too unforgiving on the losersonly one bpo for a given end product dont patents suckmining income across the board is effected by martket forces  cos its a free market  op thinks null sec is riskier than highsec for miners when one is open the other reserved for alliance members  different lvls of competition   and concord dont make ship calls if attacked and rats are bigger and scarierwhybecause perceived higher risk by the op has a need by the op for greater reward the low end mineral ores also are the most needed ores so more ppl mine thempeople mining high end mineral ores arent able to squeeze a high enough price  only anknor is sole 00   reprocessing brings too much high end minerals on to market so killing drone swarms provide high income with low risk to a solo playermoon mining costs are the same as the same equipment is used to mine no matter what is collected op thinks thats wrongthat the rarity value of a moon mineral has no inherent added value and those that control high end moon limit production supplies to others to make excess profits as its a free market system that allows them to abuse thier position of having the investment needed to mine those high end moonsproposalsall minerals to be created equalall goods to have several bpos of differing qualities of imput and output attributesmoon mining to be made all materials in one moon to make all materials equalrewriting the mineral make up of drops and roids and linking them to sec status so 10 give only 100 veldspar and 00 just gives 100 anknoor and sores changes to give multiple minerals  but that already exists   on a sliding scale the same to be applied to moons all materials just variable  of themop thinks its a issue as doesnt like a free market with all its abuses and changes in price demand availability ownership and lots of stuff that effects the risk reward ratios and them and how they make iski think i get the gist of it
no your really dont and im not going to bother trying to explain it either
cos you cant
no because it has been explained several times in different ways and yet you still stay true to your name
ah so it was you posting as an alt  kazzac elentria   up there
ohh yes definately brainless this one is
and what about those who cant afford or have huge capital fleets at their disposal but yes reactions sound good but would imbalance surely
no i just dont get it look all bpos are freely available everywhere at npc and pos stations minerals are available everywhere science and industry lines are everywhere so what is the gripe with the lack of alternative means of manufacturing anything in eve why you dont need one there is lots of un used capacity materials about do you see thatprice at the start of anything is never the eventual price that is driven by market forces on raw material and production costs as well as demand and supply of the product the same goes for original ratios eve can never be linked to the stated base price and thier differentials as thats not a player driven gamemarket the risk  reward ratio factors also have to change just because players interact and effect everything in the game by our interaction we deviate from the base that ccp set everything changes thats the way the game was made to be imho everything is player set the lower the sec status the more so thats trueto stay within any set parameters makes this game static  may as well play civ or x   we pay to play a dymanic experience thats effected by what players do no matter how much it pies us off or how wrong we think it is
lack of alternative manufacture options means you cant use less tritanium in exchange for some other mineral to build a shuttle a frigate or even a capital ship no matter what else youre trying to use instead of tritaniumin other words item a always gets manufactured from x units of tritanium y units of pyerite z units of mexallon and so on  assuming pe5 and perfect me blueprint of course  what we propose would be to have an alternative blueprint for item a that would use up less tritanium but more pyerite same count of mexallon and a bit of megacyte for instanceand this is just one example of what i meanprices of minerals which in turn are influenced by the insurance payout of ships and relative ease of availability of each individual mineralminerals are usually needed in reverse ratios corresponding to their base prices so if somehow all minerals would be equally easily available in terms of iskhour spent gathering them then the base price ratios would be maintainedbut since highends are relatively much more abundant valuewise due to mission loot drone alloy drops and higher base iskhour income of 00 mining yet lowends  especially tritanium   no longer have a reliable alternative cheap source the pressure of i want to earn as much as possible drives tritanium prices up a lot more relatively speaking as the highends are driven downas a result due to the way ore value was initially spread lowsec ore becomes nearly worthless and 00 ore decreases strongly in value compared to intended initial value but at the same time veldspar  and other tritaniumrich ores that also contain traces of the minerals least affected by this   become insanely more valuable compared to the intended base value throwing the entire mining revenue out of whackeverything is not player set its only in your imagination where it appears to be so yes you do the leg work allright yes you may profit from various fluctuations every now and then yes for a while you can influence the market and so on and so forthbut the longterm widearea averages are completely set in stone the moment changes to the static data are made and nobody but ccp can change that data the only thing you can do is adapt to the new status quo fasterone can partially predict the equilibrium prices whenever a change is made by ccp but one can totally and easily predict the direction of changes whenever ccp changes one thing the only remotely questionable thing is just how strong the deviation will be not the direction

umm can i substitue rubber for eggs when i make you that omelette sarcasm look i understand your argument but its just loading the database with more crap for limited utility in the game mineral composition of an item as long as minerals are in plentiful supply  even if not acquired   poses no problem it is only a player perception of under or over supply as a side note i think a shuttle made out of zydrine would get poped just because its made out of zydrine for fun do different races ships of the same class get made from the same material requirements atm ive never looked you have do they there is no real need for player made alternative goods we have the meta lvl tech 1 drops from npcs  the bpos of which would be a good way to implement your idea though   there are more than enough mission runners to manufacture them to fill demand with their guns etcyes price is dependent on availability and regulation veldspar being driven up in price  in relative terms   just means not enough people are giving chribba competition  probally out of respect   for veldspar roids miners can mine anything if more profit is in veldspar mine it if your null sec alliance needs high ends then buy it in dont mine it have your miners strip high sec veldspar for profits while they can as the market will change to reflect the fact that your not mining high ends but lots of high sec low ends or go farm drones there are ways to mitigate if you think about it without changing basic minerals and goods mineral compositition if you cant do an action because your risk is to high in that systemconstellationregion you have the power to change it if you want it enoughi see nothing wrong with ores being worthless thats the free market at work if farming drones gives better profits farm drones if veldspar mining prints isk do it less risk more reward is better for profits isnt it that the mechanics are not as you want to preceive does not mean its broken or the sky is going to fall on us risk reward is also market forces at work if you cant profit do something different if you dont think you earn enough do something different if you think the risk is to high for the reward do something that fulfills your critera someone will fill your niche quickly enoughccp code in minerals and moon materials  static data   they require us to mine them and we dont mine more than 20 of them so thats not an argument that holds water drops from drones and npcs are limited by numbers of missions that can be run hours spent ratting etc both of which fluxiates daily according to players desires a random generator to provide the drops again ccp dont set a limit in stone
particularly the alternate composition blueprints for t2 components  not sure about t1 needing this treatment   done right this kind of change could be added as topend industrialist content
no insurance for concord kills  which is really what he proposes   is fine
suicide ganking isnt possible if the people piloting their ships arent dumb i mean seriously warp to zero and align in less than ohhh 10 secondsit takes me 5 seconds to lock  2 seconds lag plus 25 seconds to scan your cargo  your fittings then another 2 to 5 seconds to make a call then my mate takes another 2 seconds to lock you and then scram  blow you away if your hauler doesnt take oh 20 seconds to align and warp you are probably fine however if you are afk autopiloting i mean its your own damn fault if you are autopiloting in a hauler filled with minerals through high sec or in a shuttle filled with capital skills and implants
if your partner isnt scanning in the system before youre doing it wrong that reasoning is pretty artificialsupport some kind of insurance penalty even if is minor such as adding 1 of cost per full minus one sec rating  so maxes out at 43 cost   also advocate the doubling of sec loss per attackkillpodding its absurd you can kill over a dozen people before forced out of highsec
i support this it doesnt make sense that the insurance company should pay you when concord shoots you down since its effectively 100  chance that your ship is doomed when they show up so and insurance is supposed to protect people from accidents etc not when they choose to deliberately loose their ship also destroying your own ship should be considered insurance fraud just like irlthe insurance companies in eve are total suckers since they have no rules at all except that you cant repackage the item
increasing the cost for sec hits kind of hurts that antipirates in the game they get a sec hit when attacking a pirate in losec with a rating higher than the 50 level  ie 49 to 50   and it hits the pirates that do not high sec suicide gank so penalizing folks that have nothing really to do with suicide gankingmaybe if you get popped by concord you receive a special multiplier from the insurance agency that increases the cost of insuring future ships
her allstate insurance how may i help youme hi i was in a wreck that totaled my car but i had full coverage through you guys can you send me a checkher oh thats terrible i hope everyone is ok how did the wreck occurme i saw an armored car pulling away from picking up at walmart so i strapped some explosives to the front and drove at it as fast as i couldonly problem is some cops showed up and took out my car with shotguns so when can i expect the check
id go for somewhere in between  get rid of basic learning skills and give everyone 5 on all their stats  problem is how to compensate people who have trained those skills already   and id keep the advanced learning skills as a choice of progression two months training learning skills is a rediculous barrier to entry imo
cant support this although its a good idea i dont trust ccp to refund the 15m sp i have spread across my accounts in learning
i will support introducing level 3 to 54432645 training skills taking at least ten thousand years to max out so everybody will stop whining
it doesnt take 2 months 2 weeks will bring you up to par typically
youre playing minigolf then my par is advanced learning skills to lvl 4
im going to support this and bring it up on the agenda this sunday its a good idea and is worth putting in front of ccp im going to include serenitys option of the password strength bar in the proposal as well though as an alternative
signed all three proposals i just hope the call center staff of my isp knows what range my ips are inalso consider things like passook and generating passwords for users level 3 should be sufficient to stop dictionary attacksyour password is easily guessable please use a different like for example themsly9 click here to generate another one
guys if you want to get rid of jade give ccp some information that results in a ban otherwise stfu if hes really such a jerk he gets more attention than he deserves
god i hope you didnt read that thread lil goonie im afraid that struggling as you are in this epic battle for justice you actually did
ebrothels yeah id imagine so i even remember an article a few years back where they started tracking down the person who ran the biggest ebrothel in some other mmo  i think it was the sims online or some other one in that vein   and found out she was 12 years old irl i dont know what came of it but id wager on a lot of free publicity and some very disturbing people getting subscriptions
no you are
but what am i
an achura
damn youre good at this game
i fully support of course get those weirdos out of our game 
voting in support of rp space brothels
classic jade when it finds itself caught in a lie it dodges the issue with much haste and conviction and prays that noone notices the best part of it all is that the dapper sycophants who lap up all of its dissembling and nonsense end up outing themselves so that the rest of us can point and laugh bravo
oh my god this is horrifyinghorrifyingly hilarious
this is awesome youre awesome
all my fives
and if my cat had a million isk every time someone called him a cat he would be rich too
well  its good for a laugh anyway while im not into this kind of online rp  i dont have any doubt that ccp will not allow the game to go that direction american talk radio comes to eveonline  yes im american no i dont pay any attention to that drivel   this is completely unimportant to his duties as the chair or a csmak
i dont like jade that much after his conduct but come on
also supporting
agreed
soooim not quite clear on what you object to here are you worried because you think jade might be homosexual are you concerned that he might have engaged in cybersex do you think its wrong of him to have a female avatar please explainin addition i dont understand what direction you think jade might take this game due to his alleged involvement in the chat room you mentioned i mean assuming he can override the csm and ccp together are you worried hell turn us all into homosexuals i have it on good authority that sexual preferences are not a disease you can catch from the toilet seatespecially a virtual toilet seatim sure your post isnt just part of a smear campaign from goonswarm everyone knows that would be a conspiracy theory reminiscent of the x files televisions series everyone knows goonswarm is above such things rightwindjammer
what does rp brothels have to do with aptitude in politics
in a lot of the things the goons do i can at least laugh to some degree and say either well played or this is funny sadly this thread isnt one of those thingsif you want to attack the person at least do it about something wed actually care about like say the behaviour seen in the csm chatlogs
its pretty rare that only one side lags with the exception of attackers when warping to a grid loaded with defending ships the same applies to defenders warping to a grid loaded with attacking ships howeverthis is a terrible solution honestly it favors the defenders and penalizes the attackers this means that any defender to make a system completely invulnerable to attack just needs to put as many of their people  read alts   in the system and then go afk it would take so long for a sizable attack force to jump in it would be impossible to organize changing this by alliance will mean that people will get around it by forming alt allianceslag in its current form penalizes all sides relatively equally and there isnt much one side can do to take advantage of lag  and if there is you can be sure that ccp is going to remove that ability   any solution to lag must not penalize the attackers or the defenderswho claimed that
bumped and signed they will also hand out much more costumer satisfaction or at the very least not create as much costumer frustrationadditionally we should ask them to hire more developers dedicated to bug hunting and fixing ie maintainance bit rot and bug probability increase exponentially over time if not cared about so it should also be in ccps interest to address things before utter hell arrives having known bugs hang around for years doesnt reflect well on software and their developers
not supported
another terrible idea
i think the investment both in time and isk that alliances can put into 00 systems should be more in depth but this doesnt accomplish thatif you leave hangars accessible all youre doing is basically adding another service to be blown up with a huge graphical overhead
you dont understand 00 and this idea shows it a defending alliance could never destroy its own outpost as a scorched earth strategy because if youre destroying the outpost because youre losing the system the second you drop your sov claim youre losing the system and the outpost to the attackers who will of course stop the countdown the new owners of the station sure as hell arent going to selfdestruct it why when all the defenders goods that werent evacuated are now stuck in their station destroying the station would deny them a staging ground and make it possible for their enemy to get their assets outif im wrong go ahead and tell me in which situations where an alliance holding an outpost could and would destroy it
it would be interesting
at first glance this might seem like a good idea but if you think about it for more than a minute its a horrible idea
i think its a terrible idea in almost any possible way it could be implemented the impact of destroying an outpost is so significant that you would need to implement massive defensive advantages right now the sov system in 00 is such that big alliances like bob goons etc can blob the crap out of any hostiles while doing the same on the offensive since i dont think jade has anywhere near the ability to balance such a process i dont support this at all
actually lets take this concept to its logical extreme and allow the destruction of stations everywhere i mean if its a good idea for 00 it must be a good idea for empire as well right
wait this is the remove jade from the chair issue thread rightok just checking
agreed entirely tharrn
yet its got more than twice the support of your big thread about destructible stations
csm has just begun the first board must be the strongest as it is their task to make mistakes discover these mistakes and then put in tools to correct these mistakesthe only thing i would request is to please not get bogged down in creating extra processes i already see the red tape piling up fast
theres nothing to bog down anymore when all jade has to do is schedule meetings outside of us availability and bring in alternates for everythingedit and he didnt even do that a quorum of 7 is not a quorum of 9 as the csm document states is neededinappropriate commentapplebabe
nope they didnt vote for me so i dont have to listen la la laso you admit to scheduling a meeting at a time when you knew three council members could not make it as an attempt at making yourself look better why you think its important to neglect the ideas of the largest alliance in the game is beyond me
this gets better and better or worse really
its hardly anyone fault but of the affected csm representatives if they live in some exotic timezone that doesnt allow them to fulfill their duty as members of the csm they should have been aware of this problem when they decided to run for csmwhy should the vast majority make concessions for two people who choose to live somewhere in the wilds far off from the cradle of civilization thinking about it since when are the inhabitants of the colonies allowed to vote on anything anyway their presumptuousness is really disgusting and they should be put back into their place tbqph
im not going to pretend i read this thread and im not going to support or oppose this thread at this time since i havent read this thread what i do know is that on a quick skim through this proposal recieved 96  ish give or take a few it being late   whilst other threads you have approved for discussion have recieved fewer than 20 and have been much less trolled by you jade  helpful csm icon lets me see when csm members post   and most notably
i supportbeing a chairman or leader of any sorts will get you a lot of negative attention and critism  people thinking they can do better and stuff  but this chairman is supporting proposions that barely have any votesthe chair should look at the amount of votes in a thread before giving or declining support to that propositiona chairman representing people should never ever support something that no or almost nobody supports or agrees on and should also never follow their own agenda if this person does do this they should be taken away from their functiondo i think i can do better yes
jade will respond that this is what he has been doing god leave him alone stop trolling you trollunfortunately this thread is about removing jade constantine from the council not asking for ccp to give the council permission to vote to remove him from the council without the repercussions of getting removed from the council altogether as it states in the csm documentunfortunately since its not possible to get anywhere near 5 of the eve population to post on these threads that wont happen instead the csm members get to present their own pet projects to ccp democracy in action
negative basically its part of our job to ignore nonsense posts 200 supports on a nonsense issue are worth less than 1 support on a good issue sorry to disappoint you but threadnaughts simply mean nothing when you bring a little bit of good analysis to the table thats why no post like this will be advocated in good faith by a csm delegate a   it brings nothing to the game and b   it would be embarrassing the csm delegate to bring such a motion and have it voted down on the public record wasting time better alloted for decent issues
i think if i were a megalomaniac who had gone off the reservation i would call any motion to bring me back to reality nonsense too that doesnt make it trueit wouldnt be any more embarrassing then your posts here in fact the only way to recover the good faith of the playerbase is to support this particular issue
same here that thread was creepy
this thread seems to be brought in a well ordered manner for example unlike the monster truck thread each comment seemed to have criticism attatched promoting the debate just because something is aimed at you doesnt make it nonesense and if it was nonesense then you would have surely posted once at the start saying this is nonesense and not worthy of csm time and ignored the thread from then on replying continuously to thread you deem as nonsense and thus dismiss from the agenda whilst debating with people seems kinda contradictory in terms if it was nonsense it wouldnt be worthy of your time on the other hand if it is a concern about the csm chairman which is worth the time of a csm rep in the frequence you respond then should it not be brought before the council as a popular concernme shrugs just seems odd to ignore a thread directed at you with large contructive critism and debate rather than to admit it is a valid concern then to just say ill bring it up at the meeting and see what the general consensus of the council is if your right and i have no support ill step down and well elect a new chairman if not then you can all stfu by ignoring concerns with popular support and promoting threads with no support that you like then you just add fuel to the fire and give ammo to the people posting on this thread and people of a similar mentality its your choice really but your just making things worse by yourself by responding
weve learned that lesson really administrative guff is going to the end of the agenda well be concentrating primarily on good issues and doing our best to ignore the silly stuff from this point forward
and you are the one that decides what constitutes a good issue of course how convenient could you quote the appropriate logs where this vote was heldthis is why you must be stopped
how many players need to support this until ccp decides to step in this is getting ridiculous
im pretty sure bane and glorius have advocated a vote of no confidence the rest of the council might but theyve been so antagonized by you that theyve probably capitulated it would be nice if you guys would just work with each other like during the second meeting
i hear you sister youre absolutely right its a shame how long ccp tolerated this abomination that flies under the goonswarm ticker time for ccp to step in and swing the banhammer
by the current rules you need 5 of the player base thats around 11000 supports 10900 to go  it should be possible though maitsu you have 5000 people in goonswarm and each of these can support 3 times by abusing their alts   so you could actually manage 15000 if you market the issue effectively internally get going is my advice either that or convince a rep to bring it up on the agenda  of course once it gets on the agenda you still need to win 59 csm votes to get it raised to the csmccp conference and ccp need to approve it    at some point youll actually need some arguments rather than smack and nonsense and comparing the csm chair making a moderation decision to a genocidal dictator nuking half the world is probably not going to do it for you
why does the csm even need an authority figure other than to decide when the meetings will be held its 9 guysgirls discussing a video game not congress the un or something like that
it wasnt supposed to be like this jade just decided to grant itself power
good thing we dont need to worry about all that since goonswarm has two reps in it maybe if they were actually in thursdays meeting you all wouldnt have wasted ten minutes on word processors wheres the moderation cant you show a little neutrality or did you have to mute yourself so you didnt appear like an ass
i fully support the impeachment of jade constantine
all i need to do is put the thumbs up here correct this is my first time participating in such a wonderful democratic process i like the idea that we can get rid of a csm for failing at their job particularly one who sees fit to prevent open discourse by muting other csm
signed
i fully support stfu and get back to work
two more and well hit 100 o
then better hurry up and make some more alts
i only have 97 alts
showing support for this topic jade is an embarrassment
number 100 0seriously though jade needs to get a clueoh and page 12 snypa
o ya
i can get behind this
this is democracy not a jadeocracy
i like peaches
ill accept you throwing away obvious parody threads  if monster trucks got 10999 votes it still shouldnt see the light of day but this isnt an obvious parody its a serious request and its being taken seriously by most of the voters but then maybe my gordon brown analogy in the other thread was apt after all the treaty of lisbon doesnt need a vote after all  weve seen what can happen when voters get a chance to say no to their betters
yes in on this
you know if it wasnt for you voting in this very meeting for the possibility of the council electing someone else instead of you i would consider seconding this motion they dont seem to hate you enough to actually do it thoughthat log makes for some good lulz
if anything this thread proves we need voting against a proposition im sure jade has quite a few supporters who are frustrated they cant outvote the goons herefly well and have fungrismar
didnt see serenity either so guess that was a quorum of 6but that meeting went way smootherso next step would be a smooth meeting with all 9 membersand to the goons tone down and wait how things pan out for a few meetings since csm actually might have taken the clue not to slip up again
supported this is not the effective way to run a meeting
chairperson is not an emperor
can this selfimportant drama queen
remove jade
oh so you didnt read the notes and decided to come post here thats fine i went ahead and read the log for you see if you had read it youd see that it called up an alternate for serenity being absent but it convienantly neglected to call on alternates for bane or dariusso a 9 member quorum with 3 members absent and one alternate called in means we have a quorum of7
goon teaching me mathoh noes the sky is fallingi did read before my 1st cup of java that ismy bad please except my most humble apologiesand youre right the 2 representatives missing part could use some moar explanationbtw i still think goons should tone down a bit even though they dont like jade its the voters who make it he deserves a decent chance of making this work  and i sure am not one of them btw  
yeah except that the csm document specifies that 7 is the quorum they prefer 9 but 7 is sufficient
fortunately we had a ruling from ccp yay and since the meeting was publicized and everyone was invited both from the public forum thread and the ingame channel and we managed to get a combination of 6 reps and 1 alternate we had a valid meeting
so the meeting of 7 euros was approved by ccp standards but what about the 2 us ones will there be meetings of 7 all the timeim just asking since this might goons worked up a bit which i think isnt all too strangealso could be some private stuff we dont have to know anywayz
on the whole ill try to pick meeting times that the majority of csm reps can commit to attending without too many problems weekends are probably the best for this but its worth everyone calming down a bit and realizing that there are going to be alot of meetings in this session and its not disastrous if people miss couple here and there everyone goes on holiday and sometimes things come up im certainly going to miss some and serenity will be filling in as vice chair its very good that we can count meetings with 7 reps valid otherwise we would have some real problems in the long termtheres nothing private about this  we had a deadline and needed to vote on some multi item issues otherwise they coudnt get on the iceland conference agenda
hear hear
hearing
see meeting 2 this has already been accomplished the ongoing drama were a direct result of actions taken not of an inability for people to get along
which obviously was both too important to have all members present for and not important enough for you to extend any timezone courtesies to the us representatives who clearly would have been at work at the time
i beg to differ anyway i agree jade was involved in several welp moments but the way some others reacted wasnt top notch either guess what people frack up sometimesfor the sake of it lets assume jade learned something useful and i do hope the next meeting will include all membersyou dont have to like or even trust each other as long if you work through the agenda and do your work its okjust remember that there are many people watching over your shoulders
i dont disagree with that people are people and screw up sometimes meeting 2 was well organized and expedient and 3 was a fiasco from what ive read last nights meeting went back to the organized kind and ill be happy to be a part of any meeting of the sort where people are able to speak their minds on the issues at hand and participate
obligatory jadehate comment this post now has twice the support of jades destructible outposts idea and his alliancemates 00 sovereignty redesign combinedreal thoughts lets wait for the next meeting flipout before passing judgment as much as i may dislike jade everyone deserves at least one fup now jade knows what the voters expect him to act like so if he screws up again its not for lack of knowing what we expect then we can vote to get rid of him
intolerable
wow i didnt expect this when i voted for jade he doesnt desrve a second chance which he clearly forfeited with the replies in this thread he is a child that tries to ignore anything he doesnt like
if you would bother to read the thread you would seea   its not just goons that want to oust jadeb   there are far more people posting in support than there are posting against it anyway
hearing jade say the chairman should step down and hold a vote among the council and then watching him retain the position after this was just too shifty in my opinionat the same time we need to have the csm actually tackling issues its obvious there is contention between jade and members of the council therefore it would be due diligence to step down and hold a vote so that the valuable work the csm can accomplish can be just that accomplished if jade is reelected then 100 go with it if not then hopefully the next chairman can hold the thing together
it has become clear that jade constantine has no intention to use his position as chair to do anything other than further his selfdelusions of grandeuri think the csm is an important step in bringing player feedback to ccp and i dont want to see it ruined support
no brainer here since jade simply made up all these powers the chair has in order to steal control of the council
i wont say jade should be removed but i will admit that i am a little nervous about his being lead csm after reading some valid posts regarding his past
yup jade needs to go home
yeah jade needs to go
i have to agree with everyone else on this matter even the talk in my npc corp chat is one of shock and anger this little napoleon needs to have nothing to do with eve
i agree
agreed
supporting dis
jade is doing a good job and so is the rest of the csm judging by that last meeting some confusion friction etc was bound to happen in the startand if jade gets removed by this thread wouldnt that kinda invalidate the election not too familiar with the finer workings of politics but voting time is where the peons get to voice their opinionfrom the op1 calls upon the csm to undertake an immediate vote for the removal of jade constantine from chaircan the csm do that
to the rionnag alba guys above if you know anything about cva then you would know that it is not a lack of blue slots which is the problem  but the lack of red ones our policy is that everyone in providence is neutral  unless they have been set red for piracy or terroristic actions we therefore do not need blue slotsthe cva is probably the most napless alliance in 00 apart from our holders sylph and iac we are pretty much red to the entire universe including bob a tcf goons red alliance and the majority of the northern alliancesthis issue is not about napfests it is about giving alliance adminstrators proper ability and options to manage their diplomatic relations the current system was appropriate when it was first implemented but since then the number of coorporations and alliances that need to be tracked has mushroomed exponentially and it is time standing slots reflected thisdo you really think that nrds as a system should be ruled out as a genuine playstyle and option for space holding alliances simply because they dont have the standings slots to properly managed their redsthis change is a small tweak which requires little to no programming effort on the part of ccp and provides alliance adminstrators around the galaxy with a lot more flexibility in managing how they interact with other corporations and alliancesthe current standing slot limit appears to be arbitrary and if ccp are reluctant to make what appears to be a commonsense change then i would certainly like to know their reasoning why its possible that they have a very good reason which they just havent told us yet
thisalsomaybe make it so that you can have more red slots make redblue slots separate
 hardingive alliances 5 blue slots to other alliance 5 to separate corps and infinite reds or so thennumbers arbitrary but should be low for blues
seems like a reasonable suggestion to me  but as i not someone responsible for managing standings slots  would be interested in getting some further input into this as i am not sure what consequences your proposal could havei have put this on the agenda for sunday meeting and need to create an issue template by then  so happy if people want to feed more views into this
i am trying to keep this issue as simple as possible my own belief is against hundreds of blues but that is my game play if some group wants hundreds of blues that is their business we should not hard code against legitimate play styles  even if we personally disagree   you cannot force people to fight with each otherthis proposal advocates an increase in the hard limits placed on corporations a larger standings pool means more possibilities possibilities are good
you clearly missed the point your saying that you used drake because its missile yet use myr vs astarte which is drone vs turret comparison the fact that the myr has more pg that its tier 1 turret ship just emphasises how good tier 2 bcs are your taking 1 stat to compare the ships and ignoring the rest like slots differences and drake has lower cpu to the nhbut hay compare one set of numbers to whatever rules you like to draw a conclusion well im not suprised with the numerous fitting mod setups being posted here also depends a lot on if you expect the nh to fit tackle and how many damage mods you expect abso to fit personally 2 on each which gives1 a single mar on a abso should do 250 ehps with resistance gang link thats using cap meaning have to have a cap booster2 a passive tanked nh should do 325 ehps at peak with resistance gang link thats before overloading invulns so while not constant its a good chunk of your hp band at lest 20 to 50 for no costbut like i said im not against it just prefer proper discussion instead of im posting this single stat comparison so must agree or this ships setup should be equal to that ship a lot of ships need tweaking usually the question is how and how much i mean the astarte has to drop a bonused weapon to fit a gang link would giving the nh another missile point that uses less fitting than gang link be a good plus personally id only give the nh a small increase nothing like the drakes pg or the 164pg in one of the early postsomg he pawned me  sure by missing the point about looking at one stat to draw conclusions isnt great nevermind against other ships in another class thats are only vaguely similarim talking about one of the early posts where it was1   must have active tank2   must have biggest weaponsbecause that clearly hurts the nh most with its lower pg making pdsrcus percentage increase have less effectthe best setup for a nh is passive tank in my eyes be it comparing against hp dual rep or mix hprep tank hence that style of x can fit these so y should comparison is uselesstheres so many things to compare past ehp ehps speed and dps for instance the damage lost through range and trackingsigspeed varies id say nh loses the least damage compared to other cs so while having the least raw dps the gap is closed in many situations where trackingrange hurts the droneturret cs a lot more
1 the comparison between myrm and astarte is irrelevant drake vs nighthawk  and onyx vs nighthawk   are the comparisons most illuminating frankly im not sure what your point is here2 i assume no tackle on the nighthawk  it just doesnt have the midslots mwd is mandatory of course the quoted numbers i gave for abso were for a spread of 02 damage mods 1 damage mod allows dc ii 2x eanm ii thermic ii 2x mar ii giving a single mar tank of 270 dpsnighthawk like all shield tankers should always fit 3 damage mods when possible  the reduced flexibility of shield tanking is balanced by increased ease of fitting damage mods your tank figure of 325 dps for the nh is flat wrong i have no idea how you got it it is 200 dps with the standard buffer tank disregarding gang mod oh wait a second are you using a pve fit take off the sprs please passiveregen tanking is too slot and capintensive to be of any real use in pvp the rest of your post is vague and meandering the proper discussion has been done to death in this thread and in the one linked in the op i have spent a long time explaining the fitting mods required on comparable fits  hence the highestpg shortrange weapon fits etc   of the field cs and showing that the nh needs so many more than the other field cs i invite you to either explain why you think the nighthawk is currently balanced with the other field cs or to suggest a suitable pg boost figure yourself a quick look here for example might be helpfulalso this pg comparison is relevant please explain why you think these figures are correct or suggest changes yourselfdrake 7 launchers 850 pgonyx 5 launchers 835 pgnighthawk 6 launchers and gang mod 710 pginterestingly the 140 pg suggested after the extensive modelling is exactly the same as the difference between the pgs of the current nh and the drakenote  i appreciate that the t1 battlecruisers have a role bonus for gang mods also however fitting a gang mod on any of them is tricky and the drake is therefore balanced in this respect however the field cs fit gang mods without too much trouble  well all but the nighthawk which is therefore not balanced and deserves a pg boostother note regarding the linked modelled fits all of them use an active tank despite buffer tanking being generally superior in pvp because fitting an active tank is a perfectly viable option for the other field cs hence it should be similarly viable for the nighthawk buffer tanking whether shield buffer or armour is less pgintensive hence we must examine the ease of fitting f active tanks to properly gauge this aspect of balance
1 my point is just because x ship has more of y than z ship doesnt mean it should apply to all ship vs ship comparisons if every other stat is identical then sure but they arnt like that2 im happy with 2 damage mods as long as its a dc and then pds taking the lows and not rcucpu my abso setup is mar 1600 dc t2 2x eanm t2 therm res rig and hp rig  clone has 3 cpu implant for the full setup   the  250 number comes from that plus resistance rig with mindlink although rep rig would improve the ehpsdepends what your standard buffer tank is and depending if your using pdsdc in spare lows and not cpurcu mods also depends on rigs pvp setup named lse 2x inv photon 2 hp rigs with resistance gang link and 3 pds gives  325 ehps i would prefer dc instead of one of the pds and a t2 lse thats about it that needs improving the pds add both hp and recharge so while i consider it a hp tank the passive recharge is a added bonus that practically equals a single mar while not only no cap use but the pds have increased the amount and rechargefirstly the nh gets no extra bonus to gang links over a drake so really should be compared with both without or both with a gang link drake with gang link has both cpu and pg problems without gang link the heavy missile drake typically  for me   runs into cpu problems before pg  with mwd no tackle fit   it also has a extra mid slot that will really have to be a lse since more than 3 hardeners gets a bit dodgy basically for me drake is limited by cpu nh by pg hence the reasoning that the pg should be the same or there abouts doesnt stand upof course 2 of the other cs are limited to active tanking or the benifit of passive tanking must outweigh the ignoring of there bonusas far as suggestions id prefer to have a 7th launcher slot and off the top of my head around 50 more pg adds more variation and allows the fitting of something like2x pds t2 dc t2 2x bcs t2mwd t2 lse 2x inv t2 photon t26x hm t2 gang linkfitting a 7th launcher instead of gang link saves fitting so can then add a 3rd bcs with the 7th launcher for a better damage fit  but less tank cos no gang linkso rather than more variation of sleipnir can fit xl booster tank so nh should as a variation id prefer a small easing of the fitting and more choice with the high slotsps meant discussion of ideas rather than it needs x amount of pg discussion i understand the pg discussion is more to get a value but its the end setupsperformance id value more than comparisons to other ships
once again gypsio ironed out all your misunderstandings so im not going to bother readdressing themi will offer you one challenge though  which i am more than happy to see anyone answer   to see why you are so afraid to have the nighthawk given a little love   take our theoretical nighthawk with 850 base grid and put some horrifyingly unfair setup on it that would clearly demonstrate why giving the nighthawk 140 more grid would make it so much better than the other field commands ive asked anyone to provide this bit of info in this thread and the other and not a single person has yet to answer  
uhhh your above setup requires  106175 of 97847 powergrid even with your adding a fictional 50 powergrid the nighthawk still falls short on grid so what on earth would be the point of adding a 7th launcher slotseriously though these setups and arguments are actually fanatastic illustrations of how completely gimped the nighthawks powergrid is when compared to other field commands people come in here and without really thinking about it post some offthetop off their head setup that seems to be perfectly reasonable for the nighthawk to fit and lo and behold it doesnt even fitlook at the above setup the nighthawk cant even freaking fit its lowest grid  lowest dps   weapons a single lse buffer and a command module while using two t2 pdus and being given a fictional 50 powergridhello golly gee does the nighthawk have a powergrid issue i wonder

convient way to ignore my challenge this thread isnt about a tempest in case you havent noticed genius my challenge stands take a theoretical nighthawk with a base grid of 850 and post some setups showing its unbalanced what kind of fool are you while the sleip does indeed have to active tank to make use of its bonus it can passive tank very very well hell the nighthawk throws away its missile precision bonus all the time since it is utterly useless also a passive tank on a sleip is in some ways more advantageous than on a nighthawk as the sleip is far faster and more agile meaning it can reduce the damage it takes and keep rangea if fitting only an active large shield booster is a lmao rubbish fit then you have just admitted that any active setup for the nighthawk is rubbish as that is the largest active tank it can fit the sleip has the luxury of being able to squeeze on a named xl shield booster do me a favor a show me a setup where the nighthawk can squeeze on an xl shield boosterb the sleip has loads of cpu thanks to low cpu weapons einstein look at this setup gyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iidamage control iiempty low slotballistic deflection field iiinvulnerability field iilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender ii10mn microwarpdrive ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon ii425mm autocannon iiwarfare linkempty rig slotempty rig slotthis setup takes only 53125 of 59375 cpu and 15887 of 1825 grid it also leaves one low slot free for whatever you want to fit seriously some of these comments and arguments you make are textbook delusionalapparently i struck a nerve as you keep bringing this up your salty tears are deliciousthe only difference between gypsio and myself in our postings is that he is patient and tolerant of the profoundly stupid where i have no compunction in helping you look like the fool that you are which your stream of delusional and misinformed posts perfectly illustrates

thats only half the truth add in three weapon upgrades for each ship nighthawk t2 heavy missile launcher x6t2 bcus x3 requires 3675 cpu  570 pg remaining cpu  32625 remaining pg  3175sleipnir t2 425s x7t2 gyros x 3 requires 22125 cpu  9732 pg remaining cpu  3725 remaining pg  8518both of these ships shield tank both fit command modules  or use a last high slot   however look at how totally and completely gimped the nighthawk is when compared to the sleipnir despite it using the rest of its slots almost identically the sleip has a bit more cpu than the nighthawk and more than double the gridhello mila says the sleips cpu is horribly gimped what anyone with a brain look at the comparison above and tell me what the very obvious problem might be
i was just using the arguement used for the nh of comparing a fit  active   against another ship then complaining about the fitting constraint i hit firstxl booster is the hardest thing to fit unless you ignore the bonus so the performance of the noneactive slipnir is limited by no tanking bonus and performance of active nh setup is limited by fitting and not the bonusso while the nh weapons use more cpu the main cpu use is in the mid slotsedit stupid pc hit post by accidentof course i could start using stupid comparisons with artillery setups that can hit at the range heavy missiles can but thats not why i posted that paragraph was just to demonstrate how the difference in setup constraints changes from ship to ship hence i prefer the actual performance discussion rather than comparison of what others can fitim not against the suggestion just prefer to look at other methods of improving it as i suggested rather than just throw x pg at it so it can fit whatever
umm no you werent your statement was the sleipnirs cpu is horribly gimped youre wrong more backpeddling from youthats true the nighthawk has a very slight advantage while passive tanking since it has a bonus to passive and active tanking however the sleipnir passive tanks nearly as well as the nighthawk despite its ignored bonus all the while it is doing far more dps has a much higher top speed and has more flexibility with its slot layout since it doesnt have to fill its lows with powergrid mods in active tanking mode the sleipnir embarrasses the nighthawk in every wayso either way the sleipnir comes out ahead despite your ignorant comment that its cpu is horribly gimpedtrue and the mids used for shield tanking require lots of grid also the sleipnir has both more cpu and far more grid available than the nighthawk which i showed above thanks to eleneth posting his partialtruth comparisonnighthawk t2 heavy missile launcher x6t2 bcus x3 requires 3675 cpu  570 pg remaining cpu  32625 remaining pg  3175sleipnir t2 425s x7t2 gyros x 3 requires 22125 cpu  9732 pg remaining cpu  3725 remaining pg  8518gee i wonder what the problem might be
also ill specifically address this comment as apparently you cant read very well im going to paste a quote from the first page the fourth post which is part of the op it stands in total opposition to your moronic quote above and proves that your statement is along with most everything else you post delusional and misinformedwe are not asking to throw x pg at it so it can fit whatever you idiot were asking to be able to fit a very basic setup using the lowest pgdps weapons without fitting mods of course if you could read the thread you would have known that rather obvious fact
signed please fix the nighthawk ccp
so your answer is nerf scanners my answer is no
i wouldnt mind mission gates being requiring hacking to open if you arent the first in line after the rats die completely safe i dont agree with thoughhonestly i just get a buddy he gets salvage and i get loot its a good deal for both of us because i melt stuff
i dont see what the big deal is i run missions in aramachi all the time and only been scanned and ninjasalvaged once and he ran off after i started blowing wrecks up i lost a couple million but the prober lost time aswell
salvage it directly or have a friend or something help with salvage i dont see this being a big problem and ninjas have to spend time probing and searching maybe gang up with the salvager and let him have salvage rights for a small fee and everyone should be happy he doesnt have to stand around waiting to find a place and you dont have to go and get your salvage ship
needs more attention if you disagree say why please
supported fuel mails could be put on a character sheet tab like killmails much much more can be done to allow players to customize the mails they get this is a step in the right direction
i only get starbase mails and it is horrible  supportin dis
even something as simple as another mail tab for automated mails for directorsceos would go a long way towards making evemail usable i know i get 200 a day its not something you can deal with only ignore
agreed completely this has been a long time in coming
as much as i love logging in to thousands of evemails in my inbox i support this issue
its sad it takes a csm to bring this to light
i remember the time when a bug caused all members to get the usual directoronly mail one gem that i got during that time was the character richard astley applying to goonfleet with the following textas such to prevent any future rickrolling thanks to undocumented evemail changes i heartily endore this service andor product
i support the said product

so how long before goons get accused of breaking the game the way they play with this issue
yes my liege
i have two characters that have unusable mailboxes because of this they filled up to the point where they will not open 4 petitions later and they still do not work
100 agree as being in similiar altcorp situations i know the pain
band wagoning this
lets get this party rolling
it would make my life simpler ccp please heed the op
absolutely
your still around
nothing less than the most important issue in eve today
i cant believe ccp designed it this way in the first placeoh wai
completely agree if anyone remembers a couple of patches back where everyone received these it literally drove me insane
separating this out to another window is a good idea when you have so much evemail you cant even open it you know something is wrong
remember 3 votes per account
i think it is a great idea symbolic of the great leadership provided by darius johnson
if anyone remembers that evemail screw up as soon as revelations was deployed everyones evemail became unusable as it became flooded with tower messages corp messages and so on so forth basically everyone suddenly got directorlevel evemail access the current status of director evemail being completely broken should be admitted by everyone in eve in a big alliance not just goonswarmconsequently it needs to be fixed so directors can actually find their evemails and send said evemails
make sure you click the check box also

i get an evemail when poss go up i have no idea why i have nothing to do with it i get a lot of them they are annoying i cannot imagine the sort of automatic spam mail a ceo gets the evemails need to be redirected i presume ccp being a company have something similar for the various divisions within themselves a la mailing lists it seems like a relatively easy fix for a lot of happier peoplei fully endorse this product or service

as a corporation director i have been unable to use my evemail for over a year and a half thankfully now there is a light at the end of the tunnel vote yes vote hope

this has been a long time coming

oh vc bee you card
i suffer from this a couple of dozen evemails every time some idiot didnt fuel his pos is wearing to start with
of course
as anyone who has ever had director roles can attest once you have those roles you dont ever read your evemail againi just trash it all once in a while its completely pointless even trying to sort it out i hope i didnt miss out on anything interesting  such as t2 bpo offers

i agree
i agree and so do all my alts
 and so does my alt edit rofl it really works you can vote with another char from the same account even when you have already voted with your main in the same thread thats a quite sloppy implementation of the vote feature tbh
sorry as an alt i cant agree with this i want my moments in the spotlight
voting will be a difficult issue to resolve on the one hand you could attempt to do one accountone vote it favors those who can afford more then one accounton the other hand you could do one ip address one vote it forces those that use the same computer to have only one vote between themi am unable to offer a solution at this time but i am also unable to support a voting system that clearly favors those that are more fortunate it simply isnt democratic
is blown away by the sheer volume of goons agreeing in this thread
there are several problems with doing one vote per ip1 not every case of multiple accounts per pc is due to one person having multiple accounts sometimes its due to multiple family members having accounts2 i could have logged in yesterday from home voted logged in today from work voted again logged in from an internet cafe later in the week voted yet again each time from a different ip address simply put accounts will not necessarily be functioning from the same ip address all the time especially when you consider that these votes are going on a web based forumbelieve me i do sympathise with the concept that it should be one vote per user however with the sheer number of alt accounts out there and no way of tracking whether a given account is an alt account at the moment does make it extremely difficult if not impossible to properly regulate that one vote per account however is workable and would make a decent compromise yes it does mean that those with multiple accounts have a louder voice however we may be looking at this slightly wrong the csm at the moment is being described as a purely democratic body this isnt the caseits actually more like a board of directors in a company each account is effectively a share so those with more accounts have more shares and so have a greater say in what direction a company  in this case the csm   goes ineditoh and just to make it clear what position im coming from im a single account holder with no alts at all so this proposal wouldnt help me much but would be of great help to others
yes
this and the change all ammo type one
right now a new or modified mission starts at the lowest isklp  1500 lp for a l4 kill mission   reward level possible then increases in reward whenif people succesfully finish it this leads to a lot of people not doing the mission since it looks like its not worth it leading to a very long time until the mission reaches its intended valuenew missions do not have guides detailing the npc strengthcomposition therefore a new mission is more risky thus should be more rewarding than an old missionif instead a mission would start at the highest possible isklp reward  5000 lp for l4 kill mission   more people will want to do the mission this will lead to the mission being scaled down quickly rewardwise down to its final value
sounds good to me would probably have resulted in a few less people hating on l5 missions when they first came out
signedits a shame we have to ask ccp to do this
no i disagreeto be frankly honnest missions give out too greater reward a battlecruiser running lvl4 missions is a joke the isk made in lvl4 missions is a joke and pve has just become a joke and a easy way too make isk personaly missions need reworking no way should a battlecruiser be able too run lvl4s even a battleship should struggle too complete these missions the rewards should be lower in empire space not 20 mill from bountys and 5000 lp in my eyes ccp are giving everyone isk on a sliver plate with the way pve is now and it is wrong yes im gonna get flamed for this postand tbfh i dont realy care what you all think pve is a way too gain easy isk and lots of it quick missions have become a rinse and repeat affair and even 15sp newbies are doing lvl4s this goes too show pve needs reworking totaly and not just giving in too forum whines about rewards being rubbish 
this isnt really the place to discuss different issues and doesnt actually address the point made by the opi support this though it works better because by starting the rewards at the bottom of the scale translates into longer amounts of time before they balance themselves out because fewer people do them
heck even starting it at the middlepoint would be better assessing the difficulty beforehand by a pannel of mission designers and setting a starting base value now that would be bestbarring that highest point means least effort on ccps side and fastest way to reach the correct balaceanywhere except the lowest point is goodsupported
sounds like a good idea
the count of supporting votes for a forum thread works fairly well as a gauge of support for that thread but only as long as no one does any actual discussing i think this is a problem for a forum where ideas are being shared and discourages good discourse a very simple way to change this would be to add a number equal to the number of unique posters in the thread this could be implemented with a single sql query and would much more accurately tell the amount of support an idea receivesyou could display this one of two ways1 the support column shows x out of y where x is the current number of supports and y is the number of people who posted in the thread2 a percentage of yx where x is the number of supports and y is the number of people who posted in the thread the post or support of the op would not be included in this percentage
yes
this topic has my support
yep i would support this going to take some forum programming though  but we can fairly easily add this into the already tabled discussion on forum issues in iceland i think
the idea to separate voting from posting does the same thing better have each thread have a poll at the top for voting if the forum software wasnt  this could be implemented easily   and you could see support at a glance either use standardized options like 15 stars or full supportpartial supportopposeits complicated or let players set up their own i agree that it needs to be displayed in the forum proper and your suggestions are good ideas of how to do so but the fundamental problem is still that debate looks like opposition and the best solution is still to break voting off of posting
also i can support my own topic kind of pointless since id say that if you post an idea you support it by default
please allow us to be able to remotely repair an item or at least contract it while its damaged and give the person who is accepting the contract the details of the damagethere is simply no reason why a slightly damaged item cannot be contracted it gets worse if you are amarr if there is a t2 or faction crystal that has been loaded into the gun you cannot contract the item eitherty hugs and kissesshigsy

agreed on so many levels this is the biggest annoying single thing in eve logistics trying to contract stuff to someone whos supposed to use it  move it  sell it for you and you cant do this dmg stuff inside just allow contracting dmg items in private contracts and everything would be so much better add up a line warning  includes damaged items to the contract page if it really bothers but it shouldnt really be that much of a problem

yup you should be able to contract anything provide full information of course and prevent damaged items from being used to fill buy contracts but aside from that have at it

idea is win
just make sure the contract indicates  of damage in its details and this is fine
proposed changes remove ability to dd through pos shields regardless of password thought the ability to dd through pos shields basically only rewards metagaming  bad   and exploits the intrinsic lack of accountability in an online game plus why would any pos maker actually be dumb enough to configure their shield to allow a friendly doomsday through it nuke this no dd passes through any shield friend or foe pos standings based on alliance standings rather than corp thought give an option check in pos management to do standings based on alliance level standings rather than corp level standings most alliances use pos as an alliance asset have it act accordingly forcing people to mirror alliance standings at the corp level just so your pos wont be dumb is poor interface aggression timer not going away due to jump gate use thought sorry the ability to jump through a gate and immediately log while cloaked is dumb if you got shot on the other side you are still aggrod aggro timer is 15 minutes no unaggro by jumping damage inflicted record  for kms   not going away due to jump gate use thought if someone just shot you for 10k damage you jump through a gate and take a rocket for your last 3 points of structure the killmail lists the rocket guy as the only killer thats not right have damage stick around for 15 mins or so as well regardless of system change change of ships can remove it as can docking self destruct still yield killmails via same rules as an npc kill  first other human gets mail  thought in the event where someone is shooting at you and you selfdestruct it should treat it exactly like an npc kill you die and it just looks at the next highest source of damage and awards the mail accordingly failure to do this just punishes people for not bringing overkill all the time if 3 brave battleships hold down a carrier cycle in and out to hold points and finally wear him down in an epic struggle they should get the credit not oh sorry you cant kill me in 2 minutes so i selfdestruct and it doesnt count same issue with supercaps etc if you only barely have enough damage to kill something you should be rewarded for making the kill not punished
i can get behind this
yep happy to advocate these changes and fixes i support the items here as a group issue  combat dynamics   and once this has been out here for a minimum 7 days discussion ill be bring them to the csm for approval
i agree with the first 3 suggestions buthonestly i think that people are far too concerned about killmails in any situation where your opponent selfdestructs you still have plenty of evidence that the combat took place such as combat logs receiving killmails from selfdestructing ships in my opinion is placing too much emphasis on personal pride and not enough emphasis on the fact that you have deprived your opponent of his shiphowever given the recent hp buffs the self destruct timer should at least be increased to 3 or 4 minutes i dont think that the killmails generated from selfdestructing should show fittings however
yup
before expending the agression mechanics they should first be properly documented and a visible 00 agression timer added the current undocumented mobile warp disruptor mechanics for instance which create agression on both a player initiating warp in one and the player who deployed it without any visible indication this happened
this 
yep important point i certainly believe that we need more visible timers on these issues its just fair play really
no people selfdestructing to avoid killmails is the test thing ever have you ever ganged a disparate bunch of people in lowsec to kill a carrier with battleships that was preying on your mates and then he selfdestructs at structure so annoying killmails are how we record victories and losses and yeah sure theres a pride thing you point to and say we killed whoever i dont see a problem with that
holy crap i agree with all of those ideas
yes it is a epeen waving pride issue but being it is a game kill mails are away of keeping score there is nothing wrong with that industrialists and such will use wallet balances to do the same waving there epeen about how much money they make and what kind of pimped out ship they fly just like in times of war pilots would stamp the kill on their airships to show there achievements and fellow pilots would try to compete with that there is nothing wrong with showing pride in your accomplishments
so would you be okay with self destruct mails not containing any fitting information
eve needs to support a variety of play styles so simply because killmails arent something that you personally may value does not mean that eve should support them in an incomplete manner killmails are the record of combat events and important to a large number of players lets make sure they are thorough accurate and generated upon any meaningful deathdunno if i actually get to support my own idea or not but take that regardless p 
excellent
i dont care how ccp does it or what reason they use to do it but please return the helios back to the maulus base model with the little antennae everything else below is just my side rant the single sentence above is really all im after all i am asking for in this thread in terms of support is the helios model be returned nothing else i do not want this thread to turn into give it a highslot or any other issue players have verbalized feelings of betrayal angst discontentment and even upset stomachs over the new helios modelwhile there was a very logical reason for the change i believe that ccp has taken an illogical approach to changing it when most of the players who enjoy flying the helios were up in arms over the change before it hit the main server tranquilitysidenote it is my belief that ccp seriously took zero effort into making the imicus version of the helios it does not have a single polygon added and it has just been reskinned with a new greenish texture not impressed
signedthe imicus hull imo doesnt give the covert ops style look as the maulus hull didand those that say it spends most the time cloaked who cares what it looks like you can still see the outline of it while its cloaked   
morphed you have to press the little support button go edit your post p
signed friends dont let friends fly imicus
hell yeah likewise with the cheetahvigil the probeimicus dont look like high tech covert ships they look like junk cargo haulers
i self destructed mine and training for the amarr frig now
why do you need a remodel on a ship you cant even see most of the timechange is something that is most of the time for the best in a few weeks it will basicly be a non issue
i agree
i agree old helios was sexy this one is minmatar
cov ops frig  astrometrics cruiser this is just common sense now if you want a prettier imicus maybe but changing the model of your cov ops frigate back to that of a combat frigate is silly
why do you care so much because your covert ops ship a ship that will be invisible during most of its operation looks cool or not even if this took five minutes it would be a waste of manpower
i prefer the make the imicus model less of an eyebursting abomination option myself having the covops use the astrometrics frig hull rather than the ewar frig is only sensible for purposes of continuity even if it is ugly
have you not realised they are merely matching the t1 astrometrics hulls with the t2 astrometrics ships so no this should not be changed back it has finally been changed and this is how it should stay
i prefer consistency especially when it comes to a ship that i see for only 30 seconds every few daysdont waste time on this nonsense
may be nonsense to you but to others it is not nonsense your opinion is it is nonsense my opinion is the imicus is dead ugly and ccp did not even spend any time at all making it look nice plus it is more of a standpoint that gallente are slowly turning into last years amarr  where you have people shout boost gallente on the forums   and now were getting stuck with a dog of a ship when it was once a most attractive little gemmaybe because i just enjoy looking at it alright fact is a lot of the time it is not cloaked because im alone in a system or when im docked i enjoy its curvessimple fact is the ship is pretty ccp can figure out some way or another to maybe swap around things so they can put the helios back inand to the person that said its a waste of manpower do you understand anything about qa right
the point is a covert ops ship is that exactly it is not there to be pretty it is there to be hidden and sneaky the fact it looks a little exotic does not make this ship unflyable or unusable it should not changeplease see arguments in former post this change balances the game
i prefer to keep the current model of the helios the imicus hull is the probe ship mot the maulus
helios was sexy
swap the maulus and imicus hulls give the helios its old hull make the keres the new helios hullconsistency solved people happy
its just looks bleh now p
yeah only nobody flies the keres because it is a crappy ship
the imicus is by far the ugliest thing flying in the gallente fleet and reskinning it to make electronic attack ships more appealing is just a dirty move do not change ship models midway threw the game not only does it break the 4th wall big time but those pilots that worked hard and trained months of time away to get a ship they liked for its role and looks are just slapped in the face by this changeif ccp wants to make their new lovechild more appealing than use the same model and reskin it or gasp make a new model for the ewar ships
signed
cheetah needs the same lovenew models are awful
helios is sneaky sexy indeed
no supportthe change to the helios was in fact a buff it reminds you that you forgot to activate your cloak
i dont care what this ship looks like butsince siigaris brainwashing still hasnt faded ill support
after flying around in my helios i quite like the new hullnot supported
these are practical ships no1 purpose is not to look niceyou want beauty look at a noncloaking ship
meh either way its fine its cloaked half the time anyhow
the imicus is the logic t1 hull to use leave it this way
can we make a vote to scrap every lopsided piece of crap in eve i mean who thought it would look good to have tumescent blobs flying around in spaceanyway it seems like most that fly the helios on a regular basis want it returned to the original model why because we have to look at the ship constantly were the ones sitting in station spinning in circles were the ones that still see the shape of the ship while its cloaked so if it doesnt affect you bugger off
if you fly it as much as you say you do you do not have to look at it it should be cloakedi still dont get what all the fuss is about its a ship that should not even be visable 80 of the timethe change went in to make things easier for the inventors out there if you seriously dislike the model make sure you cloak more often
signed for most of thesei know its probably late but here are some other suggestions for features ive been hoping to see but dont hear others asking forability for cfosjr accountants to modify orders submitted for corporationsskills to meter the extent of the market history thats visible at a time  lv1 1 week  lv5 1 year  new revenue streams from services currently run by npcs or would improve pvppve  repair stations clone vats at poses toll jumpbridges wingman automated fighterassignment vending machines etct2 named loot bpcs dropped in 00 specced somewhere between t2 and faction gear and requiring t2 components and salvage to buildspeaking of salvagetractor dronesand finally a capital ship that allows for sales of goods directly from its cargohold with appropriate standings filters etct1 loot drops are more important to the economy that most industrialists will ever admit  they allow for a secondary mineral stream that doesnt involve shooting rocks for long hours changing this system would have very dire consequences for anyone but the hardcore miners and macroers which are already too populous in the game
while i agree that science and industry definitely needs a boost and i like some of these ideas i really do not like many of them sorry
signed including but not limited to tesseracts magnificent critique
im sitting here wondering wtf that proclamations forum is for give csm members post privileges to it everyone else is read only voila issue resolved duh
i absolutely support thisforums are the way to go
true but it doesnt hurt to throw ideas out there also looking for any constructive critism its only a basic idea would def need to be ironed out quite a bit more
delegates are required not to look like fools in public arent they
meets with great approval and justice
supported  i would also add that remote termination of a jump clone would be extremely useful as well
signedid suggest a specific number of allowed jumps in a time period so we arent stuck with fixed intervals and have some leeway something like twice or thrice in 24 hours so you can jump into your combat clone and back into your training clone and maybe also back into your combat clone if duty calls unexpectedly
i do think 24 hours is a bit excessive
4 hours would be awesome  with skills of course   12 hours without would be pretty cool too
there has yet to be a negative response about this and for a good reason i would gladly train an extra skill in order to let me jump clone more often
the danger with reduced jump clone timers is allowing people to bounce from clone to clone too easily to swap between locations or implant sets  learning implants in particular   with much less riskfor example youre sitting in your 4 set learning clone when somebody starts an impromtu fleet op you jump into a blank clone so that your implants are not in danger go on the op and then a few hours later you bounce back into the learning set and carry on your accelerated training youre still getting the reward from the implants for all but a few hours but youre not putting them at any riskits understandable that people want this  after all we all would want more use out of our learning implants while keeping them safe  but im not convinced the proposal is compatible with the risk vs reward philosophy
that is apart from traveling insane distances the only reason for jump clones to exist in the first place its quite a bit like switching between differently rigged ships
oh yes please
monstertrucks are gay a hulk hogan model i could lend support to but not this
i support this under the condition that the delegates suppose it with straight face and a record of the devs reaction is being made public
i think if this ever happened  which we all know it wont   then we should turn mining barges into floating carebears with mining lasers for cks
no their belly lasers would mine the ore so that they could oppress the care bear cousins like the filth that they are
if csm only gets 1 thing done this needs to be it
the kings dead long live the kingseriously are you all so democratically impaired that you need to get taught democracy by an autocracy you should now betterfuture csms will be able to base their manner of operation on the previous ones amending and changing procedure where deemed necessary a period of confusion and internal fighting is common for any newly instantiated body you have to give evolution a chance to kick in
all the western democracies work only because of two prerequisites1 a written constitution that states the rights and its limits of those who participate in the political process often to the point of being very explicit when it comes to parliamentarian preocedure2 a constitutional court that interprets this constitution when the need arisesthe constitutional document provided by ccp leaves much to be desired indeed it looks like something they may have come up with during lunch break and left it by thatthere is no constitutional court for the csm and ccp seems unwilling to step up to this role  probably shows how much they really care about this  that a constitution for the csm will be worked out in consensus by the csm itself is a bit naive regarding the animosities that prevail there historically the constitutions of the western countries that guarantee their democracy have come to pass in mostly very undemocratic ways ie as results of revolutions or wars though it surely would be entertaining seeing heads being loped off in some csm meeting it surely would be more practical when ccp would get their head out of their behinds and provide the basics so that the csm could actually work
doing so would undermine the legitimacy of the council let me explainthe constitution put forth by ccp goes on to lengths to express the intent of the council which is to put an inalienable right of the players that of governmental participation into practice i should rather say constituted form as every company has to listen to its customers ccp has stated what they are willing to to namely meet with the council and even pledge to answer issues brought forth by it to do this they have to have one specific community partner and not just people claiming to be that entity thus the need for a specific form of governmental body is created as ccp themselves have to organize electionsthis given we have a social contract still the only part of the constitution that has an implicit eternity clause is defined by ccps need for a clearly identifiable partner that represents the community the rest is just needed to bootstrap the contract ccp cannot object any communitysupported reshaping of the council as long as their part of the contract does not change and is much likely to accept other changes as long as we dont all want to go to iceland on their bill this might be for example changing the maths of the election procedure i very much doubt they would even issue a statement should the community or council decide to extend the council to 100 members acting as a parliament electing nine of their own to meet with ccp in person they would just accept itthe judiciary as in any contract which cannot be based on a law all agreeing parties are subject to is the agreement itself ccp should not and as far as i see will not interfere in any politics between customers themselves doing such would be autocratic beyond legitimacy like the queen feeling scottish ordering the english to wear kilts and play bagpipes utter indecency would arisewhat im trying to express here is that a player government not ruled to the utmost extend possible by the players themselves is an epic failure the council should not or rather must not look to ccp for advice as ccp is the entity its supposed to oppose and approach on eyeheight i expect ccp to act in a laissezfaire way shrugging if the community fails to organize in a sane manner in the good conscience that they arent the ones to blame doing otherwise would undermine their very intent to have a partner at eyeheight instead of being able to look down on individual players only having to react if widespread utter indecency arisescommunication is only possible between equalsi and most likely ccp too do not care how long it takes until this goal is met as long as it isnt jeopardized in the meantime we should take our time to implement a government we can be patriotic about a state where one council member can say to another youre putting your agenda over the government and have the other one fall silent immediately council members at one time will be aware that they are not a member get their voice heard but to get the voice of their voters heard cries for impeachment wont make that happen neither voting for the right candidates on its own only acceptance of the council for that what it is meant to bemaybe the council should start off with not putting the voteable chairman issue on the agenda but just elect make a motion for procedure including or excluding alternates and then go on show some teeth how can the players trust in the councils ability to squeeze answers to topics ccp does not want to talk about out of ccp if it cant even elect its own chairman without begging for permission
thing is kitoba there is a question about what we want to achieve here is it playing a virtual committee simulator and spending time wrangling over powerplays on the council or is it getting playerissues through the process and raised for formal discussion with ccp you might not think the two things are necessarily contradictory but when we have meeting time limits and some real life intruding on how much effort each csm can put into the process each week it does turn into a matter of compromising one thing to focus on the other this csm committee can be excellent when were talking about gameplay issues and balance and advocated ideas but its pretty terrible when its discussing procedure and outright heinous when matters of moderation and balance and political interest groups get involved using the csms as figureheads and rallying banners ive come to the conclusion this week that we should be minimizing procedural discussion as much as absolutely possible because its just not a fruitful use of our time id much rather be talking about xyz gameplayboosting ideas during these 2 hour meetings than wasting more time on whatever the current political threadnaught topic is and i think at the end of the six month term were going to be judged by the general electorate on what we manged to get done and successfully advocated to ccp in terms of these gameplay issues than what we achieved in the field of political invention and playing games with the committee structure speaking personally if i end this term and people remember me as there goes jade the guy who got pvp docking aggression timers increased black ops fixed and the nighthawk its power grid buff ill be pretty happy at end of the day and reckon the people that voted for me will have gotten a good dealif on the other hand its nothing but there goes jade the numpty that spent 20 weeks arguing about whether the committee needs to pass a motion signing off minutes and whether the chair has power to call time on debates then most players who voted for me will feel justifiably robbed of an opportunity to influence game improvementsthis is a game were talking about here its a game we all play sure but it is about spaceships on the internet and improving aspects of that game to the common good ccp wanted a varied crosssection of reps from all sides of the game and theyve pretty got that our job now is to make sure all those sides get represented and get a chance to have their issues heard not every issue were going to be individuallyraising will be liked by everyone in the player base but its important that everyone in the player base feels at least one of the representatives can look at and potentially advocate the issues they feel are important
oh sorry i meant to say put your egos aside stfu and get to work failure to do so will not get any of you reelected if you arent able to constrain yourselves neither will ccp
tbqh  i would have thought that basic meeting etiquette and a copy of roberts rules of order  
ccp does not want to interfere in any way with the council they have provided some further guidance which has resulted in the current changes which have gotten us past our most contentious issues i wouldnt even have said that as ive not been cleared but ill assume jade has because jades quoted the email in various places thats about all i can say without violating both the eula and my ndai agree that the administrative discussion doesnt add any value to be frank it shouldnt have been necessary in the first place i wont allude to fictional conspiracies or makebelieve factions though because they simply dont exist people on the council have different beliefs that is as was intended if some of those beliefs did not overlap in agreement thered never be the possibility of a yes or no vote on anything this isnt the xfiles though ill admit that may be more palatable than accepting personal responsibility for ones actions
this is what i believe is the biggest problem we have players that will not let go of the goon conspiracies bob spy plants and rp faction agendas essentially we have members showing up still logged in at times i do see some discussions of clarity and then i see the spewing of the crap that belongs in game if there is a next csm i am hoping the next candidates will at least bring an out of game objectivity
palatable im surprised your stomach hasnt lept up your throat to strangle you just to stop you from making it turn when you utter such unbelievably absurd pot calling the kettle black bull nothing youve done on the csm is reprehensible youre just an innocent hard working csm representative integrity is your middle nameif you can get people to believe that youve got a great future selling swamp land as waterfront retirement communitieswindjammer
theres a reason people cant let go of the goon conspiracies and that reason is they exist some goons are dedicated to a machiavellian style of forum warfare for them distorting the truth stretching the truth twisting the truth or just flat out lying is a valid tactic one to be giggled over and admired their only interest in truth is how they can best bend it to obtain what they desireyour own posts lend themselves to scrutiny within this context ive read quite a few of them now and can only conclude youre an alt of a goonswarmer if youre not you may as well be you take up their cause in every instance that ive witnessed and ignore or down play any criticism of themwindjammer
i wholeheartedly agree with these two statements and support the suggestion of the op as an option worthy of serious consideration theres an obvious need for an authority outside the csm to stabilize the csm meetings at least until the csm gets over its birthing painsregardswindjammer
never said any of that pretty typical of one of your posts though keep swingin for the fences you alttastic diamond
more irrelevant and uninformed drivel posted without a shred of backing i can do this too windjammer has been jailed for extended periods of time in his life for exposing himself to men over the age of 89 he also has a nylon fetish anyone who says otherwise is a downright liar and sells bridges they dont own
this
agreed
well by your reasoning that would make you jades alt trying to undermine csm reps that you do not like or players that happen to disagree with you is this a true statement probably not but that is how all this crap is created because of this kind of conspiracy theories and finding a boogie man under every rockif you notice my post i made the reference to all three tinfoil hat conspiracies spewed by the three major sources on these forum not giving any defense to any one partyand whom i decide to align my self matters not as i only support the ideas that would possibly help in the long run no matter from which source it comes from by trying to chide me into your way of thinking will not sway me or to jump on the tinfoil hat bandwagon i do not have time for that messi present my views as objectively as i can i have disagreed with subjects that goons support like the removal of learning skills and supported documents like pitbosses proposal who is a privateer btw which last time i checked they war dec them a lot also i support repo who is also have been killing the goons so i am not sure how you came up with that but if it makes you feel better more power to you i guess by my way of thinking and support i guess lend my self to pirate more than that of a bunch of noobs who reprocesses a dd mod to make frigs who knows maybe i was at one time suggardaddy that choked out hagilur or maybe foe alliance drone from the day who knows but i am sure you can come up with something fanciful
inventors have more overall profitmaking potential than t2 bpo holders but it comes at an exponential increase in time effort and risk exponentialive got a healthy t2 bpo portfolio and i dedicate about one hour every week maintaining all of the inputsoutputs for each print one hour sometimes less its pretty awesome its really cheesy thoughsure invention murdered my profit margins but theyre still astronomical by real world standards 500 600 700 800 900 all the while pricing product lines at rates intended to make inventors cry i may not be making 5 10 15 billion a month off of each bpo like preinvention times but its still a decent living and it comes with the added bonus of knowing youre urinating in some inventors hopes and dreams for profitsso yeah removing t2 bpo wouldnt be a bad idea itd suck for those of us with them but oh well mountains of isk get sort of boring after awhile anyways
so let me understand thisyou are a multi t2 bpo holder you say your profit margin at the moment is between 500 and 900  how can you not know exactly if your building stuff and selling it   and al5though you are still making 500900 profit you seem to want them removed because you are bored with making mountains of isknow i do ot want to really call anybody a liar but your a liar
margins vary based on which print and which market the product is unloaded at ask around and poll people who have mountains of isk sure isk is great and all but after a certain point it starts to lose meaning just because someone has reaped great benefits from an unbalanced model doesnt mean that they cant acknowledge the flaws in the system no im not naive enough to trash my own prints since most likely noone else will so until the day comes when t2 bpo across the board are gone ill sit back and enjoy griefing marketsthanks for the comments though
the amount of misinformation being given in this thread about the profit differences between invention and bpos is pretty amazing im not sure if its because of ignorance of the actual values or because of an attempt to hide the truth and point at the fabricated numbers as proof that its not that badfirst lets look at time investmenta nonresearched vagabond bpo  which you can get the stats for on the market   is as followspe 0 give you a production time of around 1d 12h or so with industry v which is required to build itinvention has to deal not only with the pe but the time involved to get the bpc in the first place if you had a pos with a laboratory cranking out the maxrun bpcs for invention and doing the invention itself with the time investment would be around 45 days per attempt and since both invention and copying are lab activities youre limited by either your laboratory operations skill which can allow for quite a bit or extra characters to do the inventing if you did this with empire slots well you could wait for weeks for a copying slotthen theres the actual production costme 0 gives you a cost of around 52m isk to build the ship with jita parts assuming you have a production efficiency skill of v less means it costs more but thanks to the magic of multiplication the overall percentages remain the same a vagabond sells for around 81m right now which is a profit of almost 60each negative level of me past 0 adds almost 10 more to the construction cost with a few minor exceptions  ram and the hull specifically   its been a little while since i last invented anything but i think the best me you can get for an invented ship is 1 which also only gives you a single run increasing the overhead cost of that ship i personally went for the 2 me 2 run bpc option as that gave me what i felt was the best riskreturn optioneach one of those attempts accounting for failure rate decryptors bpcs run time etc gave something like a 75m overhead to each run something a bpo holder doesnt have to deal with at allnone of these issues are even seen by bpo holders so this is what were looking atat least a 10 higher cost of production a copying overhead cost  yes theres still a cost if you provide all of the items needed its called an opportunity cost   and the time investment this could easily push the cost of each ship to being 30 or more higher than the bpoproduced oneoh and the production amount from that bpo again with the vagabond option youre looking at approximately 2 vagabonds every 3 days so thats around 20 of them a month invention can give you more sure but youve got the time investment to get that bpc then the often negative pe effect as well  which can push the production time per hull close to 3 days in some cases  its not a tiny difference its a pretty huge oneas for the cost of those bpos as stated by others before their initial cost was laughably small to claim that the cost paid to purchase the bpo from another player should be protected is laughable and flies directly in the face of any concept of risk that supposed to be part of the basis for this game
id call for a motion to inject tii bpos at an increasing rate into the game as tiii approaches think exploration or random chance of invention resulting in bpos but then noones gonna listen to my sanityor youre all so stunned by my ideas that you rather keep silent as not to embarrass yourselves its hard to tell you know
wait youre serious arent youso in your ideal world inventors have  better me for less material usage  important on large stuff and especially with dysprosium so expensive  better pe for faster buildingall the advantages of parallel building capacityand the ability to go off and make something else when the market for widget iis tanksall this and all you get for your trouble is not having to burn a few dozen datacores that get cheaper by the week as more people line up to farm themi take it someone had a particularly long failure streak on their marauder jobs
disintegrate immediately the imperial apoc federate megathron guardian vexor raven state issue ecc they cant the acquired in gameother dumb thoughts to share with us
no cost like training the needed skill to get the rd agents when they gave nothing if you werent lucky running the missions for the standing running the missions for the rd agents when they were asking decent items and not tritanium  like 35 science graduates find them if you can   waiting a year before the lottery restart as you have started playing at the end of the previsous round of the lottery  spending all the accumulated rp for a bpo  25k rp for a quake l bpo it is worth 250 millions that was the price when i got it  sure 0 cost no work
boy you are a bad liar you dont know a bit about the bpo return or you are a very bad builder and think that the minerals and t2 building materials are free because you build them yourself
while the use of the copy slots has a cost  pos fuel   if you are using a character trained to invent to produce the copies you are doing it wrong you should start a new alt in one of the science schools train him a bit and you have a character that can run several copy jobs at little cost and without using invention slots you can use the same character to do rd for agents to get some extra datacore too
i might have supported the idea if the tone would have been a little more constructive the whole t2 bpo discussion is a matter of people owning them ridiculing people that dont for their building skills and people that dont own them crying about how unfair the game is neither is helping the issue forwardi would say that a little research into the matter to come up with a better solution than lets just not touch it for now is called for i can see options that might be fair if properly looked at by people with all the information  ie ccp  player builders   for example how about turning all the existing bpos into bpcs with a number of runs that far exceeds what you would normally be able to get  or better still a pile of normal maxed out bpcs that dont break the rules and have the added advantage of being distributable the trick is getting the number of runs right but thats what the research is needed for this way there would be no need to refer to changes 3 years into the future even though the end effect might be just as far away for even the most productive builders as a another side effect these bpcs would start out with a monetary value equal to  or perhaps even above   the current bpos but would nicely go down when used to balance the unfairness over timejust an example im sure theres people out there with better ideas but at least a little more thought than lets get rid of them should go into itfly well and have fungrismar
only if the t2 bpo holder is somehow prevented from inventing
the problem is that the spread of t2 bpo quality is very large so what can be fair for 1 of those bpo is unfair for another the best thing is to lets the me and pe of the original t1 bp influence the values on the final t2 bpc when inventingthat will remove the only true advantage left to t2 bpo the research done on them and that it is not a so large advantage as you can think researching them is a long process i have researched a t2 barrage m bpo to get some pe it required more that 20 days of lab and the advantage was going from 8 hours as production time to 7 hours 20 minutes to recover the isk i hadnt gained while doing the research it required 240 days with the new improved speed so 23 of a years were used to be exactly at the point were i would have been if i had done no research  and i am not considering the cost of fueling the pos   after that point i have started gaining a 91 extra invention an be more of a hassle  not really i do it and the really annoying part is researching the market not building or inventing   but a t2 bpo is a lot of capital imobilized for a very small return
what the inventors and whiners fail to realize is that increasing the me or pe of invention or screwing around with it to make it more efficient will not help them what so ever simply because the builders will still try to under cut each other and reduce profits even furtherbpo holders and bpos are not the problem and do not effect the market or the profits of inverters at all inventors are doing that by competing with each other so a reduction in costs will either not effect profits or reduce them further and bpos have nothing to do with it
given that people actually pay tens of billions for them id have to say that they cant be that bad an investment nobody gets 40 billion without having some idea of how to judge profitability
i specifically mentioned using an alt which is what i didusing a pos to help with invention also carries the additional costs of running that pos which once again increases the overhead by even more for the inventor
wow give this man a cookie you came up with another good idea although the imbalance created by a few people playing hangar queen with these ships is no where near the effect that t2 bpos havei see the old playes are still with their fingers in their ears refusing to listen to explanations on total cost and effort between invention and bpo yes it will they would now compete at a better than bpo cost base the effort will still be higher but the end product will be cheaper it will allow them to eliminate the profit margins of bpo holders in the major marketsi never said players in this game were very smart in their purchases isk  iq
bpo holders aint dropping the prices down its the inventors that are crashing the market cos of competition the bpo holders will set prices around the cost of the market but inventors are constantly under cutting each other so making invention easier or cheaper will just make t2 items cheaper and thus less profit for all but bpo holders have nothing to do with the decrease
waaaaaaaaaaaah is that what you were trying to say that ccp dared to implement some system where bpo holders would have some competition ccp preserved a profit margin for you by making invention have me inventors will never be able to compete with you purely on a cost basis if there are some people that are selling items below invention cost somewhere buy the  and relist it dont come crying on the forums that invention killed your exorbitant margins and now you are stuck with margins that are still better than anyone else has
never had a t2 bpo or any other sort for that matter and i could not care about t2 holders profit or inventors for that matter what i do not like is waaabulance nerfits who think that they deserve to be given a free hand out or up while others spent years getting into the same positiont2 bpo holder deserve to make a little more profit that ppl without them and considering that they do not effect the profits that inventors make one bit the only reason to remove them is because of jealous cry baby prats who are never satisfied no matter what is done
t2 bpo holders deserve nothing when things need to change the last thing that needs to be thought about is entitlement when titans get nerfed will the alliances that build them get a refund nope it doesnt matter that you spend 60 billion isk on the titan bpo and many billions more to build one when  is broken you fix itlike i said before some ccp dev probably has a ton of t2 bpos which is why we will never end up seeing this fixed i wish i could prove this though
bpos work fine as far as ive been told and they have zero impact on players in eve other than those who own them or buy them in the future so not broken in fact working perfectlyif your going to make accusations of corruption within ccp i suggest you have facts to back it up or start a thread for the csm to investigate it
yes proper accounting and math is oh so difficult nice try at refuting points by trying the marginalizeyouropponent routewho knows maybe your prints are no longer very profitable maybe you are a horrifically inept builder honestly thats most likely not the case  but its a strong strategic move for you to try to paint the picture that t2 bpo holders are ohwoeisme nerfed and deserve more i understand why you would take that tack but its somewhat transparentas far as the other guys assertion that t2 bpo holders arent the ones driving margins down in some cases this is true but in others it most definitely isnt some t2 bpo holders derive a warped sense of glee by griefing inventors and other bpo holders i know that i do unfortunately ive only been able to kill the margins on four maybe five product lines  which really is just a drop in the bucket  
still more lies from the guy who claimed to be making 500900 profit from his bpos after invention came outyou should have researched prices and profit margins before posting this total delusion
um how bout we replace the bpos with like 1000 or 10000  some large number   of bpcs at the current mepe of the bpo then you have a few years worth of jobs to build steady or you can sell off good bpcs or you can keep the steady rate you have now and coast still for a few years as everyone else vapors their bpcs and the price comes back upnot really saying bpos need to be killed but seemed a better compromise than a single max run bpc for a friggin bpo
while i am still seeing all kinds of acrimonious shouting in this thread with people saying other people deserve nothing and etc may i suggest shouters again go to this thread
market forces will eventually devalue them to reasonable levels of sane costthat is once people finally catch a clue and grasp that a 2 year roi for anything in this game is a little insane
i know the answers alreadyi stand by my statement of if its not available for anyone to get then it shouldnt be in the game its the same reason that the lottery was a failure as a game concept and why many other games that try the same type of thing remove it shortly after except in this case there is some unkown reason to keep the remenants of a failed system around to make it even more funny they made invention less profitable than the bposas far as my hypothesis of ccp employees having t2 bpos its the only logical reason that i can come up with that they are still around eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth  yes i stole a quote   since there is no logical reason to leave t2 bpos in the game what remains is that personal interest has interfered with good game design sense
lemme just say one thing if you dont like the way ccp runs the game then why are you playing it it is just a game after all no one is forcing you to play it
why are you reading this forum all this forum contains are people asking for changes that they would like to see in game that is the purpose of this forum to discuss what you would like to see changed hence we are discussing it this thread is for talking about t2 bpos this is not for complaining about other forum members please stay on topic thanks
your ignoring the obvious reasons they do not remove them like1 as with the fed navy and other ships the t2 bpos are a pinnacle of their particular type in the game2 they effect game design and game play not at all unless your a jealous and bitter nerf hound and so there is no reason to remove or nerf them unlike every other removal or nerf the game has seen3 they are available or at least can be available for ppl to buy if they have enough isk to do sonow considering these facts id say your sherlock holmes logic needs a lot of work
i disgree almost completely with the op i dont even own a single bpo of any sort and ill be the first to say that those who have them have the right to keep themnot signed
1   t2 bpos have nothing to do with things that anyone can purchase by running some missions maybe if they removed the missions and left the ships in the game you might have a point if you are talking about unique ships that have been given out in the past that isnt a good idea either2   either they a   dont matter or b   are extremely valuable  see contracts   so either they are imbalanced which is shown by the ridiculous sale prices or they dont matter so no one should miss them if they were to be removed3   a bpo that i want never comes up to contract or its put up at such a high price it is unfeasable to own it either way it doesnt matter its not available
nice argument well presentedeven if they are ridiculously priced nobody is forced to buy them and they do not matter to others as far as effecting profits are concerned so the only reason to remove or nerf them is because ppl are bitter cos they do not own one and that is the worst reason to do anything as ppl like that  you   should not be catered to everjust because you think the price is unfeasible does not mean other would not like to add one to their trophy case who do you think you are to remove a item from the game that has zero effect on your game at all just because you feel its over priced
finally we hear some truth here the above exemplifies all of your arguments  you do not have the isk or the ability to buy a good bpo and you want to take it away from all others that have them one way or another basically we come down to a real reason why all the people who want t2 bpos be taken out of game  their own inability to make enough isk and their own jealousy at the others
let me boil this down as simple as possible it is in ccps best interest to preserve some sort of equal opportunitiy between players this is the basis of pretty much every multiplayer game designgood game designers dont arbitrarily say ok you get a free pass and you dont you dont just give an arbitrary set of people a magic bullet that instantly kills everyone else and even dream of it being considered fair that is why the lottery system was doomed from the moment it was conceived work should be rewarded more work should reward more this is why invention is so great randomness is part of the system but not so much that it prohibits anyone from entering a marketi never want to purchase a blueprint and i have no interest in building anything i could not care less about owning one of these or reaping the rewards of having such an item if you think this has anything to do with me you are wrong this is about getting ccp to realize they ed upif you want to rant and rave about how bitter i am please go ahead maybe we can reference some conspiracy theories too
ok good luck with your credibility and all that i still say you are causing trouble and are jealous and masking it with fair game and balance garbage i have read what you were saying and was just waiting for a slip up like above again your kind always comes out with it you are just not careful enough or clearheaded enough to try an avoid pitfalls of fallacy
bpos in the game do nothing to effect the profits of inventors so other than jealousy your whole point here is worthlessthe rewards are minuscule for a good builder and just because you cannot afford one or do not want one is not reason to remove them from the game in fact because you want nothing to do with them they do not effect you or your game play at all
oh yes my jealousy drives me  im just against free rides which the lottery and the t2 bpo situation was  is i suppose that makes me jealous whatever you wont listen to anything i say and i wont listen to what you say
thank you for being honest for once and admitting the truth in whatever perverse form it may be
i think the entire point of the standing requirement is so that people dont just load up an emtpy character slot and flood fw with ships the standing is there so that there is some regulation on faction members attacking within their corp so that pirates who enter just to shoot corp mates get kicked pretty soonish to remove this would result in a mess
5 is really fine and easily achievable doable in trialtime you wouldnt want to pvp with a character young enough not to have those standings anyway and if you messed up your standings its your faultjumpclone standing requirements are too high though but this belongs into features  discussion first
not true i did them on a trial account and you dont even get faction standings
run a couple of cosmos missions you should get to 05 faction base quite fast
there needs to be a minimum requirement otherwise it would be to easy to join up with different races and 05 isnt much youll get more standing increase with skills and with better agents and higher level missions so i doubt you have to complete 200 missions
tldr easier bugreport preferably ingamei know of a great lot of people that wont file bug reports simply because the entire thing seems like something of an audacious effort we trade we fly spaceships we do all sorts of stuff on the time dedicated to eve each day the overly thorough manner for reporting bugs is not prioritizedespecially after patches speedy reporting of issues can be vital i propose therefore  but more for the convenience of everyone   that ccp opens up for a bug report that can be filed ingame and much more easily not necessarily to replace the current one  at all   but to provide ccp with tips for issues that dont need detailed logs like say items disappearing from markets or similar
agreeing with this also something automated to grab logserver outputs and dxdiags etc would be pretty good dunno if its possible though
signed though i think this motion is incomplete much more has to be addressed like unprofessionality of bhs  not having payed staff for support   and ccps attitude to fixing bugs in general
they definitely need to be easier things that would save some time would be the ability  with the users permission obviously   to grab logserver files and computer specs would save a significant amount of time
i do not know if this has been raised before but i personally think petitioning takes too longgive us a button where you can isntantly report a iskseller as soon as he posts in local or any of the chats1   right click his name2   choose isk seller or report3   doneby this it could maybe become too annoyingtake more time for them to post again making it not worth their time botheringam i alone in thinking this would be a good ideaedit spellinglike an opportunity to have them mutedblocked from chattingposting by the time of reporting them and alsomisuse  ban not permanent at first but repeat offenders could have thattldrfaster more accessible and more powerful way of countering isksellers as opposed to the petitoning
supporting my own idea ofcourse
this idea is poor and i dont support itits obviously going to be missused by people if its availible to everyone and anyonereporting isk spammers is effectivly reporting that theres a disposiable trail acc alt spamming do you think the devs care or spend any time on these complaintsi dont think theres any permenant solution to the isk selling problem  in any mmo   but one short term solutiongive rad people like me the ability to block on a global scale i block you nobody sees your isk spam in any channel anywhere in evegiving a few people who regually watch 10k channels this ability would frustrate farmerssellers and eventually theyll change to other forms of advertisingobviouly the pilots would global block would be held accountable for their actions and face a ban if it was missused
i saw the same problem myself but more like an opportunity to have them mutedblocked by the time of reporting themwhich is pretty muh the same way you describe but ofcourse with some checkupmisuse  ban for reportingin other ways its just the same as petitioning a iskseller but faster apart from the mute that is
this is an idea taken from wow unless it was somewere else 1st   basicly when the report spam function came out in wow there was a big uproar about it beeing abused etc but in reality it isntthe one key thing to make sure that it isnt abused is to only deal with reports from multiple people and pref within a certian time ie 2 or 3 mins   this basicly means that its pretty hard to abuse as long as you set the reports to quite a few people  this could also be used to limit some of the spam that goes on not from the evil rlmts such as contract spaming in jita or recruitment channel spaming etc adding in an auto temp block to this also helps
yes ban block moaaari support this idea
i like this but i think i prefer the global ban mentioned above
i can see them both working together actually the main thing im reaching for is a very accessible way of countering the isksellers rmts
there are lots of alliances people etc i dont like but they have the right to vote just the same
there is a difference between mittani calling for the purge all infidels threadnaught last may and 1000 goons telling you that youre dumb one is concerted coordinated action the other is a lot of people sharing an opinion with the means to express it perhaps if you oh great avatar of all things internety understood that goons formed on the basis of an internet forum you might realize why we all post so much its a slim hope but a hope nonethelessby the way this idea sucks and so does the alt op
for amarr gallente and minmatar on average 23 of their level 4 agents from the faction navy  federation navy republic fleet amarr navy   are in lowsec caldari navy is almost exactly the opposite i propose ccp balance this out by either bringing the other 3 factions in line with caldari navy or by shipping caldari agents to lowsecpersonal choice shift a few cal navy agents to lowsec
newsflash there is already ways around jita tuntarras new caldari etc
then they should make it so that the route planning in the map avoids highly congested systems if they can be circumvented by only 1 or 2 jumpsedit yeah im lazy and dont plan my routes manually especially when travelling in high sec but i bet the majority of players out there is lazy like me
im divided on this practically it would help people that just need to travel through jita keep from getting stuck but principally its a poor use of manpower to use static solutions to try and fix a dynamic problemhowever it shouldnt take too much effort so ill support it
depends on where you are coming from and goingthe avoid crowded systems option for the autopilot would be nice as well so its easier to plot a route around it
with the proliferation of capitals and supercapitals in 00 space and the faction warfare event going on there should be the introduction of a new type of t2 battlecruiser based upon the tier 2 bc hulls and designed with the idea of being an anticapital vesselthe main issues concerning such a ship would be as follows1   it would have to be strong enough to pose a viable threat to capitals and supercapitals2   it would have to not be that effective against subcapitals else theres the risk a significantly overpowered doeverything ship3   it should not be a replacement for capitals especially dreads in various aspects of 00 warfare4   it should be a fairly reachable vessel not too easy to get to but also not too hardwith those ideas in mind the suggestion would be for a new class of t2 battlecruisers like many weapon systems throughout history they are designed to be a cheap method of countering something big and a popular way to do such in science fiction writing is through the use of spinalmount weapons this gives a ship the ability to carry what is effectively an oversized weapon for its class but due to the point the ship at the target method of aiming it carries the negative of being somewhat unwieldythe nature of this weapon helps to address potential concerns about it being useful in more ways than its intended roleoverall ideas of the class1   one heavy spinalmount weapon other weapons for selfdefense are possible as well  as per original hull  2   reduced mid and low slots to hinder its tanking ability theyre semifragile weapons not able to replace dreadnoughts3   tier2 racial resists so theyre not too fragile4   simpler requirements to train than command ships still need bc v of course but a light prereq speciality skillbook thats easy to train tooverall ideas of the weapons1   capitalship sized signature these things should not be hitting battleships easily2   high damage so that they are a threat to dreadnoughts enough damagedps so that a small group can go through a dreadnought pretty quickly3   very limited tracking ability the ship itself would have to face the target to be able to strike it is this even possible in evemain concerns i see about the designamarr and minmatar obviously would be energy weapons and projectile but caldari and gallente pose a concern a missilestyle weapon would be caldarilike but would circumvent the mobility disadvantage of these vessels by not having to be alligned with the target give them rails instead and that means gallente has to either use blasters or go with rails as well and if gallente uses blasters then that would give their vessel the shortest range of all types significantly hindering their effectivenessthe overall idea is to help give noncapitals a better ability to engage capitals and provide a sense of reactionary development to the games introduction of new ships
good idea
i htink its a good idea too
i can see your point but im afraid it will replace dreadspoint around same damage as a dreads but cheaper 
woot  no missiles  cannot vote yes for an entire type of ship with no missiles 
bad idea cap ships should be by thier very nature hard to kill
over all its a bad idea battlecruisers of any kind shouldnt be doing much damage to capital ships after all the only use medium sized guns it just doesnt make sense and it would be abused ie they would have to dish out insane dps more manuverable than a bs as well as the cap ships not to mention alot of other stuff you could almost do something with the tier 3 bs hulls and make them into an anti cap ship class but it would still be taking away from other cap ships
i once had a similar idea but mine was based on small very fragile ships like frigates or coopsin essence one would have have a gang of these like 6 ships then these ships would have the ability to activate a high slot module  rift module  that enables it to pair with the other 5 same ships wich would have to be close to each other like less than 3000m this enabling it to build up an energyfield  rift  with its counterpartsonce this energy field charged  like after 30secs or so   it would immobilize the 5 ships and the one pilot who activated his module first in the gang then would have the ability to target a capital ship and fire off a rift beam  imagine the beams the shadow battlecrabs had in babylon 5   this beam would be powerfull enough to break a capital tank with 1 shotnow that the principle is explained here are the tweakingsthese rift firgates would be very vulnerable and would have to be protected by support fleetonce the rift module is activated it has to be fired or the module overcharges and has a cooldown phase of 30 mins before can be activated againthe rift frigates would have very low sensor strength so that only capital class ships could be targetted efficiently  locking a frig fex would take like 2mins or so but locking a dread would go normal speed  as said above already it needs to be a wing or gang of 6 rift frigs to be able to use the weapononce the rift module activated the group of rift frigs would get immobilized until the beam is fired and thus giving the defending force the cruicial counterattack moment but if they miss that point by by capital shipthink this would enable non capital pilots to take part in capital warfare and not make a ship thats a totally uber pawn machine that kills all types of shipsalso this wepon would be totally useless in a pos sieging scenario to attack a tower cos pos guns could pop the rift frigs with a glimps of an eyeso dreads would still have their usefullnessmy 2 cent on this issue
bc sized stealth bomber who uses citadel torpscan be used a little bit against some battleships but generally an anticap ship
what youre suggesting is essentially an upsized stealth bomber not a terrible idea per se but im not convinced its necessary also no spinal mount weapons  this isnt wing commander you cant aim your ship worth a damn in eve
their damage output would be fairly similar but they wouldnt have anywhere near the ability to take damage as dreads which is very important as wellcomparing the ship type to stealth bombers is not quite fair and the idea would be to make it so that they cant do any sort of decent damage to battleshipsyou can all you have to do is approach your target which makes you more vulnurableits not unheard of at all for weapon system to be designed that carry much more firepower than is typical for their size in exchange for a tradeoff usually speed or mobility the requirement for these guys to limit the amount of transversal between them and their target would make them relatively immobile targets their dps would be high against their intended targets but low for their class against anyone else
but why do we need this class in the game what role is it going to fill
badly needed very urgentno cons only prospls pls pls
check the forum history will you
would it be possible to make it so that the upgrade clone thing automatically removes all options below your current sp level if youre not getting something higher than your current sp you might as well be in an alpha clone anyways
if theres no advantage to a better insufficient clone then yes remove the inferior ones id prefer there be some advantage you lose 5 of your unsaved sp say   but if theyre not going to create that advantage then they should remove the ability to pay money for nothing  it has to have confused some n00b in highly unfortunate fashion at some pointedit judging by the post below me this is already the case thus im withdrawing my thumb  inadequate clones should be available if the game mechanics work like this
if you get podded and have an insufficient clone you loose 5 of the difference between the amount of sp you have and what the clone can hold so it does make a differenceof course you normally dont want to use an insufficient clone but you may not be able to afford what you need and in that case it would be better to get something better than the alpha clone anywayif the problem is that you accidentally purchase a lower clone then a warning might be useful but to take away the possibility to get whatever clone you want is not a good idea
i propose the following procedures for csm meetings in order to make these meetings as effective as possibleinvitation to meeting posted a minimum of 48 hours before meetinga deadline of 24 hours before meeting to post agenda for the meeting which will include all issues that are to be discussed and voted on as well as the chosen moderator for the meeting  by default this is the chairman  all issues that a csm delegate wants added to the agenda of the next meeting must be sent to the chairman before the deadline of the agenda as described above any issues sent after the deadline will not be put on the agenda for the next meeting  the one in 24 hours or less   but rather the meeting thereafterthe first issue on the agenda will always be for the agenda to be accepted if any csm delegate thinks that an issue was sent before the deadline and yet is not on the agenda he can propose to have this issue added if any csm delegate thinks that the invitation to the meeting was sent out in violation of the proper procedures he can propose to have the meeting cancelledduring the meeting everyone will be given the right to speak when they ask for it in the order that the ask for it a csm delegate can ask for this right by posting a  in the chat it is the obligation of the moderator to give the delegates their right to speak in the correct order the moderator must himself ask for this right if he is to talk on the issue contrasted to moderating the meetingmuting is only allowed when a csm delegate speaks without having been given the permission by the moderator to do so the moderator is obligated to inform the meeting when he has muted a delegateif the moderator does not do his obligations as outlined above the council can vote for changing the moderator if this vote is not allowed by the moderator the meeting is considered invalidi expect the csm to do some minor changes in this proposition if it is decided to be taken up in a meeting
signed at least whats there i would structure it further calling i participation ii through iv agenda and v to vii orderthen theres the need to consider everything else a bit of brainstorming  disconnections failing to allow for isp issues is wrong imho people should get their 5 minute chance to reconnect publicality there should be a requirement for logs to be accessible to the general public in realtimeactually id expect the delegates to put this up themselves
much like in every other corp there needs to be a general mail that goes out to everybody in the default faction corp and all the people who would normally get pos mails in corps who have signed up for their factionwhat the mail should includeidentify what complex is being assaultedidentify what system the complex is inthe time sent of the mail will timedate stamp itwhat this would domake systems have a somewhat like reinforce mode the militias have however long the time duration is for that complex from when the mail was sent to organize a fleet and repel the invaders if they cant organize that fast then they know which one to attempt to retake for defense this has come up several times in idle discussions in fleet about fw
can we get a faction warfare part of the forum
good idea
can you get a bit more specificright now im assuming that youre talking about an ic smacktalk forum where amarr can try to balance off their inferiority by living out their superiority complexes
what vizan and i mean is a forum for each militia where players can organize their own militia through standardized ts corps and ops a forum would just help create some central leadership
i will support one forum but not two or four for reasons i already gavetheres just no way not to have your enemy gather intel on you if you use these forums
its 80 right now which is quite high especially if you contrast it with the requirements for militia membership and the fact that fw is intended to be lowbarrier  and thus imho also angst   pvpoptions include lowering the req itself andor having the militia offering cheap clones to ensure proper dedication by their memberssigning this means agreeing to make jump clones more publicly available in whatever way
ill agree with looking at militia corps offering jumpclones somehow i could even be really crazy and suggest that you could get them via lp store   but the barrier shouldnt be lowered in general
all youre asking for is an iwin buttona ship that can be dropped in a fleet of 100 and not worry about the outcome is bad and will only attracked blobsan antiblob ship with a massive tank will only result in bigger blobs
now now dont hate this isnt an aweful idea what i think of when i see this is a an antisupport dread instead of a siege module which makes volly high buffs tank and kills locktime we have something which buffs rof range locktime or something approximating that heh said ship should have less of that races tank slots than either carrier or dread so that its much more vulnerableso its not all bad worth discussing at least
certainly not supportedanyone with a cyno jammer and ships with the purpose stated above would become even more unassailable than they are now with multiple titan support two thumbs down
it might now be as awful as titans sporting remote doomsdays or doomsdays at all   but its almost there
quoted for truth
carriers and moms already do that as well as titans
waaah i crawled up asses and nobody caresactually the single most democratic processes are random selection followed by public vote the thing youre proposing is autocraty disguised as philanthropism
the position was open to anyoneeven if ccp approaches players the end result is the same those who want to participate do so those who dont dont with the playerbase votes thrown in to somehow decide the resultout of those who were interested you got what you voted for now live with it ccp cant make anyone do anything they dont want to doreasons why someone might refuse to participate dont want to reveal rl name and info to all of you internet strangers dont want to do secretarial work for free  no benefits dont want to be taken advantage of in a pr stunt dont care about trips to iceland just want to play the game nothing moreits nice that you want others to step in and do a better job but you know if you want something done right
to help organization need i say more
i oppose this if ever they would have to be unlocked by militia membership which raises the alt problem and thus nobody would ever use themi bet there will be playerhosted boards for elders in time where longtime and mutually trusting people can discuss things in calm i dont think ccp should in any way even try to influence the way people metagame
sorry unsupportedi imagine many players have alot of capital invested in the tech 1 bpos in order to produce the command ships changing the base ship to appease an aesthetic considerations is extremely inconsiderate to those investing in tech 2 productionthe recent covertops change is imho a fiascoif you wish to make use of the tier ii models and other under utilized tech 1 models then make new tech 2 ship typesdont screw over those of us who enjoy the current models or have invested in thier production by arbitrary changing them

ive rethought my original suggestion some they need fairly similar base speed and mass as their t1 counterparts  not 25 slower and 50 heavier   and a fourth skill which always goes to buffing damage for ishkur the typical 10 to drone hpdamage per level for enyo an extra 5 damage to small hybrids per level and so on thatd put them into the heavy tankdamage dealing frigate role and with the same speed and maneuverability as frigates they couldnt touch interceptors for their role and would put them more into the cruiserkilling frigate role they were supposedly introduced to if ccp really wants to keep their speed gimped  although hacs are faster than cruisers in every way   then at least make them able to match the speed of frigates if both the af and frigates full set of lows were devoted to overdrive iis
did you vote for a csm candidate now elected and if you did do you regret it now
i shall be the first if not only   person to admit that he hasnt regretted voting for the person he voted for   
are you jokingjade did a great job providing me with all these goon tears i love the csm forums caod was getting a bit boring as of lately
i voted for jade because he was the only one with a vision of the game i really liked if id known how much of a walking drama bomb he was going to be i probably would have looked a bit harder for secondbest but im not convinced yet as to whether id have voted otherwise given the option i will however be sure to look peoples forum histories up more thoroughly next time when im picking who to vote for
on a serious note yes i voted for jade primarily because i happen to agree with the general ideas of his manifesto and because hes a damn good communicator but id be lying if say that i didnt foresee great opportunities for drama especially with an organization like goonswarm
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
i wish we could cast a vote of no confidence jade really crossed the line
wall of text
i voted for hardin and hes one of very few doing what he actually should beso yeah im not regretful in the slightest
voted hardin im still happy with my vote
voted banei havent seen enough to call him great but hes one of the best on the council i am not unhappy with my choice
im severely disappointed in the turnout of our csms to this thread and the others like it do they feel threatened by the goons do they feel threatened by jade do they feel impotent the fact of the matter is this is a huge topic that a lot of the voting public feels strongly in jade is dismissing it as trolling or a threadnought or a goon conspiracy but even csms other than darius and bane feel differently than jade does ive yet to see the majority of our csms respond to the claims that have been put forwardby the way isnt posting this the duty of the secretary
that is jade politicking to act like its the best manwomanthing for the job after what went down this week if he cant have absolute power hell take it in small portions including discounting 50 of the eve playerbase by giving a giant tt to the us players

on the issue of whether or not email conversations should be private or public it is understandable that people draw realworld parallels as this is an obvious connection to makehowever as several players and fellow council members like to remind everyone this is an internet space game and as such lacks the equivalent communication channels that rl provides for a group of people physically located in one placeit strikes me as a little poorly thought out to assume that all communication should therefor be made public when there is no online equivalent of meeting in the halls of government untapped phone conversations and a walk in the park or golf for such an equivalent online we could arguably use voice communications instead however there is a matter of simply being able to respect the need for other nonrecorded forms of communication  via email or private forum   and with that respect not require twisting and bending to find alternative channels last i looked every council member agreed unanimously for a closed private forumwhile it may be scatelogically amusing to read every time farts into a chat log it is not productive to providing community focus on dealing the with real issues the csm is meant to deal with i would far rather have 200 people posting up in arms about a suggested nerf than 2000 people posting about a petty argument over the colour csm should have when they type in local not in the least part because it would not reward csm members with fame and forum scoring points for wasting everyones time with relatively unimportant matters but only for dealing with the key issues players face
i guess ill have to agree to disagree i learned a long time ago to never say anything on the internet that i wouldnt want everyone in the world to read its a valuable lesson there are two schools of thought to this obviouslythe first is that the council for some reason needs a line of private communications beyond their own personal mailboxes why would this private line of communication need to exist so people could say things they didnt want the voters to see for what cause because theyre embarassed by their actions or dont want to be held accountable for them that is an idea i simply find abhorrent publishing your communications isnt a means for anyone to score political points if you havent said anything you wouldnt want anyone to seei take the perspective that we are public figures and should act as such if you cant keep from acting like a jerk in your communications with the other representatives why should the players not be able to see that if good and hard work is going on outside of the meetings and a good dialogue is being had why should the players not be able to see that if you have a reason for supporting or not supporting an issue and state it why should the players not be able to see thatreally the only reason i can conceive for not wanting council discussions conducted via email  the only other medium used right now aside from the meetings   to be public is that you feel you have something to hide all of the reasons ive seen to support this have involved the need for people to be able to save face save face from whomim sorry but this is a public council having public discussions about issues that are the publics concern they have every right to know what is being said about issues they have every right to know what edicts are being given they have every right to know if the person they voted for is really supporting their issues and living up to the standards the voters applied to them when they were electedi posit that anyone who feels they can not handle that scrutiny has something to hide i dont think its the business of the council to hide were not a shadow government
to address the last paragraph im sure you would rather people are concerned with the issues who are we to force that on the population do you honestly think that by operating behind a curtain were going to control behavior thats not our job i think it bears repeating that if you dont want people posting about a petty argument dont have one i dont think its a viable alternative to self control to have said petty argument in private and put on another face in public you are correct that this is not real world politics by that same token this shouldnt be treated with the same broken and falsely insulating shells of secrecyedit you are not a king or leader of eve it is not your position to increase or improve the morale of the general public some people will like the csm others wont regardless id posit that if you want the csm to be respected then it should be open and good work should be accomplished the majority will appreciate thatneed i remind you that secrecy is against the very nature of this council which was created initially as a means to open up the doors of ccp and look inside the very nature of this council is transparency as a founding principle of its creation by ccp at least according to their statements in international publications this council is supposed to open doors not create an additional layer of opaqueness
i can see both sides of it and at the base level i agree with darius about the dont say anything you wouldnt want made public but at the same time i think theres a danger to every conversation and exchange being more performance than substance something that i think has been far too much a part of some of the earlier meetingsthere are many situations in life where a dispute can be resolved by a private conversation between two people  but when that conversation is public record it presents an obstacle to compromise between strong personalities on stage as it were
in no way am i suggesting that two people cannot have a private conversation and in no way as ive said repeatedly but has been repeatedly misconstrued and twisted does my motion prevent that my aim is for all group communications of the council all debates all edicts all suggestions and thoughts that are sent to all to be made public if its good enough to be communicated to the entire council then its good enough to be shared with the subscribers part of the problem here is that were using an email list for what a forum should be used for id be just as happy to have a forum which is read only to the public whereby all council communications can occurat the end of the day im not hung up on scoring political points as some detractors are trying to suggest i have my votes i dont need to score points if we hold another election tomorrow id be elected in a heartbeat that entire argument is silly on its face i believe that by keeping group communications edicts debates and any other group communications veiled in shadow were merely perpetuating the problem the council was created to address by creating the perception of a separate elite class this will only create the same distrust with the public that was the cause of the problem in the first placeedit ccp created this council to remove the veil in the words of ccps ceo i envision this council being made up of nine members selected by the players themselves where you announce your candidacy and if you win the election they come here to iceland and they can look at every nook and cranny and get to see that we are here to run this company on a professional basis said mr petursson ccps chief executive they can see that we did not make this game to win itthat quote is from a ny times article located here
im with you on that i meant to go on to say it just depends where you draw the line with whats public and whats private thats a good rule of thumb
damn you and your sensible ways god damn you all to hell
deleted darius lets just agree to disagree as i dont think that this debate will ever come to an end and submission to ccp of issues is more important to focus on right now
i wont argue what darius initially wanted the focus is on what he ended up wanting and how he feels nowwindjammer
hey you put your internet psychic hat back on you have no idea what ive ever wanted or how ive ever felt lets not be silly i know its a stretch
no not really that much of a stretch its based upon posting inside goonswarm you remember instructions to your bees on how to vote splitting the vote between you and bane that sort of information remember that also based upon your prima donna antics in csm meetingsi know it seems like magic to you  or a psychic trick   but its notwindjammer
well you see the thing is we had an internal vote from about a dozen or so candidates that ended up with dariusbane as the top 2 choices and it was decided we would split the vote between the top 2 candidates which just happened to be the two of them it could have been a number of different people in these positionswhat prima donna antics you mean standing up to the chair when he is abusing his power
doh
a quick question what the hell are you voting on how can you support if a template document has been filled out didnt you already vote on this stuff
we were voting on the multipart issues which were voted in last time provided that they were split into more than 1 issue in order to ease discussionso we voted on if we could support the specific topic of each issue
i just want to thank everybody who turned up yesterday it was a most excellent job in my eyesthanks for being so patient despite how many issues we had to vote abouthopefull the rest of our meetings will go like that
well i can answer that each issue didnt have a discussion thread you couldntpoint of note on the meeting as i read itinanna you are wrong about the market the highest buy order and lowest sell order that is possible to be filled always gets the itemisk when you well no matter if you select a different order to fill or notiirc this is currently done to prevent money laundering where an isk buyer buys a bunch of isk then buys something on the market for an exorbitant price listed by an alt the seller of the item could then claim i just listed it at an exorbitant price there is no way i could have known the isk was bought this is to prevent that
good job chairing the meeting lavista vista is this permanent or is there a rotating chairmanship now
hopefully
gordon brown never made a hobby out of pretending to be a prostitute  that we know of  
ikeep hearing this but i can buy any order i wantand if not then there is a way around this lets say there are two sellorders one for 100000isk with 2 in stock the other at 50000 isk with 10 in stock i buy the 100000 isk one and put in 10 to buyi press buyi check market the 2 are still there at 50000 i spent 1 million isk
the reason i was leading debate was because i was raising the issues in questionbut maybe that is a good thing that it is kinda rotating in a sense so each time we have a new person on the block to moderate the debate i like that idea judging from yesterday it could even work toovery interesting idea we should talk about it certainly
yep i think a rotating chair is a great idea share the admin load and give everyone a chance to do a bit of running meetings excellent stuff
re the chatlogs  im not all the way through them yet but i caught a line about how ccp wont let you abstain whats the deal with that yeah but hes like paul martin without the personality ill take a bit of good oldfashioned eccentric sexual roleplay over the horrific reality of boring politicians of the centreleft
no you can buy at any price and sell at any price you want but not any order the item will come from the person with the lowest sell or highest buy order 100 of the time all the time
well i dont think its as much ccp allowing us to abstain they just never intended it to be an optionbut in questions like this its simple the options for voting areescalate issuedeny escalation of issueit can thus be argued that there is no middleway and that representatives should want one of above to be truei think there is some matters where abstaining is viable but thus far i see no reason to abstainso i dont think its ccps intention to now allow us they just had in mind that either you voted yes or nobut ccp wants us to shape the council so we could raise an issue and discuss if this should be changed
okay finished im amazed  you managed to have a dramafree meeting there had better be beer and videocamers in iceland because i peace on the csm is just wrong somehow and inanna youre wrong  you invariably buy from the cheapest order in the station no matter which price you pay i got burned hard by this one when i was about a week into the game lost my whole 3 million isk wallet   and i havent forgotten it since i see abstention as mostly an i have no idea how that section of the game works so i dont want to fool around with it too much vote in practice  i know theres a few issues id abstain on and if someone as opinionated as me is willing to shut up its probably a good idea to let me
great meeting imoi hope everyone involved thought so alsonow what was differant about this one meeting and the other 3anyway great job and thank you
serenitys absence seriously a week of forum drama nobody wanted to repeat combined with a total lack of procedural issues controversial issues and controversial procedural issues also i dont think the first two went all that badly either
ccp mandated that abstaining is an optionread the documents they have formally said that the system uses simple majority not absolute majority what this means is that all votes are what are known as plurality votesyesnoabstainyou look at the results of all 3 and if there are more ayes than naes then the vote wins if more naes than ayes the vote fails where its contentious is what happens when there are more abstains an abstain is neither a yes  nor a no so in simple majority you look at if there are more yess than nos and you dont count abstains as nos if you count them as naes its called absolute majority because in absolute majority the rule is you need 50 aye for the motion to succeed rather than more ayes than naes the reason why its contentious is if the majority of votes are abstains does this mean that that the vote is rejected or does it mean that the vote is undecided normal political theory says that because its a plurality voting system  3 or more options   the vote remains undecided this does match what common sense would suggest that if most people cant decide it hasnt really been discussed enough yet but sometimes it just means that the motion is killed because its too divisiveeither way to be a simple majority system you must have the option to abstain else it is not simple majority but rather absolute majorityif you count abstains as nos then you are not following ccps instructions in the csmsummary document which state the method must be used
no an email from ccp which i of course cant show you suggests otherwiseabstain wasnt intended
where were the goons is it a coincidence that they were silentabsent and the meeting ran smoothly
yeah it was totally a coincidence that the meeting was scheduled during american work hours
its not as if they said in this very thread  which isnt too long to skim either   that they wouldnt be there
blame ccp for putting the submission date during a work day
thats kind of a cheap shotfirst two meetings ran relatively smoothly and goons participated effectively in them from my perspective the reason this meeting ran a lot smoother than the infamous third was a general acceptance that we need to focus on the gameplay issues and a more relaxed attitude from those running the meetingall in all a good result
could have delayed it 12 hours
no goumindong that would mean that for the majority of the council it would have been past midnight since the majority of the council and eve works in gmt it would be bad to move it back 2 hoursalso due to the fact we have a submission deadline 2 hours would make a huge difference in regards to that
id see it entirely on ccp for the exclusion of noneuropeans from the meeting the fact this had to happen during the week is going to be exclusive for at least one timezone in the future these things should only happen during weekends to allow for everyone to be present what happens in the future whenif some antipodeans get elected is only going to further highlight this issue ccp should nip it in the bud now
so instead of staying up for a few more hours you deny the ability of two players and an alternate to attendstaying up 2 more hours is not a big deal ditching work is
i hate to disagree with the standard take by the elawyers but generally when writing club constitutions simple majority is opposed by 23 majority not by an absolute majority mind you its a simple majority of votes cast  serenitys abstain  no position is absurd  but the rule to ban abstentions is no abstentions it isnt simple majority since that phrase just means 501
ironically it turned out that there was an appendix written for the original documents that explicitly stated that there was no abstention facility in voting on issues  as lavista said the options weresupport escalation deny escalationin order for an agenda issue to reach the conference shortlist it needs a majority of support votes from the those present 5 for 89  4 for 7 and essentially serenity was right in this system you cant abstain and unless you are registering a support vote you are effectively saying nothat said i certainly dont blame anyone on the csm or indeed anyone in the voting electorate for being confused on these issues were discovering these principles bit by bit in discussion and asking for clarification and its a bit playing pass the parcel with new ideas and interpretations hidden underneath each layer of wrapping papermain thing i think all of us  csms and forum public   can do is deal with this process with a few more philosophical shrugs and good humor lets not jump to conclusions and accusations its a bit of a mr slippies wild ride of adventures at the moment and were discovering new things each week all the best
nice work reps that meeting looked like it went very smoothly
yeah well done guys i skimmed the log quickly the whole thing looked cordial enough feels like the creases are getting ironed outheh the trials of being pioneers
i was disappointed that the issues presented were hardly split at all poor issues were voted through simply by being lumped in with good ones even though some representatives expressed concern for wooliness and bad issuesthis can not happen again all issues must be presented seperately on the forums for debate and discussion and a vote taken on each issue not a bunch of issues under a topic many of those issues that are now going to ccp are very poor affect a small amount of eve players and have not been explored further to see that they will have negative ramifications on the wholethis undermines the percieved effectiveness of the csm both in the players eyes and ccp eyes present issues seperately on forums  this is not an issue that needs voting on its an underlying implication in the csm documents  you effectively votes 4 times for 60 issuesvery poor indeedbruce hansen
passing votes omnibus is acceptable if someone doesnt have an issue with the issues in the package but when they do they are supposed to be broken out its obvious to me these people havent read how to actually hold a meeting of this nature or they would know this
bruceonce again you prove to me you have no idea at all what you are talking about since you havent seemed to even read the chat logs which described the 6 issues it was split into nor have you seen the submission templates you would notice that your logic is totally brokenthere isnt 60 issues in total i had to cut large parts of it away because of the huge overhead with voting and submission templates so bruce how can this undermine the effectiveness of csm in both the players and ccp eyes you arent ccp i actually talked to ccp and the original 60 issue document was no problem we could have submitted it and it would have been fine but it was the councils wish to split it into more sizeable chunk and since you havent proved to me that you know what you are talking about i suggest that you stop throwing around wrong assumption and start getting a grasp of reallity unless you can prove further that your assumptions are right i think you should watch what you accuse people of before you start posting
jadei cannot find the issue of mid sized freighters listed in your op according to what i read in the meeting chatlog this issue was supported by all members present at that meetinghas this issue been dropped from the points being taken to ccp for some reason if so why
it went through at the third meeting  i between all the fun   and should be on iceland agenda
i own the small freighter issue the issue was submitted to the agenda on the 12th but i think it might have been missedi will figure out what happened hold on
lawyersimple majority is 50 in cases with small voting bodies 50 1 would require more than a simple majority eg 9 votes are cast 5 yes 4 no 50 of 9 is 45 501 is 55 the measure fails because 55 votes were not cast in favorlawyer
i think its just a case of me mucking up and forgetting it on the op post im afraid lavista has the issue hell submit it directly to ccp with our apologies and well our best to get it on the agenda in iceland sorry about that  im going to edit it into the op now with an explanation  
the issue was overseen during the indexation of all issues we will be submitting it as soon as possible in hope that ccp has a bit of goodwill
originally by arithron yes lavista needs to write 60 topics for the threads and the other representatives also thats the rules you were elected under thats what you have to do this gives players a chance to discussdebate each issue and for the representatives to do likewise both on the forums and in the meetings it also allows for the important vote on each issue seperatelytake carebruce hansen okay ive asked lavista and the other candidates with multiple item issues via our internal mailing list to come and respond to you specifically here arithron i hope youll either come to a rational compromise on the issue or ill advise that they need to be split out okay give tomorrow for some discussion and ill make a call in the eveningcntd
ill also help you out a little and quote a section from the csm documentsafter each csm member presents their opinion to support or disprove a motion the matter is brought to vote a majority rule passes the issue for escalation all csm deliberations are to be documented by the secretary including the reasons for supporting or denying the measurethe key question that council members must consider before casting their vote is whether or not the issue at hand has the potential to improve or otherwise benefit the entire eve society and not just a select group within the community that was successful in bringing attention to their unique casewhat you have is a lot of issues lumped together under some topic headings its clear that csm members vote and discuss each issue  highlighted above   not topics with multiple issuesit would also be good to be able to see the council reasons for supporting the measuresmay i remind you politely that i am not hiding behind a character here in these forums i find your responses to me insulting and belittling and bordering on inflammatory im politely asking you to stop being personal and follow this guidance from the csm documentrepresentatives are not only expected to uphold the social contract that all society members are held accountable to but should also set a behavior standard for everyone else to followtake carebruce hansen
qft you could save typing by copypasting that quote onto many thread
it was my understanding that a few players have these items on tranq already as a result of some awardrp stuff similar to the opux luxury yacht s   and a few other special it would be nice to see if they could share the love but the cost would be a bit prohibitive for newer players also having them go to a small faction like the soceity of conscious thought would make them even more expensive anyone seen a nomad  thukker   implant for sale the thukker even have empire stations yet it costs over 2 billion isk for a set of low grades
its not about giving old players a new toy like a new skill intensive ship type its about increasing the rate at which the gap between older and newer players widensbetter implants  even more sp per hour than new player can hope to attainits basically the same problem that there is with learning skills it does not only rewards older players  which would be fine   but increases the speed at which they distance themselves from newer players sp wise
with so many ideas being posted and support for them mounting i can see how the current approach of these ideas by csm is not going to work some of the more popular ideas are discussed by the csm in meeting and then either thrown out or supported but since a lot of them actually end up getting support  theyre good ideas after all   the csm risks ending up with a list the size of the features and ideas forum that wont be of any use to ccp perhaps the csm had better start thinking about ways to prioritize or generalize over this mess
what we really need are some kind of forum management tools i think once an issue thread has gotten csm advocacy and been raised at the council it could do with being locked or moved to some kind of archive sub forum it would also be nice to be able to see visually from the index which threads have been supported but these forumwish lists are already on our agenda and dierdra vaal composed a letter full of things wed like to see done in this respect while ank has advocated a specific issue around the problems with the current forum software just have to hope ccp forum programmers can be convinced to work on this stuff really
if theyre used like jade said  to push off items that have been dealt with  then theyre not prone to that kind of abuse nobodys opposed to getting threads that have been passed out of the way of new stuff
ah no they can be too easily abused
one should remember that the popular idea is not necessarily the good idea and vice versahowever you have a point that a way of marking out good ideas could have a use to sort through the deluge
214 responses  99 votes  3823 viewsof which 19 are votes from pvt alliance and who knows how many of their alts which would be naturally biased especially when told to vote for such a topicalso lots of opposition to your topic vs mostly unanimous voting in other topics id say they are doing wellexcept 4 and 8 which surprisingly are being pushed while jade supported both of them
i read that proposal and thought it died a natural death seemed to me that a lot more people were of a different opinion than the op as far as what constituted ownership honestly i thought it was a troll that just went awaywindjammer
this idea was passed on in the meeting 4 thread after a very pleasent meeting the general consensus was that the very good order during the meeting could be attributed to the change in moderator troughout the meetingit was thus suggested to look into making the chair rotating to some degreethe way i see it viable is this waywhen an issue is raised the owner of the issue will take over moderation duties all issues should thus have assigned an owner in advance eventually it could be agreed on by the council in advance whom should take moderation ownership of neutral issuesthe chairman that was elected should act as the overall moderator to make sure things go as planned things can get out of hand even for the moderator at any given issue thus its important that there is a failover moderator should it be the case that the discussion gets overheated without action taken on the part of the moderator at any given timethis means we have 2 layers of moderation remember we arent talking about things like muting here in this case its largely to do with making sure there is progress in the discussion and keeping the order of businesswhat do you guys think i think this could be a crucial step in order for the council to work as a team so i would really love to see this be looked upon
not wanting to nitpick on a generally good idea here but wouldnt this lead to haggling about who should own which issue
that is a good point most issues are raised by specific members so in those cases it wont be an issuethe only scenario i can see it being the case in issues which were picked by jade as being the most supported topics those issues doesnt have an owner per say jade could be considered the owner though worst case scenario
whatever you guys think would work best is good by me if ownership is a big deal split them up on your mailing list in advance
you seemed to handle chairing the fourth meeting pretty well and i was genuinely impressed with how you guys handled yourselves it gave me hope that this whole thing can be salvaged id say the rotation is a great idea as long as sanctions are brought to bear on people who abuse the chair and i think that should be determined by ccp apart from that great idea
this is an excellent ideaas for chosing it why not just say battleships primaries are in alphabetical order and go az
i dont see jade putting up with this after the showing of his true colors a while back good luck but ive lost faith i think the moderator should be a forum moderator or a member of isd
i like the idea a lot as it happens im very much for splitting up the role of inmeeting moderation so we all know how it works and the csm introducing an issue gets describe it call for debate answer questions and decide when to call for a vote i think this worked superbly in meeting 4 and ill be suggesting it again for meeting 5 as far as im concerned the less time we spend on procedural wrangling the better for everyone involved
ah my faith is being restored in this one
works for me want me to chair the next meeting and give jade a break assuming i can recover my eve playing computers epic fail  
works for me im completely cool with that
ordering by alphabetical order is one of the most disgusting undemocratic things i have ever had the misfortune to see in real life id rather not see it in game too
i personally have no problem with any chair or moderator provided people are able to speak without being subject to censorship i dont mean spamming farts farts farts but i also dont agree with heavy handedness such as slapping someone for disagreeing and saying so v0v i think this idea is just ducky provided everyone conducts themselves in a reasonable fashion
totally agree
i hardly see arazulachesis any more in combat

stopped at min bs5 crew

signedthe argument about hardest to train for  should be best sounds goodbut i would really like to see this1 give the naglfar 3 turret  and 3 missile hardpoints  argumentgives the pilots the option to train for either weapon system giving them options and also opening the doors a bit wider for minmatar pilots who want to train for them shortening the time it takes to train3 turret slots is pretty obvious split weapon system on a dread is just idiotic i cant see any reason for having one on a dreadgiving the option to use launchers as well follows the minmatar way of being versatile2 boost fittingsquote op

i stopped reading theregive us a break minny trolls youre still one of the two best pvp races in the game
terrible post spotted
i dont have a problem with the naglfar being the hardest to train for and arguably the worst its more the extreme difference between it and the other dreads it just cant even come close to the revelation in any aspect the only dread it beats in any aspect is the phoenix with its dps but even then the pheonix has twice the effective hp and 34 times the alphathank god you stopped reading at the end of my post im glad you took those few extra saved seconds to post this
what he said
setting up poss is quite possibly the most soul destroying thing i have ever done in a game to date i didnt login for days afterwards because when i did the pos was going to be sitting there mocking me
the way someone could possibly disagree with this is to have never set up a pos before
no its in favor of carebearificationif putting up pos is easier it will mean that pos spam is also easier 00 wars should be more about pvp and less about pos spam
i would agree with you twd but ccp put a hard limit on the number of towers you can erect in a system while i am not in favor of superior defenses springing up instantly on a tower the manual time in terms of sitting and doing nothing should be reduced this of course ignores the mind numbing time wasted on industrial towers this issue merits review being able to set up a configuration in queue  for example   would make the life hating experience of tower setup more tolerable
i dont know about any hard limit    there is only a 5 pos per day limit as far as i know
are you seriously suggesting that the best way to make pos spam unviable is to make it unenjoyable this is a video game the object of which is to entertain above all else
nah im saying that making the placement of pos easier than it is now  and making pos spam more viable   is bad for pvp in 00if its unenjoyable for you then i suggest to place less pos
so im guessing you didnt read the op then
yeah it happens to be that i read the op fully  this time  
so how about you tell me why any of the arguments ive raised are incorrect there are better ways to reduce pos spam than to make it souldestroyingly tedious
pos spam needs to be addressed in its own right and keeping them so horribly boring and tedious to put up is not a solution
the queuing idea makes the most sense to me yes setting up or changing the configuration of a pos should take significant amounts of time to complete but the souldestroying tedium is completely unnecessary i think almost anyone who has set up a deathstar or 12 would agree

you forgot the thumb icon
i support pos overhaul in all forms logistics when it comes to pos are really cumbersome  and i think ccp is coming up with fuel pellets systems and some other stuff anyway any pos improvements are ok in my book
i stay away from these things because they scare me
i can see the point twd is making  if you make something easier more people do it easier pos spamming will make for more pos spamminghowever this is something i dont think its right to fix in this way making a mechanic balance via being annoying or massively tedious or laggy i dont think is right in terms of game design it just means people do it and hate it insteadi would like to see pos spamming become a different part of territorial warfare but thats straying off topicid suggest queuing anchoring and onlining of modsanchoring having some impact on what level of parallelism you can do  and poses not being a key element of sovereignty claims  
any grinding in mmorpg should be fun anchoring poss is less fun than mining veldspar in a velator in 10
strongly supported
if it down from 24hrs to 12hrs at level 5definitely
definatly a decrease in timer i jc a lot from 00 to empire be it to mission or go shopping in jita it saves me a huge trip from 00 this could make things easier for people like me
only it should be sciencememory like all other science skills and require infomorph psychology v p
the exact values do need a bit of discussion but i wholeheartedly support this clonejumping once every twentyfour hours can be awfully restrictive and a means of reducing that would make a number of people happyi do prefer reduces jump clone turnaround time by 10 per level over two hours per level just because almost everything else in eve is based on percentages so it looks and feels a bit more internally consistentnumbers  based on 10 per level  aip 0 24 hoursaip 1 21 hours 36 minutesaip 2 19 hours 12 minutesaip 3 16 hours 48 minutesaip 4 14 hours 24 minutesaip 5 12 hours eventhe first couple levels dont get you much of anything  a couple hours   but aip3 is close to jump into an implant clone before you go to bed sleep go to work the next day get home from work jump back into a combat clone kill stuff repeat aip 4 and aip 5 make that quite feasiblethis could lead to a bit of overall inflation of characters skill points my implant clone is full of relatively expensive bits in a station far removed from any of my alliances current combat operations so jumping into that clone effectively removes me from combat for the next 24 hours if it were easier to do so  without the implicit penalty of you cant play eve tomorrow   i know id be jumping quite a bit more often once i had this proposed skill trained up to iii or iv a few hours with 3s and 4s would give me an extra few hundred skill points a day which would add up over the next year or twoi dont have a problem with that but some folks might

chribba is god and god must have capital miners on his shipand the lasers should twinkle with glitter to make them even more uber
i approve this idea however what i would really like to see is something that is a capital ship mines more than the hulk and is much bigger and tougher than the hulk perhaps instead of lasers it fires chains at asteroids and slowly drags them to an onboard grinder mechanism the asteroids would take a bit of time to reach the ship  200 ms perhaps   but when they do they would be instantly ground to a pulp
i completely disagree with your idea in its current form i would rather have it changed in one of these forms 1   create a skill that allows a 2 second delay in when you appear in local per level at lvl 5 it would give a 10 second delay and 2   create a ship that hides you from local for an additional 30 seconds however this ship would be the equivilent of a shuttle but the size of a cruiser  all that built in antilocal electronics are heavy   with no offense no defense and no way to cloak it would only be a scout
let me illuminate for the more dimwitted folk in this thread people are proposing that constellation not local is the main channel that is the 46 systems around you will all condense into one large local this means if a hostile in in the constellation you wont be able to tell where he is however youll see gatecamps long before you arrive to them and also youll see hostiles approaching more often than you would your reaction time goes up as you see them father out but their actual location is obfuscated blackops will gain purpose for bridging past gatecamped systems without them being sure if youve actually done it ratters will see that large gain inbound or even gatecamps ahead in the pipe depending on how the constellation is formedthis isnt a single faceted fix or nerf both sides will take a hit but gain from it overall i believe the game gains more than is restricted by this
no support local is fine just the way it is i wont bother to offer reasons for this your own goumindong  post 29 on page 1 of this thread   states the case welli will simply add that the change you propose benefits hunting packs at the expense of miners haulers and mission runners your assumption that defending pvpers would want to hang around these people on the off chance of intercepting pirates etc is self serving absurdity and would rarely happen save perhaps in the case of a large corp andor alliance ohlookyoure in a large corp andor alliance what a surprisewhats next nerfing cloaksthis is at least the second time this week that ive found myself in agreement with goumindong and its ing me off please coordinate your communications within goonswarm to avoid this in the future thank youwindjammer
i absolutely and fully believe this would be the single best change to the eve interface available  and im almost never in local lowsec00  
if you listen to anything goumindong says youre an idiot
this i didnt even think his post deserved a reply
agreed with the principle of altering local even if not necessarily exactly as the op suggest
this has many pros and consfrom a pvp standpoint it can be both the ability to move a sizable fleet practically undetected the con is the poor sods getting blobbedcon chinese farmers will find it easier to farm with little risk of detection  pro more secure transports through low secetc im sure we could carry on atm i cant think of any way to balance things but i will have a think more on it
dont completely remove it instead modify it here is my ideaeveryship will have a new kind of local scanner that will automaticaly shows player names  except cloaked ones see below   in the system much like local these scanners will have something like 20au range  a random number   in low sec and null secmake it so that cloaked ships shows as unidentified flying object this way youll know there is a cloaked ship but you wont know who it is cloaked ships should also have a scanning penalty  like 50 to 75 penalty on system scans   so they wont be overpoweredif someone types something into local they basically broadcasts a message across the solar system this way the chat function also protectedmake it so that every station and stargate has an inherent 100au range  again a random number   in high sec that will give the system info between each other and then to players like an information web this will ensure local will stays as more or less same in high sec as it is todaythats my 2 isks
normally id agree and thats whats ticking me off in this though he has the right of itwindjammer
youre telling me that the 30ms that a tempest has over other battleships compensates for having ridiculous weapon systems autocannons dont have the best dps or range or ammo usage theyre only used by amarrians because they cant figure out how to use lasers effectively with a tank  weakest is fine whatever but at least set it in line maybe you should visit the 10 page thread between liang and goumindong on why 1400s are outdone in every way capless means virtually nothing anywayanyway op supported as artillery is currently crapastro
while i have no unique or useful suggestions i did want to give my support in that i personally feel arty  and acs as well to a lesser degree   need to be looked atedit man its hard to remember to hit that i support button
i support the upgrade of the 1400mm arties the biggest issue as i see it is the amount of bullets in clip that are way lower than the other weapon types i would suggest increase the clip size so that it can take more shots per clip   i dont know if this is the right terminology i mean to increase the amount of shots before reloadingactually doubling it  another suggestion could be to increase the amount of bullets per clip only by 50 of current decrease rof and increase the damage to make the alpha more significant maintaining the same dps in the long runps i suggest this for all large arties
as if missing battleships that are moving at 100 ms at 100km range just because of the worthless tracking wasnt depressing enough in itself youll also be stuck on trying to reload in a couple barrages if theres any lag at all in system which combined effectively puts your dps somewhere around shit
ill take a this
wtb boost
more alpha and a bigger clip size would be nice i cant offer any ideas to actually balance it but it does really need to be looked at
as someone has said the problem lies with all arties oh and as were on it could we please have a third range of artillery guns to bring it in line with the other races range of guns availableas a note artillery needs revising as you need so many modules to compensate for the lack of rangetracking and locking range you completely fail to fit any kind of tankbuffer as all other bss can do while still outranging and outdpsing the minmatar bs line of ships which is kind of sad and of course you need fitting mods to fit a full rack of 1400mm arties yet it doesnt include the ability to fill up the remaining 2 highslots of a tempest
very much supportedalpha trix
i only really want 2 changes at the moment give us back our alpha strike  minmatar dont really have anything special here anymore increase the tracking to be similar to say the slowest tracking equivilant compeditors gunsi do have a suggestion of how alpha strike could be improved i got this after reading someone elses suggestion of burst fire when an arty is activated for the first time it fires 2 shots  20x the current alpha   it then fires as per usualthis may be over powered so penalties such as waiting longer for normal fire to resume or having each of the first 2 shots only do 75 of their normal damage so they have 15x the alpha
not sure how i missed this threadsigned 100 times

op definitely supported the tempest is currently the worst fleet sniper due to 1400s and was hit the hardest by scripting you cannot have any kind of a hp buffer without dropping your optimal with tremor under 140 add in the 75 tracking penalty of tremor and you cant effectively hit a cruiser hull at that range if its moving
gief boost plz
so you want the same tracking as other guns or better but you also want to keep a dps edge that seems very fair to people using railslasers because it would be so fair for single minmatar battleships to be able to doublealpha for 10000 what an idiotic idea im saying no until you give hybrids and lasers overpowered activated abilities of their own
if by dps edge you mean lowest dps of all long range turrets then yes it is fairyeah its not like extreme alpha is supposed to be characteristic of arty or anything and its not like hp has been boosted to the point where the effectiveness of artys alpha strike would need to be reexamined
minmatar battleships are laughable at the moment any sort of buff to either large projectile guns or the ships themselves would help
it hasnt been boosted to that point 6k alpha is fine for now and 10k would be idiotic and overpowered in fleet battles boost overall dps a little if you must and clip size fine but you cant have both superior dps and tracking i know your little mind struggles with this concept but there is such a thing as considering how buffs will affect other races
say it with me artillery have the worst dps of long range turretssee how hard that wasnt
im not as talented as you are at lying in fact i dont really even like it anyway clearly logic is not going to dissuade you go whine with your goon csms some more

in fact i tend to believe that noone at ccp itself uses nonwindows clients in any way whatsoever you know whyscreenshots are still broken and the amount of data generated by the log options is just a very very bad joke i cant spare a terabyte for a game session it starts by forceinstalling the client into cedega     and goes over graphics card drivers being blamed for crude bugs in the directx layer to utter incompetence regarding multiplatform supporti guess they should just license the directx layer from cedega and build a native client using it
possible solution talk to codeweavers theyre already officially supporting eve and all improvements made by codeweavers go back into wine winwinwin imho

unfortunately the only thing ccp seems to care about is the status quo as evidenced by the removal of player notifications in logserver output to break programs such as bacon im for any improvements and customizations to the ui and just because ccp thinks that its fine doesnt mean the playerbase agrees

i know i just want to get a momentum going where all those who are involved in t2 bpo issue can get behind  and actually do something positive like elicit a proper dev response other than we do not have current plans to remove them at fanfest appreciate the support
supporting this
supporting for the lulz
i support the unban of this guy he helped in improvment of the qos of this game in a sence truth was revealed in real life the law punishes who reveals personal data unless this serves the common good i think in the case of  we have the perfect example of the above
its a request to review not to unban 1
okwhat the hell i hope that  is never allowed to play this game again as for what i have read i get the impression that all he was doing is griefing players whether they are gms or not it doesnt matteri say f him and f this threadnot supported if you are so against ccp and this game dont play it and go else where where the devs and gms are angels and hand you the game on the plateoh and the csm does not have any right or should have the powers to get bans lifted and if they ever do i will campaign for the csm to be removed because they are players with their own interests they are not impartial
so outing gms who do nothing wrong and spoiling the game for them because he wants to be unbanned is for the common good how i agree that if someone is doing something wrong they should be brought to the attention of the law however the player base is not the law they are the rabble the great unclean the law is ccp comparison to real life  because you did   you suspect that someone is a kiddie fiddler but dont have absolute proof would you go to the police or would you go to the sun newspaper  any form of media outlet   with a picture of the bloke and say that he is a naughty man and that he should be strung upif the person is and you go to the police then he gets arrested and tried by the law however if go to the newspaper first you could damage the the case and it could mean that he gets off because of a technicalityif the person isnt and you go to the police the matter gets investigated and the charges dropped thats all good however if you go to the newspaper with this then and you ruin this guys life because after investigation it turns out he has done nothing wrong what have you done you have ruined an innocent mans life  that sort of stuff never comes off   and also screwed yourself over because he can now sue you for damagesoh and serving the common good can only be seen in hindsight as what one person thinks is serving the common good may not actually be serving the common good but actually just serving their own goodand finally its ccps game and we pay to play it there are no lawsrules to say that they have to let anyone play it because we say so
the last thing eve needs is more emo tinfoilhattery not supported
every time i got to some outside forum where players discuss mmo games in general if someone wants to  on eve they bring up the whole t20 scandal and say how t20 was never fired but ccp banned the player who discovered that he abused his gm powers and spawned bpos for himself for no good reason so there they state the game is rigged and there is no reason to start playing eveso either unban the guyorgive a good reason for him being banned because im getting tired of trying to defend it when someone brings up t20 thing again
this case is very different from other cases however as kugu did not break any ingame or eula rules editspelling
supported ive never been happy with this
hi thats not why he was banned thnx have a nice day
why was he banned then
im not going into detail because last folks i know who did could no longer post on the forums that being said he cought a gm creating t2 bpos and them being used in game hense the whole coalition thing this was before invention mind you he did uncover another gms acount later after he was banned i wont go into details on that either if you want to read him goto kugus websight you can find it in google all the stuff is there at no point did he break any ccp rules doing it either they banned him for a general eula section of basically costing ccp moneyedit i might actualy be off they might just delete the posts i cant remember happend so long ago
can ccp point us to some thread where the official reason this guy was banned is explained not generic explanations like he violated the eula but in specific what was the exact rule of eula he violated
hahaha thats funny man   you wont find that on these forums he posted a copy of the banning on the sight if i remember right
i believe the exact reasoning comes down to ccp banned kug for creating additional work load for ccp employees what this is referring to is the manner in which he revealed the t20 information and the threadnought and disabling of the forums that followed this information being public
no you still dont get it the exact same item  in terms of market tab attributes and so on even if its a separate item for reprocessing purposes   but obtained from different blueprints needing other typesamounts of materialsso right now you have only a caldari shuttle blueprint  mark i which under perfect conditions needs 2500 tritanium to build one caldari shuttle that reprocesses into 2500 tritanium in the future you could have a caldari shuttle blueprint  mark ii which under perfect conditions needs say 500 tritanium plus 625 pyerite to build one caldari shuttle  for all intents and purposes not related to reprocessing identical to the caldari shuttle from the mark i blueprint   that would reprocess either into the same 500 trit  625 pye  in case you keep separate item ids but somehow merge them in the market tab   or into the original 2500 tritanium personally i prefer this second option no separate ids and reprocessing into mark i version if at allthe base value of trit is 2 isk per unit pyerite 8 so the base price of a shuttle  via mark i blueprint   is 5000 isk the alternative mark ii blueprint needs a base value of 6000 isk in minerals but is still only worth the same 5000 isk for insurance purposes and in case no separate ids are used at all refines into same 5000 isk of base value of materials even if the base value of minerals you used in its construction was 20 higherand this is just the simplest example using only one single alternative build methoddepending on ship race size module type or anything else the manufacturing alternatives could follow some clear rules of replacement  how much percentage of what mineral value converted in what other mineral value and so on   as long as some form of replacement is available for most items and covers  overall   all possible mineraltomineral replacementsps it doesnt even have to be this way for ships especially since you have the reprocessing issues that can lead to pretty nasty sideeffects this part of the proposal works a lot better with nonrefineables  ie t2 components  
no i do actually understand that version of your reasoning but its a waste of database as i said it just makes miners make slightly different choices or mission runers do differnt stuff with thier drops or market players hedge different commodities look face reality insurance will be nerfed long before ccp would entertain your perceived problem and its cure why well its a overall reduction in server load whilst your idea increaces server load as it requires lots of code to implement and space to store etc an insurance nerf also would render all you say invalid as the alledged base price would cease to exist like its cap which went when npc reprocessable goods began dissappearing the free market would take over and the real value of minerals would be shown and maybe the roid belts and drop ratiositems will be tweaked by dr e and ccp to restore time  risk  reward balance in all 3 sec lvls to whats apporiatebasically in its crudest terms all your saying is lets make stuff with what ever  and slow the server down   while making a new sink for minerals to fall into when reprocessing a percentage of stuff
this is the best and probally only peice of inspiration ive seen in 12 pagesmeta lvl t2 bpc chances when inventing could be a way to acheive alternative compositionattribute blueprints and thereby broarden the material requirements of both roid and moon derived materials and minerals it could be tied into faction warfare rewardslvl 5 rd agent datacores lots of things over and above basic skill books which would broadern players opportunities for fun and profit it also is something that newer players can strive for and older players can expliot until there caught up to reduces t2 prices and creates premium meta lvl items that tech 2 bpo holders have no advantage over all addition server load with this idea actually adds new content too at every stage its not the same stuff but diffferent but not different stuff idea of the op
signed
slow a database down a by significant amount by adding a few more rows to a table  he didnt say he wanted to duplicate every bpo in existance just t2 components  you might as well argue that ccp should not accept new players since they will slow the servers downtrue to your name as alwaysalso you dont actually have to duplicate db entries just have a universally applicable procedure like turn 50 of trit requirements into pyerite for this particular manufacture job
waste of database space  as in out of the multiple tb of data the game has adding a couple of hundred  or even thousands for that matter   static data types of blueprintsreactions that would actually make a diffeence  don make me laughand that would be a bad thing because  yeah right you dont have an explanation to thatinsurance has nothing to do with those ratios insurance only has something to do with absolute price levels even if you completely remove insurance things wont get better theyd only get worse as in lowends will become increasingly more profitable and highends decreasingly less profitableyou have zero idea of what youre talking about lots of code to implement  how about next to zero code to implement  and how about negligible space to store  no the base price would become zero thats what would happen the only remaining things will be just how low everybody is willing to go in regards of iskhour mining or missioning compared to how high theyre willing to go for ships all t1 item prices will crash quite nasty but not enough to stop it from rendering pvp a lot less attractivethe free market will do next to squat you know what will happen  veldspar will become the most valuable ore to mine in terms of iskhour even in deep 00 as prices of minerals obtainable from drone loot drops and missionrunning loot reprocessing  especially zydrine and megacyte   take a huge drop alongside pyerite  heavily featured in mission loot too   with tritanium being the most overrated minerall overallthat is the real value of minerals in terms of where is it cheapest to get fromthere needs to be some form any form of negative feedback for each mineralmaterial pair so that as soon as one gets too much more  or less   valuable than the intended ratios there is some kind of backward pressure to restore the initial ratiothis does not eliminate absolute price fluctuations it doesnt eliminate relative price fluctuations either it just makes it increasingly difficult for prices to get past a certain relative level no matter what other conditions we might have in the game world
re read what the op said plz they bought up shuttles which dont happen to be t2 do they a bpo called shuttle ii is an additional line they cost more and are also worth less  reprocess   and that undermines thier utilityok so slow the server down may be so slight you may not notice it it all adds up eventually all that is added is a new bpo that generates additional buy and sell orders for them it also reduces availability of science and industry lines as more competition for them it doesnt matter how much of whatever is comsumed making the good database wise does it as they already exist in the game and already have their buysell order lines etc adding a duplicate item therefore adds a greater database load for no real phyical end benifit the item could have been made at a different price using existing methods thats the mechanic of the game and the real world the substitution is a duplication as no addition attributes are held by the goodsyou may notice that i elaborate the t2 bpc modification above which is a good idea they could use difering amounts of existing materials without which actually gives a far great effect to the game for the same amount of effort it deals with over supplied minerals and reactions to a degree for inputs and it undermines tech 2 bpo holders advantage by offering a meta lvl version of a tech 2 item as they have to use the bpc route to get them far more of a win win dont you agreeyes its small scale effects only high end players but the risk reward ratios will always be broken because its a game and people sell at well below cost at times as they dont put a value on thier time or datacores etc thats because its a game understand its for fun not making shed loads of isks anyone however can take advatage and turn a profit by becoming a factor for such goods if you can cover your losses buy what you want when you want having 500 trillion isk doesnt add to the fun of the game it just makes wannabe captialst slave owners get an erection
a most important issue
akita tcost benifitthey  new bpos and associated items as outlined above   are calls for no purpose the good already exist additional load for no real benifit apart from market regulation but yes its very slight jita will be 1 nano sec later but it is an effect none the less they are less attractive to the market as imput cost is higher and reprocessing value is lower  than existingdid i say changing ppls behaviour is bad nope i did not i said it would change i gave no comment on what type of change it would be or the effects on the individuals you have assumed something from nothing the implication is yours alone from my nuetural observationratios are set by market availabity and customer demand across the board yes removal of insurance will make the free market take over you have stated that you like free markets not communist coops that are regulated but you now admit that you dont want to have a free market as prices will change in ways that may cause chaos in game but whats a little choas in a sandboxits cost benifit  impact on game storage costs money cpu cycles costs money bandwidth costs money writing code costs money testing that code costs money deploying it costs money if it can be done better and cheaper they will they want the greatest effect for the lowest price they run a business too you knowprices will never be zero unless everyone stops being greedy stops blowing other ppl up etc you fail with that straw man its a totally bogus argument a better one would have been a market crash and re adjustment to eve perceived values which would hurt lots of people while enriching others at thier expense but having it otherwise is communism isnt itlol you dont understand a free market and why you have never lived in one its a nasty nasty place the amarr mixed with the caldari stories are loose demonstrations of what a free market will acheive  mega corps and thier elites and slaves with a hint of religon to make it palatable and soothe the soul  veldspar may be best iskhr but only until miners exploit it and drive the price down as i said the risk reward time ratio can be tweaked by roid and loot manipulation 15 less chance of npc loot would have a greater effect than what you propose
i agree
definately need adjustment to minerals to make ores have correct riskreward nocx needs a boost trit needs a downgrade in price i would recommend adjusting drone drops by replacing nocx with trit in some of the drone alloysas to moon metals i think the exploration system could bring additional supplyi would also love to see moon metal hauler spawns if they carry mins around why not moon metals
supportedthe current moon materials market is getting increasingly like the t2 bpo monopolise of old those with the moons have the resources to do as they please with the market but the rest of the market suffers it would be ok if other lower end moons where less profitable but still profitable but the extreem value of a few moons is badly unbalancing industry atmim not sure what the solution is persoanly but i would like to maybe see the demand for rare resources fall and lower end ones increase like the way you need a great deal of tirtanium to build a battleship so that those with low end moons or doing processing of moon materials have the ability to turn some sort of profit whilst those who worked for the high ends still enjoy a high value for those assetsthis is my personal view and is not indicative of any views heled by my alliance or corperation
whats most amusing by this turn of events is that akita predicted the bottle neck would be moved to moon minerals instead of where it was  read bpos   before the advent of inventionand id have to go looking but im pretty sure akita also predicted which t2 moon mins would be the bread winnersthis is what brainless bimbo is missing the only true influence anyone has in totality over the market is ccp we players think we have a free market but we still play within the guided and fenced areas that ccp sets
made that prediction so long ago i have trouble finding the post myself of course back then i had no idea just how skewed the demandsupply ratios for moon materials were so i considered it a desirable change it would still be ok if the ratios of demand in products would be  inversely   proportional to scarcity of material not the current situationa possibility  actually make that most likely   would be that i made that prediction in the nowdeleted forum subsection that handled kali prerelease issues  the codename for revelations   so youd only be able to find those posts on evesearchedit hmm not there either just checked
the problem with ores in the op is not actually a problem  price fluctuations are not a bad thing ore prices are relatively reasonable now the highsec ores are worth about 6090 isk per m3 lowesc are 60100 and 00 are 130450 lowsec needs a boost ive suggested putting gneiss dark ochre and spodumain in scannable belts to up the lowsec peak to about 220   but the 51 ratio between bistot and veldspar is just fine they have value in proportion to their rarity and difficulty of access and ores with similar availability are pushed to similar prices for obvious reasons i dont think loot refinement has yet managed to meet the demand for any mineral though i dont have data to back that up   so there shouldnt be any bottomingout going on because of it also ill specifically say no to alternate blueprints  i dont want to deal with the astoundingly large headaches that would cause as for moons im open to moon concentration being expanded upon because the current system is both too unbalanced and too hardlimited for my liking i dont know exactly what the right fix is but there does seem to be a problemedit one thing i forgot to mention calling this a critical issue is a filthy lie
akita t has been around a lot longer than i her prediction of a new bottleneck with moon materials would replace the t2 bpo monolopy isk printing press was known to ccp before they even anounced kali if they didnt the game designer wasnt doing his job remember we dont know the long story do we ccp devs are reading this thread laughing at our squabling have you noticed that they are recovering the story line regarding the amarr succession that went astray  lolz   so they got a long term plan albeit sketcky and flexiable but they arent flying by the seat of thier pants there are so many ways that the moon material bottleneck inducing market issue can be solved but it has to adhere to an over all concept and add a lot to the game play in a radically diferent and rewarding way for evryone for it to divert attention to the next build in bottle neck which is there to replace it bottlenecks have to exist in the game control of criticial items drives game play for that not to happen makes the game carebear central if high end moon minerals werent a premium they would lose the value needed to drive alliance conflict high end moon materials just got a boost more is available in black rise so supply has increaced in high ends but the alliances set the price and availability of high end minerals and control the bottleneck if ccp can see that its politically engineered why should they act its part of the player driven content ffs
it was well before kali had sections dedicated to it and at that point invention was just a glimmer in some devs eye done on a blog or some suchin any event tbe best solution is to create a better ratio of moon minerals for t2 components and then also include alternate prints that mirror say the locales in spacefor instance northern regions are heavy gas but in the end with the right prints can produce the same thing southern regions are metal heavy but again with the right prints can produce the same thingin this regard no single location has complete control and bottle neckwith regard to ores the solution is simple and has been presented nine hundred times over eliminate insurance and eliminate high end minerals from loot drops
do you mean eliminating insurance entirely or just its pricefixing aspect and if its the former why as for loot drops loot drops are items and refine as such what youre suggesting is to remove highend minerals from all item blueprints and thats crazy

after ready this topic for the last three days  yes i am a slow reader   i dont claim to be an expert but most of the suggestions seem complicated my idea for the mineral debate would be to ad a new elite class of veldspar that refined into more tritanium and only spawned in lowsec and 00reasoning i see is 00 would not need as much of the highsec mined trit and for lowsec it would be more reward vs risk to mine it in lowsec

i am not the most eloquent person out there so i will post this as best as possible so that everyone can form their own opinioni believe the pilgrim needs to be looked at for balancing issues of all the force recons it is completely outside the box first i will do a comparison of the recons to get a feel of why the pilgrim should be looked at to be fixed to be more in line with the rest of the force reconsminmatarthe hugin which is the combat recon receives bonuses as such 25 medium projectiles rof 375 target painter effectiveness 300 web range and 25 to heavy ham and assault launcher rof the rapier which is the force recon receives bonuses as such 25 medium projectile rof 375 target painter effectiveness 300 web range and 96  100 reduction cloaking cpu role bonus 80 reduction liquid ozone use and 50 reduction in cyno field durationcaldarithe rook which is the combat recon receives bonuses as such 50 reduction ecm cap use 100 ecm optimal 100 ecm strength 25 heavey and light kinetic missile damagethe falcon which is the force recon receives bonuses as such 50 reduction ecm cap use 100 ecm optimal 100 ecm strength and 96  100 reduction cloaking cpu role bonus 80 reduction liquid ozone use and 50 reduction in cyno field durationgallentelachesis which is the combat recon receives bonuses as such 25 medium hybrid turret damage 25 remote sensor dampener effectiveness 100 warp disruptor range and 25 heavy missile launcher and assault missile launcherarazu which is the force recon receives bonuses as such 25 medium hybrid turret damage 25 remote sensor dampener effectiveness 100 warp disruptor range and 96  100 reduction cloaking cpu role bonus 80 reduction liquid ozone use and 50 reduction in cyno field durationamarrcurse which is the combat recon receives bonuses as such 25 tracking disruptor effectiveness 50 bonus drone hit points and damage 200 nos and neut range and 100 bonus to nos and neut ammountpilgrim which is the force recon receives bonuses as such 25 tracking disruptor effectiveness 50 bonus drone hit points and damage 100 bonus to nos and neut ammount and 96  100 reduction cloaking cpu role bonus 80 reduction liquid ozone use and 50 reduction in cyno field durationthe first thing you will notice is that the pilgrim is the only force recon that loses its range bonus the range of the regular t2 medium nos and neut is 12 km this means that to be in range to use this specialized cap weapon you have to also be in close combat range web range and scram range forcing the pilgrim into a niche role of the only recon that must be in close range to use all of its bonuses before the nos nerf this was ok as it could nos a target to fuel any tank it may field since the nos nerf use of nos to fuel a tank is no longer a viable option since the pilgrim must be in nos and neut range to fight it must have some sort of tank at this time it does not have an effective tank the pilgrim is thus at a huge disadvantage compared to any other recon ship at largei believe that to bring it in line with the other recon there are two viable options
option 1since the pilgrim is a drone boat as well as a recon it would seem to me that it needs to do its damage with drones since its highs would be taken up with nos and neuts so it utilizes its bonuses i suggest removing the drone bonus but increasing the bandwidth to 125mb so that it can field heavy drones similar to the ishtar  without a dmg bonus   and replacing the drone damage bonus with a bonus for its tank since it must fight in close range to use all its bonuses either increase its armor resists similar to a mauller at 5 per level or increase its armor amount similar to the navy issue augoror at 10 per level this would allow the pilgrim to field a decent tank and survive long enough to use its bonusesoption 2remove the drone damage bonus since all the other combat recons have one damage bonus removed and let the pilgrim retain the range bonus this would allow the pilgrim to remain in line with the rest of the combat and force recons letting it use all of the bonuses it has been given at a safe range however the pilgrim would no longer be able to do any damage to speak of which may upset some people one fix would be to go with the idea i put in option 1 and increase the drone bandwidth a bit so the pilgrim could field larger dronesi have flown the pilgrim quite a bit and have some experience with it i am by no means an expert with the pilgrim but i do like the option to fly a semicombat ship that can warp cloaked at the moment its only viable against noobs who dont know what they are doing and against a very select line of ships any missile boats passive tanks or wellskilled pilots will defeat a pilgrim pilot simply due to the pilgrim having to be in close combat range where it cant take the damage while effectively using all of its bonuses as can other force reconthank you for reading please feel free to leave your comments and suggestions as i know this isnt the end all be all and there are probably much better ideas and suggestions than what i have come up withplease dont forget if you support this thread to click that suport box when posting a reply to show your supportczy4rr on ps and yes i did have my girlfriend proofread this so i didnt sound like a complete idiot

i agree the pilgrim needs a boost but not via any of your suggested options you came close to what we really need but you never quite hit it here it is option 3 replace its amount bonus with a range bonus but keep all other aspects the same this would bring it in line with the other force recons  except the falcon   in the way that they get range bonuses but lose out on one of the effectiveness bonuses this would not obsolesce the curse as the curse would retain an extra mid slot and have a much higher neuting potential it would however make the pilgrim viable in gangs or solo as it is its lucky to kill a cruiser and in gangs the curse far outperforms it
pilgrim certainly needs something
signedpilgrim needs some love since the problem was first posted  by hydrogen   nearly 8 months and roughly 30odd pages of support still no word from ccp
ccp needs to make the pilgrim worth flying rapier  great asset for our gangfalcon  great asset for our gangpilgrim  do you have any other ship you can bring
i agree just looking at its bonuses compared to the others it needs boosting
no need to say anything
ask jade he makes a big issue out of this telling we are the ones that made that site
it has more to do with judgment jade has a long history of terrible judgment this brothel being one of the more funny incidents what makes it better is heshe continues to lie denying he was involved this was hosted on his server until a couple weeks ago
dear lord im shocked and not in the way youd imagine who gives a ing  about some persons rping and who cares if they profit from it or make some people uncomfortable if you dont like the content dont go to the site people rp all sorts of crap if given the opportunity a  is probably better than a murderer  though im sure most rping people in this game do rp murderers   whats your pointalso how does one rationalize that someones rp can affect the way theyd take the game remember that hes just one guy there are nine total members in order to do something weird to the game  like adding a space brothel   a majority of the council members would have to agree ccp would have to agree and a large proportion of the player base would have to agree what the hell are you afraid of
my bet would be on cooties
you did you downloaded the files from my server  you registered a domain called jadeconstantineweb and rehosted my files there you made that site at that urlthat took some effort on the part of goonfleet maybe we should be asking why you botheredi said on shc it seemed like you were hosting some kind of creepy stalker tribute site since you youve used my character name to make a domain and seem to find it amazingly fascinating and thats exactly what it is  its a celebrity stalker thing  you must be proud seriously that old la maison site was there for what best part of 5 years characters listed there included miso dbpreacher lianhaun charity regard josephine and others they were damn famous players back in year on and the idea of a chat channel that was like the bar in casablanca where different sides got to play ic politics while pouring drinks and flirting was always pretty big news we used to recruit for events there we arranged the elariel pleasure gardens security detail there  jf used to announce all its best wars there i remember having virtual drinks with robeyone and halseth durn on the eve of the gnw there and thats history i mean not sure what im supposed to be embarrassed about really heh i notice you goonfleet guys are completely up with a guy who likes to roleplay being a slave master of matari prisoners maybe its just gf are closet goreans then but what it really shows is just how sad goonfleet is to try to make an issue over something like this shows you dont have a clue about eve history and you really dont know when your little campaigns of demonization are actually alienating you guys rather than your chosen targetfunny
wow goonies just patheticget back to geminate and fight us instead of wasting time with this bullwhen i started eve and was reading about the beginnings of the goonbob war i almost rooted for the goonsafter having to hear your  so much for so long i obviously joined the gbc and proceeded to kill youthis is what your bull does it alienates people who would have otherwise been sympatheticgo back to second life and make it rain dildos and get the hell out of evejade forever down with goonie es
with all this ducking  weaving you would have been an excellent boxer
why are you so bitter
i definitely agree with jade and thats why i voted for hergoonies and the other big boys only play this game to grief others with combat and ruin everyone elses fun they completely miss the finer points of eve  the excellent playground it is to rp our spaceborne fantasies people like me and jade are lucky to have a game and an rp background that allows us to transcend the gender that a capricious god gave us at birth to become the seductive witty politicallysavvy spacetemptresses that we really are on the insidepersonally i cant wait until ambulation when ill have not just a pretty portrait to go with my flirty witty chat but an entire  and entirely lovely   body hopefully with customizable clothes  or not       and plenty of cute emotes i plan to set myself up in a salon orbiting the galente homeworld and sip spacewine while being courted by my noble suiters what a joy it will be to play the game the way i want to play it and not bother with all the ugly combat and rude griefersand dont think im alone  there is a reason that jade got the most votes out of all the candidates after all i think that ladies like myself are a silent majority in eve and we definitely deserve to have our views represented on the council we need a voice and a strong hand that will shape this game to meet its greatest potential for the kind of play that so many of us enjoy  need   so muchso in conclusion keep up the good work jade shine on you crazy diamond
hi darius
i dont get it theres proof but hes still saying its false
i dont use alts stupid you obviously know nothing about my eve history
ill give a free crow interceptor to the first person in this thread that posts why i think its your alt with relevant forum quotes
step it up to a free cyber and ill take you up on it
v0v think all you want its your prerogative i find it mildly amusing that youd think for a second that id feel the need to hide behind an alt to mock you
i am against the purpose of this thread i dont see what is the problem with something that after all promotes rp rp which is a rarity anyway i think some people are getting too puritans as of late i dont see anything wrong of a rping brothel in eve in fact such actions add some spice to the game if you dont like it you may very well not partecipate if you really need a holy purpose go after the macro farmers and let the very few rpers be
it wasnt actually a brothel you know  but the thoughts appreciated nonetheless
posting to become famousi fully support rp brothels in all honesty i dont think it matters what jade or any csm has done in eve to this point but what they will do as a csm
yall had better not push jade it looks like hes getting pretty closetothaedge
at this rate hell hit super saiyan before iceland
hes gathering the spirits of every whiny pedantic pansexual nerd into himselfhe is forming a whiningbomb
jade is awesome glad i voted for him and would do it again
asmuch as i think jade should step down i honestly dont think what he does in his rp matters and if your so shocked by a shim being a rp sm bordello or whatever you really need to open your eyes more and if you that uncomfortable with it ya better get out of mmo not suported as its to lame however i still support removal of jane from the chair for past behavior in meeting that do affect the outcome of the csm and my representation to ccp
i agree
oh noes cybering in an online game what is the internet coming toi mean really its ok to consistently and happily pod other pretend human beings whilst feeling good about yourself but not ok to engage in this   everyone calls this a sandbox
whilst the csm and jade in particular continues with its current antics  i dont think you have to worry about ccp taking it seriously
this is a horrible idea and its not surprising that its received almost zero support outside jades space buddies i ask the council representatives to look at the number of posts in this thread calling the idea stupid vs the number of support votes and accordingly vote to not escalate this to the csm platform
i am completely against this idea we work years to acquire wealth and prosperity and if real life calls for an extended leave of absence during a war that results in the loss of the outpost you have lived in for years you lose everything you have in eve i would refuse to start over with nothing to my name i value my time and that results in value for in game possession the way outposts are now is fine there are several ways to evacuate items out of captured stations and that is how it should be losing so much would disvalue eve as a whole it already has a huge risk vs reward theme and does not need to be all risk and no reward
voting no
destructible outposts in and of itself is not a bad idea but your proposed implementation is nothing short of garbage not supported
its already been escalated by a 72 vote of the csm
good to see
jita 44 is down i repeat jita 44 is down if we can get in empire to i see no reason not to i mean i would sack 6 freighters to suicide the station
nothing says trolling like making people quit eve due to losing all their assets while i believe this is one of the dumbest ideas presented by someone who knows nothing about 00 goonswarm is known for its griefing still going to say this is a horrible idea though the last thing we need is to scare off more newcomers to 00 why jade has such a strong opinion of this when his alliance will never come out to 00 is beyond me maybe hes jealous of all that moon mining
this idea makes me laugh but only because of how absurd it truly isthen again the idea of a corp gathering enough firepower to wipe 00 clean of outposts is appealingstill voting no
im laughing at how this was ever thought to be a good idea
terrible idea jade doesnt even do 00 stuffif you are going to make suggestions about how 00 warfare should work you should probably have some experience in it
heh hardly i think sf has access to more isk than youll ever see little goonie but seriously behind your trolling is a real point at the moment 00 is a one dimensional setting only way you can upset a territorial power is by becoming a territorial power only way you hurt an outpost owner is by becoming one and thats bad for the game  its a lack of variety in the endgame still csm voted 72 to escalate and we get to ask ccp what they think thats what i promised to aim for in my election campaign and im very happy that eve will get to hear the answer to the question in the op maybe theyll say no bad idea and agree with you if so at least we tried cant say fairer than that asking the question was a decent idea and while a couple of dozen frenzied anti posters and their alts here disagree a couple of thousand actual voters agreed during the election and 79 csm reps confirm the validity of the issue shows the process works
this will be brilliant i cant wait to grief more pubbies out of this game after they have lost everything they ownjade you are the best csm dictator to date
still cant get that bitter taste at failing at 00 out of your mouth jade
kill everyone
not entirely sure what you mean there 00 for me means fat territorialist pigs to shoot  thats why our alliance plays the game its hardly failing when every time we come out we shoot some more regressive dogs is it i think youre taking this game too seriously mr goon
it makes a good point goons can have fun our way and it can have fun its way
that being the main reason you do not want to mess with t2 bpos you only have what around 86
yeah theres just a slight logical disconnect thereoutposts are unfair because they hinder the ability of new players to break into 00nerfing t2 bpos is unfair because people have worked hard for them and taking that away to help out newbies with invention is a bad ideaso jade you want to help nonpower bloc players into 00  not being part of a territorial power yourself   but youre happy with the advantages of the t2 bpo holders  being part of an economic power yourself  seems awfully selfish to me
horrible idea how does making it harder for empire players to move out to 00 serve the eve community i hope that all members of the csm give jade a napalm enema for proposing this moronic idea further more id suggest that matters regarding 00 come from players who have actual 00 experience
newer smaller alliances trying to get a foothold will be in trouble at one point anyway if they dont align with one of the current power blocks i think this is an excellent idea
hear hear
people were voting for csm representatives not csm chair
how would it invalidate the election op is asking for a vote to remove him from the chair and we the constituants agree or disagree not asking for a removal from the csm it boils down to this he muted and in doing so denied a csm to vote intentional or stupidity of how the channel moderation worked he still did itthe csm in question had asked jade not to editorialize  sp   and was told they were being disruptive sort of a how dare you deny my autority to do as i plse when a csm asked why they were being warned rather then explain how it was a disruption and muted when the call from the floor was made to explain the disruption again the how dare you question my authority had he comein said yes i was wrong and i shall conduct myself in a more professional manner and applogized to the csm this would have blown over alas he didnt and has let this blow way way beyond repair on top of all that he insults his constituancy even more by calling them nonfactors as they are all goons and goonswarm which many infact are not myself included
jade even if everyone agreed with you 100 on the issues youd still be a bad chair because youre trying to give the chair too much power imagine someone really horrible becomes your successor a democratic council of equals would thwart their attempted reign of terror this borderline dictatorship youre setting up where the chair chooses who can speak  what issues may be raised is only going to enable it your continued power grabs show either that you completely lack foresight or that youre purposely trying to harm the csms long term viability whichever it is you shouldnt be chairalso im surprised so many goons have signed this thread given that with their numbers theyre the most likely to be able to win the chair in the next elections  benefit from all of the extraordinary powers jades trying to give the position are you guys just too add to wait 6 months or are you all secretly gigantic fans of democracy  supporters of the little guy
in a normal parliamentary body the chair is generally a nonvoting position the csm was set up with more of a chairlite where the chairpersons sole additional responsibility over a normal representative is to draw up the agenda for meetings but still retains voting rights jades blatant disregard for this original intention is reason enough to request removalsupported
simple answer is no ive said a couple of times in the course of this thread only way this could conceivably happen is 1 a csm rep decides to support and advocate this issue after its been in discussion for 7 days 2 csm rep puts it on the agenda for a meeting 3 during the meeting it needs a 59  47   votes to pass and become an issue for the formal conference between csmccp4 supporting csm would write it up as a submission document and wed discuss the measure with the ccp council 5 what happens then nobody really knows because we have no idea if ccp are happy to have the choice of the electorate overturned by a motion supported by a tiny fraction of the votes cast in the main electionbut its all a little academic since this thread hasnt received the 5 of the electorate vote required to force it onto the csm meeting agenda and it hasnt been supported and advocated by a csm rep at the moment its like a protest thing from angry goons really thats becoming a bit pointless because literally everyone else has already gotten over it and moved on through a very productive meeting in midweek and expectation of another one on sunday
absolutely
i suspect well end up deciding to go for a rotating chair or even ask ccp to supply us with a ccpprovided non voting chair to do the admin to be honest there is no advantage to having an empowered chair in any way this whole argument was about the definition of moderation and got compounded by a desire to finish completing issues in a time crunch remove the time pressure and moderation stops being an issue because if meetings fail to get absolutely everything done  it wont matter so much anyway contrary to the fears of the goons on this thread im really pretty relaxed about the role of chair in this csm progress im happy to see it rotating see moderation and admin duties shared or whatever else can be agreed on single best idea anyone has come up with in the last week was saphrine who suggested putting the admin stuff at the end of the agenda not the begin that solves so many problems its silly we didnt think of it in the first place
1 it needs to be replaced

you suck get a lifel gtfoim for jade btw goons suck
jade just out of curiosity whatever happened to you stepping down from chair and letting the csm vote someone in like you said you would do at the very startand dont try to feign ignorance when you accidentally miss this post like you are bound to do
sorry to have to say this  that was a flat lie   but youre either dead wrong or deploying a smoke screen quotingby default the representative with the highest vote tally is awarded with theresponsibilities of chairman for the csmnotice the default that means that the representative with the most votes is chairman if and only if the chairman isnt selected in a different way thats what it says not more and not less practically that means that a motion of no confidence against you is useless as youd still be chairman a vote of confidence for another member does make sense though in fact im wondering why it didnt already happen considering all that mud throwing around herethank you all for informing yourselves before posting im proud of you dont interpret things into the space between the lines youll miss your freedom
the reason it didnt happen the same reason darius and bane are running the goonswarm rather than being plebs inside goonswarm they are smart enough to see that wasting the csms time with stupid little power plays will reflect badly on themat the end of the day our reputations as csm reps depend on getting the job done and promoting issues to the attention of ccp
says the idiot who started all the ed power play crap just get out
bane is a pleb fyi
i am deeply moved by your expression of respect for your fellow council members and your ability to distract from topics i cant see how the election of a chairman could possibly distract the council more than this very debate
you sound a little bit stressed maybe have a cup of tea and play some internet spaceships rather than student politics seriously its not the end of the world that you dont get your way on this pace yourself maybe ill get indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for internet posting or perhaps you could open a class action suit and try to have me deported to texas or something
this isnt a debate its a threadnaught  and a little light entertainment  
actually this thread isnt a threadnaught its a thread with the sole purpose of removing someone so obviously unsuitable from their position its what the assembly hall was designed for showing support for issues that concern the players of this game
well technically its designed for showing support for issues that concern all players of the game whereas this is a petty little vendetta that only concerns bitter little fruits and their alts and cheerleaders so far this thread has less support than goum got in the election its not exactly a sterling triumphant beginning for your crusade and its actually alienated more people than its convinced
if you pulled your thumb our of your arse for a few seconds you would realise that there are more than a few non goons telling you that you are a raging idiot and to get outedit word count
yep and all his replies in this thread are pretty childish hes made it clear he should be off csm as soon as possible
youre assuming that bane and darius have rallied goonswarm to tell you that youre wrong you have no idea how we work besides have you seen ra or tcf or any of our major allies appear in these threads hell ive hardly seen bob in here they dont seem to care and its no business of ours to pressure anyone else into voting we like to call it democracy but that word has a different meaning when you use itguess what this includes goons stop acting like it doesnt
if you prefer to call it such ill go with youi cant see how the election of a chairman could possibly distract the council more than this very threadnaughtin what way did i change the meaning i think youve proven my point
distract who ive done all my template writing up for the weekend  meeting agenda set documents submitted to iceland etc etc this thread is just another goon threadnaught  why should anybody care
actually the chair rejected my motion then changed its tune and started behaving more like a council member and less like a dictator you keep using terms like power plays and political points i have nothing to gain from either
indeed why do you i guess the rest cares about why you care
if you want the motion darius i told you all you had to do was support this thread and add it to the agenda as an issue its pretty simple
i bolded the important part for you
bolded and underlined the important bits for you dariusdont try and claim you were prevented from raising this if you had wanted to and do cut the it stuff out it makes you look like a petulant child
ok i gave you the out and tried to act civilized about the matter the fact is that you refused any motion that limited what you stated was your authority you were then given a set of suggestions from ccp  youve already stated this in various threads another issue i was not trying to bring up   after ignoring the very same suggestions from your fellow council members  and have followed them provided youre not being a  i have no problem with you sitting as chair had you not changed your tone and changed your course from authoritarian to team member i would indeed be supporting this thread which would be fairly irrelevant for the most part as all that this issue accomplishes is the creation of a conversation in iceland is that clear enough for you now or shall i go onof course ive already said this in various places but you have a love for making me repeat myselfedit it was referring to the chair as an object not a person calm down you look like someone trying to play the martyr
incorrect i told you needed to compose an issue thread or support an existing issue thread to raise the point and it would be voted on as a discussion topic alongside all the rest thats what i had to do with the electable chair issue thats what you would need to do with your issuei really dont understand why you are still spoiling for a fight on this darius we have come to a decent conclusion already as far as i understood we had a very good meeting in the week and everyone has worked hard to meet our deadline i can only assume you feel obliged to play some macho goon patriarch role here and i have to tell you it doesnt impress me in the least grow up and get on with the job we were elected to do stop posturing and acting like an ass
id like to add in addition to that that simply because i see no need to support this particular action at this juncture that does not mean people cannot voice their opinions or concerns on the subject everyone is entitled to their opinions and beliefs even when they run counter to your own
you dont get everything you want a dictatorship would be a lot easierthere ought to be limits to freedomi want everybody to hear loud and clear that im going to be the president of everybodywhere things have gone wrong have been where ive made the mistake of allowing a little too much democracy and allowed them to impact the constitution itselfone of these is from jade constantine though i could understand how someone would attribute them all to the same person
whos spoiling for a fight i was playing mgs4 and hauling minerals you mentioned my name and i responded you were acting out of line vetoed a perfectly valid vote because it didnt suit you then proceeded to deny my two motions those motions were indeed denied by you you did state that it should be raised as an issue and i didnt say that you did noti really dont care to impress you your opinion of me is entirely irrelevant to me if you want me to not respond to you do not associate me by name in your opinion posts
i was just correcting your false statement darius you claimed i blocked your motion i simply told you how to do it properly within the agreed procedure for raising issues i think the problem here darius is you what youre describing that i blocked or denied you when what i actually did is tell you how it could be done properly within the rules of the csm process i know its frustrating you cant get exactly what you want when you want it but we do have some rules for the submission of issues that the rest of us have to followi dont care if you respond or not darius  thats up to you but if you come and post an untrue statement ill feel free to correct you on it
correction you stated your interpretation of how to do it properly within your personal opinion on what the agreed procedure for raising issues was the fact is that a procedure to remove the chair wasnt documented nor was the ability for the chair to veto votes and mute dissenting opinions in the council we can run around in circles playing games with interpretations all night id moved on
someone with good writing skills should send a little article about the last meeting plus this thread to a few select gaming oriented sitessee how this petty thing goes on you are a bloody disgrace
theres nothing incorrect about my statement at the time we were perfectly within our rights to raise administrative issues it just so happens that immediately after i raised one in regards to your muting fellow council members you decided unilaterally that we were not allowed to raise issues such as that any more there was no agreement there was a statement by you nothing more
youve proven youre no better than any goon is jade last thursdays meeting if the chatlog on that thirdparty website is to be believed went along much smoother thanks to lavista vistas role as chairman although i would like to believe that you would exit gracefully should it come to that i see no reason to believe that you would do so without further disgracing and embarrassing both yourself and the council when it comes down to it that is what this thread has shown me infighting amongst the csms for no reason other than outofgame quarrels which is publicly making a mockery of this democratic process
btw wasnt there a meeting after the 0608 one wheres the transcript i dont want to miss the lulz
what arent you understanding here darius and i hate each others guts he has no respect for my experience in this game i have no respect for his you should count yourself lucky were even talking seriously im happy to interact within the parameters weve been set by ccp but if darius tries coming on with this rubbish in public im going to challenge him on it  every timei wasnt elected to roll over for the goons get used to it
i posted here in response to your post here mentioning me by name its right here in this thread you can try and reframe it like i was simply prancing around in this thread coming on with this rubbish in public but the fact of the matter is i had moved on and was playing videogames i already said that too though do you even read what anyone else writes
please use that in your next electoral campaign it surely will get you elected
yep thats right i had stated that you were too smart to be seen wasting everyones time with a crappy motion like this im happy to take it back obviously you arent that smart after all if you had moved on then why provoke this argument by claiming i blocked your motions when what i actually did was explain to you the process of how the issues had to be raisedseriously darius you need to chill and bow out of this stupid thread its not helping your good judgment to be forced to perform for the goon chorus
you fail in clarity did you mean to write darius is a moron if he supports this motion by any chanceedit english should be used idiomatically for all i know
take it back v0v i honestly dont care you did block my motions interpreting the validity of motions wasnt any more in your purview than vetoing votes if you want me to not respond to you then dont editorialize what i say id be happy to post the emails to allow them to speak for themselves but i fear you would take umbrage with that and the vote to do so has not yet been had how i can provoke an argument by clarifying what you stated was my position is beyond me i think im certainly capable of speaking for myself i certainly didnt nominate you as my spokespersonwhile i appreciate your concern about my judgement its neither asked for nor necessary
itt jade constantine calls somebody out for wasting time not knowing when hes dug himself into an inescapable hole and making stupid threadscats and dogs are living together brimstone is raining from the sky
also jade isnt most of your experience in eve composed of writing awful fan fiction while docked in high sec wishing there was somway to wall of text cva out of existence
i mean remember that f13 thread where you were out argued so seriously on the topic of eve by a guy half your age who has never actually played eve that you threw a temper tantrum and edited away all of your postsnot the most sterling resume
no interpretation of validity was done i told you to post an issue discussion thread or support an existing one and go through the motions for raising an issue dunno how to make this any clearer for you i dont care if you respond or not its your choice at the end of the day yeah but posting those emails would involve you breaking the terms of service you agreed wouldnt they  little bit inconvenient there maybe you might consider not provoking public arguments every single day over every single issue weve ever talked about how about that for an ideayou didnt clarify darius you lied you said i blocked your motions when what i actually did is told you how you should make them within the same rules we are all bound by
ok lets say this againup until my motion to limit the scope of your moderation to prevent you from disenfranchising elected representatives at whim like you did last sunday we had discussed numerous administrative items we had even had a vote on one immediately after the motion was presented you unilaterally decided for the rest of us that we would no longer be discussing administrative issues i was told we could not discuss that motion because of your decision and it would have to be raised as an issue this would have meant you could have continued your wreckless vetoing and muting until ccp made a decision in iceland thus the problem i had change it to not blocking a motion if that makes you feel better in jadeworld the facts are the facts and theyre right there plain as dayagain with the provoke word you were acting as my spokesperson on as issue i posted clarifying my stance for myself that does not make me a provocateur you do not speak for me in any waybeing coy about your explanation to save face is pretty silly the simple fact is as i stated above prior to my raising the motion we were able to discuss administrative issues the second one was raised that challenged you you decided unilaterally that we were not discussing such things anymore thats the chain of events its not a lie you decided you had the authority to change the game midstream perhaps that long and wordy explanation will sit better with you than blocked those were not rules we were all bound by just the day before we had all operated under a different premise you decided that you didnt like that immediately thereafter you unilaterally vetoed the vote that you didnt like from the day before declaring it void also not a rule we are all bound by
i think most of us emailed ccp asking for intervention actually i said i wouldnt be countenancing any more administrative votes until we heard back and got some guidance the sole significant administrative issue wed discussed thus far was the alternates thing if saying no more of this crap until we hear from ccp is considered by you to be a bad thing then well agree to differ well like i said lots of us had apparently asked for guidance from ccp and waiting till that guidance was given seemed like a good idea to me spin it how you will darius you wanted to move into the offensive with admin motions to change the balance of the council without a 7 day discussion without submission templates and without face to face time in iceland again ill cite the example of the issue i brought up to impact the council dynamics electable chair and i went through the approved methods and got it openly discussed for 7 days and then voted on the csm what made you think you didnt have to meet the same standards of approval how about we simply tell the truth rather than listening to darius johnson trying to wriggle his way out of lying in public i held your motions that would impact the balance of the council to the same standards that mine had met if you call that changing the rules you really are deluded you made an allegation that i had blocked your motions  that allegation was false i did tell you how to raise them properly absolutely not again i cite the electable chair motion and its passage through the csm process your motion of no confidence in the chair should have to follow exactly the same checks and balances and be heard in exactly the same manner why do you think you should be the exception to the rule i said it was void pending an inquiry to ccp we made the inquiry we got the information matter was resolved really you are flapping around like a fish on dry land here darius and making a scene for absolutely no good purpose give it up
im not going to play the ladder quote game with you that gets tedious and i lack your flare for the boringthe fact of the matter is that your decision to not hold any more administrative votes did not occur until my motion had been raised could that be a coincidence certainly could that does not change the fact that i raised the issue the same way the use of alternates issue was raised  the one you decided you could veto after a perfectly legitimate vote   and you ruled it out of order prior to there ever being any understanding that this was even a possibility i never said you didnt allow for me to raise it as an issue here i never lied you can say i lied until youre blue in the face but the facts are on the table and you stomping your feet and saying so in your typical juvenile fashion does not make it a factyou told me no to something for which no other mechanism had been established and my choice of words was blocked what you did did indeed have the effect of blocking the motion you can claim nuance or want some fancier wording or explanation around it if you like but theres no lie there the motion was not allowed to carry through along the same lines similar motions had before that is not a lie that is not spin its simply what happened your telling me how to raise them properly did not meet the previous standard which was actually bringing the item to a votewhat made me think i didnt need to meet the 7 day standard the fact that until it impacted you that standard didnt existlook at jade trying to wiggle his way out of his circular argument flop flop flop flopdid i do that right i can sling names with you all night long call you a liar say what youre saying is stupid i can selectively ignore what is inconvenient to me i didnt see a need to do that at this juncture but im the juvenile im the one spinning somehow jade is always right and without fault whether you realize it or not youre fairly transparent and one of a very few people who buys your own bull
please dont say such things you could destroy his selfesteem its more fun with him not realising
ill leave you to your alliance of yesmen darius when you get to the point of simply casting insults its fairly clear you dont have an answer was a pointless argument as they always are with you
quoting the first insult in this discussionquoting the noninsulting inflammatory dance that followedif answering repeatedly the same arguments you make is not having an answer then i guess nobody has one its you jade you have the only answers and everyone else is wrong why did i even bother having an opinion when i could have just asked you what it should be if you dont want people to insult you dont throw the first stone dont pretend to speak for me dont reinterpret and editorialize my words and i wont have to respond if i did that to you id expect a response i wouldnt feign shock when it occurred
thats not correct very few issues will concern all players of the game something ridiculous like 70 of eve players never leave empire space none of them will care about your ed destroying outposts idea and yet you raised it anyway  and put it on the agenda despite the almost overwhelming negative reception   so there we go youre wrong its for raising issues that concern a portion of the eve population removing you as csm concerns a large portion of the population you can tell this because of the almost 140 support posts in this thread this compares very well with other issue threads in this forum  especially considering this thread is quite new compared to most   ever since this issue broke youve been trying to claim that its a vendetta of only a few people this is clearly incorrect the people asking for resignation come from a wide cross section of eves population while you may claim that there is a large portion of goonswarms population is here and taking part in the csm process however thats mostly because unlike almost all of the eve population we actually care about the csm process 89 of eves active players didnt even bother to vote on the other hand a good portion of goonswarms population is aware of this forum and for the most part have similar viewpoints on issues  we arent a homogeneous group though people disagree about things constantly   no matter how many people call for your resignation youll claim that they are a vocal minority shame its quite clear to all involved that thats far from true itll become very clear if you run in the next csm election
thats not precisely what i told you to post pleb 30 demerits
i have some sympathy for jade in the muting issue and as chairman he certainly does have the right to do that when necessary but the dictatorial powers he is trying to give himself are as astonishing as they are corruptthe chair has no right to veto a vote the chair has no right to set the agenda of a meeting and the chair most certainly has to refuse a vote of no confidencethe role of the chairman is to moderate and facilitate the meeting he can have a deciding vote if the ballot is a dead heat but to give himself the power to veto a vote defeats the whole point of having the committee in the first place also every member has the right to abstain from a vote and the chair has no right to criticize let alone change result of the vote because of itthe chairman does not set the agenda  the members of the committee do at the end of the meeting each member should be given the opportunity to add an item to the agenda of the next meeting and the chairman has no right to refuseas for the chairman refusing to allow a vote of no confidence in himself well do i really need to explain why that is utterly ridiculousspeaking of jade giving himself powers he has no right to possess he also seems to have set himself up as dictator for life according to his explanation as to why he cannot be replaced that explanation unless im very much mistaken applies to members of the committee not the the role of chairman itself which incidentally he usurped in the first place so yeah  i regretfully support this motion which jade has no right to refuse according to tradition a vote of no confidence must be attended to at the earliest opportunity under the provisions of an extraordinary general meeting which again jade has absolutely no right to refuse if you want him out of the chair call an egm and vote him out its as simple as thatedit committee members may also be interested to know that the chairman isnt supposed to vote at all unless the committee is deadlocked in which case he casts the deciding vote if jade has been voting on issues that were not deadlocked then that too is an abuse of power
quite an amusing read should lock you guys up in a room give you all baseball bats and let you duke it out that way seeing as this seems to be doing absolutely nothingmeet on common ground and rework it set ground rules get things done properly instead of wasting everyones time
okay im going to be short and simple herejade1   continues to ignore many people with valid points2   uses the name of the games largest alliance as an insult and implies theyre all stupid children in public3   continues to smokescreen issues instead of dealing with them4   is letting the power he is trying to give himself go to his head5   is bickering with darius like a child6   has become a synonym for annoying arrogant 7   is now being told to gtfo in one of the most epic threads on assembly halljade give up and leave while you still have some tiny shred of dignity
quite obvious this isnt going to work well otherwise
because only when it became clear that you would lose such a vote did you declare unilaterally that all such votes were verboten the council had been running administrative procedural votes for three meetings in the same manner before the call to remove was placed you had brought administrative procedural votes to these meetings with no objectionsyoure lying you are twisting the truth so that you can say things that might be maybe possibly true in order to convey other meanings just like when a goon rehosted your maison site you said i have nothing to do with the hosting of that page which despite you creating the page hosting it on your own domain for a long time having posted in other boards in confirmation of you owning the site could possibly construed to be true because that particular copy you did not put online you said this to disassociate yourself from the contentits the same thing here it is technically true that you did not block the motion but only because there is no technical procedure called blocking that you could have taken advantage ofyou did stop the motion from going to a voteyou did previously allow motions of similar nature from going to a voteyou had previously brought similar motions to a voteyou had never objected before to any procedural motion before such a pointso what changed the motion was unfavorable to you and was likely to pass just like when you editorialized hardins motion  after without right or justification barring him from a meeting   to formalize the process by which alternatives entered and left the status of equal voting membersedwhen reasonable people get together they can make decisions about themselves and only themselves without interruption unless it breaks the founding documentsthe council has the power and authority to make changes to the way it operates in meetings bif only for the reason that because its you agreeing between yourselves to take an action the csm document presents a way for you to step down and the only thing preventing it from happening is you blocking the motion that would formalize them asking for you to do so and abide by the will of the council i like how you define all players of the game as players who agree with me
jade continues to show his unprofessionalism and is letting down all his voters imhoyou should step down let the vice take your place and shut the heck upand if you continue to be such a pigheaded person it would make sense for the csm to have meetings with 8 peoplehonestly you make me sick for trying to ruin the first csm because of your own petty ego and i wished ccp never unbanned your sorry behind
um what
jade was banned from the forums for a significant amount of time for doing pretty much exactly what he is doing here   a few months before taking sign ups for the csm ccp issued a blanket amnesty for all forum accounts that were not removed due to serious infractions like posting goatse on the forums  
the way i see things its not too late for jade sure hes overstepped the mark and assumed far more power than he is legitimately entitled to but the situation could be resolved if he accepted the following points1 the chair has no right to veto2 the chair has no right to exclude members from a meeting or a vote without the agreement of the council3 the chair has no right to set the agenda or dictate procedures without the consent and support of the committee4 the chair has no right to vote on any issue at all unless the ballot is tied and he is required to cast the deciding voteif jade could accept those basic principles of democratic procedure then the problem would be solved
the chair is an equal voting member there is no reason to disallow him from partaking in discussion and voting there are 9 people on the council and so long as the chair doesnt attempt to railroad the others and powergrab so that the csm does what he wants when he wants there is no problem with itnonvoting chairs are precautions that need to be taken in larger bodies where the sheer number of people make participation skew the process too much to also allow the chair to participate in discussions and vote on resolutionsit should not be needed here and until its shown that such a system does not work with a reasonable person at in the chair its unreasonable to suggest it should be changed
this is precisely what is happeningno they are not ive never been a member of a committee that allowed the chair a vote in any other circumstance other than a dead heat the chair is supposed to be a neutral moderator and is normally extremely reluctant to reveal their position on any issue unless forced to do so in the event of a deadlocked vote to do so in a real life political environment would be considered extremely unprofessional at best oh i see you dont want to resolve the issue amicably you just want to get rid of jade no matter what okay thats a perfectly reasonable position to take i guess i was just trying to be diplomatic
i have it went fairly well but there were only 12 of usno if jade can be reasonable there is nothing wrong with jade being the chair jade should only be removed if he cannot be reasonable if there is anything not diplomatic its telling an elected member of the council their vote should only count in the event of a tie we all know what happens when you tell an elected member of the council that their votes dont count jade did it and we have to deal with the fallout
hang on goum point of order here i think i should explain how forum bans used to work just so people have the full background the olf forum ban thingforum bans use to be issued after a set number of warnings warnings did not expire over time the longer a person participated on the the eveo forums the more likely they were to rack up the warnings and thus be subjected to an infinite time banyou have been around on shc long enough to know that back then a lot of the more active forum folks got hit with perma bans its part of the reason that shc was set up iircwasnt it three warnings and your out
ive received one warning my entire time on the forums and ive been more prolific in terms of posts and words than most people eg i have 40 more posts than jade with a higher average character count   you had to be pretty consistently abusive to receive enough warnings to get banned because of it granted it could be light abuse but its very unlikely for it to occur without that pattern of behavior given jades posting here and elsewhere i am not surprised in the least that he was given an involuntary permanent vacation especially since in this environment where we ought to be talking about stuff that is fairly in game politic neutral in a game where we shoot each other and generally harbor ill will   and so you would expect the debate to be more tame than when you are talking about things like who won what engagement and who was winning a war he has done little but insult others and insinuate about some conspiracy against him
iirc jade got banned for sig size violations not walls of texts
i am not getting drawn on this thread or discussion i dislike the vitriol and hate these kind of things bring it doesnt add to my enjoyment of the gamei just felt i ought to explain how things were a lot different then a lot of people got banned for very little and it was a major bone of contention for most forum regulars to the point that the mechanism was eventually changed
if theres anyone who has anything to gain from explaining how something works its jade unfortunately all he seems to want to do is run around the issue dismissively and throw insults at everyonenot to say youre a jade alt but just that he could take the time to explain things without so much vitriol and hate as you put it
i dont think texas would want ya i know i sure dontand you said you hate darius wow you hate another person over a video game proof your in need of a real life sure theres characters i dont like in this game but i dont hate anyone in this game prob because i know behind the keyboard there not the same person they are in game much like having the name jade and really having the name andrew step down now make it rie show you can realize your not for the good of the fgame and for only you personal powertrip as a roleplayer give the chair to one whos willing to be impartial and is not going to see a goon at every turn

well your comment was that the sleipnirs cpu was horribly gimped which is wrong yes the sleipnir is normally fit active and from what i can gather camps seem to be split on activepassive tanking for the nh but from what i can tell the sleipnir comes out ahead in both cpu and grid regardless of active or buffer tank no matter which way you look at it the nighthawk seems to kinda get the shaft on grid i dont see how adding 150 or so grid would make the ship unstoppable especially when the sleip would still have almost twice the grid left yeah i can use the grid for howies and still have plenty but seriously who fits howies on a sleip
well presonally i dont think caldari ships are even designed to fit a mwd which causes most of the fitting problems the issue of mwds being a necessity is an issue for everyoneall i did was take a similar paragraph used about the nh and its pg and changed it to sleipnir and cpu just showing how easy it is to make statements like that posts such as
we had this discussion in the other thread mwds are essential period if you dont share that opinion thats fine however take your nomwd nighthawk and join some pvp op where everyone has them fitted and watch what their reactionyoure being a fool again cutting and pasting a true statement for one thing doesnt a sound argument make for another thing logic  you if you dispute any fact in any of those posts then step up to the plate with your own numbers to dispute itso your solution is to fix a lack of a by adding more b brilliant really it has been shown here using solid numbers and facts that the nighthawk lacks grid your solution is to add other things to make up for it that isnt a solution its avoiding the problem solving a problem with a ship doesnt elimate diversityyes the nighthawks grid is most certainly horribly gimped if you dispute that fact then provide some actual proof not an opinionthe nighthawks grid problem and bonus problem are two seperate issues we are not trying to fix one with another read the freaking thread seriouslya 50pg doesnt even come close to solving the problem ive already shown that the nighthawk needs a base increase of 170pg in order to fit a very basic setup and a command module with the use of one rcu any less and itll require two fitting mods while other command ships can fit the same setup with none so all im asking is that the nighthawk be required to fit one rcu while other command ships can fit the same setup with none reread that several times thankscontinued

you walked into this thread with your first post laughing at people and at the numbers theyve provided numbers and proof that are rock solid and are far more convincing than your uninformed opinions explain to me why on earth i should feel compelled to be considerate to you when your opening attitude was both derogatory and insulting i have discussions with people who discuss i mock and insult people who do the same you have gotten and will continue to get what you deserveyou have yet to respond to my challenge you have yet to provide proof numbers a setup or anything approaching a fact that the nighthawk can live with less than half the grid of the sleipnir when both are fit very similarlyyoull likely continue ignoring my posts as you dont have the consideration or maturity to admit that youve been wrong or the facts to step up to my challenge till then ill continue to be considerate to those who are worth consideration

you need to justify these numbers you cant just go around spouting numbers that look like theyve been picked out of a hat140 pg required  see herean extra launcher slot is not required and assuming a simultaneous pg fix would overpower the nighthawk missile precision bonus ooh yes pleasethe sleipnir is absolutely fine its a model for the other cs the nighthawks pg is unquestionably horribly gimped again you need to justify your opinions like this for example i agree that the nh has problems other the pg  poor slot layout and the useless precision bonus but the lack of pg is just so obvious and so easy to fix

i havent flown the nighthawk but fitting a high number of fitting mods for a cookie cutter fit is weird is a bit weird
sounds like a good idea
usually a blockade runner gets shoehorned into fitting one of its lows with a power diagnostic or a rector control just to be able to fit a microwarp with the rest of the fittingpersonally i think its fair to give the crane a slightly increased powergrid so that the extra low is free for inertial stabilizers nano stabs or whatever the pilot could possibly desire
i agree and would include ship cargo holds to be browsedi have many ships in several regions and systems that i use for several reasons and sometimes i need to find something that i left inside a ship  i once had to make a petition to find a missing skill  also it would be very useful to have the info window of all ships in the station display the modules they have fitted to avoid having to activate each one to see the fitting  i can fly most t1 ships from all races and most t2 amarr ships and i cant buy faction gear for all of them so i have to swap modules to the ship i need

yes for the topic but what the heck ever happened to forum polls yes and no options limited to one per account other forums manage this just fine
i agree
it is an annoying problem as a player who flies solely amarr i understandhowever this is a bad idea the entire idea of not allowing damaged products to be contracted is for a reason because if these are contracted in a high sec system it adds an extra cost onto buying the product which is not explicitly included in the priceeven if people know of the damage people will just ignore this and not really notice another are you sure you want to do this message i oppose a general allowing of this sort but i can see how when setting personal contracts  ie usually a corp or alliance mate or someone you know   that this may become useful but setting it as a public setting will open it to abuse which tbh ccp wont change since they are positive about scamsspiesthefts etc it would be a system open to abuse and if introduced should be in a private an not public arena
so everyone else should suffer because you cant be arsed to read a warning message sorry but thats just being stupid
agreed
i believe this restriction exists to prevent people from foisting 99 damaged items on each other that said a better option would be to include damage amounts  if any   in the contract info just like with all the other contract scams the info would be there and if you fall for it then thats tough the gain far outweighs the scam potential here
getting rid of t2 laser crystal is the most painful thing ever
ime that happens now except that looking out the window is replaced with having a suicidal alt undock or having a buddy in a cloaked ship sitting 100km from the station giving a running commentary in corp chatpeople already get around this restriction through various cumbersome means so im arguing theres no real reason for it to exist if an overview reproduction is excessive then simply having a list of people on the station grid shouldnt cause more lag than local does
you are thinking of this from too much of an empire standpoint empire station camping is a joke in most 00 there is only one station in any real 00 warfare enemies will be in your system all of the time usually at a pos idling you cant expect anyone to stay docked the whole timeeven when the enemies are active there is a chance they wont be at the station because they are shooting at a pos or camping gates or they are active but stuck inside their pos shield you cant expect the defenders to stay docked just because there are enemies in the systemif the enemies are at your undock and there are more than say 20 of them you can undock and slam stop all you want you will not load the grid all you will see is a black screen for probably a minute or two in that time the people outside will have more than enough time to kill you and you will never ever see itthat said i dont really support the issue because i dont see a fair way to do it
i understand what you are thinking and why that would not make any sense on asking the station ownertraffic control as to see if the approach is clearhowever in the context of just looking out the window for an object that might be close to 20 or 30km away in pitch black void i am seriously doubting you will able to really know if you even were able to see it to know if friend or foe with out your targeting system now thats an avatar leaning on the window sill looking for bad guysif you were able to see what is on grid this will be nullified before the patch hits the game 1   you will not be able to see cloaked ships on grid2   all they need to do is park off grid and warp in as soon as you undock and a cloaked sabreshictor on the undock will really spoil your dayalthough a good thought would be somewhat useless in practice
i support this unless it causes a noticeable lagwindjammer
good lord man even when youre cloaked you can see the outline and the outline alone is enough to induce vomitingbesides you cant cloak in a station
seconded as far as people saying that it will be cloaked most of the time  im sure you folks wouldnt mind playing a text based version of the game either thats a complete red herring the answer to this problem is simple  just switch the tech ii bonus of the imicus and the maulus and go back to the original hulls problem solved or  god forbid actually design a new hull that doesnt look like a bag of azz

and while were at it can we just plain have some new ship designs  why does the t2 have to look like the t1 anyway more models
once again i would like to encourage everyone to step back and realize if this is not something that affects them why vote against itjealousy plain and simple jealousy for years the helios enjoyed the spotlight as bestlooking covert ops even if perhaps it was the least functional now it is the least functional still and now the worst lookingso all you people who are voting to not support this are simply just upset that we are fighting for our right of being the best looking covops back admit it you are jealous

signedbring it back why was it even changedon a broader note like someone else said why do so many ships in eve look rediculous is the art team a bit tipsy when they design these ships some of the jove ships look cool but whos actually seen one new hulls needed
this idea is approveddoes less dps at optimal  23km   than other close range weapon systems which means when you fight where youre supposed to in falloff you have even less dps maelstrom isnt bad but you trade that tanking bonus for a falloff optimal or tracking bonus and watch this ship take the biggest nosedive in history typhoon is only good because 23rds of its weapon systems are nonminmatar astro
the major problem i see with auto cannons is this they are geared to close medium range warfare preferably with a ship which is faster than the opposition which is why med acs work so well on a vaga however this concept simply does not work when applied to battleships you ever tried to outrun a mega mwding towards you try to get around him hoping his agility will allow you to get past bs are simply too slow to use their range advantage and with minmatar bs being as slow big and unwieldy as their racial counterparts they have no advantage please i am sick of the argument having a bs is better than no bs  this is bs  pardon the pun  somebody pointed out there is not much difference between autocannon tiers  this is a problem granted but i would much prefer the larger problem to be solved the impotence of the tempest looking at hail the halving of falloff demolished tracking means even if you do theoretical on par dps with a mega  lol   you will lose due to inferior tracking range etchail makes no sense because it dispenses with all the acminmatar advantages  unless your fighting another minmatar    range  falloff reduced   and speed  tracking reduced  posting setups does not help your argument anyone can see a dps mega will beat a dps tempest at optimal but in practice if the tempest gets the range who knows of all this i cant only say 3 things a change to hail would be nice maybe less damage gives cap when firing speed increase who knows you your imagination difference in autocannon tiers not much simply make 800s do more dps 425s less whatever it needs to balance it thats ccps job to figure out a change to the tempest it has simply fallen out of its role i think development as a sniper would be good as minmatar have less viable options atm than other races a change to artillery would compliment this  large btw others seem ok  
i agree that the acs need some love especially the 650mm and the 800mm would need to offer much more optimal to have a meaning of existence
i actually didnt need to read this entire topic to support itbs acs are shocking compared to their counterpartssame goes for arties as well to be fairbig support for this though to be fair minmatar bs need to be looked at as they are subpar to their opposites in other races
agreed

one hot summers day a fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch just the things to quench my thirst quoth he drawing back a few paces he took a run and a jump and just missed the bunch turning round again with a one two three he jumped up but with no greater success again and again he tried after the tempting morsel but at last had to give it up and walked away with his nose in the air saying i am sure they are sour

who are you and what have you done with the real windjammer
agreed peoples votes shouldnt count at all remove everyone from the csm
lies greed envy this is all the posters who would leave the t2 bpos in game have to argue with made mostly by t2 bpo owners alts im sure
im a main actually if you understood manufacturing you would know that bpos do not effect inventors at all or their profits so the only reason anybody would want them removed is false greed envy and jealousy as no other real reason exists
youve just clearly illustrated my point thanks
your point claims that i am a alt  im not   and that their are other reasons why ppl want bpos removed did you not read your own post
its amusing how you can say something and not know what youre talking aboutthe profit of something is determined by its selling price the selling price is determined by market conditions you can put a t2 ship or item on the market for higher than the current price but it probably wont sell all that quickly thats what keeps your price lower to draw more consumer demand  because they dont want to pay more and eve wont let them for that matter  you have a minimum amount you can sell it for before you actually realize a loss on your product thats determined by the costs of manufacturing if your costs are higher than mine and theres nothing you can do about it the competitive advantage is in my court this is whats known as the walmart effect lower costs  lower prices with a profit  driving out of business those with higher coststhe safety margin for an invented ship  i dont know about modules   tends to vary by class being the best for recon ships and the worst for most t2 frigates  the electronic attack ships are an exception to this because no t2 bpo exists  of course inventors can understate their costs by treating their rd agent datacores and explored decryptors as free but thats not really sound economic sense
ok bud so you claim that even though the t2 market for years has been steady and the although plummet coincided exactly with the onset of invention that its the bpo owners that are driving it down although for years the bpo holders had the sense to keep the market high suddenly they have decided to crash itthe bpo guys and gals may be able to make a slightly higher profit than inventors but that profit does not effect in the slightest inventors or their profits as the market and demand is way to large  a fact you either ignored as it did not suit you and your point or you were just ignorant of because of a lack of insight  
i said it before in the thread and ill say it again maybe this time youll actually read it and understand itback before invention an oligopoly existed in the t2 market an oligopoly is when theres a relatively small number of individuals or companies involved in a market resulting in a limited amount of competition there wasnt that much underbidding because there was a rather low number of people putting stuff up for salewith the previous numbers i quoted a vagabond would have cost 50m or so to build  possibly less possibly more i dont know what the component costs were   and were oftentimes selling for over 200m isk each many t2 modules were priced upwards of 89x as high as they are nowthe invention came in the oligopoly came closer to a true free market but not quite because not all of the players so to speak are following the same rules those that have the advantage of lower costs of production enjoy an automatic boost over those that do notthe current situation is beneficial to the consumer but its not as equally beneficial to the sellers of the goods these situations do happen in the real world but it would be very difficult to think of anything approaching a magic moneymaking machine like a t2 bpo the holders of the bpos do not make slightly higher profits hell if i could find a company that could reliably make such slightly higher profits in the real world i wouldnt have to worry about working anymore and could just live off my investments in themwell i guess i could invest in the oil companies right now but theyre a bit of an extreme and their longterm outlook isnt great but thats irrelevant hereoh and as for the rare event ships theres one big difference between them and the t2 bpos in order to take advantage of their significant powers and abilities one would have to risk them in combat either pve or pvp which could end up with one less said rare event ship in the game ask the exleader of iac about that but a t2 bpo is different they dont even have to be put into any risky situation to be used its less effective but unlike ships they still produce when theyre being cargo bay queens unlike hangarqueen ships that are never undocked
your missing the fact that nobody is saying that the t2 bpo guys cannot make more isk per sale on the ships they build from their bpo as they of course can without a doubt but the fact is that the market is so large and varied that they do not effect the profits of a inventor in the slightest and to claim that they do is absurd
a still aspire to have enough isk to actually buy a t2 bpo they are very available maybe not often and maybe not the exact one youd want but they do sell so please do not take them out of the game
obviously t2 bpo owners will be able to make larger profits than those who rely on invention but you can still make a huge amount of isk through invention you could then use this isk to purchase a t2 bpoim not saying its fair but with no real feasible way of removing the t2 bpos and with the introduction of invention vastly leveling the playing field i dont believe anything has to be done
true to a degree but bpos do make the actual manufacture less of a hassle and that convenience has a price but i agree i think most people voting to get rid of bpos are people who want them and dont have them
not just less of a hassle but as ive said before cheaper tooi dont want them to exist period and i dont have them to me theyre basically subsidized t2 production when it doesnt need any the demand for t2 items is quite obvious so its not like theres any need to make it cheaper to produce without good reasonthe original t2 bpo program was heavily flawed to put it kindly and its a relic of a poor design decision thats still having an effect today
give me the name of those mystical bpo giving 500 profit and how you get it then i could think you are speaking the truth and give you my excuses till then for me you are a liar or you arent counting all the expenses note ram even if you produce them should be priced at sell price  or you will be moving the profit of building ram to the final item and the profit come from building ram not the t2 items   idem for t2 building components idem for all the other items used if you are saying the basic materialsminerals cost x so building all the componentsadvanced materials i am getting 500 profit on the final item you are simply adding the profits of several constructing jobs to the final job and calculating them there in that situation it is not the t2 bpo what give you a 500 profit it is the building of the components that give you a profit

the assembly hall is rather busy innit    im wondering if more people think this a good idea perhaps not so easy to get support for it since relatively few have encountered bugs that they then wanted to report
signedi filed 2 bug reports in the minutes after opening ea for the first time both of them came back with need more details followed by try this thing we know wont work followed by ok we know this is an issue im playing a game i dont feel like checking my email and hand holding the bh team on a side note what the heck is up with that no paid staff for bug hunting puuuuhhhleez
hydrogens threadnaughtthere have been numerous threads in regards to the pilgrim and its ineffectiveness at its supposed rolepersonally i wouldnt mind having a reduction in energy emissions capacitor use per recon level and a tanking bonus  remove the cyno bonuses why use a 200400 million isk ship to do what a 100k isk ship can do  
what 100k isk ship can fit a covert cyno generator again
any of the t1 frigatesedit misunderstood was thinking of the normal cyno generators
nah the covert cynogen can only be fitted on covops stealth bombers recons and black ops bs none of which are 100k isk ships
so you admit that youve never flown a pilgrim thats fine i have flown a pilgrim extensively you think it needs to commit yes thats true if you want to utilize its inherent bonus but in order to commit it needs a tank with which to survive and that tank sucks  well its better than that of a t1 cruiserwith the exception of the mallerbut compared to the damage output of things its fighting it sucks   unless you are attempting to take on a bs the tracking disruptors have little to no effect within web range and if youre trying to take on a bs youll run into their cap boosters  drones if its a raven though theyll likely end up popping you very fastway faster than it will take you to break its tank so given the info above you pretty much need to keep out of range to be able to add almost anything to a fight at 20km tracking disruptors are actually very good if you run two you can pretty much keep a vagabond or sleipnir from getting any good hits in but if you fight at range you cant make use of your neut bonus so theres little point fitting them you end up with a vexor with tracking diruptors that can also cloak yay with a range bonus the pilgrim will be able to utilize all of its bonuses even though it will be less effective than the curse it can still swing a battle  which at this point is hard to do   the thing is force recons in general give up combat effectiveness for the ability to cloak but at least the other recons can still function in combat the pilgrim is simply not costeffective its hardly worth flying
have looked for it in the past thinking it would naturally be there already  but it aint  
would be a nice option petitions take a bit long especially if youre lagging then it takes like a minute for it to openwould be nice if it was also a block button combined
good idea nice and fast and effective
okay before everyone freaks out hear me out the way capships move is horrible you cant do anything with out a chain of cynos the improvement with cynos on towers was great but just a beggining to where it needs to go i would purpose that with caps you can jump to any cestial body in a system however i would make it so that a cyno comes up 30 seconds before you can jump in giving people some warning and stopping people from jumping massive fleets with out notice i would also make it so a fleet would need a cyno to jump that way you could stop massive fleets from moving with impunity it would make caps ships easier to use on a personal basis but leave them needing help for massive movements i understand ccp and devs desire to put a focus on teamwork the focus should be in the area of combat and minning and stuff like that when you are doing logistic and trying to move around then you should have the ability to do alot of that by yourself if you are worried about things being unbalanced then you think about jumping a carrier in a system when you have no clue what is there let me tell you it is not a good thoughtstormdeath
so you favour capital ships having more strategic mobility and flexibility than interceptors and covops ships combined no
yase empire miners and mission runners should have complete flexibility with their gravy train capital ships anyone who actually uses them for pos warfare well youre sol
no support im afraid capital ships are supposed to be a really big deal with logistical hurdles to their operation i think the current setup of using cynos to move them is reasonably balanced theyre not intended for solo work and opening them up to more solo work would be dangerous carriers for instance can already be used as solo pwnmobiles to some extent we dont need to buff that ability further
i would only support this if it was given to a new ship such as a blackops t2 carrier or something crazy
what about me im one player who gets 6 votes
no support cool troll thoughwindjammer
so you want to take away my right to free speech you want someone whos above me to speak for me and what if hisher opinion differs form my own what am i to do then who could i appeal tohow about we not turn this into stalinist russia

the main problem with invention is that it is too reliant on chance and inventors do not have the avenues to research the mepe levels like holders of t2 bpos dochance based invention is problematic due to the cost of a failed job you stand to lose your bpc datacores decryptor and meta 4 item if the invention fails and if it is successful you still can end up with a low runlow mepe item depending on the decryptor usemy solution is to reduce the risk of inventing by removing all the decryptors from the invention process with the exception of the chance based decryptors  assembly instructions installation guide  stolen formulas war strategon   this will slightly lower the cost of invention and provide less risk to the inventorthe second part of this plan would be to allow the ability to research invented t2 bpcs through the use of the remaining decryptors much like t2 bpo researching requires items you would also have the ability to add a limited number of runs onto the bpc through research with a penalty to me as with the current decryptorstldrinvention needs to be less chance based
lord yes pve is entirely a caldari game unless you feel like jumping through some pretty tall hoops each faction should have at least one corp with highseconly combat agents at each level  the faction navy at a minimum maybe others as well and caldari shouldnt have eleventy billion l4 q0 agents sitting in nice safe highsec break them up ship them out itd probably even kill a decent part of the lag around motsu longterm since people wont be forced into flying for caldari also give caldari some good lowsec agents like the l4 q20 01sec agents that most of the other factions get a caldari pilot shouldnt be forced highsec for missioning any more than an amarr pilot should be forced lowsec
im going to make an argument by example the following is from a bug report with the bh responses edited for obvious reasons and also to share my confusionbugif i am in space and try to buy something via the group tab a dialog box says your current skill level only allows you to place arbitrary bids in stations thats presumably correct as i dont have any serious trading skillshowever if i try the same thing via rightclick on a location in the details tab i can buy stuffdo i now get banned for using an exploitand why is this possible anyway shouldnt the server do all the checkingintended behaviourthen please refile this bug as utterly confusing behavior imho both options should work the same as a specific offer is preselected the place buy order button in the details tab should be the only one issuing an arbitrary bid i know that this would slightly change the mechanics but then i think its more clear and correct this waynot a bug if you really want this addressed please post into the dev forumsbugno i dont want this discussed i dont want to post to the forums just to get ignored another time i want you the one who is working on it put it in front of a game designer who will not need more than half a minute to decide if should be changed or not if its not going to be changed i expect that designer to extend a global public faq to include it so that other people dont get to duplicate the work we three diddoes anyone else feel that ccp needs to reinvestigate its customer support methodsedit thread topic
i voted for ankh and jade not regretting it so fari always thought that the vote should have been more about who appears mature and reasonable enough to sort through the mess that are the eve forums and present the important issues to ccp but then i gave one half of the vote to jade anyway because i liked his agenda    maybe people will vote differently next time when its more clear what the csm actually does  too many still seem to think that the csm is supposed to make decisions about the development of the game  that said i do think that jade is probably not the right person as chairman at this time not because he is unable but because too many csm members seem to have issues with respecting his authority due to his controversial character a more neutral person might have better luck but what i am most disappointed with so far is that its not just the goons who make this a lot harder than it should be by being excessively argumentativethere is still enough time for everyone to get their act together and the actual results arent that bad for a start so i am not worried  yet   and all of this will give us a good idea who and who not to reelect next time around
the chair has no inherent authority there is nothing to respectedit before some goose takes this out of context im explicitly referring to respecting authority respecting opinions or anything else is a different story
ding wrong again oh great one the chair does have authority authority to moderate meetings i know this vexes you fiercely but its the way things are suck it up accept reality and respect the authority for what it is mere administrative dutymoderating the csm meeting in no way means that jade is your superior as you are fond very fond of saying youre all equal on the council dont worry nobody contests thiswindjammer
ohand i do not regret who i voted for and no it was not jade im very pleased with the choice i made and in light of events to date would not hesitate to make the same choice againwindjammer
youre still speaking about things you dont know about see this very forum for an example of that change re rotating moderators
yeah darius is right on this one i think we all agree now that that rotating moderation responsibilities and letting people introduce their own issues and get a turn running the debate is a good thing it has been a bit experimental and random so far but im going say right now that im happy for darius to handle moderation responsibilities on his own issues and if we can come to some kind of agreement to make it work id be happy see a fully rotating chair with us all sharing the moderation burdeneither that or completely outsource the chair role to a ccp appointed non voting moderator im really not interested in stupid admin power struggles  i just want to see our issues get promoted correctly and the csm to be a success and as the actual csm reps have all calmed down and come to agreement on this point this week im pretty confident itll happenthe chair position never really had any actual power  its just a lot of responsibility and hard work really same as the secretary roles  every argument weve had this week has been a storminateacup blown up to ridiculous proportions by the jerryspringer factor of doing this all in public for an audience of bored internet spaceship geeks   in which category i suspect a lot of csm fall as well
voted for darius expected the csm to do nothing got a bunch of drama am happy with my vote
i think jade needs to be reported for eula violations  specifically sharing his password theres no way our friendly neighbourhood andrew cruse would say that darius is right seriously though if this can be worked out im entirely in favour anything that makes this committee function is a good thing
voted for bane am very glad
i for one hope that there isnt a next time aroundccp seem to be wasting valuable resources on something that so far has created nothing more than a group of arguing players with gold avatars beside their name on a forum
verone what exactly did you expect to happen did you think we were going to cure cancer and stop all war in the world csm has only been in place for about a month or so we have only just sent off the initial agenda for icelandso verone how can you judge something so soon yes there has been some issues but that was really to be expecteddo you also go god damn this computer is crap lol before you even plug in the motherboard in a new computeredit now that i think about it i believe i made this point on a podcast once what is going to make csm fail is not csm itself csm would have to fail pretty damn epicly and have the whole csm banned in order for that to happenwhat is going to be the death of csm is people with unreasonable expectations
if this was the real plan then i would call it a complete failure i think darius johnson has done a whole lot better then i would have expected in fact the csm has done quite well for the first time around with luck things will get better
no but what i expected you all to be able to do is treat the players youre representing with at least a small amount of courtesyi also expected that the csm would work together rather than lock horns on the forums like a pack of children in order to see who looks the toughest and meanestfinally i expected you all to be able to hold a meeting without it degrading into childish bickering resulting in people whore at the meeting to give their viewpoints being muted and unable to do soall of these things the csm has failed horribly to dono i make sure that i buy the correct components and that i know what im getting before i assemble a machine so that im not dissapointedi fail to see how my expectations of you people to do what you were elected to do are in any way unreasonable or excessiveat present all ive seen from the csm is sets of meeting minutes that discuss very little a loose and incomplete agenda for a meeting that takes place in two weeks and a group of players whove been elected throwing childish insults at eachother across a forum and throwing their weight about in meetings with heavy handed and overzealous moderationto be honest ccp is wasting their money it would have been much better spent in keeping the evetv weekly show alive something that like the csm was unique but unlike the csm actually strengthened the bonds between players gave rival corporations something to talk about and gave eve something no other mmo hasat present eve has what every other mmo has a bunch of players  albeit with pretty pointless little badges beside their names on a forum   that are arguing and bickering like childrensorry mate it doesnt float with me this term for the csm has already failed at its job in my opinion
verone i both agree and disagree with youi do agree with you that the behaviour so far is a fiasco but we have made progress the last meeting was a bliss we have recently send off a large list of issues to ccp for us to discuss at icelandbut i think the difference between you and i is that your requirements for csm to be good is that the council works great together while i definitely see your point and to a large degree agree with you i think what really matters is that we make progress and that the council manages to make a difference and push forward the interest of the playerbase
its not the job of the csm to push forward the interests of the player base its the csms job to discuss and vote on issues that affect the majority of the players and will benefit them a consequence of this discussion and vote is that some issues have to be addressed by ccpcan you tell us how many issues in total were forwarded to ccp  not topics but individual issues  can you also tell us how many of those issues affect the majority of eve playershow much time in total was taken to discuss the pros and cons of the issues before voting in meetingshow much interaction and discussion did you and other csm members have via the forums on the specific issuestake carebruce hansen
oh shnap we have spies woah
yes if darius had wanted it to be solely bane he  darius   would have dropped out therefore darius changed his mind from his original desire heres something to ponder if darius had dropped out bane would now be the chair of the csm instead of jade kind of makes you think at risk of being called psychic ill venture that goonswarm will forward just one candidate next csm election however theres always the chance goonswarm will be smarter than thati mean jumping up and down like a red faced child during his attempt to block a vote in the first csm meeting i mean engaging in a fleet battle during the second csm meeting  couldnt be bothered to give his full attention to the meeting hes much to important for that   i mean trying to fan a bad situation into a fire in the third meeting by acting in the same rightously indignant fashion as he did in the first meeting and i mean his and goonswarms consistent and perpetual attempts to blow incidents from the csm out of proportion using these forums as a tool to do sothere were several in the third csm meeting who stood up to the chair as you put it only darius johnson found it necessary to have a tantrum both there and on the forums frankly with darius to base a measurement of goonswarm on bane comes as a surpriseregardswindjammerps i might be reading your text incorrectly in terms of tone but you seem surprisingly civil are you sure your heart is in this defense of your current ceo
thats too x fileish you may expect a reprimand from your glorious ceowindjammer
ive already said that it may be our intention to forward just one candidate youre neither astute clever or psychic for repeating such i doubt it will be necessary though as i suspect the value of the term chair has changed significantlyyoure free to characterize my actions however you like however i was not engaging in a fleet battle during the second meeting bane said i was i said clearly i am here in the chat channel i was however in a lagged system causing a delay a fact id made mention of in the beginning of the meeting and re goonswarm again you editorialize and you do so horribly goons or anyone else is well within their rights to say whatever they like dont let those facts get in the way of your neverending bluster and bull however
ill chalk it up to  envywindjammer
thats actually not the goonswarm i remember right to trash post doesnt equal right to say whatever you wantthe goonswarm i was in one was free to do and say whatever you wanted as long as you1   never questioned the directorate2   never questioned or even just tried to discuss or get a clarification on war strategy3   never let your burning hate for bob be doubted by making a balanced statement about themalso it was wise to adhere to expected communication patternsa   post in memes and one liners  this even applied to the war room on the gfcom forums  b   serious communication was generally something to be frowned upon it wasnt needed after all as the directorate in their fathomless wisdom already facilitated all the necessary thought process among themselves you just had to x upc   there are only allies  all super friends   enemies  to be meta hated   and pubbies  worthy of contempt   your outside communication had to reflect thisi would like to remind you of the goon who dared to deviate from said communication patterns and was ordered to facilitate his own banning from eveo  he posted close up pictures of a certain orifice and was perma banned not only from the forums but also from the game for this  goonswarm may have changed a little bit for the better since these days  probably due to the disappearence of the mittani   but events like the witch hunt on jade or the recent readmission of cippalipus primus in your ranks make me somehow doubt about the extent of this
im sorry you dont agree with the administration of the corp you are not a member of v0v be bitter about it
its not about my agreement with how goonswarm runs his business but about the public picture you recently try to paint of your allianceor let me put in simple words perhaps more suitable to your part of the audienceita about calling you on your bull
and what bull would that be you quoted me saying goons can post whatever they want they can wheres the bull
no they cant i listed topics that were taboo or at least frowned upon if they did so anyway they were either outright banned or on a minor offense ridiculed by the mob with the backing of the directorate for iti also gave a more prominent example of how unwelcome posts were suppressed by degrading one of your own members into banning himself from the eveo forums  and accidentally from the game itself  truth is that you indeed have many freedoms in goonfleet you dont have in other corpsalliances but the truth also is that when it comes to blind mass following mentality its also one of the worst
you gave an example that is simply not true today i cant speak for the past i am not trying to speak for the past in this regard at the least since i took over goons have been free to say whatever they like im pretty sure it was the same under sesfan tell me again what people in the corp youre not in and im ceo of are allowed to do
ive been posting i hope we lose for a long time and havent been banned   maybe you are shinori
haha i laughed at this because i couldnt stand shinori myself also shinori wasnt banned because he begged to differ but because he was even by goon standards a giant douche if im rightly informedso in this case i have to give mad props to whoever banned him
gosh you really put me in my place huh neither the position or term of chair has changed it never was what you feared it to be it never was a position of power it never made jade more important than you youve really had a phobia about that repeating the chant were all equal and having to be constantly reassured on that count have not helped your image the image of a frightened child concerned that hell cease to become the center of attentioni appreciate you giving me freedom to continue to characterize your actions i already possess this freedom but its amusing to see you think yourself important enough to grant it keep it up and your hats arent going to fitlets be clear on what you did in the second csm meeting first you made excuse for your lagged responses which wasted time for the csm meeting by saying you were in a war lagged system it was promptly suggested you move and that in the future csm members avoid situations during csm meetings such as you put yourself in second bane announced you told him you had just warped into a fleet battle and suggested voting be delayed while you were in that situation to your credit you did after a few moments tell the meeting you were there and did not ask for special consideration i call that engaging in a fleet battle even if you were just observing it still lagged you more you were in a war lagged system and instead of getting out of that system you went further into lag by warping into the battle and that darius demonstrates a lack of full attention to the csm meeting which is what i saidyou really should look up and attempt to gain a better understanding of the words you try to use words like editorialize and truth i understand you heardread ank use the term editorialize and im sure it looked like a big word to you and thats what tempted you to use it however using a word you dont fully understand only makes you look more like the little boy in his fathers too large shoes and hat proudly pronouncing himself to be a big boy now as far as the word truth you havent a clue as to the conceptre freedom within goonswarm absolutely members of goonswarm have the freedom to be or say anything they wish additionally they have the freedom to be harassed belittled and attacked for it they get to be called traitor coward and spy and on occasion they even get to be blown up ahhhhhfreedomfeels good doesnt it heres an interesting little concept for you peer pressure look it upwindjammerps the more i read from you the happier i am that youve assumed control of goonfleet

doesnt this part of the post kinda suggest that goumin is an alternate surely that inst the case oz is the second alternate afaik

there are a lot of good ideas but many fail the benefit the majority of eve players requirement unfortunately these also make it through meetings a firmer application of requirements rather than a focus on getting as many ideas to ccp as possible  whilst ignoring requirementsdiscussion and unclear explanation of the actual issue  when good ideas that met the requirements are voted on the csm can be said to be being effective simply by taking a lot of issues to ccp wont meet this criteriatake carebruce hansen
this requirement cannot conceivably be that each individual issue must benefit the majority of eve players because i can only think of about three issues that actually would ui fixes lag fixes and subscription fee reductions   and two of those arent topics the csm can reasonably bring up this game is way too fractured to have a majority interest in much of anything if im not mistaken it was a requirement that the csm process as a whole should benefit the majority of players which is a completely different requirement
its pretty evident from the documents reallythe purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player baseandthe key question that council members must consider before casting their vote is whether or not the issue at hand has the potential to improve or otherwise benefit the entire eve society and not just a select group within the communitythat was successful in bringing attention to their unique caseits also pretty clear that representatives mustengage the populace on all issue debates and discussions and candidates are expected to be active on the csm forums and participate in the discussion of topics and this requires active engagement with the player communityactive discussion and engagement on issues seems to have slipped past the majority of representativestake carebruce hansen
its their personal interests andor that of their buddiescorp the only way you can force a issue through is by getting 5 of eve to vote on it and the chances of that happening is small even then the chances of getting csm to spend any real effort on it is slim to none
while i wont comment on the issue itself its pretty obvious that more controversial issues with far less support have been pushed through as it was in the interest of a csm member
i think that isnt truei have personally been writing up submission templates for things like the colourblind issues and the maclinux clients im neither colourblind nor do i use maclinuxso how can you say its personal interest none of my friends have asked me to take up certain issues either if they did i would probably tell them to screw themselves and ask them to go write a post on the forumi can of course only talk on my own behalf i cant deny some council members are looking out for their own interest but you should certainly not expect for that to be true for all members
i do agree on that point things like lets see destructible outposts shouldnt even have been taken onto the agenda because of the extremely low support  but a member sponsered it so well
the members got their votes also for the issues they have put on their flags in their running campaignsthe votes for each of the csm members are far higher than the support in any    singleissuethread till now
im still trying to get my head around why theres so many meetingstheyre coming as little as three days apart whats the deal why not just hold longer meetings and get things done rather than spending a couple of hours bickering and asking people to come back in 3 days then rinsing and repeating the processive seen more organised riots tbh
well such things as colorblind issues and linux clients or many of the simple ui adjustments are very easy to support as it doesnt have any real impact on the game itself they also require a very low amount of input from the csm as such they cant really be compared to changes such as the changes the op proposed from your campaign and the issues you supported its easy to see you are mostly interested in market related changes that will benefit you and others in your situation nothing wrong with that as it is expected and what you seem to know best but then changes that fall outside the interests of those 9 elected members will naturally be overlooked as such the issues the csm will spend time on is largely determined by the csm members personal interests but then its up to the voters to vote on someone that will be interested in the same issues as them politicians never represent the people only special interest groups one just hopes that with enough special interest groups represented the politicians cover a larger amount of the population
yes such things ruin what little faith people have in the csm program
our meetings are usually 1 week apart but due to having to submit the agenda we have had an extra meeting as for longer meetings its a challenge with both us and eu crew at least during week days during weekend theres no reason other than how much we can get onto the meeting at any given time
people were told that if they were to apply to be a candidate then theyd need to dedicate the time to be able to do whats asked of themi dont see this as a vaild argument tbh if people want to be on the csm they should make sure they have the time and the chair should make sure the meetings are organised so that under regular circusmstances everyone is able to attend
i have to agree totally with verone and ive said as much elsewhere you stood  as others also did   fully aware of the commitment you would need to give if you cant give this commitment withdraw and let one of the alternates that can take your place its that simple meetings take time and when you start to discuss an issue it might take an hour or two to come to the point where everyone can make an informed vote start putting just issues that affect the majority of eve players onto the agenda and your meetings may get a little shortertake carebruce hansen
oh i do agree with you and i have till this point attended all meetings even though i didnt have the time but i did take the time to attend all meetingsbut still lets not forget that in some cases people just wont be able to attend and i think we have to respect that
if that continues to be true and ive not seen that yet on anything important and gamechanging just some bureacracy internal to the csm then that is not the fault of the system but of the chair and those who elected that chairgrandstanding and complaining about the entire damn system being broken sounds very grand but the truth is the system works its who you get into the system that can be gamed oddly enough and i do find it mildly ironic youre busy levelling the same criticisms that quite a few levelled when those from goonswarm ran in the first place  that itd be run by the goons for the goons etc  after all 6 months from now jade is no longer chair and so the system solves that particular issue anyway personally id wait to see the transcript from when they actually have to do these things in person amazing what a bit of facetoface meeting can do
i want to see the csm working also however it will never be really successful until the csm stops the preoccupation with voting on issues to be escalated to ccp by this i mean the followinga issue  not multiple issues   presented in a clear and well thought out manner on the forum in assembly hallb issue after 7 days of discussion is free to be raised by a representative for discussion in a meeting this means if it has been on forums for 7 days it can be raised regardless if it is on the agenda or not obviously for a csm advance warning via an agenda is desirable so everyone on csm can become familiar with issue and the arguments etcc issue is raised in a csm meeting obviously some personal issues and smallgroup issues will make it to this stage d the issue is discussed and the arguments for and against it heard consideration of the issue in light of the requirement that it must affect the majority of eve players needs to happen here if it doesnt meet the requirement it should be voted oute representatives vote on the issue taking into consideration d above f a consequence of a successful vote by majority is that the issue is presented to ccp this is a consequence not the prime goal of the csm voteat present i think that the some csm members have forgotten about what their goal is not to present as many issues to ccp as possible but to decide which issues affect the majority of eve players and are actual issues which are important to be given further considerationit is not the job of the csm to decide or suggest possible fixes but highlighting why the issue is an issue worth ccp consideration with examples is probably good practice to clarify itcurrently step a is poorly done  not just by csm members but also by players   take carebruce hansen
good argument signedthere do need to be changes in game mechanics involving looting and salvaging wrecks and this is definitely one of themof course i think it should expand to salvaging wrecks not belonging to you as well because  after all  it is stealing in a sense and should be dealt with accordinglytchell dahn i dont think its you or your corp that would be the ones that do the killing i think you guys fall on the other side of the spectrum

i had my own thread here
this needs tuning in a few parts  not charismawillpower percentage based reduction   but i like the general idea i dont think rank 6 is something that necessarily needs to be changed since it should be a skill that takes you a good while to train up fully but that final decision would be up to ccp in any casesupported for the csm to bring this to ccps attention
i use 90s and would like to keep doing so
fat chance this is going to happen hehyou can post here all you like but ccp has made up its mind
would make rattingmining on 00 practically unavailiable reason is that a recon would travel each belt cloacked to see if something is there then all of a sudden the minerratter would have a whole gang scrambling him let alone that the small gangs would no logner camp the gates they would simply sit in safespots within popular rattingmining systems as are oe4hb 42x etc on tenal and have a couple of covert ops to scan for ratters miners in the end of the day they would simply log out at the safespot only to reappear the next day to do some more griefing is this your idea of fun the alliances would be practicaly impossible to scan the systems with covert ops daily the so called sovereignity would be a joke since there wouldnt be any way to actually controltake advantage of system like thisthat is why i am against this idea

support with bells onthe level of support and  especially  the level of engagement is an utter disgraceim sure many of the problems actually lie with the muppets at transgaming rather than ccp but it is not unreasonable to expect clear and regular
im sorry i didnt catch this one sooner call me support as well i have been a vocal supporter of the official client over any other approach but in order to even play properly these days i too use wine  premium graphics im only looking at the official client to see if it has been patched or not these days it is very disturbing to a community of users to see a wellspring of initial excitement and support from developers for new platforms only to later suddenly and mysteriously just shut up and keep quiet when keeping quiet is the absolute worst thing to be done at the timeccp promised that all platforms would be equally supported and that there would be no disparity between clients currently and since the release of trinity there has been disparity no premium graphics option for those who have the hardware is the primary issue but the technical snafus that have plagued the official linuxmac clients are ongoing and not on the same field with the dx9 clientthe developers have gone silent on multiplatform support and their co programmers at tg who were supposed to be more vocal in our forums to assist with issues and get feedback have never maintained any presence ccp whisper and lingorm have been of some help but even they fell silent a couple weeks back in the linux forums with nothing forthcoming since then
support from me tooi can only run eve on mac i have no other optionsat times the issues are so bad that i wonder if it wouldnt be worth it to buy a lightweight gaming rig pc just for eve

yes the overall trend is the erosion from the base price an average of 33 across the board but as only 1 effectively out of the 16 have not fallen  trit   without the rises it shows a 45 decreace on average mercoxit could also be left out as its a t2 not a t1 base item and at a 72 from base it may give an indication that base price may have lost its meaning or the market is well over supplied the question as i see it is really as supply and demand set the price why is veldspar in short supply  high price   even though it is the most plentful of ores in the lowest risk areas  high sec   if supply was plentliful it would be following the overall trend which has to be downward as the base ammount present of everything in new eden is always being added too no matter how many ships get blown up the available quantity grows daily veldspar is the basis of life and source of all profit maybe chribba has it sussed with the veldnought people see no glamour sitting in high sec chewing veld even though thats where the money is it could be a simple as that
its all about opportunity cost on average as time goes on more and more people will do whatever it is that gets them more cash in the long run if the risk levels are relatively the same or might take on a higher risk if the reward is proportional is mining veldspar better than running l3 mission at your skills  youll mine veldspar is ratting in the drone regions more profitable than mining arkonor in some 00  youll rat in the drone regions is running l4s in highsec better than ratting in some 00  youll run l4s in highsec and so on and so forth given equal risk levels more and more people will do whatever is more profitableyes exceptions exist people that keep doing whatever it was they were doing without checking and rechecking  like for instance people mining jaspet in lowsec like crazy because they used to do that for a good profit a long time ago and they didnt bother veryfing if its still the case   but like i said on average more people will do the more profitable things and a lot less the less profitable onesand to answer your why question more clearly  because the only reliable and sufficient source of tritanium in the vast quantities that tritanium is required  compared to the other minerals   is mining veldsparwant pyerite  theres a vast surplus of pyerite from missionrunners and people reprocessing npcsold items that contain both tritanium and pyerite as they need tritanium but have no use for the pyeritewant nocxium or megacyte  theres a vast surplus of all of these coming over from the drone regions slightly less megacyte lately so it corrected a litle bitmexallon was very high for a while as it was needed in significant quantities in the drone regions as a little bit of megacyte was replaced by a chunk of mexallon in one of the alloys dropped there megacyte prices rose and mexallon prices droppedand so on and so forth for each rise and fall of mineral prices theres always a trivial explanation on how changes made by ccp and only those changes alone fully explain all the deviations in price of individual minerals
i dont totally agree with some of the solutions suggested but i do very strongly agree that this is one area that could use some attention so ill support the idea anyways
ok in order1 ok first off how the hell do you plan to impliment this given the kind of database they use never mind that this solution is so childishly simple to game its rediculous simply set up in one of the bascialy empty stations in low00 and swap say veldspar at 1000000000 per to put artifical preasure on that mineral to drive the price down or if you want help freeze people out just endlessly trade thousands of nocxium at 01 per thus causing the bps to suddenly demand more nox the second problem it does nothing about the seemingly ever growing supply of minerals lets face it given the combined fact of improving me  fewer minerals used with the reality that between improved skills and better modules and better ships running missions theirs more minerals hitting the marketplace the other problem with this idea its a  surprisingly lame   attempt to price fix bascialy what your trying to do akita is casping your little producerce hat in your hand and begging ccp to please please please make it so that nothing can sell for under this price because if anyone does their only cutting there own necks2  sigh   where do i even start with this one  a again how the hell do you plan to do this with eves database first every time you creat a new bpo with this system your actualy creating a new basetype in the reference database both the normal bpos the researched bpos and the bpc all refer to the base type in the database after all second how often do you do this to the reference database daily weekly monthly once a year with the system they use the fewer calls and searches on it the better and the smaller you can keep it  the basetype database   the better thirdb   what about the person with the older and now mutch more expensive  or cheeper depending on how prices go   bpo force them to buy a new one perhapsc   incidentaly you also managed to combine the problems with your previous sugestion3   ok so you bascialy want to just spread out and randomise moon resources a bit more bascialy thats just going to  off the people who have the monopolies  see the never ending arguments about why people were allowed to keep their t2 bpos once they put invention into the game   and force people to go looking for other moons to work because some of the moon they have are suddenly worthless and odds are some of thoes moons will be just like they are left undeveloped because its still not cost efective to mine 1 unit of the current high priced mineral a day  yes their are moons with no poses by them for whatever reason  4   ok first off taking away the rewards from mission runnersratters plex runners is generaly considered to be a non starter second a better idea might be to shift respawn on roids based on the maket value
the mineral prices youre using are slightly different than the ones i based my numbers off but sure well use yours what is wrong with any of those numbers as i said above and in a couple other threads lowsec needs a boost but the values seem to line up well with the risks aside from that the only problem i see here is that youre treating base prices like they mean anything  to my understanding theyre relics from a halfdecade ago when ccp was trying to manage the economy delete the base prices columns from all your tables and youll get an accurate representation of the real situation their only actual utility is in insurance calculations and that needs to change to a marketbased system instead of a fiatbased system ive got a thread on that very topic lurking in these forums so youre advocating that we make bad items more expensive im generally opposed to that  i like the fact that newbies can fit up ships for dirt cheap youre also suggesting that we remove a sizable proportion of the income from combat with npcs  i do l4 missions and id say unnamed loot drops are somewhere between 10 and 20 of my income you seem to dislike the fact that ccp changes costbenefit ratios for various activities but are encouraging it in this case because it fits in better with how you want the game to look i could conceivably support this but id need hard data suggesting that the reason for certain minerals being dirt cheap is that reprocessing is fulfilling the vast majority of the demand not just supposition

where do i start first off you assume that i meant some automatic method of adjusting prices on a daily basis or somesuch i certainly didnt mean that but ok lets even assume for a second that this would indeed be the caseconsidering your presented exploits the outliers  materials traded far above or far below recent averages or traded volumes far above regional averages in a single location and so on   can easily be discarded for this calculations purposes in the case of lowvalued minerals setting an insanely high price means you lose quite a lot on trade taxes so i can only question the utility even if those prices wouldnt be filtered out  in the case on highvalued minerals you either have to spend a lot of time  and taxes   in order to slowly adjust regional average prices and average volumes while risking that somebody could just come in and swipe all your lowbrow orders or you are easily filtered out because your prices are insignificant either way what i actually meant by slowlyconstantly was every weekmonth somebody from ccp will look at things and decide what this weeksmonths adjustments should be if any to some highdemand product blueprints it makes sense from multiple perspectives  you tweak the least amount of blueprints so its not a big deal to follow in patchnotes but you generate the most impact on the mineral market also as you only slightly but often tweak them it even sort of follows rpwise  those in high demand get improved by the empires in terms of costeffectiveness  to your second problem and third other problem nothing you can possibly do with mineral price ratios will do anything about the ever growing supply of minerals as long as the insurance system remains in place the aggregate price of minerals in the average ratios used in ship construction will always hover somewhere above 70 of the base price of the same aggregate so it would be at best a futile attempt to even try to solve this problem in any other way except reducing insurance payouts but im pretty sure some people would be insanely upset in case thats ever going to happenits pointless of you to claim i would have some vested interest in keeping goods above or below a certain price when insurance already does it marvellously and in case insurance would go away and these changes proposed would go live  fast and often   the endresult would be a lowering of prices not an increasestill i dont see insurance getting any changes any time soon so your two issues here are completely moot
a you couldnt possibly know all that much about databases because if you did you wouldnt say that in this particular case of a type addition the added computing requirements are minimal if even noticeable at all in case no instances of it are spawned and in case any are instanced it would be not more cpuintensive as instancing just about any other item typeb nobodys forcing them to do anything and given enough time  not that long actually   the fact that the output products are identical market forces will cause the two blueprint variants to end up being equally valuable the only advantage anybody will have will be for those who buy the alternative blueprint and use it massively before the opportunity to use it at higher profits has passed translation not a problem at allc im not exactly sure what you mean by this that is to say i fail to see a connection between whats been said so far by either of us and this remark here by you maybe you could explain what you mean or just drop it altogether in case the above answers have cleared things up
you mush have misunderstood this quite badly toothe original moon material distribution ratios would remain exactly the same as they are right now or would even be boosted if anythingall that happens is that most other moon materials will be added to all moons in very small quantitiesso for instance instead of having an extractor that extracts exactly 100 units per hour you could have extraction rates anywhere from 1 to 100 or even from 1 to 500 per hour depending on concentrationthe whole point is that overall adding all concentrations of all of one type of material the ratios of totally availablemoonmineable materials should be almost identical to the overall requirement ratios in the whole industrythis would still keep the moons that are now valuable the most valuable  even boost their value a bit in case due to concentration one allows more than just 100 units to be extracted hourly   but will be adding some value to a lot more moons that previously had next to noneyes a lot of moons that only extract 1 dysprosium per hour will probably be left alone in the long run but then again at the current prices thats almost 60 mil isk per month so youd be silly not to mine it as long as prices keep so high after a while when dysprosium promethium neodymium and thulium all start settling in roughly the same price range the moons with just traces of dysprosium will either be abandoned or switched to mine something else instead on the same moon something that gives a better profit per hourthis way you get a selfregulating system while at the same time maintaining value differencesfirst off you have a bit of trouble understanding the concept of how mineral prices fluctuate it seems no the overall value of the loot and alloys a rattermissioneer will be getting not be changing significantly in this whole set of changes just like how a raven doesnt change value regardless of how each individual mineral fluctuates all that would change will be where exactly theyre getting their value from in terms of mineral in the reprocessable lootsecond just moving ores around willynilly wouldnt solve all that much so what do you really plan to do move veldspar to lowsec for instance you do realize that by doing that you create a lot more problems than you solve veldspar prices would go up even further then what move it to 00 only  thats just silly
i understand about opportunity cost but if they have the isk then no matter what the price of trit is they will pay as they can afford it keeping set prices and static differentials be buggered veldtrit in short supply so pay noobs to mine it in 10 large corporations dont worry about minerals they can go strip a system to meet their building requirements they dont need the market cost dont really matter to them they are a collective and their existance is strenght through cooperation in all things if they cant get enough trit or maon about relative worths they are poorly inspired managed and motivated tbh what segment of the player population actually buys minerals and ores off the market traders industrialists pvp corps and pod pilots who have no mining  refining   skills opportunists and ppl who make time value judgements on how to wipe thier arses based on how l33t they think they are  sounding like a goon   in a game they can never winas they dont have the skills or feel its below them to work at the roid face for little reward in the saftey of 10 they deserve to pay well over the odds for it they made a decision that sitting in jita undercutting by 001 while waiting on their science and industry job lines to complete when they could be in a hulk nice and safe in 1009 mining veld and remotely manipulating them and contributing to their botton line even more  ok thats just a rant not an actuality or is it   drops put only 10 of minerals in the game at best im sure ccp have an exact value they are not tweaking dropsloot so they dont think its a problem as its a very easy thing to do the ore price differentials you give are still remaining basically the same in relation to each other to a great degree its just veld that is under supplied and so up in valueif veld is a bottleneck so be it its a market driver that helps new players to make isk to pay for books etc new players are the reason for insurance in the first place thier losses and lack of profit opportunity literally makes the game unattractive to play for them so its mitigatedcompensated base price must go to be replaced with daily universial mean and insurance should be linked to thatagain i say its presently a perceived not a real issue and it is under devolopment within a much larger framework which is not yet advanced or stable enough for announcement the time scale on stuff like this is long as its complex to get it right and presentable so it can be announced and greeted with a about time good work cant wait for it player reaction
so wait youre telling me that veldspar the most widely available  and on the intended baseprice listing the least valuable   ore being 40 more valuable  on average in hubs up to 60 more valuable   than the base and relatively up to 75 more valuable overall than the basket  or double in hubs   is not a problem or the fact that its equally valuable to one of the rarer limitedavailability bottom highsec ores  kernite   one thats supposed to be 26 times more valuable than veldspar or heck the fact that its more valuable than two lowseconly ores  jaspet hemorphite   that are supposed to be 28 respectively 335 times more valuable  damn it even the last remaining valuable lowsec ore  hedbergite   is barely worth 20 more when its supposed to be 375 in value screw that what about spodumain a 00 only ore which should have been worth almost 48 times more and its now barely worth a bit over 50 more yeah all is fine my ass
yes its not a problem its a reflection of lack of supply its the limiter to a degree on production you said your self its the most plentiful ore in existance but it is expensive as ppl dont mine it enuf to meet demand it stays locked in a rock the market has spoken it is in low supply  not enuf miners   so it carries rariety value even though its everywhereas i said before base price  and to a lesser extent differentials   is not a guide to anything apart from the day it was written on a web page eve ecomonics are player driven within basically unlimited resources  we are only talking about roids here so dont start on moons   its our choice to gravitate towards x or y we do what we think is sexy and will provide funprofittake a look at chribba the king of veldspar he has more intelligence in his little finger than we have collectivly as he was wise enough to know ppl wont mine veld as its not thought of as sexy and its the limiter of supply as so much is required hes win win alliances control all the high end stuff that resides in null sec and to a lesser extent low sec they could force the price up of basic high end ores and minerals if they formed an effective cartel or cartel groups to control supply  think oil industry   if they made sure only very limited supplies of zydrine or morphite reaches the empire market they could cripple empire totally the potential for it to happen is there the game mechanics exist to do it but it doesnt happen  it could if so many ppl didnt polish thier epeen by meta gaming   should that be changed
yup thats exactly what im telling you you have this strange obsession with irrelevant numbers pulled out of a devs ass in 2002 and its leading you horribly astray when you look at the market as of 2008 none of those ores are supposed to be worth more than any other  theres size refine amounts and availability and the prices follow from that its like saying that pork is supposed to be worth twice as much as beef because of a government agriculture subsidy established in 1930 and then complaining about how out of whack the market is when pigs cost half as much to raise and slaughter the flaw here isnt with the free market its with your commandeconomy baseline

no supportso lets see those peeps who want to scrap the learning skills are  generally   using the reason that they are a waste of time fine have ccp return your sps but at the same time have them reduce your attributes respectively you seem to want the benefits of the higher attributes without having to expend the time it takes to get them there put simply you want a quickfix i win buttonnew characters now start with 800000 sps compared to the 80000 older players had  with my notquitemaxed learning skills that is equivalent to approx 2 weeks of trainingsoct skills now only have a prerequisite of the relevant basic skill at lvl 4 as against the previous requirement of lvl 5  saving over 30 days trainingimplants now cost  25 of the price they were 3 years ago and with the new loyalty store they are much easier to get hold ofassuming that you dont want to completely remove training time from the game there is nothing wrong with the current system not training learning skills does not stop anyone from playing the game it merely means it will take longer to attain the necessary skills investing some of your training time to the learning skills will reap rewards in the longtermat the end of the day eveonline has always been a game where effort  reward removing learning skills would be similar to starting other rpgs at level 10 and in doing so the players would miss an important part of the game part of the magic of eve is that while you are training those learning skills you are also learning how to play the game
what are you straight from special ed clicking train skill doesnt take effort unlike you know grinding levels in wownow you might argue that farming 225mil to buy learning skills is a fun activity that every new player must go through it might be hard to understand for an industryoriented player such as yourself  you are missing accel control 4 by the way   but not everybody enjoys running missions over and over
you misspelled stupid carebear
i fully support this issuei suggest that you add both the password security bar and the failed logins message by default the audit log is also a great idea i also agree with having any sort of ip lockout as an advanced and agree to service
i like this idea thumbs up from me
very good idea
tarminic ccp customer service response state when lag problems occur that its a client side issue problem not lag not address the lag issue is a form of denial it is clear lag occurs and it is clear that the server priorities some clients over others it is clear that the server lags and similar combat especially if you dont get kill rights as i said above loser lag  winners dont
they claim the logs show nothing thus they dont directly blame the client a bit evasive way of saying we know theres a problem but we cant fix it atm and giving out reimbursements for this would cause a lot of problems
i couldnt agree more
fypseriously grow up the goons have 2 members on the council and still  every day its ing pathetic and so are youalso all the critics need to stop using democracy as their reason you clearly dont understand it or you wouldnt attempt to overthrow the top democratically elected official while simultaneously claiming youre doing it for democracy jade was elected chair and is the top votegetter in the csm elections in light of that she wins every argument that uses democracy as the measurement period and by definition every attempt to remove her as chair or limit her ability to act either as a csm or chair is undemocraticfrom reading the complaints against jade what most of them seem to be getting at is that she is authoritarian  or against anarchism   that is not incompatible with democracy as in most democratic systems the elected officials have allmost of the authorityedit  learn your governments noobs
my government has the ability to impeach presidents that were democratically elected because they are bad
then your government is a republic
assuming that mr all caps is an american then youre right but your statement does not logically follow from what he said for example in a westminster system if the mps lose confidence in one person as prime minister and decide that theyd prefer another person to have the title then that second one becomes pm the person at the top gets kicked out but its hardly undemocratic  if anything its a better expression of democracy since the voters changing their minds results in a change in the outcome similarly see any type of recall vote using words like undemocratic is excessive  the worst that can be said is that people are looking to do something not allowed by what passes for the constitution that statement at least has the virtue of accuracy
fixed
in a westminster system there is no direct popular vote regarding any position other than mp so your point is muddled at best the example of a presidency was better to use as that position is voted on directly by the populace but can be ousted by something other than another popular vote obviously in that case the rule of law is greater than the popular vote in your example its rule of law on both sides and no direct elections have occuredrecall votes can be democratic but i should point out that they are unnecessary in a true democracy in a true democracy there would simply be another election whenever the voters wantedno its not excessive jade was elected to the chair by popular vote by definition anything other than another popular vote that removes her is undemocratic your argument that the westminster system allows for more democracy because it allows voters to change their minds only carries weight if the replacement mechanicsystem is at least as democratic as the method used to place the person in office to begin with the two are the same in the westminster system it is undemocratic if the council removes a chair voted in by popular voteand lets not stray too far from the point here jade was elected to the chair by popular vote the goons claim to want to remove her for democratic reasons i am pointing out that there is only one truly democratic way to remove or replace a directly elected position
lets not make any mistakes here this started when jade constantine threw out hardin from a meeting against the language in the csm founding document he exerted powers that he did not have in order to gain an advantage over an in game enemy this escalated when hardin brought a general motion to the council to formalize when alternates were to stand in for elected representatives jade argued hard against this vote and why wouldnt he he had just the previous meeting excluded another representative with no grounds or authority when jade lost that vote he editorialized it in a manner to make everyone else look bad a member of the council named inanna zunni objected to this later in that same meeting jade muted inanna for making points of order without explanation which many of the council members objected to and then during another vote badgered council members who had already voted into changing their vote before it endedare goonswarm just defending their own in some partisan political playunlikely hardin is no friend to goonswarm we are neutral we have worked together in the past but typically fight each other we have a mutual understanding that each will use each other for their own means until such a time as it becomes strategically expedient to do the opposite we can work together on the council because we also have a mutual understanding that the council is not a place for those machinations there is nothing to gain for gs or to take away from our enemies when the game is made more fun everyone benefits whether or not that is for the 10000 people playing factional warfare the 20000 people in 00 or the 40 people who want to destroy stations there is only the goal to make the game that we all play betterinanna zunni is a member of electus matari an enemy of cva for their entire time within the game allies to ursha kahn during the war where cva took their space and sent them back to empire and in general not good friendsin terms of relevancy to us jade constantine is farther off the radar that groups like repo who are so far off the radar that half of the goons probably dont even know who they are despite war decs going on for the past year or so most what we have had to talk about internally is explaining who jade was to the majority of goonswe have no reason to support either of these people nor to move against jade it gains us nothingit is only if the council is to be subverted from its goal of making the game better that we would have any reason to be up in arms because we have a stake in having fun
keep digging jade went emo on coad a few times and it seems people forgot about that mr ego doesnt like to be contradicted it was self destructive back then and it is now
i couldnt keep up with it after page 7 but jade averaged over 100 words per post and has about 20 posts during that time frame its the internet equivalent of terry pratchetts 5 exclamation points
agree
i support this based on the transcript of the meeting and jades unprofessional behavior in this thread and the meetingi dont care if the person holding the chair roleplays a drop bear they should be able to separate the position from their roleplay and leave tourists alone for the duration of the meeting if not theyre failing the playerbase and dont deserve the position
they fail your player base if you dont like it you and the rest of the goons are free to get the hell out beg permission to return to second life and rain some  againeve would be better without you
why bother just go back to wow
the first letter of a sentence is capitalized you fail you mean this 20080531 205154 hardin  okay happy to let tusko go on those 20080531 205205 hardin  but dont agree with the administrative principle 20080531 205224 jade constantine  kk well get a proper discussion and vote and decide on it with open discussion hardin 20080531 205232 jade constantine  for next time okay 20080531 205236 hardin  surethe menacing way jade says for next time okay is chilling just chillingyou are making a mountain out of a molehill you dont have to assign your own motives to jades discussion and vote of this topic she gave them herself in the chat logs and it wasnt because it would make her decision in the previous meeting look badshe had also restated the proposal earlier in the conversation in the exact way you claim is editorialized and no one objected 20080608 181452  jade constantine  okay does anyone want to say something against hardins proposal  which is  in effect   that any alternative who takes a seat at a meeting can be displaced at any point in that meeting by a csm candidate returning to take over the voting on the remainder 20080608 181457  serenity steele  it seems unreasonable to me in the current term serving criteria for alternates to only partially participate in a meeting after making the time free to attend 20080608 181507  inanna zuni  so far as someone leaving during the meeting depends if they have gone or their comms line went down should we penalize for an isp failure 20080608 181538  lavista vista  if the person comes back he just takes over 20080608 181549  inanna zuni   at the end of the current item 20080608 181600  hardin  yep 20080608 181606  serenity steele  inanna imo yes we should penalize for an isp failure those are the breaks  get a better isp or backup if its that critical 20080608 181607  dierdra vaal  i agree with serenity except i believe the solution is to change the rules so an alt is not counted as having served a term 20080608 181614  lavista vista  but we cant be halted because someone have a failure the person looses out on a vote or two no big dealreally you are trying too hardjade muted inanna for disrupting a vote this was something that was voted on in the first meeting and it is right for her to do thisyoure going to have to point out where she did the badgering your spin is so unspecific i cant tell what you meanare strawmen really that dangerous to goonswarm
im not aware of anyone  other than yourself   claiming that there is a conspiracy going on in the councillooks like another strawman argumentyour consistent and focused attacks on council members proves that you cant work together in the councilaccording to darius he only represents goonswarm interests on the council you guys had better get your stories straight
never played wow i only play eve
i will welcome you to provide the quote of me saying this alt
yeah i wanna see it to because if he did id like him off the csm aswell but i have only seen sofar his want to keep himself open to public scrutiny and wants nothing behind closed doors
hmm seems jade has a new alt sees goons everywhere still i see yes yes i know im a goon too goods are everywhere wait is that a bagelbite or is a good disguised as a bagelbite let the goon hysteria begin oh btw ya really are pitiful
hmm cant find the post so ill retract it for now
i dont think youll find one you may find one of others saying he does but ive followed the csm posts and have never seen darius say he was only out for goonswarm interests if he did id call for his removal and i think he knows full well it would go over like a lead balloon
if jade is willing to mute a csm rep then how long till he tries to mute the people
that has already happened theyre representatives that dont actually represent us the issues of greatest concern to the players are not the ones being put forth for discussion
this seems to sum up the speed issue nicely
certainly
issue is same classes not being able to hit eachother and hacs coupled with speed and huge double extender buffer tanks also going over 8 kms or faster which sometimes out speed the dedicated tacklers like interceptors even if the ceptor is faster the approach and orbit around the hac will be too slow to survive
i think miladianeces has made it pretty clear that hes not here to logically respond to threads he has yet to answer my challenge  claiming ive hurt his feelings as an excuse   has yet to respond to your very valid points and seems to only be interested in bouncing between his alts to make childish posts or to avoid presenting an actual argument  as his above posts clearly exemplify  i think its fair to say that hes not here to discuss however i think newcomers to this thread can see through his antics  since theres not much else to see  
ah well its first item on the agenda for tomorrow fingers crossed we get it through
fantastic thanks for the help jade please keep us posted on how it goes today
i really hope they fix thisnighthawk is very underpowered compared to the other field command ships
ah thanks jade even if the devs turn round and say hehe no the nighthawks anaemic pg and useless precision bonus are specifically designed for its role as a slow but safe afk l4 missionrunner  it is not intended as a pvp ship then at least wed know where we stand
excellent thread excellent point i support it completely maybe im biased because im a caldari pilot but i havent given this topic much thought before and from what im seeing here it looks like this is an issue that needs to be addressed asap
this would be a good addition at the same time basically if its in your possession it should be able to be searched in the assets tab thats what assets means
booya
look at dat fuggin post
you would dare disrupt the game in this manner how dare youmutes you
i am crossposting this since the ideas forum seems to get zero traffic these dayswhile i am a mission runner by choice i have definitely not run every mission there is so may have listed something below already in the game somewhere but i have noticed a definite trend oftake item x to location y  bring item x from location y  mining and courier   orgo to location x kill some rats optionally loot something bring it back and that seems to be it just wondering about ways to make this a bit more varied for examplemission quality needs to be better tied to agent quality and with more missions be tied to increases in standing  would be nice to get this with factions as well as corporations  im over 80 with cstate now my storylines should reflect the trust  a rescue mission  to have a container which you have to put something into like a battery for a dead spaceship to enable it to limp home under its own power after exploding its experimental capacitor maybe you only get a general location from the agent who gives you a special high slot mod that lets you scan for that specific ships signature  and no other ships to stop people stealing the mod and using it for pvp purposes    therefore requiring you to actually find the thing firststealth missions where you have to use a cloaked ship to covertly loot something delicate that would be destroyed by doing in with all guns blazing perhaps could go loot the thing and then go in guns blazing in your mission runner    could also be required to drop some kind of probe in an enemy base to provide intel  make surveillance agents actually gather some intelligence as wellexploration missions where you have to survey a remote area of a system  again requiring a special mod from the agent perhaps be rewarded by a deadspace pocket to minekill inlargescale courier missions that make me think it was worth the millions of isk and months of training to be able to buy  fly my freighterbetter risk vs reward level 3 guristas extra for instance  the hidden 6th area has a bs in there and also a silo labelled as the leaders stash  yet it is always empty when destroyed and the bs rarely drops anything more interesting than a standard siege launcher would be nice to get a random minor piece of guristas faction equipment in there i just finished new frontiers for the first time and the whole story arc is talking about experimental technology but at the end all you end up with is a stack of cash and a stack of lp  hellord missions where you have to test a newlydeveloped module in action and report back it performs well but unreliablypirates have hacked an acceleration gate aqnd set it so only small ships can get through the missiongiving corp have tried to send their own small attack craft but they just get wasted they need a highly skilled pilot basically a small hull mission  restrictions on the gate to force you to change out your uber cnr  or whatever you fly   and blow the dust off your t2 frigate obviously the mission after the jump needs to be challenging for a higher skilled pilot than the type normally running level 1srunning the gauntlet  an urgent package needs to be delivered to a research station but an unpredictable plasma storm has been blocking the approach vectors for weeks and shows no sign of stopping our scientists have figured out a way through the storm that will probably be safe but youll need a fast nimble ship to get through mission requires a ship capable of going at  eg   1 kms and must navigate between however many markers it is in the mission space in a specific sequence to be effective this would require some environmental damage not sure eve mechanics can cope with that at the moment continued
from under their noses  a variation of the stealth mission noted in the first post  the target is a lootable container being guarded by a bruiser of a ship too difficult to take out by combat  superpowerful reppers or something   the key to the mission is to lock the ship down with a tackler waltz in grab the loot and hightail it outedit  another survellianceintelligence type mission  the agent wants you to fly to certain out of the way spots in a couple of systems  or maybe even all systems within a constellation for a better reward   and launch a surveillance probe at each location just to help them keep an eye on thingsmore edit  mining mission a ship carrying secret cargo crashed into an asteroid field at high speed the cargo is embedded in one of the roids you have to go mine the field and find whats left of it  mechanic here would be when the mining laser pops the roid a lootable cargo can appears  more edit 2  variation of the mining mission above the agent has had a tip off that a certain asteroid field is very special  some of the ores look like fairly innocuous veldsparscordite roids but actually have a core compused of pure  insert random rare ore here   go mine it and bring a share of the ore back to the agent  not all of it gotta keep the reward thing going   i really would like to have variation of reward back as well i miss the time where you were sometimes rewarded with goods rather than cash  i still have my little fleet of frigates in a hangar somewhereand more on variation in reward  as well as the goods option an option to take all lps or all cash instead of the splitmy main thing here is to change the current state where a single ship  set up is the only thing required to successfully perform every mission out there anyone have other ideas to vary the goals and mechanics of the missions at all to make them more varied
if we could get this and downvoting that would be amazing
thumbsrup
i would like to pledge one  1   thumb to this cause
a great idea
supportedthis post is in violation with the general forum rules
stations have windows your pod doesnt the only way to see in space is through your ships navigator drones or somethingthis bit of backstory will get lost with ambulation tho so youll be able to complain about it at full power once the patch is deployed
this is a small and id think uncontroversial requestid ask to introduce a way to sort your inventory by meta leveli think we all know the pain when youre cleaning up your inventory and have to decide what to keep for selling or using yourself and what to reprocess this can take some time if your inventory fills up during extended time of missioningratting it would make things a lot easier if we could sort our inventory by meta level so one could just select all items of meta level 3 and lower and reprocess the trashthe easiest way would be to simply introduce a new column in the details mode of inventory management window so one could sort it in ascending and descending order
i support my own motion because its awesome and you should too
oh lord yes this would save me so much time when clearing out my named mission loot  i have all the unnnamed names memorized but theres no way i could keep up with all the grades of named stuff itd also help newbies a lot im sure
yes having a column with the meta level would make sorting out the loot so much more easy fully supported

large projectiles in general need to be looked at scaling between the guns is poor and not consistent with other weapon types there is simply no good explanation for this  for example why the jump from middle tier large acs to highest tier acs should result in a smaller damage increase than going from middle tier large blasters to highest tier  
as people have said its not that minmatar weapons suck they really dont its that the conditions for which they are designed are completely absent in battleshipscale fights whether the solution to this involves changing the guns as the op suggested or changing one or more ships as goum suggest im leaving up to ccp but i think this should be brought to them by the council

as a supporter of the nation and someone who has no idea who their current leadership is what their goals are or if there is any more to them than zombots i strongly support both the ideas to introduce new pieces of flavor material and a general fleshing out of factions that seem to get ignored in the wake of the big four

agreed that there needs to be alot more interaction within the world of eve that corresponds towards player events as well as information about eve as a wholeit is also quite disappointing that the pirate corporations  player and npc   receive little to no attention in these regards

pretty much yes on all accounts
youre pretty much wrong i am glad that the csm ignores topics like monstertrucksas i understand it the csm acts like a filter between ccp and the playerbase the 5 rule makes it so that it is possible to force an issue through the csm and to ccp in other words if monstertrucks gets 5 it goes to ccpnice stats though and interesting read
being worked onwell why havent darius raised it to the councilis already sent off as a part of the agendaalready being worked on by ccp as per the first chat logalready raisedthis is already raised as a part of the csm should vote for its own chairmanthis is the funky pos alterations issue so you are contradicting yourselfankh raised thisget one of your csm representatives to raise it i dont know why it wasnt raised beyond time issueswe are requesting to talk the ia this could very well be a part of it but we have to make the request firsti dont know why this wasnt raisedthere is no such thing as a vote of no confidenec from what i understand from ccp but this kinda goes hand in hand with the voteable chairmanat the time of our last meeting for the iceland agenda the topic hadnt received 7 days discussionthis issue is being brought up tonight at our meeting we hope ccp will adopt it to the iceland agendathis was raisedthis means the csm works as intended filter trough stupid ideas
but people would whine if we didnt raise it it was raised as it was a concern at the timeyet a very very big issue as large parts of the community experiences itit was a topic which at the time had significant support compared to other topicsreaches out to a lot of people had a good amount of support at the time had support from csm memberwas sponsered by csm member i believegenerally high support at the timeimportant issue so that you guys can push forward issues onto csm for next termhigh support at the timeanyways you get the drift i wont waste more time making the same pointat the time of their posting they all had very high support  or they had csm sponsorship
im bringing this one up in todays meeting
well small point but its not entirely true that the 5 rule will force an issue trough csm it merely means csm has to discuss the topic at their next meeting the issue still have to receive support from the council
and this were there to read the issues and make sure the important ones that can be good for the game get onto the agenda part of the job is filtering out high vote issues that dont do anything good for the gameedit  and yep 5 means we have to discuss it on the csm  it still needs to pass a csm vote to be raised to ccp discussion in the conference  
raw number of votes isnt necessarily the only important statistic for gauging support for an issue what about average votes per day  since some topics have been around longer than others   the votetoreply ratio the sympathetictounsympathetic reply ratio etc some topics disappeared into the background when a csm rep announced that they would sponsor them so its very unscientific to say that some of those wouldnt have had a great deal more support if no csm rep had weighed in on them when they did the reps preempted what they thought were worthwhile topicscsm is not obligated to put every topic on their agenda if that were the case then we wouldnt need a csm at all theyre doing what theyre supposed to be doing i have no complaints about their choice of topicsif certain topics continue to build popularity then yes ultimately csm will probably take them on its a long time between now and iceland though so relax
theres 4 days our submission deadline was 3 days agoso no
seems like you guys forgot about rights to pvp loot and wrecks its over 9 pages long and has mostly support over 100
its item 4 on the agenda today im bringing it up
whoops wow time flies i suppose thats for the better though the first csm was always going to have much more to talk to ccp about than any subsequent csm  gotta get through several years of backlog
while i do agree that our votes are often ignored in this particular case the most significant issue concerning time cards is being worked on therefore it looks like our concerns are being heard at least to an extentalso you gotta admit that it is silly to compare a 603 vote tc thread to a titansmonster trucks 84 vote thread 603 votes is at least enough to get noticed 84 votes is just a few people off course they will get ignored i see nothing wrong with thatps i want to thank lavista for working on mid sized freighters and rigged ships and cargo this might not be a top vote to some but it is a very significant issue that can improve the game in many ways and allow newbie traders to get to the top within any reasonable time frame the way it is now for many traders acquiring a freighter is just about as hard as acquiring one in real lifeive been playing for a while now and i grind for hours on end but im no closer to having a freighter now than i was when i started i understand that this ship is something that is not supposed to be accessible to newbs but he way it is now is the rich will only get richer and the poor can only dream of getting there ever there is no inbetween phaseill give a half of a thumbs up the other half is thumbs down
i think half the problem is seeing what is out there as a popular topic and have decent support there is so many different ideas and issues flying around it is a daunting task at best to see everything or catch them all also the current work load of the counsel should have some sort of limit due to the fact there are limits to how much each one can actually do some issues are so complex that a rep may only take on one while some others might be more of straight forward proposalthe counsel has a finite amount of time to spend on a certain number of issues so we have to understand that if you have 100 well supported issues the counsel has to be able to pick the top x  of that group for this time around i think if we can somehow employ some tools that would make the issuesideas by showing a more of clear proof of support i think that would help both the counsel and the player base aye votes x     naye votes x    base support x  from there the csm can quickly see what has some support and react appropriately as far as monster truck posts its not a hard stretch to see that was a troll post it does not take that much use of the brain stem to actually identify the fact that it is not a subject to be brought up to ccp if the csm can not tell the difference between a troll post and a real issue you are doing it wrong
someone please raise the minmatar capital issue theyre really terrible  especially the naglfar  
the csm is disfunctional to the point of being useless they dont even know what theyre supposed to be doing and dont have the common sense to figure it out for themselves
windjammerlook man all i stated is that i try to post as objectively as i can i do not have the patience of buddha nor the omniscient sense of god all mighty all i can do is tryand you trying to imply someone else is not exercising objectivity is laughable at best you have absolutely no creditibilty of objectivity at all all you do is chase down and stalk ones that do not see things your way or call you on your agenda  reminds of me of somebody  of course i have an agenda i voted unfortunately my candidate is acting like an ass and now i am participating in the debate and i am inputting what i feel is objective as i possibly can and yea i lean towards pirate but not in the same sense or perception you are thinking of and goons are not pirates i am sure you have no idea what pirate means if you have to stretch such a connection you are not going to mute me or shout me down if you want to debate fine no problem just take of the tinfoil hat first you look stupid
just adopt some form of roberts rules and be done with it
lets make jita 00
only when i can unlock the jedi star firghter and have 100 saber block on it also have a i win button on noob ships i mean heck if were going to make a usless waste of time post go for gold rite
this thread is about as useless as the important issue remove soandso from the csmone threadsbe nice if we had mods to clean these up
oh man this so much this do this nao
if you make jita 00 the people who have their assets stuck there will complain because they cant use their stuff the people who try to move their assets out and get ganked will complain because they lost their stuffsome of these people will quit eve meaning less money for ccpand then the high sec trade hub will move somewhere else probably to a system that doesnt have its own dedicated server meaning the new trade hub will have more lag than jita currently does until ccp gets round to changing ittldr this is a bloody stupid idea
i think this would fix the lag in jita

iirc all the derelict stuff either gets deleted from the database regularly or it is in lownosec and thus is shootable with regular guns if you want to get rid of it amusing but i dont think its necessary
i saw a simlilar thread but it was only handling criminal activity and suicidingi wanna add 00 and low sec since no insurance agency will pay if you lose your ship in low sec  00   so no insurance payout if 00criminal activitysuicidingand in low sec 20 in 0140 in 0260 in 0380 in 04 and that percentage is on the sum you have insured the ship for so if you havent insured it you get 40 of the basic insurance if you lose it in 02  
sry but go 2 hell do u want to kill all 00 warfare
after looking at the the eve patch notes over the last 5 years ive seen nothing really major thats been implemented so i decided that this needed to be changed and what we need to do is add configurable missile skinsthis means that we could colour in our missiles in shades of any colour you decide or you could draw sharks teeth or fluffy bunniesor playboy bunnies so i propose to scrap all current developments and start imediate work on missile skinsps turret users r screwed but it serves u right for not choosing minmatar or caldari
and ofc the first thumbs up
stupid idea game is laggy enough already with out having to implement more glitter into the show
but this is important i want it wah wah wah nano nerf minmatar sux wah
i second this new motionremove the csmall it has generated is another crappy part of the forums with thumbs up signs
this is my main my main alt poster character
your post sucks and you are a terrible person 5 would read again
i heart darius big johnson
remove jades alts from the forumsi for one welcome our new goon overlords
darius johnson is a very capable and clever guy you could do far worse than him
signed
i wanted to say that
you are actually right i would rather have him in the csm than jade constantine if it came down to a choice  never thought i would say that about a goon  
really he didnt sound clever and capable during the most recent state of the goonion spitting antisemitic and racist insults all over the place demeaning anyone who disagreed with him and belittling the little goonies asking questionshe sounded like an internet  who never has accomplished anything and now thinks he is great because of an internetz spaceship gamepersonally i think the whole csm should be dissolved and scrapped
quoting this because its true i am a racist failure at life an internet  if you will ill posit however that for an internet  i at least have the balls to use my main when i post if im an internet  what does that make you
unless i missed something darius was pretty level headed thr the whole thing wanting to keep things in the open and not under chair rule not suported
i heart darius big johnsons lil johnson editare we talking about darius or jade here
are we talking about darius or jade here beat me to the question
this may well be true but having read the logs of the meetings ive not really seen him say anything other thana   to voteb   to make snide asides at jade constantines expensec   to step in and make a half hearted attempt to defend innana when jade was disenfranchising her may have missed other instances of input due to eyestrain from reading the chat log edit  also based on logs from first 3 meetings only  i dont think he should be removed im sure he has some valuable insights into the game i just wish he would share some of them   
csm should be whites only
outposts have them so why cannot npc stations in 00 have them toothe time for people being able to hide in npc stations in places like fountain stain or curse without fear of services being disabled should come to an end make them equal to outposts by enabling them to be attacked
if youre going to take that angle im not sure why you dont think npc corps wouldnt have forces to defend their assets after all they dont want you blowing up their stuffnice alt post btw
tech ii bpos  profit  guaranteed return  invention  gamble  no guaranteed return  you can save up and buy one of the 20000 tech ii bpos investing massive amounts of isk for a small guaranteed return each week or with minimal cost gamble for the chance of getting rich quickreally all thats needed is dev input there are other assembly hall topics asking for this players argueing amongst themselves doest really solve anything this thread is piontless and really only mirrors hundreds of previous general discussion and market discussion threads that have also had no dev input
supported after i read this thread
pointless argument really you may not recall but ccp on a couple of occasions had to reseed bpos in the lotterybecause they dont last chars go inactive they get blown up being moved accidentaly recycled every day there are less and lessi own a couple of bpos and i invent you make more isk with invention than bposi have a prowler bpo which makes 11 a week every week thats all it ever will doif the market tanks on prowlersill still be making 11 a week whilst cryingwith invention i can switch to another item and have bpcs ready in a day or 2the bpo makes me 11 a week with invention i can make 30 or more yes they cost a little more to build but the volume more than makes up for itthe days when a bpo made you instantly rich are long gone most are next to useless any item that has a high profit will attract the inventers and prices will drop to a reasonable level classic example is hulks bpo only  500mil a pop with invention 90100mil a popbpo owners have no control on the market they cannot react to market changes they may make a higher  of profit per item but isk profit will be way behind a half descent inventer due to his ability to change what he builds and the volume he can buildbe interesting if ccp could release the number of t2 bpos lost each month and how many are on chars that havent logged in in 6 month or moretime and peoples stupidity will gradualy reduce the bpos to collectables soon enough so its not worth worrying about
so whats wrong with that that also means ive been paying forever too play this game so i have every right in having 2 t2 ship bpos
good evening this is a fairly inconsequential issue in the greater scheme of things but something that has annoyed me for a very long timeits the lines that come out from all ships you have currently targetedhere is an example of what it looks like to have eight ships targeted at the same time
the endless political diarrhoea that is swamping this page is beginning to get tiresome it was always going to happen and in a sense its a necessary part of the democratic process  just as how scams and ganks are a necessary part of our beloved sandbox but its getting in the way and beginning to smellthe council appears to be slowly progressing from talking almost entirely about nonsensical bureaucratic minutiae to actually spending time on the issues thats great to see and i remain optimistic about the long term effect of the csm on the game so when people come to the assembly hall it would be nice to see the real issues i dont give half a toss about whether a councilman can be tied to space brothels space terrorists or the ghsc i care even less about whether you think a particular council member shouldnt be there  they are now shut up turn on your tv set and youll see the same trash happening in real world politics the world over can we at least keep it off the issues board the jita park speakers corner board should be the place for rabblerabbling about abuse of power or how darius and his wife did a terrorist fist bump the csm themselves showed in their fourth meeting that they can successfully talk about spaceships its time for us to follow suit
i agree that the you should resign no you should resign stuff is just getting dull that said there are legitimate issues not relating to internet spaceships for the csm to discuss the one on changing the 5 rule the assorted complaints about the forum software and that monster thread on the gtc changes are all legitimate topics for csm discussion if you want to make a rule say that only things which should be brought to ccp are to be discussed in the assembly hall with csmonly topics rules of order ing matches of all varieties etc   going to jita park instead id support that but spaceships only is too restrictive
so youre basically saying that people who talk about stupid nonsense should close their bulletholesupported
yeah but how many newbies are going to know about those if youre building a fw alt then sure but this should be accessible to new players instead of just new characters
why not alter the required standing for signing up for a fw militia by the number of participants then considering vast numerical disparities atmand of course you can get the 05 faction standing during a trial of course you have to know how of course it isnt done with just racing through 3 or 5 missions but that is not really the intention either and i think its okay i see no reason for having fivedayold players joining a militia just to deliver easy kills
silencing people you dont agree with is communism thats not communication
you should read up about communism my friend it describes a socioeconomic order that implies the public ownership of the means of production facilitating the dispersion of the interest gained from those to the benefit of the whole population and not a single investor  at least in theory  it has nothing to do with communication even if the words may seem similarof course there may be the slim chance that you are a remnant of the cold war era so you equal communism with everything you else you might consider unfavorable i dont know which would be more embarassing for you if your statement originated from your profound lack of education or your mccarthyism
to be fair silencing people who disagree with the ruling elites is a fairly fundamental aspect of communism as its actually practiced in real life i dont think theres ever been a communist regime that allowed for dissent  most of them would just shoot you out of hand and a few of the more creative ones would then send your family a bill for the bullet   and the rest would just have you rotting in a jail cell for years or decades marxs theorymongering aside equating communism with repression is a fairly apt statement about how the world actually functions
silencing people was also the common practice durung the mccarthy era in the usa the land of free repression was also a trademark of many regimes that enjoyed the support of the western states in their fight against communism eg the the military junta in chile during the pinochet yearsso repression is something that happens independent of the underlying socioeconomic model of a society equating repression with communism is really political oversimplification of the more primitive kind
hey i hardly claimed that communism was the only repressive system humans have ever used for government mind you its one of the worst  stalin and mao both killed far more people than   but a cursory examination of history will tell you just how evil humanity can be no matter what rhetoric is used to justify it he was oversimplifying ill agree but he wasnt doing so inaccuratelyedit wow they censor the name of everybodys favourite  dictator this board must have had some real fun with godwins law back in the day
no its not youre just trying to show off communism is by nature oppressive because there is no other way to enforce its tenants effecively other than through force communism without the dictatorship of the proleteriat is a 19th century pipe dream that can never existbut anyway you just keep on copy pastin wikipedia passages in an attempt to look smart it worked in high school so it should work here as well rightalso conflating stalin and mccarthy seriously
where did i compared stalin to mccarthy i even never mentioned stalinbut perhaps youre conflating stalin with communism in this case let me conflate the republican federal free market system with slavery racism and intolerance im sure this would be fair wouldnt itjust because some red necks told you that communism is the definition of institutionalized evil and can be used as general analogy for everything that is undesirable is doesnt have to be true
i should have known it would be useless to argue about freedome with an european
im quoting this before you edit it outoh speaking of freedom we here in europe have the freedom to travel to cuba perhaps its because our societies arent so paranoid about communism that they feel it necessary to forbid their own citizens traveling or conducting business there just a thought
sorry my education prohibits me to copypaste from wiki also i put in bold your obvious level of education in the spelling area that is ironic and funny dont worry though the words do seem similar oh and good luck making communism work without a dictator
quality rebuttal right hereid advise to take some lessons on forum warrioring from your goon friends
sounds like a jade alt
i voted on the abg premiss  anyone but goon  so far i dont regret my vote
i take this as a compliment though im not  another thing you could have learned from consulting goonswarm first   there are worse people that one could be accused to be the alt of
you really are bent on thinking that anyone who dislikes the chair or you are a goongoon altgoon friend so sad  
thats ironic considering you just have suspected me to be the alt of jade on your previous post are you really bent on thinking that anyone who dislikes goonswarm    and their sycophants is a jade alt so sad actually individual goons are not so bad really its just their aggregation that makes them unbearable
i voted for jade and no i dont regret my voteexpect any csm chair to be a walking drama bomb  it comes with the position youll always have the people who love to pick apart every little action or word that the chair says and attempt to turn it against that person and having other uncooperative members on the csm doesnt help much jade just seems headstrong and willing to make his own decisions to me which is something i would expect out of a chair  and out of star fraction tbh   i cant see any reason people would want a uncontroversial and coincidentally indecisive person to chair the csmso you dont agree with some of jades actions and maybe he is particularly flippant to his detractors  so what that doesnt make him the antichrist which is what id expect given some of the bull spread between this forum and the assembly hall
take the goon aspect out of this i dont think it was ccps intentions to allow any member to mute another member over a disagreement when i read the logs i saw no reason the mutee should have been silenced over a debate in a democratic assembly that was pure childish behavior on jades part to be honest i expecting that kind of behavior from the goons before i did anyone else hate goons all you want but from reading the logs they seem to be doing a fine job you know they debate they back up that debate with reasoning they dont mute people that they dont agree with that just childish even for a goon
well the debate will come to an end with the vote that is what will decide if the council is for transparency or not
dariuscsm emails should be kept confidential unless specified otherwise if you need a reason outside of respecting your fellow csms wishes let me spell it out for you your alliance trolls every csm issue and communication from major to minor to minute get it
sorry jade i support you but what nonsense are you going on about what does this have to do with powerplay or votes yes it might not be a good idea maybe even a bad idea in some people opinions however it has nothing to do with powertrips sorry you lose my support on this issue jade i dont understand how you can reply to something daris posted with was clear and to the point with flamebait stay to the facts dont start trying to make people hate someone or love youalso as for my stance on the subjectif its a csm discussion it should be public if its an information chat or email like meeting at 5 sure whatever but if its a meeting it should be public and if not public it should be public to the csm memebers at least
no its hardly discussions so far the list has been used for publishing agenda items submission templates updates on agenda items like our internal calendar and things like that oh and mud throwing hence why darius probably wants everything to be public so it can cause more drama  i have nothing to hide on that mailing list but i do want people to respect my privacy i want to be able to communicate with my fellow council members without having goons running around twisting my emails and putting words in my mouth which will happenits obvious why people want the mailing list public but i will vote against this if the community wants csm to run we need communcation paths that can reach all council members without threadnaughts spawning from every single email if we dont have this ability we will be unable to work effeciently thus im stronly against it
so the public doesnt get to see these agenda items and submission templates why what is wrong with them you are fundamentally wrong in your characterization of goonswarm we will put no words into your mouth on the contrary we will quote you directly had jade not been saying things like the only mistake ive made is allowing a little too much democracy then we wouldnt have had to keep quoting itdid goons threadnaught the second meeting no we did not why did we not because people behaved themselves and didnt run ridiculous power plays just go look at the thread if you want proof the only people posting in the thread is me who has been disappointed in the lack of discussion that issues are getting due to inaction of the council and has been disappointed the entire time since the first agenda was laid out and athiron who has taken issue with roughly the same thing except with the specific instance of the council allowing multiple issues be lumped into the same votes
the agenda items are here to see right on the forum as for the submission templates i see no reason why the public shouldnt see them
so then what is the problem with making the communication public if you dont talk about things that shouldnt be public anyway then why not just make it publicits seems the only reason would be to allow yourself the opportunity to be petty and to enact power plays without the public being able to see just who is being dishonest with their vote and who is trying to screw all the others out of the votes that they cast
no votes are casted via email all votes are done during meetings which are public so your assumptions which are extremely wrong are just plain wrong the reason why i dont want them public because i think it wont make a difference other than causing more drama i do see why some wants that high degree of transperancy but i think its too easily abused as wellas i said i have nothing to hide i just think we should have at least some privacy we could have to discuss things which are subject to ndaagain i wouldnt change my way nor usage of the mailing list should it be public its that simple
i am sorry i thought you saidit doesnt matter if we can see votes i am not talking about votes to get past your ridiculous strawman   the process is important and we have a right to view it i want csm reps to be voting based on what they think and not power plays when a rep goes on a power trip i want to know about there is no reason for reps to be insulated the voting public so lets go over what we would see if it was made publicagenda itemstemplate documentsboth of these are the public interestanything else there that should not be cannot be construed as have a public interest to be private unless its specifically discussing items covered by the ndathe only reason to keep them secret is to allow people to exert influence over other reps for the purpose subverting the game towards a partisan agenda so we have ample reason to make the records public because as you say they ought to be and we have ample reason to make them public to prevent any representative from any alliance from attempting to subvert the will of the people who rightly voted for their representatives
the first is already public please check the very first post in this thread the template documents i see absolutely no reason not to release again i see a lot of good reasons why it should be public but i also think that there is reasons why it shouldnt i thus go with that it shouldnt because there needs to be some kind of privacy so that the csm can work without drama at every damn step we take there was a reason the mailing list was created what do you think will happen if the mailing list does go public those who have things to hide use other means of communication its like disallowing drugs in real life if things are disallowed they will be less obvious more violent and much harder to investigate i think the only thing that would make me accept a public mailing list would be if it was delayed 12 weeks so that nothing can be taken out of context because things are work in progress just like certain people tend to do
no the mailing list was created because there was no read only forum that the csm could post in but not anyone elsethis is nothing like drugs there is no trade going on there are no fiscal interests yea people will communicate in other means it happens but that doesnt mean we cannot make all the communication we can as transparent as possiblepublic institutions rely on transparency to keep undue influences from corrupting the process corruption of the process produces results that are not inline with the right and proper will that grants their authorityie it makes it so the council will do less good for the game or more badhow can that be a positive and why would anyone want to push for a situation that would increase the likelihood of that outcomei am sorry who is taking what out of context are we taking jade barring a representative from a meeting out of context are we taking jade editorializing a decision of the council out of context
why are you saying we do you feel aimed at this has nothing to do with jade eitherlets face it the forum is filled with trolls and people who take things out of context for lulz and drama
we being the general forum population there was no drama over the 2nd meeting when there was no clear problem why do you think that people are going to make problems when they have demonstrated both that if there is is nothing to be alarmed about they will not make it an issue
those people who take things out of context are the ones voting for the csm theyre voters and youre no better than them they have a right to see whats going on even should it be misinterpreted also the mailing list has been used numerous times for official communications you need only look at the emails to see that you state that the council has some need for privacy in its communications and i will ask once again to what end what purpose does creating us as some separate class from the playerbase achieve how does that fit in with what the csm is supposed to bei dont see any responses to that i see blind opposition and mischaracterization i want drama what the hell are you on about if you conduct yourselves like reasonable human beings what drama is there to be had i find it hilarious that im blamed for peoples responses to the actions of others im guilty for mentioning the crime as opposed to the person who committed it and now seeks to cover it up puhleeze
so they are still taking things out of contextdid he claim he was better than them is not having your email read by the entire game some sign that you think you are better than everyone else if so were all guilty of it as im not aware of any email that is open to the publicthey already see whats going on in both the meetings and here on the boards and of course they have csms like yourself to warn them if some plot to take over eve is secretly being hatched in the csm emailgood if it were used more often for official business maybe these boards would be more about player issues and less about goonswarm throwing a hissy fitso that they can communicate with other csms without having goons troll each and every communication wasting council members time defending themselves against accusations that they are trying to unfairly influence council affairs by for example scheduling a vote on a thursdayyou should tell us that as far as i know youre the only csm member to claim their constituency is not the playerbase as a whole  just goonswarm  what purpose does that achieve dariusall the csm members were elected its not unreasonable for them to ask that they be able to carry out their work unmolested players can still see what their council is doing and ask direct questions to their council memberswhy would there be youre the only person who believes that an internal email is going to subvert the whole processyou just accused the council of blind opposition and mischaracterization because they want an internal email system thats being dramatic dudeplenty look anywhere on the eve boardsno ones blamed you for anything in this thread and no one has called you guilty of anything stop being a drama queen
why am i somehow not surprised an alt has again taken up the torch here i apologize but theres no way im going to play the quote game here as i dont have 7 hours to respond to every sentence in your post ill respond overall though if it doesnt involve me repeating myselfyou have a flair for the dramatic quote me the part where i suggest people should have their email read by everyone youre making it seem as if what im suggesting will force people to divulge their personal emails that is not the case as ive said repeatedly i am only concerned with the semiofficial csm mailing list private conversations are just thatwhy should i be responsible for raising issues so i can be accused hilariously of trying to score political points if people can see the mailing list of the csm then i wont have to those who care can read it and those who dont can ignore it uhoh goon conspiracy quote detected perhaps it would be wiser to say that if it were only used for official communications that people were proud of then nobody would have a problem with people reading themyoure comparing apples to oranges they did schedule a meeting on a day the us members could not attend what does that have to do with emailwhere did i claim my constituency is not the playerbase as a whole i stated that i had the votes to be reelected as a matter of fact ive specifically stated the opposite multiple timesnobodys asking for them to be molested im asking them to be transparent theres a differenceagain you refer to internal mail there is no such thing there is a mailing list and peoples personal emails i am also far from the only person supporting this issue saying its just me doesnt make it sore my responses read the thread
more bs about alts get over itnot going to bite on your strawman argument about email no email is available to the public you want csm email to be available to the public its unusual and your arguments for it are tangential at best while the cons of it are obvious to everyone but a member of goonswarm apparentlyyoure a member of the csm you raise the issues and make the arguments within the council intead of asking that all council business be made available to the public so that your loudmouthed alliance can trash it for you if thats too much work for you too baduh oh goon blinders spotted darius isnt aware his alliance craps all over every piece of council business perhaps it would be wiser to say if feedback from goons was constructive or useful then nobody would have a problem with making more information public  see what i did there  the example of scheduling was used to point out that even mundane matters are crapped on and flamed by your alliancemates specifically they accused jade of being antiamerican  or proeuro possibly   among other things because the timing didnt favor the us csmsitll take me some time to find it but basically someone was taking you to task for csm business and you used that as an excusedont need to ask for them to be molested they already are they are trying to get some work done despite this and you are arguing for things that will enable and encourage the harassment while simultaneously not even acknowledging any harrassment exists draw your own conclusions
there is a lot here that is just plain terrible qaed so ill just get a few choice onesno the only candidate to do that has been jade constantine for someone who is complaining about the level of drama it seems you havent read itlook especially in the agenda threads for the first two meetings lord the drama was thick the forums were being threadnaughted sarcasm
instead of asking for the euros to stay up an extra hour or two he demanded that the us representatives whom he had already shown bias against leave work early in order to make the meetingthey arent accusing jade of being antiamerican they are accusing her of using the meeting scheduling to skew the votes on the councilhow in the world can you not understand that dissent can be justified the judgment on the dissent is always hinged on the judgment of the cause of the dissentif someone was making a stink because a someone said a bad word it would be one thing this is entirely another
havent read what and feel free to link where jade said thati think you should no longer be able to critique others posts
the euros were up past midnight already he didnt demand anything regarding the us csms he simply scheduled the meeting he explained why the meeting had to be held on thursday also  submission deadline   he also scheduled a second meeting for sunday so that all could attendobvious drama queen is obviousperhaps thats what they meant that is not what they posted howeverdissent can be justified do you feel like you have done this do you feel like most of the things you have accused jade of can even be justifiedi do not you are irresponsible in your dissent you are dissenting simply to dissent your constant and unjustifed dissent is now just a distraction to everyone who reads this board mostly because you throw baseless accusations into every thread and fail to follow up and prove them or let them go when you cannotscheduling meetings is mundane your claim that theres some malfeasance going on regarding this has been proven baseless but you persist in your accusation
also ccp told him not to 
if they cant take the joke they shouldnt have joined in the first place we dont openly recruit so unless youre some poor delusional soul that ponied up the 10bux solely for the purpose of playing spaceships with us they should know what to expectits not a corporation  or alliance   full of miscreants no matter what you want to think most of us are simply irreverent
looks interesting unfortunately my 1 problem with eve does not appear to be on that list  nanos   this leads me to the conclusion that either the csm believes they are fine and doesnt want to change themor you folks havent gotten to them yet im hoping for the latter though knowing the mindset of todays playerbase i doubt thats the case
if you think theyre a problem put up a thread on assembly hall i dont think anyone has yet
o grismarhey fix your sites databases already mkaythats all
this sentiment is silly the csm is made up of other players just like you guys and theyre already giving up a lot of time as it is i dont think its all that unreasonable to not expect them to be at the playerbases beck and call 247  this isnt their full time job they arent ccp engineers or designers  its a player committeei mean you cant seriously be making the claim that just because holding much longer meetings would cause problems for the useu part of the council that they arent somehow honoring their obligationthe lack of thinking on the csm forums is astounding this post will of course be interpreted next by someone as me saying that the csm candidates shouldnt have to attend meetings or dont have to put in the hours or whatever everything isnt black and white folkson the issue of csm members looking out for their interests primarily  you didnt expect this obviously these are not unbiased people and as with any political position each member will have their pet issues and will tend to support those issues that affect them and theirs again this is not to say that the csm members should be allowed to be corrupt politicians who only look out for their best interests but you must expect some amount of slant in their decisions based on their personal experiences and involvements in the game thats why the playerbase was supposed to vote for these people  so that they could get a selection of members who represented their best intereststldr  ideally the csm members will look out for the greater good of the greater playerbase but you must account for some slant with their votes it would be naive not to
success got it voted through the csm and is on the agenda for iceland well done chaps

after the damp nerv and the new bonuses to interceptors these ships are more the less useless todayplz give them there role on the battlefield back cuchulin
good points but if everyone and everything was equal what fun would this game be every race has its advantages and disadvantages you dont want everything to be perfectly balanced out it might be nice to make minmatar capitals somewhat more powerful but they shouldnt be in any way equal to thanatos or any other better ship i agree that maybe easing the training requirements would be nice but there should be no big changes to slots cap or whatever elsethe major reason why you are upset really is cause youre minmatar and you want to have strong capitals you dont care what happens in the process you just want it doneby the same token maybe i hate that the nighthawk doesnt really do much more damage than a drake yes it has a hell of a tank but i want more damage on it its a friggin command ship after all well too bad for me if i want a higher dps command ship ill have to train for one from another raceminmatar might have sucky carriers but they have ships that are the best in their class as opposed to other races for example i cant think of a ship that would compare to a vagabond or a rifter in their respecting class  these might not be the best examples though but im sure you get the idea  so in the end my vote is yay and nay at the same time   
the problem with balancing around whole races is that you are not limited to the race you start with when it comes to dreadnaughts the only thing keeping you from switching races is weapon training and battleship training which in the grand scheme of things is a pretty minor chunk of time considering the vast improvement you get flying nonminmatar capitalsits ok for races to have a certain flavor to them and its ok that this flavor makes them better or worse in certain ship types the problem is that since any player can fly any ship in the end game you need each ship in a type  hac dread whatever   to have a use in some role its ok if other dreads are in general superior as long as the naglfar is better in particular relevant situations it currently has advantages in some very odd and rare situations and the performance increase in these situations simply does not make it worth it the problem seems to really stem from the lack of a midlow the even spreading of midslows and the dual weapons that make damage mods somewhat useless i would say move a low to a mid and add a mid to make it a shield tanker leaving the lows for damage mods  which it will be pretty inefficient with still but since it can have a nongarbage shield tank it sorta works out  imo the niddy is pretty decent now since it can fit a thanatoss tank while having superior repping ability and the ability to fit both shield and armor transfers  cpu issues on shield transfers aside   its a niche role but it doesnt give up that much for this and its a role that is relevant

minmatar  eve in hard mode
as ive said before i dont really have a problem with them being the worst capitals but more that theyre the worst capitals by such a huge margin if you have all the skills for a nidhoggur  min bs v capital armor tanking etc   but do not have large projectile v  which is pretty worthless considering how much minmatar bs sucks at sniping   its actually quicker for you to train amarr bs v and large lasers v and get into a revelation especially when you consider the training required for decent missile skills that most minmatar pilots probably dont have not to mention you can now fly a pretty nice apoc or abbadon and are close to t2 large beams  pulses with decent gunnery skills shared with minmatarthe vagabond may be the king of hacs and the rifter the king of t1 frigates but theres plenty of other good hacs  the zealot and the sacrilege are both very nice   that are almost as good as the vagabond but also have good battleships and the best capitals any smart pilot would just train minmatar cruiser v not bother with min bs at all and just train for amarr capitals getting the best of both worlds with relatively little extra trainingbasically just because minmatar have the best cruisers doesnt mean they should have absolutely terrible capitals supercapitals and battleships
yes make missile hardpoints go away tia
best xyz sized ships doesnt mean that min caps should be laughably bad i dont necessarily want min caps to be the best caps just not as bad as they are worst dps and worst tank dread is fine but the currently the gap is so huge that youd be better off cross training for another race add on top of that the extra training needed for 2 weapon systems  dont forget supports skills   and you really dont have much incentive to not just suck it up and train another race for cap ships 3 races of viable cap ships is pathetic

i support this it should be noted that it is possible to transport rigged ships in a freighter if their unpackaged volume is 120000 m3 or below with current game mechanics just send it as a courier package i would however like to be able to transport rigged ships with a volume higher than 120000 m3 as well
good idea   
yes
not sure about the details but the time needs reducing 24 hours is very awkward
fully supported about the complexity level of the skill imho it should be about as hard to train up as thermodynamics to give an orientation point
i think this has a great deal of merit and support it fully personally however i would make it more difficult than that to train simply on the basis that it make a fundamental difference to gameplay maybe science v and infomorph v the rank of the skill looks about right imo based on the effect
24 hours is short enough between jumps if need to do it sooner you could always do it like we did before jump clones
bring the 3090 day gtc back
i agree 100 keep 30 and 90 gtc and simply add the 60 day gtc as a inbetween option its simple easy and offer more options for everyone
did the csm ever say anything on this matter before it went through

arties need some loving no question
signedeverything has already been said artillery is just useless nowadays and 1400mms are worst of all
when i think of artillery i think of ordnance something with a blast radius why not incorporate that idea into the game let me elaboratewhile artillery has low tracking compared to railguns and lasers it could be compensated for by giving it a blast radius persay when its fired if it hits the ship then damage is inflicted normally however shots that would miss or glance could receive partial damage so as to make artillery more like missiles there could be an explosion velocity skill for projectile shells and it could give the artillery the alwayshit nature of missiles generally when artillery hits the general vicinity its going to do some sort of damage to its intended target and i would like to see this incorporated the game dynamics support this with missiles already so there is no huge physics requirement to work out i would accept a rof increase to augment the nature of the weapons but i think this could be a great addition and really fulfill the role of artilleryedit in order to justify something exploding without actually making any contact the charges could be timed in fact they could make a new set of projectile ammo for artillery so ac and artillery have their own  would save them from explaining why the same ammo works in 2 different ways  
i fully agree there isnt much reason to fit artillery on my cane or any other ship that i fly when i can get close to the same alpha with acs and infinitely better trackingdps that way i get 1500 alpha with 720 t2 artillery and 4 t2 gyros 1200 alpha with 425 t2 acs and one t2 gyro on a hurricane with bc5completely absurd if you ask me easily out damaged by my stealth bomber with minimal missile skills
for people saying that since they are capless they should be a lot tier remove capboosters then maybe that would be true even then youd be hard pressed to run out of cap in 90 of fleet fightswhen people ask how to fit tempests in gf they are often met with fit a tempest easy train amarr
i agree that they do need sum lovin but if i remember right wasnt the ammo clipsize of the arties reduced as a balance to th ezero cap use in rmr patcham pretty sure there was sum balance done which has lead to the 1400 iis only holding bout 10 roundsits really dreadfull cos when i used my mach with 1400 iis id get am npc bss tank cracked only to run out of ammo and itd sort itself out even ith arti spec lv4 and the extra gunery skills to lv5admittedly the npc was draben kuvaki  or summat along them lines   but my over tanked under powered standard raven broke tank easilyif anything i would like to see the ammo capacity restored back to normal  double   or as op mentioned the damage increase by 25 to give that extra punch for what is the worst ammo clip in the eve universe

being a codeminded person myself and seeing the worst in a company workplace when it comes to delivering a product on time i know firsthand that technology is fickle and may cause unforeseen delays thats life and theres no need to critique lifehowever again being a codeminded person who knows what it takes to develop a technological product  whether internetborn platformborn or both   i also know that technology works on ones and zeros in the end it either works or it doesnt but it doesnt work in shades of gray theres only one place in the development process where theres a shade of gray and thats meatspacethe human factorin short there can be reasons for delays there can be reasons for misadvertised products there can even be reasons for things to be cancelled after theyve been announcedeven though none of this may be good its sometimes the nature of business in technology even though it may betray a lack of forethought and planning all these things even with the lack of forethought i can stomach believe it or not but as the op said the major problem is not the technology its not keeping the community informedwhether ccp liked it or not they committed to the mac and linux community for delivering their product when they announced it made the client downloadable for mac and linux and got the eve logo on apples growing games homepage even if it was a handoff job to transgaming ccps customers still look to ccp for product support and updates especially if the product is half baked  which it was when it was released and still is now to an extent mostly due to the lack of premium graphics   they want to know how its baking even if ccp cant say when itll be done whether or not its due to their development process or transgamingsmaybe our woes are the fault of transgaming saying they could port the client but not realizing the full extent of the project they faced maybe it was ccp being too willing to hand over their product while believing an outside job could do things to their standards im just shooting in the darkbut honestly i have no way to know otherwise im fully willing to blame transgaming for the bugs in the client and the delays im fully willing to wait a year for premium graphics if i have to but i have no way of knowingand in the end that not knowing is not an issue of technology or not being able to turns ones into zeros thats the human factor not living up to its own declared standards past promises and apologies its a lack of devblogs and a lack of forum posts it is not a kink in the development process it is strictly speaking unprofessional and it is unprofessional because it is unnecessaryagree with the op 100 exclusive macbook pro user tell us the status of your product and our purchase
 supportand heres my solution and its pretty straight forward ive just canceled my account not without a salty comment about the matter
supportpersonally i dont care if we dont get the premium graphics id just like the mac client to get the same performance as the windows one  approx 30 fps using mac client while the same computer achieves fps in triple figures once booted into windo
 supportmy ranti am pretty sure that the players of eve allow the game to continue i know i keep paying someone each month and i assume it goes to ccp and yet they still dont give us any news whatsoever about the mac premium graphics or fixes whic
i personally still cant understand that this thread  this one in special   and the others on the macintosh side have been going on for a while and even this thread is already 2pages longand yetno response from ccp
this
as ive mentioned on the mac forum the only solution to get their attention is for people to stop paying if you continue to pay there is no incentive for them to even bother acknowledging as is evident as much as you like to play eve you either deal with being ignored shutup or quit playing i do not care to deal with companies who blatantly ignore their customers there obviously has been some sort of request that nobody at ccp reply to this issue otherwise someone would have by now people at ccp who have responded to these issues in the past like ccp whisper is absent even though he had stated in a previous post months ago that he was sorry for the lack of communication and would not let it happen againthe only way you are going to get the same performance on mac or linux is to have a native app other companies have done it for their games such as world of warcraft but considering ccp appears to be a windowsonly house this is not likely to happen my gut feeling is is the reason why we have not heard about the premium support on mac is because it was determined that it is either technically not possible or the hardware requirements are too high the fps rate is already bad enough with classic graphics what do you think premium graphics would do i can boot into vista via boot camp on my mac pro but as ive said earlier i do not wish to support a company who ignores its customersmemkani 10mil sp
the reason that eve cant be ported to maclinux natively is because the underlying graphics engine uses directx the engine would have to be completely rewritten in opengl which i dont see happening any time in the near future honestly i dont really care about official support of eve for linux or mac i dont use a mac i dont see myself ever using a mac and the people that do have to accept the fact that interoperability is a  serious   downside of owning a mac i do use linux however and i dont have any problems with playing eve through wine and i dont see this ever changing
then they shouldt officially support macs simple but they are ranting in apple news etc that here you have a great game but forget to mention that if you have problems or issues with the gamethere will be no answer there will be no communication there wont be anything that macusers have been used to toplevel customer satisfaction
supportim pretty sure premium for linux and mac will soon come once transgaming has made swiftshaders better  when cedega 61 final is released  but i guess wed need info from ccptg to actually know it
bump to gather more support please

becuase the ban was ridiculously unjust mulla said hey these guys are cheating and ccp said whatever shutup youre not allowed to play anymore thats messed up and it needs to be fixedit did it started a whole war thats been going on for two years now where half the universe the half that hates cheating went to war against the other half the cheating half and those that suck up to them it brought the corruption to light and exposed the seedy underbelly of misconduct causing ccp to make a lot of hollow promises about player oversight in the form of the player council id call that some goodno t20 started that bob continued it and then ccp did it to themselvesno he hadnt nothing was done until the cheating was made public t20s punishment came shortly thereafter and the playerbase didnt start hearing about it until later and when cries of harsher punishment came along it was revealed that those with the real power of punishment at ccp had been on vacation or whatever other excuse and were not going to act against t20 again since some form of punishment whatever it was had already been meted out in their absence did no harm to the community the whistleblower is not the one responsible for the initial cheating hes not the one responsible for others profiting from the cheating and hes not the one responsible for banning himself and putting a black mark on ccps name by banning a player who did nothing wrong and instead some things very very rightremorse for what for being the hero in this storysaid the bob memberno we have the player oversight commitee for things like this they were initially supposed to be for all kinds of cool things and not just for idiots whining about moon materials or nanoships it was supposed to be for us as a community to raise issues exactly like this and so were god damned well going whether you like it or notno good comes from jack booted fascist thuggery and people completely ignoring wrongdoing either stick your head in the sand all you want to the rest of us actually give a  about the game and the environment it exists in if we didnt we would have all done the really right thing when this all came to light and just stopped giving our money to an organization that reacts like this to whistleblowing instead of making out feelings known by going to war and ing on the forums
do the right thing ccpunban him
im not positive but i dont think the t2 bpos were removed until this information was made public therefore to the question of wether he did any good the answer would be yes and you cant blame him for blacking ccps name what blackened it were the actions of t20 its like saying reporters are out of line to report scandals that happen because they are ruining the people invovled in the scandals lives
the bpos were not removed until after the issue had came to light
unban him

high fives 
it helps if you check the box just sayin
not around back then but definately support this
despite been completely outside the scope of what the csm is meant to be about i fully support ccp on this one ccp has the right to ban anyone at their discretion without needing to justify it everyone agrees to that by choosing to continue to play the game frankly if you have an issue with that you can vote with their wallets and stop playing i think people will be less willing to get behind this kinda issue if they arent willing to put their accounts on the line for it
actually sir the issues that kugu brought to light are the reason that the csm exists you know back when it was supposed to be an oversight committee and not a group of dudes pretending they know how to rewrite the game
i support the unbanning of kugu did you expect something other than my support  
i support this free the  1
what kugu did was expose the corruption in this game he was wrongly banned fix it
i would love to know where the hell you pulled that figure from bimbo is way too free market and akita t is way too game balance im happy with how the t1 market is working should missions drop less t1 loot probably even though i like all them reprocessed minst2 market well prices are well better than preinvention at least and there should definitely be something out there worth fighting over
in some way akita is an avatar of reason great job especially in the original thread
yet completely different in that these moons can be fought over
i do not participate in the fights over this but was talking to a friend who does he described taking over these moons as essentially impossible the defending alliance has cyno jammers and would move in 6 titans  this is from his personal experiencehes seen that   in order to take the moon would require a  literally   node crashing number of ships
doesnt that simply mean they are valuable enough to afford those defensesi personally think the pockets being mined out or a pos array that prevents your moon from being scanned would be awesome additions moving targets promote more pvp agree with this so much it isnt that omber should be worth more than veld by virtue of it being low sec it is that low sec being less developed should have richer roids  of every kind   left in it
right and probably l4 missions arent supposed to be better paying than l3 missions or mining arkonor isnt supposed to be worth more than mining veldspar either how can you even say that with a straight face 
op is spot on about the moon mineral problem and this is an issue that needs to be fixed soonest and no i do not own any of the other 64 rarity moon type  
if you just mined pure isk and veldspar was worth more than arkonor then id agree with you  the riskreward ratio in that ever so hypothetical case is way off similarly if l3s were worth more than l4s it would presumably imply that they were worth more in terms of each individual payout cash lp loot salvage   and as such no set of prices would restore the proper ratio again that would be a major failing of the game and something that needed fixing the thing with minerals is that theres a market with variable prices and the various regions tend to skew towards different minerals so instead of l3s are easier and more valuable lets abandon l4s its theres an oversupply of nocxium and a shortage of zydrine lets mine less jaspet and more bistot and given that im pretty sure miners provide the vast majority of the minerals used in game when the miners move to accommodate the new demands the prices will eventually adjust to a fair equilibrium taking into account scarcity rents risk premiums skill investments and all that other lovely stuff its because relative prices can fluctuate that the market will be kept in equilibrium  thats a feature not a bug of course given that there are 15 ores across 7 minerals there will always be more linkage than the purest models would indicate and theres room for individual ores to get screwed but i really dont care much about the omber rocks feeling lonely as long as kernite and gneiss are there to pick up the slack in the isogen market the most efficient source of each mineral will fall into a roughly fair cost vs benefit line and the less efficient rocks are largely irrelevant except for inefficient miners aka noobs   and the odd mission requirement this is what i meant by how the ores arent supposed to have different prices  they will very naturally because of their different characteristics but one set of prices is not inherently superior to another ultimately there are no shortages in the mineral economy at the moment and the risk vs reward ratio of 00 and highsec is in line with how it ought to be lowsec gets boned of course and id favour a fix to lowsec ores to deal with that but thats a far more minor issue than your critical complaint lowsec excluded however the mineral market looks just fine to me both from the point of view of the industrialists and the miners
quite easlily id imagine you cant compare mission rewards to base price or ores shall i explain missions are set peices the only limit on missions is what well time available to do them the mission you get is ramdom and youll only take so many standing hits refusing ones you dont like its hard coded that lvl 4 will be better than lvl 3s it cant be changed by the player as it is the ccp parameters  rewardratsdropsdrop ratioetc   are set server side no human intervention  ores on the other hand only have a real value set by the player the only parameter is the insurance fraud cost of a ship and that does not set a price lvl on individual minerals or ores we can ask what reward we like as it comes not from ccps hard code but human beings that all operate differently at the individual level different ore prices are player driven not hard coded like mission drops there placement reflects risk but the price asked or given  reward   is from the market which is player set not hard coded its variable without limits not ridgid like riskok do you understand now you made a very simple and basic mistake oh the ore mission comparisson was a worthless straw man that only colours you badly and leaves you open to be ridiculed youre pretty smart but your not thinking things through from every angle in adequate depth
no no and no the security status lost costs the player plenty enough insurance is just that insurance no matter what role you play warp to zero nerfed suicide ganking enough we dont need cuddly protected mission runners in cold harsh space they can save themselves by staying dockedwhy isnt there a thumbs down option all i see is a fanboi box to check
i support tradable kill rights but if youre going to pimp out your ship expect to be a target
agree
i do agree that the pilgrim does need something but i am not too fond of your ideas to be honesti think that we as a community should first try to get the developers to actually acknowledge that they seriously screwed up the pilgrim and to some extent the curse and bhaalgornfirst it was the nos nerf this was intended to only nerf nosdomis and nosmyrmidonsthen it was the drone bay and tracking disruptor scriptseven in a live devblog when i asked the question in the forums about the ewar and force recons the developer even said well we didnt really look at how scripts would affect recons but i mean we look at everythingseriously what the bloody hell is that shouldnt the first thing you should look at be how a nerf will affect the ship it is meant to go on especially when the modules for that ship work as intended before the nerf this development plan makes me sadanyways after we get public acknowledgement that yes the pilgrim is broken we must then ask the developers when we can expect to see changes no i am not hoping it is changed tomorrow because if it was it would be a half assed solution will it be during the ambulation patch after it next year approximately when can we see changesthere have been a number of recommended changes by the community all of which have seemingly gone ignored by ccp  hint hint all we want is acknowledgment that you have read the thread  options inside of it you know what thread i am talking about  personally the first thing i would change is the powergrid it needs to be boosted alot it wasnt necessary when we where not forced to use a cap booster but now we arethe second thing that needs to be looked at is its role in the game its role as a soloer as a gang ship and as a fleet ship what is it expected to do in each role how is it broken in each role here is a small very small list solo does not have the range as all other force recons do to stay outside of the red  ie web range   and does not have the cargo space to outcap most opponents its entire weapon system can be destroyed quite easily gang again it operates well within web range its weapon system can be destroyed quite easily its slow and does not have the range to counter ranged opponents  fleet does not have the range to operate within fleet based warfare ranges does not have the ability to go into a system and lay down cyno generators due to its horrid tanking ability if you deploy a cyno you will be killed this is a known fact to anyone that has used a cyno why use an expensive force recon to do what a cheap ass frigate can doof course this is just a small list and some or many of you may not agree with these however the issues are still there and there are many more of them
disagree
i would support a closer look by the devs at the pilgrim but i cannot say i really like either of your suggestions that well still supporting it fwiw
support for option 2  the other force recons dont do jack for damage so extending that to the pilgrim but allowing it to function in its primary role of nuking someones cap is perfectly fine by me
pilgrim needs some kind of fix agreededit not sure about those proposed changes however but it certainly needs looking at fengs post is a good one
would def support the pilgrim being looked at mainly as im about to get one and i need all the help i can get 
sounds like a plan
am in favour of this idea a global attribute boost across the board is fair makes the game more exciting  especially for new players   and removes a branch of skills that is more or less completely pointlessa skill to learn skills faster mmmmmrather get on with the game and hundreds of skills that do things interesting tbh

signed a million million times precision heavies are hilariously bad and are effectively useless in pvp
i confess that ive never used precision missiles before but i really appreciate the exhaustive numbercrunching you did to present concrete evidence supported
if there is one issue that deserves to be fixed it is this one very narrow very specific fixes are required  these should be implemented immediately to end the travesty of terrible heavy precision missiles  
i would be inclined to agreeid mention though that this does have a significant impact on nanoships  precision heavy missiles can hit but just do minimal damage to a speed fitted cruiser upping their explosion velocity would raise this bar somewhat i dont feel this would be a bad thing but it would represent an indirect nerfing of your average polycarboned speed shipas it stands now the 250msec difference in explosion velocity between precision heavy missiles and faction heavy missiles when combined with the significant difference in damage range skills and secondary effects makes them not worth the cargo space

im torn on the one hand i want to raze geminate to the ground and turn it into a nature reserve where rats can roam free just as god intended it to be and lets be frank the regions not much good for anything elseon the other hand this is an idiotic idea and will only make it even harder for new groups to get into 00 because noone is going to expend much energy in saving the outposts in crap space besides investment decisions have been made on the assumption that these outposts wont be destructible changing this is fundamentally unfair to the people who built them in the first placemoreso theres still the risk of losing all your space and access to the outposts in it  just look at what was once owned by v and lv and the rest of the old southern coalition they lost all of their space without giving people the opportunity to play a game of damagehowever i support this idea being escalated to the meeting with ccp just so jade can be shot down and informed how stupid this idea is in person by both csm reps who have some experience of life in 00 and cpp themselves in a setting where    s he doesnt have the opportunity of the wall of text defense that we so love to navigate
the difference is how much trouble just because its hard doesnt mean we should make it harder
it is clear that some people just have no idea who and what jade is about
remove him
it is too creepy it should not have a seat in the csm
have you even read these threads its jade constantine who has claimed a goon conspiracy
it seems to me any reasonable person can see what jade has donethe fact that jade believes they are not wrong and threatenspromise stronger moderation is a valid reason to remove them from chairhonestly i think the csm would be a lot better as a think tank then this council crap where they would have their own forums and be in some dark corner and try to squeeze out a gem to improve eve
imo jade has shown she is grossly under qualified to be in any position of authority let alone csm chairperson i support this idea get him out as soon as possible
i support this motion the council as a whole needs to move on from all these administrative issues and start finding solutions to ingame problemsyou guys should start putting your heads together and give ccp solutions that are acceptable from all your different perspectivesremember that you are a advisory council  your role isnt to give ccp a list of problems but some way of resolving themi dont believe this council can do something useful in its current forumrant
supported because i like fun
it ends here
trolling yes you are doing it right
wall of text  the need to overshout others  muting others to make sure youre the one being heardin controlthis is news how
im disappointed with the csm chairmans behavior after reading the minutes jade it is time to step down from the chairman position
i havent vote for jade but what is that you all guys have against jade what is the real reason behind your hate what were the specific cases were jade failed commends like jade sucks need to be removed tell me that it is you who suck so stay cool and express your legitimate serious reasons that make you wish jade to be removedi am waiting till i hread some serious reasoning the idea is unsupported
perhaps you should start by reading this thread everythings here
the op says nothing am i supposed to dig a 17 page full of mostly generic negative comments against jade to discover a small part of the truth behind this hate movement against him especially when the op says nothing specific how about some of you that also voted positivly make a summary about it what the hell you vote for it i am sure you must have an idea why you did itps and why are some of you people using alts and not your mains afraid of anything
because jade constantine overstepped his authority denigrated the other members of the council used the chair as a bully pulpit and accepts no fault or responsibility for what happenedseriously read the threaded what do you mean the op says nothing are you sure you are reading it
its rampant ego is costing the csm credibility while it remains in the position of chairperson
compleatly childish theres no room for people like that
even fix agrees and they have many more reasons to hate goons than you
supporting

i wont get too much into balance issues but the principles here are good
not the worst idea i have heared so far    supported
as a part of this issue if ccp could help provide a system that allows better cleaning of standing slots many times corporationsalliances mergebreak up as it stands it is very difficult to track such information a person spends hours getting info on each corp when house cleaning were pulling a great deal of unnecessary information when it comes to standings we need active members and if a corp is member within an alliance other thoughts welcome
okay im tired so ill try to keep this short and to the point i make no claims to eloquency or coherence due to exhaustion but here goesnanospeed setups are taking the fun out of the game for many of the players simply put theyre overpowered one should not be the next best thing to invulnerable against most conventional ships and setups even assuming you can hit a nanoer in the first place its speed will usually allow it to escape the moment it is taking fire in certain circumstances speed setups can be destroyed but these usually require significantly more skill numbers andor effort than it does to fly nanos in the first place in short the risk vs reward is fubarin addition nanos make many ships and setups obsolete rendering them largely useless on the battlefield for those who are specialized in said ships and prefer those playstyles it makes the game largely unplayable  here is where nanoers will chime in with the then adapt mantra that is so widely touted but understand that just because you enjoy flying nanos or the ships and setups and blobs that counter them doesnt mean that everyone else does this is a game  if doing the things necessary to win isnt fun then people will simply quit and go play something else instead  proponents of nanos will no doubt come in here and state that nanos are required because of capital hotdrops and blobs and i will even agree to a small extent capital hotdrops and blobs have become more prevalent so people have taken to using a mechanicnanosthat destroys the fun of subcapital nonblob pvp as a method to avoid dying to them  while i personally believe something should be done about the prevalence of capital ships anywhere but highesc thats a discussion for another thread   whenever any suggestion is made to weaken nano setups certain reactionaries will immediately state that pvp would be impossible without nanospeed setups i maintain that the opposite is true  there would be more pvp with reduced effect of nanospeed setups there are many people myself included who dont play much because they dont enjoy flying nanos dont enjoy fighting nanos  i dont like flying a rapier dont enjoy having to drag a gang around with me 237 and the ships i prefer to fly arent good at countering nanos bar the tempest   however there would be more risk back to the level that obtained in 2005 and 2006in any case i personally think speed tanking should still be viable but slower id like to see maximum speeds reduced to something more reasonable perhaps in the range of 253kms for hacs doubtless some people would say that such a slow ship would be utterly destroyed today but thats large because the ships that would be chasing would be faster too nerf speed setups somewhat and it levels the playing field speed setups at least for certain ships were perfectly viable before the nano buff even with the slow 3kms velocities they could achieve as an example the old 3kms vagabond from before the nano buff was a perfectly balanced ship it was fast but not to the point that it couldnt be caught it also couldnt permasustain its mwd and its guns had to track their targets all of these combined to make a very good vessel which was also the topselling tech ii ship of its timepeople would pay as much as 200 million isk for onethis change may however require an adjustment to certain other ships to become viable as the web range of the huginn and rapier is far enough to be a major problem if the web range of these ships was reduced to 20km at the same time as speed tanking is reduced then it should go a long way in helping keep things in line edit please note that i am not saying this is definitely necessary rather im saying its something that should be taken into consideration when examining the overall balance
anyway i need to get to bed i really started to ramble there at the end and i apologize i may come back and clean this up and provide more supporting information tomorrow if im not too frazzled by the time i get off worktldrnanos are overpowered they make other ships obsolete encourage blobbing and destroy the normal pvp their proponents say they encouragereduce the max speeds achievable and you will bring them into balance though this may require a rebalance to the minmatar recons and eas as welledit folks if you support one of these threads theres this leetle button youre supposed to click in between the text box and the area where you select your character to post with when replying
please for the love of all that is holy nerf the crap out of speed setups i had a webbed vagabond outrun my t2 valkyries wtf
holy hell batman the first nano whine thread in hereoh and no
not in favour of a plain nerf but some rebalancing might be in order i think
if you nerf nano you nerf minmatar into uselessness end of story next
hell nothumbs down
so in addition to nerfing the speed of my rapier you want to nerf its effectiveness with webs too what a fantastic idea i cant see anything wrong with it if you think the huginnrapier is overpowered dont try to mask your whine as a nanoship whine
right
shut upthumbs down
agreed it should be damn near impossible to run an mwd nonstop theres your fix for this one
no we dont need to push the game even further towards blobbing
flying some nano ships myself i know that there are currently only two ships that i have realy to fear the minmatar recons in my opinion nanos are imba because every player who has not trained minmatar recons will have problems to counter them my idea is to introduce a mod for the webber whitch increases webbing range significantlywhile on the other side makes it impossible to fitt a decent tank or something in that direction  this would lead to more the less balanced possibilities to counter nanos for all players while not nerving nanos at allcuchulinps thought about it a little bit and maybe this issue could be combined with the assault frig issue maybe they should get a role bonus on webbing range like interceptors have for scramming
theres an area effect everything elsewhy not an area effect web
there is no problem herestop moaning that your insured raven with 20mil isk of fittings cannot kill my fragile 250mil uninsured vaga
youre either a bad nano pilot or you dont fly nano youre missing a couple on that list of yours
this topic does merit serious consideration the issue itself is quite complex and impacts well beyond analysis of the ships used to nano alone the balance factors of the nano phenomenon are not correct at the moment i am not sure how much support can be expected for the issue but it has my general support
no support here as you say wrayeth im going to say exactly what you thought id say  imbalance in 00 warfare defensive advantage of sovereignty tools capital hotdrops jumpbridge hotdrops  these are your culprits since theyve made nano the only technique that can work in that environment and you dont handle this problem by removing the ability for players to play the game you handle it by rebalancing the problems with the environment itself and ensuring that defenseadvantage is toned down to allow other techniques to have a chance again id suggest  seriously   you take a look at faction warfare wrayeth maybe even join up and give it a go see the sorts of ships and techniques people are playing there and have some fun if nothing else itll help bring some balanced perspective back but at the moment im completely opposed to any gameplay change inspired by the knockon symptoms of the broken 00 sovereignty systemthere is nothing wrong with the riskreward balance of nanoships the issue is with the environment that ensures that nothing but nano ships can have a reasonable competitive chance you used to be in morsus mihi wrayeth tell me with a straight face that anything except a nano gang can pass through morsus space secured by anchored bubbles jumpbridged capitals in cyno jammed systems and the constant threat of the uberblob near instantly appearing through the twisted miracle of sovereignty architecture in response to any incursion around that space im not knocking morsus mihi mind  they played the game they built an epic defensive trap that is admirable in its sterile efficiency  but if the game allows the kind of uber defensive playstyle where you are dead unless you can burn out from gates at 4000mps  then you cannot point at nanos as the problem they are simply a symptom of a specifically broken play environment and that is the thing that needs fixing
you may have a point there jade agreed but what about the part of eveo that is not 00 i know it is often conveniently forgotten that some people live there toomoreover if you argue that the nanophenomenon is absolutely necessary due to some mhm broken 00 game mechanics that does not really make  assuming for the sake of the argument the equally part may be way off   an equally brokenunbalanced game feature justifiable i didnt read the op as calling for a massive swing with the nerfbat but it is a frequently made observation that not only minmatar ships which by their background are kinda entitled to it go the nano way these days its not any more that it is two or three ships only that are popular for nano setups thus if it is legitimate to address the issue of eveo going into the direction of capitals online it is imho as legitimate to fear the same for nano online even if we might not be there yet stating that it is required to counter some inherent 00 problems and that would be that is the wrong way imho
jade you are wrong imbalance in 00 warfare defensive advantage of sovereignty tools capital hotdrops jumpbridge hotdrops if we take all of those out of the equation the performance imbalance still exists you are not arguing to the point raised the issue here is nano being a performance imbalance not cyno jammers and jump bridges
two thumbs down nano ships are not immune to destruction just bring the right tools to the table if theyre flying scissors find a friend who flies a rock a cry for a nerf is not a substitute for a friend with a curse rapier or any of the other counters available to you
reducing the viability of other techniques can in no way reduce the viability of nanos you are saying that nanos are too powerful because capitals are too powerful that is edits especially apparent because nanos is not something relegated to small gangs just look at bob they dont fly frigates anymore because there is no frigate that does anything better than a hac or reconyou will never be able rebalance 00 space to make nanos less valuable than they are without directly nerfing the ships and increasing the number of counters you could remove all capital ships pos sovereignty etc etc etc from the game and it would just make nanoships more powerful the only thing keeping tactics other than nanoships viable is sovereignty and infrastructure and they are still a problem
ahh yes the guys guys nano ships are fine just fly nanoships as a counter defensedo i have to spell out how dumb that is as well with most ships we define a counter as something that will kill the target especially well but when defending nanoships a counter is always defined as the only thing that might have a chance of killing the target if the target is competent
nanos are super fragile already at most they have 10k hp they cant do all that much damage either the best is probably the vaga which puts out 300 dps at around 1520km theyre essentially equivalent to a very well tanked drake in dps and tanking ability the difference being that it requires multiple bcs  and sometimes even bss   to take out a drake whereas it only requires one only good and properly fit antinano ship to take out a vagabond see for example the garmonation videos on eve tubeno support hereedit also nano gangs are one of the few truly viable counters to blobs which i think most people would agree need to have something to fear
support i cant stand nanogangs
not true disco bs  frig blob and so should bombs once they fix those
1 there are only a handful of nano ships that have 10k ehp its pretty much the zealot the rest have between 16 and 252 it takes a single bc to take out a drake well at least any drake that is useful more correctly it takes a frigate to kill a drake3 garmon fighting idiots does not make nanoships balanced4 nano ships are not counters to the blob nano ships are the blob just like all the fools that said titans were the solution to blobs just like any other overpowered tactic it will become the blob
op described the problem with nanos well i think at least partial solution could be putting all speed enhancing modules and rigs to same stacking category for example after rigging the ship with 2 polycarbs you could only fit 1 more odnanoistab to lows before the stacking penalty nullifies the bonuses gained so massvelocityagility would all be on same category
not supportednano ships are ridiculously expensive and should have abilities to match their costim talking minimum 300m each most people i know who fly them are broke and youd be surprised how often and how easily they can be lost if the pilot isnt paying 100 attention all the timenanoships are stronger than regular yes but they cost twice as much and require 10 times the skill and concentration to flythats not brokenviable counters to nanosmixed fleetshuginrapierceptorsany fleet bigger than 20amarr ships  great tracking  ewar heavy fleetsseriously we run from all of the above nanos work well because there are too many groups running around with 15 slow ships no decent webbers and no tracking or all missiles nano ships are simply strong against the type of group most noobs put together  as much armor and dps as possible bring ur bs guys  
i said they are the only real problem  ok novadays you can ad the hyena but these are the only ships that make me running imediatly if they appear on my scanner but back to topic i dont say that the nanoships themselfs are broken but my opinion is still that there are to less counters the advantage and the protection of a nanoship its is speed so a classical countership would be one which can kill the speed all classical slow and well tanked ships cant do that  and thats absolutely ok   at the end it is always the sameif a nanogang appears you have to jell for some minmatar recon pilots these are good counterships but you need these spezialised pilots that have invested the skilltime in these recons on the other hand the most interceptors are of course realy good nanoships with high speed and if they work in groups of 4 or 5 they alone can kill a load of ships so you can train the interceptors of almost every race to have a decent nanoship but you need to train the minmatar recon to have a well counter ship  that is in my opinion what is broken here cuchulin
ok you are right the best nanoships which outrun all the other low cost ceptors and whatever else can be incredibly expensive but if we stay at the ceptors for example then you can have a nice nanoship for lets say 40  50 mio isk it will not make 14 kms but it will also do the job  4 or 5 of them can kill for example a bs out of a group of slower ships which costs much morecuchulin
its broken boost something to counter or nerf it
fix the blob then fix nano otherwise people are going to be even less likely to travel solosmall groups looking for pvpas a minmatar recon pilot 20km webs and a nano nerf would make me cry for matari recons itd just about make them good only for refining down for the minerals 
yeah now that i look back most hacs at least have 1625k ehp assuming they fit large t2 shield extenders  which is not necessarily a good idea if you want to be hard to hit  sure you can kill a drake in a frig but that would have to be one of the stupidest drake fittings ever if it cant even tank 100 dps nano ships reasonably fit however are much more likely to die to frigs than any reasonably fit bc is ive seen drakes tank battleships in pvp with ease granted theyre not doing much damage but thats my point with nanos theyre mainly tank and unless youre very highly skilled theres little gank there without severely curtailing your speedif there are enough idiots flying nano ships to make 4 long videos why are so many people complaining seriously if you can fit a rupture to specifically solo kill nanos whats the issue youre not going to stand much of a chance against a tanked bc with a gank fit like that but if you exploit the weaknesses of nanos theres nothing to really worry about nanos will simply runthe real problem is that in the age of eft people are so obsessed with dps that they forget tracking and other concrete considerations like ewar cap and range ive lost enough nano ships myself to know that they take a ton of skill to fly well and you must choose your targets or you die the issue isnt an unbalance really its just that people dont realize that you cant use the same tactics on a tanked bs that you would on a vagabondill agree some blobs are nanoed to oblivion  espeically fw ones   but a blob overly specialized like that is susceptible to the same problems as any other overly specialized gang
keep proving me right i wasnt talking about the hyena
the frigate does not have to do dps to kill the drake you do not understand how combat works in 00 dps on the winning side is rarely an issue its keeping the other side from leaving which isit is however ed to not do so if you canbalance is not achieved by assuming idiocy on one side and competence on the other you must assume both parties know what they are doing otherwise when people who are competent come along the imbalanced will be exploited the nanos will simply run is exactly the problemas an aside how many times does he fail that we do not see videos often skew perceptions of the players ability kil2 for instance who we see making a number of cool videos has only a 151 battleship killdeath ratio is he good probably but he still dies a lot we have three pretty awesome videos from him and if they were any indication he would have a 101 kd ratio or something equally ridiculous yes that is exactly it you choose the targets no one else does there is no way to dictate an engagement against a nanogang without superior numbers of nanoships if your nanogang sticks around and dies then that is you being foolish and not them being accomplishednot really no because nanogangs do not need to specialize they will bring ewar cap warfare long range webs logistics dps the works but you cant force them to engage and that is the crux of the problem
maybe not i am the bad nano pilot here  if you have the omgwtf counter nano tactic then tell us little noobs your wisdom and if you argue right i will shut up and will accept that everything is alright with the nano stuffcuchulin
posting with the wrong alt
while i agree with this in principle we have to remember that this is a game and that implies everything needed to maintain a perception of fairness  im not saying equality   on all sidesthings that with ridiculous cost  in currency or time   should obviously provide benefit but in a game one can only provide so much benefit before the perception of fairness is lost often the best solution to this is to have less benefit per unit cost as the cost increases in other words 100mil to 150mil gives less benefit than 50mil to 100mil if pitching a 150mil against a 50mil results in an absolutely no contest match  cmon who wants to play a game where the game guarantees a predetermined outcome   the fix is simple just decrease the benefit gained for increments of higher cost vs increments of lower cost things with ridiculous cost will still provide benefit things with low cost will still have some semblence of chance thus we can satisfywithout removing all the fun and challenge from a gameso im saying yes spending to rig up your ship should be rewarded in a bit more advantage  inversely proportional to how much youve already spent   but that advantage must never reach a point where it is usually classified an exploit in most every other game  if i do this right i am exceptionally effective in the majority of situations and for all the rest as well if i just avoid those   the problem with nanos is it fits right into both exceptionally effective in the majority of situations and easily being able to just avoid the rest by choice

id say no there are already counters to nanos take my raven its an antinano battleship my cruise missiles speed is just over 9000kms with a 30 second flight time thats the equivalent to 250km they come near me and in a few salvos there dead especially vagabonds and running dont help them as my missiles are generally faster than they are and including most inties except the real good ones  though they are nightmares to kill  most gangs tend to have a few huginnsrapiers with them and the cost is huge my nano vaga cost me a whopping 250m isk to fit minimum the ship  8090mt2 nanos are a few million eachoverdrives 15 i thinkthe rigs are 5060 each  polycarbons  guns tend to be around 23mfits in general ur speaking 1015 million
ive mainly done low sec small gang war fare and fw recently so i understand the basic idea of tackling something i think we were talking about different things however since a frig does stand a reasonable chance of killing a nano ship but not normally any conventional fitvalid point and he does lose some ships in some of the videos however its still a 15mil ship taking down 100 mil nanoed hacsah so i think i understand now i still disagree however i dont see why a gang or a ship lacking significantly in dps and tank should be forced to engage anything the nanos one real advantage over others is the ability to run but it does pay significant costs for that sure you can have ewar on a nano ship but its going to cost you and it wont be sustainablei dont fly in 00 so i could be way off but if the main goal of being in 00 is capturing and holding territory youre much better off with a conventional fleet as nanos for the most part are meant to harass and weaken but dont have the staying power of a well balanced campin my experience in low sec though the real problem with nano ships is that people just havent gotten over eftperhaps a better antinano change would be to boost snipingtargeting so that 300km is no longer safe
yepcerb pilot hvy missiles betweem 9000  9700 mps 218 220 kms max range most vaga pilots would be hard pressed to get the hell out of the way or those things no tracking issues and hard as hell to speed tank and there you go
a frigate does not have a reasonably chance of killing a nanoship the nanoship zeros out transversal pops the tackler and warps awayconversely a frig does have a reasonable chance of killing a conventional ship apply scram orbit hope reinforcements get there before you dieand there needs to be benefit to increased isk expenditure the benefit is simply too high cruisers are too marginalized furthermore the cost difference is not relevant you could spend more on that rupture than a standard t2 nanoship and fit a fleet of them and you still wont be reaching the efficiency levels that nanoships gain from readily available goodsthey are not lacking in dps or ewar 2 falcons 2 vagabonds 2 rapiers and you have 1000 dps to 25km and you will be out of any fight before anything large can even lock you as gang sizes increase start adding zealots and your dps keeps going upnanos dont have the staying power of a heavily battleshipcap oriented strategic gang no but for gate camps loads better if anything big comes in and you are not in nanoships you have a chance of dying a nanogang can disappear into space and then reform after the threat has passedin terms of fleet effectiveness nanoships are no slouches either they are hands down the best support ships in the game the wealthiest alliances in terms of personal wealth   will have fleet compositions that look like thiscapsbsreconshacshicscovopsthey wont have interceptors they will tackle with hacs and hics in lowsec there are three fundamental differences1 no bubbles speed is less important when you can warp to 0 on every gate 2 gate guns 150300 dps to 150km with infinite tracking3 stations anyone can dock at theseand just to get the adhoms out of the way i fly nanoships i do this  because its effective i am the high skillpoint wealthy not technically   pilot that is just the ones to abuse these types of mechanics and i do all the damn time

no thanks i usually prefer not to give the nubs who dont know better free information the fact of the matter is you are missing pretty flagrant nonminmatar vessels that every nanopilot should look to kill as soon as possible
people must get over the notion that spending lots of money  game balance it does not balances are maintained by limitations in eve isk is effectively limitless the reason your vagabond is entitled to better than say a rifter is because it is more difficult to use  training   and at this point a lesser effect of scarcity it has nothing to do with the isk you spend for the same reasons some modules are entitled to perform better than others in fact they add drawbacks as additional balance factors on t2 higher fitting costs or power usage per cycle penalties to other areas more difficult to use and so on that is how item and ship balance is  or should be   maintained officer gear is not entitled to be more potent than other gear because it costs more the balance factor of scarcity is used now the problems come in when combinations of modules and ships infringe on other roles to the point that ships that would fill those roles become obsolete or nearly so this is where some attempt to justify performance with cost considering we each have what amounts to a printing press to churn out money when we wish that argument must be rejected couple that with the gaming factor that every ship should have a role that it excels at above others  more balance issues   and you should see the problem ishtars moving at 9k are unbalanced not because they move fast but because they eliminate the need for other ship classes there are many many other issues tied directly to these simple underlying conceptsships become more powerful and durable as they grow larger these ships also get slower and less agile as they grow smaller they become more agile faster less durable and less powerful we have a wide array of modules available that allow us to push the envelop in one direction or another if a larger ship can by any means be more potent  or so equal as to make distinction nearly irrelevant   than a smaller in every comparable category then there is an imbalance the same can be said of a smaller ship to a larger there are others issues such as risk and the withdraw ability i will not touch on right at the moment let me close with thisships and ship classes have their place nano can exist in this spectrum and be perfectly acceptable if throwing money which is not balancing at something allows it to overwhelm through performance classes larger or smaller than itself there is a problem and the balance has been lost this is the current problem with nano and why it needs to be reviewededit and sorry for the wall i tried to keep it simple
ok some comments to this listingmixed fleetsnot a point on its ownjust saying if you have rapiers you can counter ithuginrapier yes of course this is the only good way to tackle them downceptors a possibilitybut i would like to see a single ceptor to tackle down a sabre or vagain most cases the poor little one will just get blown up any fleet bigger than 20 not a point at all imho  depends on the shiptypes of the fleet  and is also not realy a counter cause the nano pilots will just fly away from the enemys and stay save there is no possibility to get them engaged if they dont make mistakes  amarr ships  great tracking   never had probs with that but even if some nano pilot is flying so slow that he realy gets hithe will not be tackled down by this and just warp out if he is taking to heavy damageewar heavy fleets this can be of course a pain in the ass for every enemy not just nanos but again its more like a self protectionecms doesnt tackle nanosi conclude there are of course possibilitys to do some self protection  in fact there are missing quite a few like large neuts on bs and whatsoever but at the end we have a situation where it is still almost impossible to get the nano ships tackled down if they take damage they will just burn away and warp off and that is again the reason why i think this is brokenif they are able to kill me then there should be an easier  of course not too easy   way to kill them then to have a specialised minmatar pilot with me cuchulinps sorry for my constant posting on this but altough i have fun on my own flying such ships in the last time the big not to tackle nano blops are realy anoyingthere is just not much fun in these engagements for the none nano pilotpps it is your choice to do so or notbut if you not want to argue then you shouldnt maybe post at all
sorry chaps we failed it was the first item on the agenda tried my best to argue for it but ultimately it failed 2 votes for  jade and hardin   6 votes against i personally still feel this is an important issue and ill try to work on it again later on in the csm term
what happened to the wwwevecsmcom site why are we being forced to go to a thirdparty forum for the chatlogs also i havent read it yet but congrats on your 45 hour meeting you guys really know how to party
serenity had to sleep  we did work pretty damn hard you know i could have left you waiting till tomorrow but im still full of coffee so decided to let you know now you arent forced to go anywhere btw if you dont want to read the chatlog on the star fraction site you dont have to  by all means wait till the formal release of the chatlog elsewhere
sorry that came across nastier than intended i was commenting as much as anything on the fact that the chatlogs for the last meeting also arent posted anywhere other than said thirdparty board im also a bit annoyed at serenity about my updates re new threads not having been added to the sticky but ive talked with him about it and its not actually a big deal i get generally annoyed when people on a volunteer committee take on a huge swath or responsibility and then dont follow through especially since it seems that theres always one who does that if its temporary hey life happens but i asked because it looked like theres been a bit of a fullscale retreat going on as regards the document postings you guys started with its hardly the end of the world but its something id prefer not to see happen also ive read the log now and it seems like this one was just a long meeting because of a lot of issues not because of any new drama i must say im thankful  one week of a derailed csm is enough for me
fail nighthawk is used for pve way more commonly then other command ships but it fails at any decent pvp setup so this would not work and you probably should   know thiswhy was there not a list of setups made and compared quickly via images or whatever or a challenge for them to go pvp in this thing without a mwd or cap boosterall the info you need is in this topicyea but who cares we dont fly ithas any of you csm who voted no actually been through this thread
the issue documentation i raised had a lot of good information from this thread in it kaillani it had comparisons of setups and powergrid and the proposed fixes sad but i couldnt convince people this time will try again later in the session
ah well thanks for trying jade
kailani youll also notice that a lot of the rejections were based on the principle that they didnt want the csm to get into the minutia of shipbalancing thats an entirely reasonable viewpoint and its hardly a statement that they dont care about the nighthawk because they dont fly it i can understand annoyance but dont get too ad hominem just because they disagreed on this topic
i apologize i let some rl issue influence that postthough on the subject of small concerns the large autocannon issue was voted and passed with it having less forum support it was said the nighthawk has strongpoints yes it does passive tanking while all medlowrig slots except 2 bcu are dedicated to the passive tank if thats what you call a strongpoint its slow it cannot tackle it cannot escape its only a sitting duck that tanks well and deals out 425 dps from t2 launchers with navy scourge or less from other damage types adding a 3rd extender with pg increase and face it missions pose no threat to this ship thus more pve only passive tank would add nothing to it   increases kinthermexp tanking only after adding a 3rd extender you only have 2 slots for hardeners leaving two logical choices for pvp eminvuln or invulninvuln eminvuln has 620 uniform tank with exp being weakest at 512 tanked best is thermal at 853 tanked invulninvuln has 637 uniform tank with em being weakest at 312 tanked best is thermal at 1154 tanked and note that the currently usable 2 extendereminvulninvuln is 643 tanked weakest em at 515 tanked best is thermal at 915 tanked id say the previous setup are worse then what can be currently fielded why you would passive in pvp i dont know possibly in baiting or fleet situations but this ship only has 88 km range on heavies which is not good for fleet war precisions same with all guided missiles   are short ranged for some unknown reason as well except for light missiles which are equivalent in range to t1 i think it would need a shield recharge nerf if only for the fact it tanks insane amounts of kintherm even though it has a huge em hole with invulninvuln   the tank isnt too much when patching up the em hole because you have to remove a invuln or better yet an extender
there is a bright side to this of course because this is a democracy after all  we can choose to not vote for them should they run againthis said the issue with buffing the grid for use in pvp is that it will make it an even better passive tank for pve because youll be able to fit the shield extenders with less of an issue i mean you dont want to make the nh too op for pve usage
facepalmthe nighthawk is the defining lame duck of field command shipsdouble facepalm oh cripes this is a terrible idea all it tells you is that this its useful in pve you could try the same thing with missiles vs turrets and conclude that missiles needed to be nerfed into the ground because of all the raven missionrunners its logically insane and frankly i am staggered that a csm member would propose such a idea seriously all people need to do to realise theres a problem is to look at the ship bonuses  hello useless precision bonus   and then spend 5 minutes with eft trying to shoehorn a useful pvp fit on to it it really is that simple i appreciate this but what about large autocannons then ok theyre not ships but the principle is hardly different
greatsomethings are best left alone now if you could remove yourself from the chair it would make my day a real happy one
i just explained this yes the kinthermexp tank will be better for pve passive setup the better option for omnitank is to remove the 3rd extender thougha simple shield recharge nerf would doalso this ship would do great with a 64 medlow layout instead 55 is the same as sleipnir as generally caldari ships should have more medless low slots then a minmatar shield tanker it would actually nerf passive tanks since shield relays boost the tank more then anything while helping the pvp setup though this is an entirely different problem
i know this has been shotdown but signed buff pg drop a low  perferably 2   for a med  pref two    caldari should have opposite medlow slot layout of ammarr see absolution layout   change precision bonus to explosion velocity bonus  precision is amazingly worthless  sigh from reading the chatlogs its like the sm forum personalized caldari is relegated to a lolpve role minmatar has a perpetual fanbase drones always need loving amarr is generally viewed neutrally the cynic in me questions the point of the csm if the members will vote in the same proportion as the installed forum base to begin with
head explodes in anger at the ignorancethe nighthawk is only popular in pve it is not popular in pvp because it has insufficient pg to fulfill its gang antisupport role and has a useless precision bonus i repeat i am aghast that members of the csm believe that the nighthawk is popular in pvp and that an inventory count of it relative to the other field cs would provide any useful information on its pg needs or pvp balance issues like charles babbage i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such comments
thismakes one wonder if the csm shouldnt start a topic themselves to relieve them from the duty of taking a closer look at specific ship types and their balancing its one thing to look at wider game mechanics and escalate issues there to ccp its a totally different thing to get deep into minutiae of game design like ship balancing and one that will tie up a big amount of their resources if they have to cope with it
while i will concede that having the csm committee looking at specific issues with specific ships might lead to too much minutiae i am frankly astounded at some of the ignorant and apathetic comments made by some of the csms in reference to the very brief discussion regarding this very very old issuethis comment seems to me to be the absolute definition of apathy serenity doesnt seem want to bother reading a thread where its been conclusively shown that a ship has problems so instead of wanting to address the issue she simply falls back on well other races have ships with issues so lets just continue to let this ship have its problems alsoseriously i was floored when i saw this statement having voted for serenity i feel like ive made a huge mistake in having done so it seems like several of the csms cant be arsed to read a thread and do some homework in order to truly step up to the plate and fill the role that they were elected to occupymore of the same if leandro had taken the time to read more than a few posts of the thread he would have seen some very solid  and very basic math   that explains almost precisely how much grid the nighthawk needs in order to be on par with other field commands however instead of reading the thread he just makes some ambiguous comment about how it might need a fairly small boost since the nighthawk has other strong points what other strong points are some of the csms really too lazy to do their homework and read threads isnt a free trip to iceland and a sense of responsibility enough to get people to do their jobscontinued
again im astonished are those people voted into csm positions truly careless or thoughtless enough to think that ship usageownershipor production will provide evidence of a balanced ship its already be shown by ccp that caldari outnumber other players and most carebears fly caldari for missions those two facts there show that more people are going to be pushed down that path of training and usage regardless of ship effectiveness even so the nighthawk isnt a terrible ship for pve however this issue has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of pvp its obvious serenity did not bother to read the thread otherwise she would have knownall in all im pretty freaking disappointed that the csms so briefly and superficially touched on an issue that some of us have spent so much time trying to address ill simply hope that some of the csms that seem to care to brush up on issues will readdress this later or that  miracle involved   ccp might actually fix the nighthawk after having been gimped for yearsregardless my thanks goes out to those csms willing to study some of these issues and who will continue to work toward solving this and other important problems
this is symptomatic of the problem upon hearing nighthawk it appears that leandro has simply assumed that we were talking about pve balance and fitting issues i wouldnt blame him for the assumption  the nighthawk is currently too gimped to be useful in pvp  but i would blame him for not realising that this is a pvp balance issuethis entire thread has been discussed in terms of pvp balance although the implications of suggested changes to pve balance have certainly not been disregarded to see such a comment as leandros is simply bafflingi think an explanation of leandros comments would be useful specifically confirmation that it is understood that this is a pvp balance issue not a pve one and an explanation of what he believes the nighthawks other strong points are in pvp with the appreciation that tanking is not a rolei repeat i am aghast that members of the csm believe that the nighthawk is popular in pvp and that an inventory count of it relative to the other field cs would provide any useful information on its pg needs or pvp balance issues like charles babbage i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such comments
shrug i can understand the dont want to get into balance response from csm that actually seems fairly reasonable actaully  theres a lot of issues here that are this is balanced this isnt kind of thingsto pick up one shoot down another though it somewhat disappointing oh well time to go buy a few more falconsmaybe though this is something in and of itself that should be an issue eg should we be wasting csm time with ship and module balance issues
nice
wouldnt this be a disadvantage to bomber and recon pilots
remember when trinity  or the patch   before came out and director evemails were sent to everyone in the corpit was one day of hell

great idea that should have happened long ago
missions arent my primary interest but if this would happen i would certainly have more fun making the moneyedit  forgot the thumbs up thingie
look at the most recent dev blog
hll yeah i want u to write the scripts
100 more adventure and unpredictability pleasea little more randomness would be also good just some crazy brainstorming you delivered a package but on the way back you find yourself pulled out of warp facing several pirate ships  ok lowsev level iv probably    exploration find xxx in the constallation  competitionteamwork give the same mission out to several players at once competitve like finding the exploration site above or as forced teamwork like in real life sometimes you had wardeclared a certain guy last yearsurprise now you have to work with him to achieve a certain goal for a limited time enemies with cloaking ability primary and secondary goals maybe
the only way mission will ever be slightly interesting is if there is a chance you will lose your ship
good ideas for the present missionsreduce the number of rats by 80make them a lot stronger and with higher reward on their head   
yes
hell yes  although if its in the gun doesnt it get auto removed   oh hell that is dirty it says go  yourself its damaged before it says that guns loaded removing ammo and continuing on with the contract
supporting
yes
certainly makes sense and getting camped in station where youre blind is kinda weirdanyone have a covops on station
signedfor those afraid of lag just give us a 500km 360degree station scannerthe amount of lag generated by one scanner click is negligible compared to being undocked for even a few seconds
and sort by meta level in the market too
raises handsimple effective and useful
most certainly yes
not crucial but would definitely be nice to have and its easy to implement
very helpful great idea
i would love that feature the meta level should show in the list view version of windows  hangar cargo etc  
awwww jea
i think a dev has said that it required a second db lookup to determine the meta level similar to the issue with getting a bpobpc distinction otherwise i melt most of the loot of my entire corp so no problems with that
flip this on its head what about if there were a new module created a highslot item   so it reduces the firepower of the ship chosen   which reduces the cpu requirements of a scan probe launcher   not recon launchers   there for you can fit a scan probe launcher on a ship already in game add this new gadget to enable you to fit the rest of your ship around it minus the 2 highslots required for the mod and the launcher say a scan probe battery of sorts what ya think 
yes
sorry experimental alt thing
even if it did not get the csm support  till now   i support this even thoughit would not be just the technical aspects of such a class of ships but also some kind of identificational or even roleplay aspectsplaying the lone wolfexplorer style is attractive in some ways and it has to have a suitable ship

there are so many others too a couple come to mindwhatever happened to jirai laitanen after he was podkilled hes not been seen for years and rumours of his death or reanimation into a defective clone have never been followed up on its a massive issue for guristas loyalists to know whether fatal and the rabbit are still actually running the organisation or whether only korako kosakami is nowalso what ever happened to achilie abraxas and lucash helmatt who were representitives to the guristas capsuleer loyalists from venal and were working on attacking mito to gain a guristas foothold therewhatever happened to salvador sarpati and the federation navy soltueur class titan he stole and rampaged through empire in back to serpentis hqthere are a million more unanswered questions and loose ends that the arcs were just cut short for and never completed some that have a major impact on faction supportersi can say that im 100 behind this issue and it needs sortingof course a complete lack of faith in the ability of the csm to actually do anything about it other than argue leaves me doubtful it ever will come to that
id go with changing the tempest first though with more agility 25m3 more bandwidth  making it 100m3 bandwidth or 4 ogres basically   and 125m3  150m3 dronebayitd give it somewhat more punch more flexibility for droning and make it a proper minmatar ship atm it handles bad
the advantages of minmatar dissapear when you get to bs size ships and then all of a sudden the drawbacks of minmatar start to play havoc minnie doesnt do great damage nor does it tank too well but they have versatility utility speed and agility  neuts come to mind   speed and agility are lost on bss  normally   so they either have to be able to dish it out or suck it up the large autos simply lack oomph combine that with the tempests silly dronebay makes it a no go i dont see a way to improve the ship from a fittingtactics point of view and lets not even start about arties these days if you look at for instance a hurricane with a similar setup you dont gain any real dps increase no matter what you try when switching to a tempestthe maelstrom wont win any pssing contests either unless you go for a fleet setup and even then its not something to boast about the only bs that works quite well is a phoon which oddly enough does great if you completely forget about putting on turretsso 2 out of 3 minnie bs arent up to par and those are turret users the other one doesnt even use turrets most of the time  or doesnt rely on them   so yeah instead of looking at the ships themselves i think that stating that large autos need a bit of love is probably the best way to look at it
everything has been pretty much said i dont use battleships because of all the turret problems rather use battlecruisers which are more fun and are more minmatar like than the big slow battleships its a shame that they arent too great im not interested in what theyre going to be like once ccp changes them im more interested in how are they going to be changed because the only way to do that would be changing the weapons making the battleships more agilefast would go against the whole idea of battleships being the slowest but the hardest hitting boats in the game good luck ccp
i agree with thisfrom when choosing between missiles and projectiles on my typhoon  both the same shipbonus   i seem to remember thata  missiles do full damage over all ranges while due to falloff projectiles do notb  missiles have no tracking issues while projectiles doc  missiles also dont use capso i was surprised when i learned that projectiles didnt do any more damage at all making missiles quite the superior choice which to my oppinion makes a pretty good point for projectiles not living up to it they should at least make a viable alternative just with different strongpoints

i honestly dont think my maelstrom needs any more damage output its kinda overpowered allready if you ask me but if acs got a straight 7 damage increase accross the board and the maelstrom was changed to a damage instead of rof bonus the dps would stay the same while the tempest would get a slight boost plus my ammo bill from the maelstrom would go down a bit pthe only problems i have with autos is the ammo barrage is nice but emp and hail could use some work i would like to see emp get its base damage raised to be inline with shortrange charges and crystals nerf the longrange projectile ammo if you need to no one uses that stuff anyway also i dont see why hail should lose 50 falloff and optimal when void only loses 25 opt and 50 falloff and conflag has same range and t1 mf it would be nice if hail didnt have any optimal penalty so 800m iis could hit for full or nearfull damage at the edge of web range

i would like the ability to set my waypoints without having to open other menus such as my assets the map or people  placesperhaps when you press a certain hotkey be it in space or dockedan extremely small input box appears at the top left of the screen where i can type in the destination i want and it automatically sets it for me the option to leave it permanently on the screen should also be an option while its basically trading a window for another window it would be so small i could devote more attention to flying around in space there wont be windows cluttering up the screen and itll be less complicated to do
try this type the name of the system you want to go to into any chat window paint it with the mouse rightclick and select autolink  solar system  or whatever  no client here cannot check exacts   it will turn into a nice link you can then rightclick to set destination you do not even have to send the link to any channel it will work from the channel input box and you can then delete it without pressing enter
ahh thank you
i have been enjoying the new story arcs even if they do not align with previous ones and i hope ccp keeps it upi agree with this proposal whole heartedly
good ideas
got voted through the csm without opposition today
i agree can i vote with my other account as well
totally sipported   i liek the part about ded skill d and joining navies     like factional warfare for carebears   
now i know there are several other threads about this out there and its slightly against forum rules to make new threads regarding existing issues however in all the other threads about this people are  in my opinion   getting things wrong perhaps they dont provide detail to their ideas or perhaps they suggest things that would really not work in principle bottom line everyone  well almost everyone   wants transferrable killrights but so far little thought has been given as to how this could be implemented heres my ideathe system would call for a bounty system makeover basically make it so that bounties can only be placed by someone who has kill rightsand can only be placed on those he has kill rights against this would prevent the system from being exploited  see below   a new kind of npc regulated contract can be accepted  by anyone   to kill anyone with a bounty the thing is the contract would require collateral equal to 5mil  2x the targets current bounty  this would be to prevent anyone and everyone from taking out contracts on the big guys   the contract would last for one week of accumulated play time of the target if the target isnt online the timer is essentially stopped if the target is killed by the hunter in this time the contract ends the collateral is returned and the hunter gains the targets bounty if the contract ends without a killing then the collateral is lost and the hunter must take out a new contract on that person unlike other stated ideas though the person who initially places a bounty  there could be several   does not have anything to do with the public contract you should not be able to make money by being ganked the contract exists because someone has a bounty on them it is not created as a hit by the player who placed the bounty as a side effect failed contracts would cause an isk sink when a contract is taken out on your head you would recieve a mail saying who is hunting you  it could be multiple people   in the same way you receive a mail when war decd as long as the contract is active either party can legally shoot each others shipspods  the contract doesnt end when the hunter dies just the target   also the contract cannot be cancelled once it is accepted its binding anyway this would make it so having a bounty is a winlose situation on the one hand it could mean that youll get free pvp on the other it could mean there could be the equivalent of a war against younot your corp you if the target is podded during the contract by someone else the contract ends and collateral is returned one would still be able to pod someone for their bounty as they can now the contract only gives the legal ability to kill the target for their bounty without repercussions from the lawalso the minimum bounty would have to be raised to at least a mil to make people actually want to hunt and to help prevent the exploitation of getting kill rights and then putting up a bounty of 5k to get someone to kill the person with this system the smallest amount of collateral would be 7mil for a 1mil reward youd get the money back if you did your job remember this wouldnt be exploitable against carebears one could still only place a bounty if they have killrights against someone the proposed system would give another  possible   consequence for piracy but would still keep the lawabiding citizens safe i feel this system would create a very interesting dynamic between pirates and bounty hunters as a pirate youd feel all the more badass for having someone specifically hunting you as a hunter youd feel all the more badass when your hours of work finally culminated in a successful kill sorry for the text wall but i figured i better state the details first as to avoid misunderstandings
what no opinions
this raising a specific stat on a single ship  nighthawk needs more pg   was brought before the csm yet a whole line of ships for one race being out whack was not ill add that the minmatar cap ships thread has had much more support than the nighthawk thread
id like to know the csms comment on ccps actions regarding the 3090day etc they were aware of the issue and surely aware that it was being taken into consideration if the issue was beyond the csms level should we not all have been informedallowing us to vote on an issue that has already been decided shows a very poor level of communication between ccp the csm and the community
there are two ways for it get onaa csm members can support itbit can get 5 support of total voters  needs to be looked at though but still  so vote and it can countor elect better candidates next time
been listed on the market for a while when will we get this valuable skill i say now whos with meedit for stupid spelling
i think that the reason why so many people are frustrated in combat with nanoships and the reason why people complain about them is not necessarily that they are overpoweredthe real problem is that only one race the minmatar can field ships with any real ability to counter them the huginn rapier and hyena have stasis web range bonuses that let you snare a nanoship long enough to bring its speed down in spite of inertia the gallente of course have decent nanoships that might at least be able to keep up the caldari have the crow and uh the crow amarr forget about itim willing to bet that the vast majority of people who complain about nanoships are flying caldari and amarr and possibly gallente to some degree they cant fly huginns or rapiers without about a year of training for matari ships its frustrating they feel helpless their corp may not have many matari pilots who might be able to supplement their gangs to provide antinano capabilityto counter this frustration while still allowing nanoship pilots to keep their beloved speed demons i propose the either of the following1   each race that doesnt already have one gets a hac or recon ship with a web range bonus so we poor caldari pilots can one day eventually hope to get revenge against the nanogangs that blew us to pieces when we were noobsor2   the introduction of a stasis field generator with a relatively wide area of effect  say 3040 km   similar to a warp disruption bubble the stasis field slows down all ships within its area of effect this will need to have a few limitations firstly warp disruption bubbles and stasis fields should not be able to be colocated  you cant create a bubble that intersects with a stasis field and vice versa secondly the stasis field generator can be fitted only by interdictors and you cannot fit both a stasis field and a bubbler at the same time i think option 2 provides some interesting opportunity for tactical innovation on the part of the nanogangs for instance one could imagine pairing nanogangs with stealth bombers to couter the counternano ships sbs warp in at 100km and decloak letting fly a salvo or three at the interdictor until it pops at which point the nanogang can sweep in and do its usual business at the same time it allows nonmatari pilots to feel like they have some chance of killing these previously  for them   unkillable ships and nanoships can still do what they like to do best gank big slow ships that are caught alone or in small numbers without supporttldr summary nanoships arent overpowered the matari just have an unfair monopoly on antinano ships we need to either give other races ships with web range bonuses or create a stasis field generator for interdictors to optionally use instead of warp disruption bubbles
the problem with nanos is with the mathematics involving inertia and how webs affect agilitysee nyphur
hmm your post seems pretty serious but the title says otherwise
i partially agree but i dont think its entirely true that the minmatar have a monopolyi actually cant think of a race that doesnt have a hac that could legitimately kill a nano ship except maybe the caldari i really dont have any experience fighting a nano with misslesgallente fit an ishtar with small drones andor a drone speed modamarr some quite capable nanoed hacs which good trackingcaldari hamls with precision misslesin addition the recons of each of those have some very decent nano counterscaldari jamming  doesnt kill but a nano that cant shoot you isnt going to attack you  gallente sensor damping a nano to force them to be closer and thus orbit sloweramarr curse nuff saidwebs arent the only way to kill nanos it just requires a little more creativity if youre not minmataredit cleaned up a bit
grann in my experience hamls dont have the range to take on nanoships which tend to withdraw to cruisemissileonly ranges in between attack runs so im not sure theyre viable antinano weapons the other problem is that most of the antinano countermeasures you mention there work fine for small nanogangs but for large nanoblobs you run into the following problems1   you cant jam or dampen every ship all the time so they dont get discouraged2    re ishtar curse antinano operations   if you go out to meet them theyll tear you apart because if youre not already in a nanogang you probably dont have an even number of nanoships and they can draw you out of range of the rest of your fleet and call you primary i was recently in an engagement between a 15person nanoblob and a 15person conventional t1t2 blob that ended in a nearly perfect stalemate because neither party was able to engage the other  if they got too close wed web them and if we went out to meet them theyd pick us off one by one there was a lot of frustrating sitting around watching one another across 300km of space and waiting for the other party to blink the nanoblob eventually left because they had to go to bed id like to see something that can lead to a decisive victory for either party with good planning and tactics
caldari have ecm giving them a caldari skinned rapierhuginn would destroy racial specialisation and balance same argument goes for amarr and gallente with their respective reconsi like the principle of this idea but not the practical application a much easier solution to implement in my mind would be to increase decloak range to 30km off a sg so that the incredibly frustrating situation where you get webs and tackle on a target and land possibly 2 volleys of whatever your weapon of choice is just to see them jump can be balanced more effectively
ah ok i stand correctedi think that this story really is a better indication of the balance than of something being wrong if there were no nano ships at all a t1t2 fleet versus a t1t2 fleet in a similar stand off would probably end the same way or with minimal survivors the big difference being nano gangs  lacking in dps and tank   get to dictate rangehow about instead of more webbing  which nano gangs will avoid anyway   boost sniping so that killing at 300km or so is not impossible
not a bad idea the caldari rokh platform would be great for this but it would also be nice to have a missile solution in place as well missiles are probably the worst antinano weapon in the game maybe missile speed and range bonuses would be the way to go
ok i figured i would see how much support their was for an expansion of the domi hulltype either a customs  as they are the ones using this around the universe known as eve   or rogue droneseither make a faction domi or a faction sinthe sin is a domi hulltype but made for ew and stealth this would seem ideal for the customs version but not the rogue drone versionthe customs should expand on the sin as ew and scanning a focus on its intel gathering role its use in customs to track down contraband would be the direction of this ship rather then its ability to create a jump bridge not a group ship specifically but rather one made to be like a bloodhound in groups and a survallience craft alone in customs efforts to stomp out terrorism and the illegal traffic or drugs slaves and anything along those line bonuses to scan time scan  exploration or ship probe   time bonus and strength bonus no offensive increase but adding the use of the covert ops cloak a mustthe rogue drone use of the domi hulltype would focus on its tank and drone deployment abilities drone damage tracking armor and shield boost drone control range drone speed drone optimal range drone sig radius mining drone productivity increase support drone abilities increase and many other areas would seem to be its focus the basic toughness of the rogue drones would be easily represented by adding another lowslot this could be used for armor resists agility or many other things the third and last differance would be armor repair rate the advanced neural network aboard this ship not only allows for better control of remote entities outside the actual ship but the control of the nanites within the ship increases so as to allow a 355 increase of armor rep amount per level of the focus skill s   though it might also be plausable for the hybrid weapons bonus to increase to 1015 as all the drone varients of the domi hit real hard but if this were to be the case i would go with lasers because the drones would seem to use beam types rather then ammo based systsm but i could be wrong though ammo would seem to be something they would have tried to avoid worrying aboutthe customs ship should require the normal black ops skills and signal aquisition astrometric triangulation and pinponting to vthe rogue drone varient would require bs v drones v drone interfacing v electronic engineering vthank you for your time
i wasnt aware that any other faction ship required so many level v skillsalso no bs has bonuses to mining from any source
youve already posted this thread just because it got low support and has been dead for two weeks doesnt mean you need to repost it
honestly it makes no sense for some of the faction ships we have that seem to require very little or no skill in the core systems that the ship is built upon yet they are so much more powerful then the original hull typepersonallly i dont think any faction ship should be easy to fly but rather require specialized knowledge and study in the areas of their core systems to use to their full abilityit is this make is so everyone can use them mentality that makes them overpowered as the only control on their use is isk or lp points not actual understand of the systems they are built aroundyeah i supported my own ideahaedit  and there are threads about replacing a particular ship graphic with a monster truck so whatthere are no rules for posting nor any guidlines observed for this forum by anyoneso guess i will keep doing it till that problem has been remediedthanks for caring
actually theres a nice fat sticky at the top of the thread telling people to avoid posting duplicate topics and providing a list of existing topics to help them do so also ive seen at least three csms tell people not to bump threads or to repost threads also look at this reasonably  your post got minimal support the first time around and died quickly why do you think itll do any better the second time around youre just wasting everybodys time
appologies if this has been discussed and dropped of the face of the forum somewherethe eveo forums from general discussion to corps and alliances and jita park are going largely unmoderated one assumes there is supposed to be some kind of moderation in place but were not seeing itid like the csm to represent the reinstatement of a volunteer based moderation team and a suitable accountability mechanic for those volunteers in my opinion these moderatiors should be afforded fairly strict powers enabling them to remove l2p noob and go back to wow replies entirely and temporarily mute repeat offenders in a similar vein id like for the csm to propose to ccp an ignore feature so those of us that choose to do so can self moderate posts shown to us posts from a filtered individual would ideally appear simply as a notification that this character posted with the opinion to show individual posts based on a contribution value judgement made on subsequent responsesexample i ban bobmcnasty for generally being a numpty but then seebobmcnasty post notificationbobmcnice actually bobmcnasty thats a really cool ideaid have the oportunity to display the post with indicated good idea and if sufficiently impressed unfilter that player
 reposted in the first post  one last try for sanitycurrently the csm does not have any form of formal direction or sturcture many people assume that the csmpdf document is meant to provide this but if you read closely it is easy to tell that it is not meant for that purpose it was written for ccp as a proposal for the idea of allowingencouraging the formation of a player government it is up to the csm like any other founders to establish how it as a government is supposed to work if the people represented are not happy with what they the representatives propose they revolt clearly the most popular csm related threads of late are ones calling for the downfall of the representatives or ones mocking iti can understand their desire to get things rolling and jump straight into issues without a constitution or similar document that formalizes how they are supposed to do and what they are supposed to do anything that is attempted in the meantime will be a catastrophe of confusion before they can address issues the csm desperately needs to adopt a founding document such as this
an internet spaceship constitution lawl
its no different than a local sports club having a founding document or a school organization etc this organization covers a much much larger body of people than most of those would and thus the need for such a thing is even greaterthere are plenty of towns and cities with smaller populations than tranquility has and they have charters etc that establish city councils mayors police forces etc its foolish to think any organizaiton which is supposed to represent tens or hundreds of thousands of people wouldnt need a set of rulesbylaws even the internet forums on which we communicate have such founding documents i doubt you could find many forums without one
this man needs a spot in ccp for amazing game balancing skills and superior game design ideas i fully endorse this product andor servicewhat could be possibly wrong with this idea
yes lets
i partly support this lets make it 01  04
well people with stuck assets can sell them to meit sure as hell would suck if jita was moved elsewhere currently its my main supply hub  when it loads   but think of all the fun you could have if there was a single 00 territory smack in the middle of empire without sovereignity

it will suck the trit right out of your ship
lol i can see it now a group of covetors with attack mining lasers webs and scrams use dones to beat the shield off a hyper and mine all the mineral out of the hull
frankly myself and a number of others were sceptical on the possible success of the csm some even more so after a month the csm has only voted on administration and some token issues without real effect therefore i propose a bi monthly vote to assess the general opinion on the csm and whether it should be maintained after all the initial vote for representatives did not allow voters to vote against the formation nor did it allow for an abstention vote therefore was not a truly democratic or representative election therefore needs to be constantly reviewed by those that it claims to represent
i just wish the csm would do what it was intentded to do instead of magic lets try to rebalance the game land
nor did it allow for an abstention votewhat do you mean i checked the abstain box myself
i concur
just let it fail properly first plz
ccp should just give goons their msn address and talk to us directly about game changes maybe give us some sort of t2 bpo reward too
lets give them a chance to actually do something first whatever is happening are growing pains in my opinion and should be overcome as they work more and more together if they do not do the job properly well there are other options at the moment it is too soon to tell if anything going to come out of it or not so lets give it time not supported
bad idea
with the empires going to war clearly insurance rates should go up i dont care where you die insurance needs to go away or go up a good bit my preference is remove insurance it doesnt really make sense it is good the newbies but after you have lost about 6 hulls in a week you insurance would be canceled in rl
bump to keep it fresh
please refrain from bumping
oh ok
hell yea i want hot pink missiles  for those complaining about lag you can just turn off missile effects  
im a dad and i live in australia my prime playtime is between 8pm and 10pm weeknights downtime takes up an hour of that leaving me very little opportunity to play for anything more than 45 mins to an hour at a time before people bring it up i accept that it works the way it is and whether or not it changes i wont be going anywhere ive learned to live with it as most aussies have so please no if you dont like it go play xxx type posts for all of that i think its worth throwing around some possible alternatives to the system ideally id like to see it put on a 25 hour timer instead of the current 24 that would distribute the downtime equally for everyone the big downside to this being of course that it would affect a much bigger proportion of the player base than it does now so perhaps not likelyotherwise if could move from week to week or month to month through something as small as a four hour window start it at 10 eve time one week 11 eve time the next week 12 eve time the next week etc it would have minimal effect on the majority of the player base still occur at reasonable times for the devs and at least sometimes give aussies the chance to play uninterrupted during the peak week night game timeand i know full well this idea doesnt have legs given that portion of the player base and the council affected by this is relatively small but im bringing it up anyway in the hopes that someone does take it onboard   
yes its a global game
they have it at 1112 gmt because it is convenient for them i wont support this but i understand your frustration
i understand that ccp might want to have dt at a convenient time for them however i think that any time during normal working hours in icelandlondon should be considered convenient enough the op is only asking for it to vary within a span of as little as 4 hoursccp needs to consider what is convenient for their paying customersdt as it is now is not very convenient for our friends in oceania and east asia
i guess they had a good look at the demographic then combined that with their own timetables and came up with what works best for themthe majority of players
yep it sucks for aussies and kiwis but there are valid reasons for a set time and the period that it occurs in you have forgotten to look at whats behind the game the time was choosen to fit in with the icelandic uk working day for very good reasons gives time for a morning brief on what will occur at down time all staff are available to elaborate on things to be carried out if required if something goes wrong lots of people are at hand and can stop everything and get on it the customer base can never be caught out as its always the same time and roughly the same duration no matter what time they did it people would be effected but its best in life to upset the least number of people costs are kept down no over time or out of hours payement theefore better value for money for the companythere are probally a lot more reasons but the first and more importantly the second are the ones that make it so
this has been brought up so many times in the past even if you get it into a csm meeting and they bring it to ccps attention they probably wont do it anyways and a shifting downtime would probably cause much frustration in the camp of the vast hordes of people who cant or refuse to read causing much grief for ccp in return  daily omg teh serverz iz down111oneone threads guaranteed  i understand your frustration but am indifferent myself for as long as it doesnt shift into euro primetime regularly p
i think that i would personally have the dt in an inconvenient time than have the ccp reboot stuff and do the dt maintenance and calculations outside of their normal working hours if something goes wrong during dt i would rather it was during the prime working time of the people who can do something about it so if it is varied it should be varied only inside that constraint
with the current system of how election is done you cannot directly challenge someone you just need to finish the race in the 10th position or higherim proposing the creation of csm seats thus being able to challenge people whom have express horrible or great ideasa rough idea of how the system would be is there will be 10 csm seats where unlimited number of people can run for each seat everyone or account   will be able to vote once for each seati think this will improved the debates on issues i hope such a system would also help remove alliance or corp politics and bring a focus on the issueplease start flaming now
block voting groups would be able to stack the entire council that is probably a bad thing with that vote manner the entire council would be likely to look like thisgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmalternatesgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmgoonswarmas funny as it would be to have a council of goons the csm needs multiple view points from across the spectrum to ensure that the problems that are addressed are not only those which affect a single entity in short the representative system we have now ensures that minority positions can achieve relevance on the council
omg bump
the problemamarr ships being contracted will almost always have their most used ammo type the crystal either in their weapons or in their cargoholds while other races ammo does not suffer damage like the amarr the crystal is special because it does not have charges but rather gets damaged as it gets used the current contract system disallows contracting of damaged items whatsoever this includes the amarr ammo typethusly remote contracting an amarr vessel that has once been used for combat with turrets is not possible without repackaging it and in some cases this can destroy rigs on the ship that are worth millions of isk if not billionspossible solutionsallow crystals to be placed in contracts with a  damaged   suffix this would alleviate the issue with contracting ships and allow all the ammo to be contracted aswell while not giving sellers a sneaky method of exploiting buyers of ammoallow remote emptying of cargoholds and weapons have it as a single feature maybe that would just remove all charges and items from the cargo of the ship in questionthe former of these two proposals would allow all the ammo to still be contracted and the new owner would understand he would get damaged goods the only issue i see with this is how damaged the goods are would be impossible to interpret but at least the buyer would know he wasnt getting brand new items when buying the contractthe latter provides a means to effectively complete the transfer while the ammo would be left behind the ship could effectively change ownership without the original owner having to make his way out just to empty the cargohold it would not jeopardize any market users and thus seems like the better choiceany other ideas would be welcomed and added
look here
this but supporting this thread anyway
why would we even have a csm election if all we want to do is remove the candidates after they have been chosen is there any logic behind this am i just wasting bandwidth posting this
i cant argue with him doing a or c but there should defintely be more of b occurring
until you read the average post he poasts signed
its clear that the solution to the controversy over the existence of the csm is a compromise to both sides remove all the elected representatives from the csm but keep the csm as a symbolic political body that will make everyone happy
replace the csm with devs
why settings cannot make my first character default ill never knowthis is my main

this is a unmodified  other than removing some irrelevant bits of smacktalk against jade the caldari state goons and the csm in general   chatlog from tama local chat a few minutes ago jade constantine  hello therepearljammer 5657  cool actually met someone from csmbatwigg  ahahahabatwigg  hey jadejade constantine  hey heybatwigg  how is muting voted reps goingjade constantine  so goon alts right   batwigg  so jadebatwigg  why do you think people who disagree with you are goon altsbatwigg  are you biased against goons or somethingjade constantine  yep i think goons are rubbishbatwigg  oohbatwigg  postin this on coadjade constantine  post this too   jade constantine  goons are eves greatest carebears  the biggest failures in 00 too scared to see their outposts explodejade constantine  might as well make your post worthwhile   is it really acceptable for a csm chair to be openly biased against two of his fellow voted representatives and to openly admit this in a crowded local chatcan this council really get anything done when we have a powertripping openly hostile against his fellow representatives childish chair such as jade constantine all the meetings so far have dissolved into childish bickering with jc in part to blame for most of it then there is of course the infamous muting incident where a elected representative was muted for merely disagreeing with jc  is this really acceptable behavior for someone who is supposed to head up a group that will present the concerns of us the playerbase to the game developers
yes this is eve online not my little pony online dont like hearing somebodys opinion dont ask
more like dont like hearing someones opinion just mute him from the channel
jade constantine you were not voted into office as the chairman of a eve online entity you were voted in as the chairman of a real life council of eve online players voted in to present the concerns and wishes of the playerbase to the makers of the gameyour behavior has during your term been completely inappropriate the excuse of this is eve online lol i can do whateva i want does not apply you are not being flown out to iceland to meet xhagen and the gang as jade constantine the eve player you are voted in as andrew cruse the personyour behavior has been on par with what i would expect of a 12 year old child and frankly you are a embarrassment you have betrayed the trust of your voters myself included by acting in a selfserving childlike power abusing manner your latest antics of assuming those who disagree with you are goon alts just serves as a glimpse into your bratty little mindyou are a disgrace please do the csm a favor and resign
exactly what do you think this thread will accomplish
its a bit like asking harry s truman what he thought about communists and then blaming him for itobvious troll is obvious please do us a favor and dont post anymore
the difference is harry s truman wasnt serving on a council with a bunch of communists representing a public that included a whole bunch of communists i am not trolling jade constantine has in the past shown some very questionable behavior  gagging a rep for no apparent reason other than disagreeing with him for instance   his behavior has on more than one occasion held up the council for hoursthen he openly states that he in fact despises the alliance that two of his fellow reps belong to and by proxy themselves  does this not strike you as incredibly unprofessional i am not trolling i feel that this is a very valid point do you honestly feel that jcs behavior on the council has been exemplary
no but i think its unreasonable to blame him completely its been trial and error thus far ccps expectations have been lacking and the role of the chair was largely undefinedso i think its wrong to blame jade he was put under a lot of pressure
no truman was head of political organization that was in struggle with a communist political organization asking harry truman what he thought of communists and then blaming him for it would be kinda like asking darius johnson what he thought of bob sympathizers inside goonswarm and then blaming him for it completely removed from his responsibilities on the csmit is only a right analogy if you believe that the csm is a tool for alliances to gain in game power over other alliances i and i suspect many other people find that idea abhorrent
truman didnt represent the communists and the americans
waitits unreasonable to blame jade constantine for jade constantines actions is that what you are sayingim not blaming jc for all of the csms failings im blaming him for his own personal failings in his work as the csm chairman
so what ccp didnt explicity say not to be a crazy irrelevant douche so man whatevs
jade being biased isnt exactly news in one of the very first threads after the results were announced jade declared that he wouldnt be having anything to do with issues raised by people in goonswarm someone find it before jade edits it to wall of denial or something
youre getting to be like jade posting walls of text sometimes you need to stay like this short and sweet
so you are saying if  organisations win seats in a local german government  which happened   other politicians are not allowed to have biases against neos any more the sense must be hiding somewhereim not comparing goons to s but jades opinions are his own whether they are appropriate or not is another question and one that ranting on forums is not going to answer if a majority of the council would have a problem with his opinions they would find a way to deal with it otherwise this is just the way things are and we will find out what the voters think about it on the next election the filtered word being a common abbreviation of nationalsozialisten
i see nothing wrong with this jade isnt a robothonestly someone else would just as ed if she said i love goons because she would be biased
noone is demanding that the chair be a emotionless robot but there is such a thing as professionalism and tactjade has let his own personal opinions precede his duties as chairman on more than one occasion  gagging a rep for disagreeing with him wording proposals he disagrees with in as negative a manner as possible when announcing issues during csm meetings and finally discriminating against players simply based on what alliance they chose to join  stating that he absolutely will not answer questions or issues raised by a member of goonswarm   and has generally acted in a supremely arrogant mannersince someone so brilliantly compared goons to the government of germany from 1933 to 1945  thanks word filter   thereby opening that ohsoawesome can of worms im going to go ahead and compare jade to a homophobe  he assumes that all goons  homosexuals   are somehow beneath him and not worthy of his attention by virtue of simply being goons jade also seems to be obsessed with some kind of goon agenda as evidenced by his assumption that those that criticize him are goon alts similar to many rabid homophobes in real life who believe in some kind of gay agenda
i didnt know one is being born a goon of course that changes everything my condolencesjoking aside youll have a point as soon as the first goon publicly takes on the opposite point of view until then i see nothing inappropriate about jade treating them as one entity
yawnwhere did you take the idea that jade has to be impartial just because he has the chair jade is first and foremost a csm member and a such entitled to to have a public political opinion as he won the chairmanship by popular vote he just acquired an additional administrative role that doesnt void his right to express his opinion on thingsgoonswarm needs to realize that there are people out there that dont like them hardly news
it is not ok that the csm be used as a platform to exert a partisan ingame agendait is not ok that the chair use that position to exert power over other representatives
you would have more success trying to talk to a dog about postmodernism than to a european about sensible limitations on authority
cough coughdont you have one of the most powerful executives in the western world over there in the colonies just sayin
lol what planet are you living on
planet freedomalso illaria the fact that you would bring that up illustrates your ignorance so perfectly i dont even have to add anything   
the incident during the csm meeting taken on its own is forgivable due to teething problems with the set up  and a lack of a forum where these issues can be discussed by the csm during the week with each other   entertainingly the most discussed issue so far seems to be jades conduct during that meeting and his conduct after his conduct after is not excusable it was a tantrum blaming everybody but himself for his words and his actions are you honestly happy with a chair who will throw a strop when he doesnt get his way is that why you joined the csm
another epic meeting 1 nighthawk needs a powergrid increase  jade  
what the hell why did you vote down capital shipsthat is like the only really important thing on the entire agenda
okay so i finished reading the chatlogs that is incrediblejade and co are so caught up in the bureaucracy of everything that they arent willing to vote yes on talking to ccp about capitalsahahahahahaha thats incredible
i love that those who ran on supporting transparency are now voting to keep csmwide communications away from the public it really is pathetic and feeds into all the negative things being written about the csm absolutely amazing
3capital ships online bane
i do agree that its an important topicbut the issue wasnt presented clear enough and the documentation wasnt available at the time which was expected for all issues presented yesterdayso in order to get issues submitted the right way i voted no but please do notice that it was stated that it didnt mean that it would be a nice if it was raised for next csm  ccp agenda
while the capital ship issue is a good issue and i actually agree a lot with bane on it it was not very well presented and it was very unclear what was being voted forfrom the chatlog it read like too much capital ships are bad mkay its a bit too fuzzy to vote on thisit should have been separated in discrete motions that can be voted individually on likea   reduce skill requirements for capital ships esp carriers and dreadnoughts b   review the doomsday effect esp regarding the stacking issue of multiple dd on the same gridc   d   etcjust voting on we should talk about the whole undefined complex with ccp i will work some presentation out would be a bit naive i really dont know why bane hadnt something more concrete and precise prepared on this important issue we all know that hes very well capable of doing thisanother thing that applies to a lot of the csm memberswhen you ran for csm you made a commitment you should all have been aware that it will cost you time and effort that people cant be bothered to be on time and come prepared to such a meeting or even review their documents for who voted on what i find a bit disappointingif you dont want to put in the effort because youre time constrained then you shouldnt really have run it certainly isnt a problem if you miss a meeting now and then but randomly dropping in and out dont have your stuff ready when its voting time or unwillingness to document your issues properly makes some of you look rather amateurish
we were voting on whether or not to discuss an issue in iceland that issue being capital ships i think we got a bit tied up in the details of what banes ideas were regarding the subject which was an acid test i dont recall putting any other issues to each of us will have opinions on each of the issues presented in iceland we havent had to examine all of them in order to decide they were worth discussing v0v personally i think the council got a bit too tied up in the details and lost site of the actual motive some of us dont even have a use for capitals to be honest so how you could be opposed to discussing something you dont understand is something i dont get ive voted to discuss issues i didnt understand for the most part because i dont feel its my place to deprive people of the conversation when i clearly dont have the knowledge required to say whether the subjects broken or not
ultimately i think that by not allowing any leeway on how well the is were dotted and ts were crossed with the presentation of the cap ships issues they simply diminish their own usefulness and importancereading the loginanna and lavista voted against because banes writeup wasnt all in orderserenity voted against because he got caught up in the details of a specific subpoint bain made involving capital skill training time  serenity likes the timesink  ankh voted against because she just never has or will encountered a capship while tooling around highsec in her miner or mission runner or whatever and so doesnt see any issue worth discussingjade wrote that his problem was with the documentation but he waited to the last  to see if he would be the differencemaking vote   and probably just took an opportunity to vote against an issue raised by a goon whatever was voted on here however you guys can get them to talk about capships once you get to iceland do it its not like theyre going to hit your face if you trye i can just picture the devs focused on capships reading this like wtf how did they miss this opportunity to talk to us what did we even make this council for now we have to go back to sounding out our ideas with dev blogs
of all of the items on that list the two i didnt expect to fail were the nighthawk grid issue and capital ships online seriouslyanyone who has ever tried to fit an active tank setup on the nighthawk while using hams knows that the nighthawk has serious issues trying to cram a mwd injector and large booster on there in addition to 6 ham iis requires two rcu iis even at maxed fitting skills ffs im guessing the folks who voted against have either never flown the nighthawk or just dont use hams and thus dont careas for capitals online i own  and am skilled for   both a carrier and a dreadnought and even i think something should be done about the damned things theyre crowding out normal pvp in all too many cases
well the agenda for yesterday clearly stated that submission templates had to be in place before the meeting i would have voted for the item if bane had sticked to the submission template he did submit but he started talking about capital shield transfers and all kinds of stuff it wasnt just about capital ships online being bad there is a big difference between capital shield transfers taking too much pg and then the topic at handi would have supported it if bane split the issue up in pieces and had submitted templates for everything he started discussing but that wasnt the casei hope he will submit it for our ccp agenda in 2 months its an important issue but i think he tried to do waaay too much
no you would see that several people stated that they agreed with the issue in general but bringing it up in iceland wasnt in order they were all for bringing it up at the next agenda thoughalso that in general csm as i see it doesnt like bringing up issues about specific ships its waaay too easy to blame us for being based if we did
capital shield transfersrars are an intimate part of capital balance or lack thereofpsyduck
i dont have access to the document bane submitted but that wasnt the topic of the document from what i recallthe document never talked about csts and rars of any kind when he started talking about those things it was bound to fail because of the difference between the submission template and what he was on aboutpsyduck
see point 11 disincentivizing carrier spam  gangs of 20 carriers   2 revisit titan doomsdays 3 incentivize the use of smaller quantities of carriers  16  
for the same reason we cant pay the beta that ccp is currently running of ambulationif its not done it should not be publicshould book companies let the rough copies of major books be public you need to be able to tie up a bundle of sticks before you throw them out or someone will take that lose unbundled pile of sticks and take what they what out of contexteditnote my point is we should not under any circumstances be allowed to beta ambulation even if they have it running right now it would lead to mass whinage blah and balh not getting in and such i dont think everythign should be public just important thing also how pointless would it be to read all the emails throwing the list back and forth editing it and making sure its all sound and the link work and such why would you want to read that if we get the final document we voted these guys in if something evil happens i hope that the person i support will tell th communityedit in other words csm emails should not become public unless someone raises a issue in which email would need to be read in this case nothing should be hidden however we the public should not get to read them even then only ccp should or another group of officials and then what they find should be published for the public once again same process
damn even though im sure the documentation on it was very very weak anyways its still something id like to see changed i should of did more support on the issue since day one then again the 1st person that ever brought this up was a dev during the alliance tournament interviews saying he hated learning skills in his game so maybe we wont have to worry about it palso your not going up to iceland for another 2 months
the csm is not a company they have no financial interest in keeping its discussions public as authors and content creators do they are a public institution accountable to the publicyour analogy is thus false
when your analogy lets you down find a new analogyhmmm this time ill state it using one wordgoumindongthis is why they shouldnt be public as it would not be profitable to ccp to let goumindonghappen   you know what never minds lets let goumindong happen ive had a change of 3 1st step we implant chips in the csms brains to make sure we have there every word on record i mean hell if they cant talk over email they will jsut talk over the phone or in person right rightor maybe cant help myself they will use msn pps your too easy to figure out and i support some of your issues you nut  
when your analogy fails instead start strawmanning
csm is a council that is supposed to represent us to ccp i want to know how they are deciding to represent us fully before they go and do iti am agreeing with goumindong i am agreeing with goumindong oh god
how come you have allowed many other worse presented ideas with badly thought out solutions go through with the intent of just loosely talking about the issue the issue itself should be pretty clear to anyone that spends time in 00
to bad i dont trust people that have an agenda  note im talking about a lot of people that want to target jade   to take these emails that will nothing to do with csm and they will use them i mean hell if i had something against him thats what i do
so if there is a reason to not trust him the information should stay private
if jades emails will hurt him so badly he better think a bit more before sending them this just confirms the impression i get of jade on the forums
i got the impression that the capital ships online topic just needed a oneline summary that encompassed the totality of what would be presented to ccp in writing it sounded like it was the unknowns in banes planned presentation that were throwing people off and next time around if its all written up ahead of time and summarized in a way where the reps are clear what theyd be supporting it will be easily escalated
i will point to my original pointi got the submission template right in front of me this document describes nothing about the things bane were talking about yesterday i would have happy to vote it on if those details were in the document thoughi dont know what the rules are about posting these documents but if its ok with the council i would happily prove it to you by showing you the submission template that was submitted which is the reason i voted no
well what was his paragraph on it say and what did the links sayaside this wouldnt be a problem be if discussion list was public oh  now were taking things out of context because there isnt the context to back  up its almost as if that is more likely to happen when the list is private
or maybe it wouldnt have happened if all submission templates were public
the template is public jade released it in the meeting for agenda subject the submission isnti still fail to see how more context can ever be bad
lavista there are basically two valid cases here you could have fallen under1   you dont know anything about capital ships in that case i would at least expect you to know that bane himself is pretty much the living document of capital ship issues and potential solutions and that you really ought to just trust that hes going to send something worth discussing to ccp2   youre familiar with capital ships and have an intuitive grasp of the issues with them and how interrelated those issues all are and so you would cut bane some slack because you have an intuitive grasp of the issues he was pointing at in the 5 minutes or whatever you gave him to write his explanation out in the meetingbut you chose3   stand in the way of progress in the interest of covering your ass because oh no what rogue ideas will bane send to ccp that you would actually have objected to if only you had known what crazy things he was going to write surely that mad goon wont send anything within the realm of the hundreds of eveo posts hes made on the topic and what if ccp doesnt approve of how well the submission is organized they might frown at you and scold you in icelandbasically youre like the faa telling santa clause he cant deliver presents to the little kids because he didnt get the paperwork in for his pilots license
why do you hate the little children lavista  
if we cant trust the csms to pay attention to issues other than their own i guess well never see any progress hell hardly any of them post anyway which doesnt do the public any good darius and jade are the most prolific posters but all they seem to do is argue youd think that with all the energy they spend arguing theyd both be against the release of emailsbut darius wasnt jade even said before the meeting that if it did pass hed stop using the mailing list and use something else where he could keep his communications secret what does jade have to hide hed even said he was in favor of a more open transparent process but i guess he was just assuming there would a goon conspiracy
no one right in his mind will vote on a carte blanche just to cut you some slackyes while bane is indeed one of the more respected goonswarm members and the capital issue appears less politically loaded now that the bob vs coalition war is over it doesnt relieve him of the duty to clarify and define what he puts up for voteits a bit amusing that goons like to paint themselves as champions of transparency in one case but demand that the other csm members will blindly vote on their issues relying only on good faith
 20080615 212419  ankhesentapemkah  sorry i must also say no because i dont have insight in the documentation and because i do not think this issue is currently unbalancing 20080615 215429  ankhesentapemkah  people do not even understand my issue 20080615 215445  ankhesentapemkah  no listen to what i have to sayhow ironic
it did however relieve quite a few other members of that responsibilitybut really when the issue is dealt with isnt a huge deal though it would have been nice to have it done sooner rather than lateri think the csm is going to find that they have set themselves up with a lot of things to talk about and not enough time to get it done they are going to go to ccp and not be properly versed in any of the subjects they have said they want to talk about
i assume then that the 30  90 day gtc issue will not be raised to ccp at iceland im surprised it wasnt one of the discussed topics
allready happen
no it should go to ccp so they can chem him apart and then be made public as ccp sees fit
thanks
the problem with the capitals online issue was that a   we didnt get to see the presentation notes and the documentation we did see was very brief and generalized and b    and this is an important one    there were some very specific and contentious ideas expressed there that needed to be split up into different topics in order that we could vote on each element properly an idea like reducing the skill reqs for capital use is a huge thing and its an entirely different issue to rebalancing the cpu reqs on capital shield xfer modules basically the issue was too big and allencompassing while at the same time presenting some specific proposals that a majority of the csm did not support ill happily go on record and say right now that i do not find a good argument in the proposition that the capitals online problem can in any way be solved by reducing the skill reqs for capital pilots and allowing more alliances to spam capitals in fleet combat it just didnt make any sense to me and i couldnt in all conscience vote for an issue that included this as a proposal as ive already stated elsewhere in relation to my campaign docs and the issues i have supported i believe the solution to capitals online is to increase the incidence of capital combat and loss through introducing greater necessity to expose these ships to formal combat risk and let natural attrition handle the problemthis could be done in various ways changing the sov system to be less defensively orientated aggression timers for station warfare hell maybe introducing a timer to reenter pos shields after you fire or activate a repper ive already spoken on the titan issue and id like them to be forced to remain on the field longer after they dd but basically i think the solution to capital spam is make the game harder for capitals and increase the risk they suffer on involvement in pvp contention see more of them explode well see less ridiculous overspam so thats my position on the issue and i completely oppose the principle that you deal with a problem class or technique by lowering the barriers to entry for that class or technique thats just counterintuitive and in this specific case transcends gamebalance into the realm of seeking partisan advantage for a hypothetical alliance for superior numbers of relatively lowskilled pilots and an aspiration to sit at the big boys capital table without doing the same training their rivals have already done to attain competency and military advantage in this field
the  and  end   things needs to be used properly towards the end the meeting it went to crap with people being skipped people interrupting and people repeating what they had already said over and over because some stated an opposing view if you cant explain yourself properly or have a misleading title for an issue well thats your own dam fault take some time on it and bring it up in a later meetingalso we only need support and deny as options for when taking votes not aye nay support not support yes no yeah no support support escalation ing nay deny
we can say what we will about the documentation provided to date voting to bring an issue to iceland has had very little to do with the individuals opinion it was a recognition that the root issue warranted a discussion with ccp this was something youll find i even stated during the meeting but which was glossed over in the interest of nitpicking about banes individual discussion pointsas i said for a discussion issue each of us is perfectly capable of providing their own viewpoint just because bane already has some ideas that doesnt mean that these ideas are the only things that will be considered by ccp in iceland were voting to have a dialog not to approve the individual proposed solutions the results of the vote yesterday indicate that 5 out of 9 of our csm reps do not want to have a dialog about capital ships with ccp interestingly enough most of the dissenters live in empire if not all where capital ships serve no purposevoting to discuss an idea never had anything to do with agreeing with the details of an individuals specific proposal i dont agree with some of the specifics in jades proposal regarding destructible outposts for instance i still voted to have the conversation in iceland because i feel its a worthy conversation to have and who am i to say that simply because an idea only had 40 votes of approval we shouldnt talk about itultimately i dont believe the negative vote was an act of maliciousness but attribute it to either a shortsighted myopia or a flatout lack of concern because the issue doesnt impact the people involved either way isnt positive hopefully next time around people can look at the issue objectively or at least admit that they dont understand it and allow those who do to have their conversation
your thinly veiled jabs at bob just earned you a few points in my book
i hate to be the one to break this to you but were the big boys getting cap ship pilots is not a problem for us
as someone who voted for serenity i have to admit that the above statment is pretty damn disappointing the rather brief and casual glance that the nighthawk issuethread was apparently given and the total lack of understanding of the problem  and some of the amazing responses   have me genuinely concerned over some of the csm choices
as i said during the voting i dont think its our place to get caught up in the minutiae of buffing or not buffing individual shiptypes id honestly prefer we concern ourselves with at least the barest oversight was was initially intended and highlevel issues if the nighthawk issue gains more support then id be happy to bring it as is required
thanks for the response dariusin some ways i agree with your take that the csm should try to refrain from getting too engaged with micromanaging nuances versus tackling larger issues however as caldari ships go  i have four characters one for each race   this is a fairly glaring issueits the only missilebased caldari command ship and the problem is not a small one  which a moderately focused read of the thread s   will show   the problem has existed as long as the ship  read years   i dont expect a huge quantity of support as not many people bother flying it however if you look at the linked thread from the ideas and features forum it is up to 17 pages if i recall and months oldthe numbers and math are there it would take the devs all of 10 minutes of coding to fix the issue when you compare the ship to the sleipnir  also a shield tanking field command   the nighthawk is truly a joketrust me i do realize and very much respect your take on wanting to avoid small balance changes to ships however this is an old issue one for which there is plenty of firm evidence and math to back it up  not opinions or preferences   and one which it would take only a trivial bit of coding to fixso while it might seem to be a small ship balance issue its an old problem and trivial to prove and to fix investment in time versus reward on the problem is enormous
now that its too lateit seems to me that a csm member with no idea or opinion on a subject when the vote comes up would be to abstain from that vote thus a issue could be approved  or fail   with a 32  4 abstain   voteon the public nature of the csm with luck there will be another csm after this one and another after that making the vast majority of what the csm does public would help the later csms skip over the problems this one faces having learned from it granted some of the communications need to held private as they may cross the nda linelastly darius i think you are mistaken on the submitted information while there will be discussions with ccp in iceland they  ccp   is required to respond to the documented issues submitted if the document is lacking focus then the response will be of little value
the problem is is that many issues have been passed onto ccp in the guise of having a discussioned ie the vote changed from do we want to talk about this with ccp to is this template of issues related to the brought issue something i personally want to see implementedsurely no one would have said jade i am sorry i cannot vote to talk to ccp about destroying stations because your template document is not perfectly inline with what we are discussing in this chat and i dont support it and hey we have that vote on record
the problem is on the scope of things fairly small and noncritical its one ship in a line of missile using ships for a purpose that directly mimics what drakes do and the drake is fantastic   now it may be clearly lacking in powergrid or hams using too much   but how easy an issue is to see doesnt necessarily mean that it should be escalated i dont personally think it something that requires the council discussing it with ccp yet and it looks like the majority of the council agreed however you can always ask jade to see if he can make the argument on the side regarding the issue it just means you wont get an official response and jade probably cant tell you anything about how it went nda   but it might get something done
im pretty sure ccp has banned abstentions a stupid decision imo for exactly this reason but its hardly one i can overturn
i agree to a degree and will chat with jade about going forward to ccp with the problem  thanks for the advice regarding that btw   however how many years should a ship be totally out of whack and broken till ccp finds 10 minutes to fix the code on it seriously the lack of grid on the nighthawk takes gradeschool math and a tiny portion of logic to understand  this is totally excluding its useless missile precision bonus  yes there are other ships that need tweaks also however the nighthawk has been this broken since the day it was introduced which is years ago i do believe the longerstanding a problem is the more priority it should be given
ccp didnt ban anything they made some suggestions which we could choose to or not to follow
get more than 40 people to support it in assembly hall as it stands it has less support than destructible outposts which is downright sad
while i understand support for an issue does play a role im not sure how much weight that should be givenif an issue can clearly be shown to exist with any aspect of the game  with actual evidence and proof of such an issue   why should the popularity of the issue hold priority over common sense
everyone who has an issue be it a pet issue or not is themselves convinced that the evidence is clear i personally dont fly nighthawks and know nothing about them the bottom line is that if an issue is clearly a problem you should be able to get more than 40 people to support it unfortunately its as good a measurement as any that im personally going to get to go by because as i said i dont fly them though some goons have complained about itwho knows if the issues that clear then maybe the devs will see it on their own and we wont even have had to bring it to their attention
please even the most obvious of issues like corporate email logging which would reasonably have every single ceo in the game telling their corps to vote for it to force it being pushed to the csm have only received 500 votesyou voted to discuss destroying stations despite it having less than 40 votes at the time and having large opposition and effecting probably fewer people than the nighthawk problems did dont pull that populist bs either there was a good reason to not bring it to ccp or their wasnti dont know what is going on is not a good reason though understandable since there is no easy mechanic by which the csm can be educated and informed on the topic with proper dissent of course   but the excuse of ignorance does not make the reason any better
oh your so big
what on earth are you on about nothing i said in that statement is incorrect and ive already stated why i voted to support destructible outposts the fact of the matter is i didnt bring the issue the issues i did bring i am willing to justify the votes ive made i am willing to justify if you dont like my explanation then thats fine insinuating that its wrong because you dont like the result is what i would call ignorantif youre going to call me on bs show the bs my statement was that i did not want to get into shiptypes my statement was that if something was clearly a problem more people would support it how is either of those incorrect in your eyes because some issues havent gotten support because in your opinion its a major issue even though very few seem to care enough to do anything about it what other unit of measurement would you have me use when looking at issues im unfamiliar with
i know you wont give a but youre my favorite csm repcan i call you dj scribbles
ive read the logs thus far darius speaks up when he doesnt understand something or disagrees with something and you people are giving out to him for this dont get me wrong im an antisocial misanthrope at the best of times but wow a year from now youll have convinced yourselves that everything wrong with eve is darius fault and goons by extension when you start with a wrong premise its hard to get a right answer have you tried ignoring the speaker and just focusing on the content of the text
donenot the best articulation of the problem by far but it was the best i could do in my current sleepy state
i dont think this is as easy as clicking a check box and watching the resultsi think the main problem with higher bonus implants is a combination of issues as people have mentioned a gap between old and new players will widen as the costs involved with actually obtaining these implants will make it more difficult for new players to acquire them second the skill point investment to actually use them would make them harder to accessto actually implement them i think lp reductions would need to be considered for all existing implants  alternatively a 1 bpo with a 3 invention might work but i dunno   i also think theyd also need to carefully consider of the number of skills available before they proceeded with this finally strategic cost reductions for everything from 1s to 5s would need to happen to bring everything into balance before introducing the 6s this might even include skill level requirement reductions
if you must be nitpicky benefit the majority of eve players can probably be described better as provides appreciable benefit and does not benefit the minority at the expense of the majority
i have seen one linky to a chat log  apparently in rtf format is there any plan  way to post the csm meeting chat log in the eve insider csm sectioni would like to be able to read these in the raw form but  apparently   i dont know how to read rtf thanks for the helpak
no idea on the issue of ccp hosting the logs  but if you would like to read the raw text in a forum format youre welcome to read them on sf public
tye  spellingak
rtf should be readable on just about any platform you could be using wordpad reads it on any windows box i think textedit does on the mac and theres a native client for linux as well
mission complete  raised the issue this evening and it got voted through the csm
strictly speaking all the issues passed by the csm yesterday were past the submission deadline set by ccp yes
yes the official submission deadline was last thursday but we are relying on ccp to show goodwill and accept the latest batch for discussion at the meeting
while i love the design there is several points that would concern me regarding implementation1   transition between the current pos system and the moduler format proposedthe last thing we would want is ccp to say ok those old pos mods are now scrapped and useless to those peoplealliances who have spend billions on the pos infrastructuretough2   pos protection of friendly fleets while still allowing nonprotection of aggressive pos moduals  possibly already discussed  3   pos assembly interface
i think that if implemented intelligently this could be mitigated somewhat most of the idea presented revolves around changing the visual representation of the pos and its componentsafter an update which changed this feature of the station i believe that existing pos modules and components would simply remain in space where they are fully functional within the standards of current pos mechanicspos managers could then reassign locations for those modules using the new placement interface which snaps the pieces together which doesnt put the pos very much at risk doesnt cause the players to lose assets and doesnt force the managers to rush around reassigning pos positions
very much supported

sweet
good to hear now lets see when it actually takes place fully support the implementation of the idea
o thumbs up
hmm where have i heard this before cant remember
agreed
kinda seems like something you said that was you wasnt it
i agree with this posteven though im amarr
seems it needs repeating since its obviously not getting through
what this issue actually needs is some csm support unfortunately both goon reps dont want to focus on specific issues  rather the larger more important ones   and a goon suggest it so everyone else is out or somethingthat or none of the other csm reps have ever flown a minmatar cap ship  or any cap ship for that matter  
no im saying that if this is a problem then its a problem of something bigger and that pos warfare in general needs to be revised im sure this would be a positive change to many pos managers but it also has negative effects on pos warfare in general
i feel this is a unneeded request and personally do not support itif you want to move ships in mass use a carrier or suck it up and repackage them  lossing the rigs  
most of the credit for this idea comes from herelinkageevery t1 frigate for each race in eve has a t2 counterpart  interceptors assault frigates covert ops and electronic attack frigates however the miningcargo frigates have been completely left behind relegated to use by trial accounts and misplaced purchases but what role could they performwith the advent of factional warfare and sizerestricted deadspace zones i think that its time these poor ships received a t2 hull a role and some general love what role you ask logistics frigatesgeneral design principlesreduced signature radius  improved survivability and in line with logistics ships  reduced mass  t1 cargo frigates are way too heavy for any kind of combat  t2 resistances  obviously  marauderlike bonus for remote repair systems  compensates for low slot numbers and improves sustainability  significantly improved sensor rangeresolutionlogic behind thema frigates biggest weakness is its vulnerability obviously t2 resistances will help a little but like interceptors reduced signature radius will also go a long way towards saving them in an engagement i choose to give them a marauderstyle bonus to their repairers because this frees some slots for tanking  further improving survivability   and goes a long way towards cap sustainability as theyll probably be running mwds for the duration of combat the reduced mass allows them to actually benefit from using mwds though they should still have mass greater than average for their race if the combination of capacitor reduction and a marauderstyle role bonus is too much you could change it to a 100 bonus to remote repair cycle timenow for some juicy examplest2 navitasslot layout3 low 3 medium 2 high  2 turret  t1 bonuses150 bonus to remote armor repair system and tracking link range5 reduction to signature radiust2 bonuses10 reduction to remote armor repair capacitor use5 bonus to tracking link effectivenessrole bonus100 bonus to remote armor repair system transfer amountt2 bantamslot layout2 low 4 medium 2 high  2 turret  t1 bonuses150 bonus to remote shield transfer and remote energy transfer range5 reduction to signature radiust2 bonuses10 reduction to remote shield transfer use10 reduction to remote energy transfer userole bonus100 bonus to remote shield transfer amounta good idea or another horrible brain abortion from tarminic
good one tarminic i am totally supporting this because i am in now way tarminics alt
t2ing the cargo frigates might make sense but logistics frigates generally dont if anything id like to see it go the other way and have us get logistics battleships the logistics cruisers dont have much survivability asis theres no need to make them even more fragile how about something like making them logistics ships that actually do logistics instead of being space medics strip out their combat capabilities and have them be ships designed to carry ammo and cap boosters to the front give them a big cargo the sig radius of an anorexic hummingbird high agility and warp speeds and the ability to transfer cargo without needing jetcans or at a minimum the ability to jetcan every 10 seconds instead of every 3 minutes   its something that wouldnt have a lot of use in line with the fact that these frigates are crap but itd at least be new and interesting with some possibility of utility
wow tarminicwhen you get your hands on an idea you run with itnicely donei appreciate your support for my idea its really nice to see one of my general concepts fleshed out a bit more by someone so knowledgeable about eve in general and fitting in specific i do hope the csms can bring this to ccp as a possibility it would really help out in fw warfare and fleet battles in generalminilogistics ftw
for the sake of discursive fairness it should be mentioned there are other good ideas for these frigates doing the rounds including in the nether regions of the thread tarminic linked to my two other top favourites  the one in tarminics post rounding off my dream 3   are the salvager frigate and the gas harvesting frigate both of which borne of the notion that these two miniprofessions have no specialist ships at all
well this thread is about logistics frigates if you want discursive fairness start your own thread and allow us to discuss your ideas on their own without hijacking someone elses threadnothing personal i just think those ideas deserve their own threads here to be voted yay or nay on
no no point spreading several ideas in a discussion about the leftover t1 frigs into several threads when this thread isnt likely to be overly active anyway discussion is discussion mon ami and i plan on discussing every aspect of the idea in the op including its alternatives

what i would love to see is to have arties only hold 1 shot but quickly reload automatically from the cargo hold and continue firingthen balance could be reworked on varying reload cycles
minmatar battleships andor large artillery needs to be rebalanced and brought back in line with the other races battleships due to the changes brought on by the introduction of scripts
signedlarge artillery  and artillery in general   needs significant help large clip sizes or universal ammo sizes and more alpha for starters
i agree
artillery having the lowest dps of all long range turrets sits fine with me tbh since it fits minmatar philosophy to forego damage for mobility and hit  run tactics  ie high alpha to quickly pop target and get away  after the hp boost the said concept doesnt apply anymore so id very much appreciate and recommend a boost to damage modifiers and a nerf to rof in order to keep dps where they are and increase alpha strike and small clips wont bother us then since they will take longer to go click  range and tracking are fine imo as admittedly projectiles are not the most advanced weapons in new edento rectify this and offer fleet snipers some love maybe change the tempest to 5 dmglvl 5 optimallvl in order to fill the sniper niche and rectify the optimal nerf scripts causedmy 2 iskedit corrections after sipping some coffee p
agree
boost alpha considerablynerf rate of fire a bitthis translates to2575 more alpha25 more dpsnerfed rof3rd tier would be nice too but thats just me dreaming
i agreereducing accidental convos reduces lag too
i would support this if the reload all timer is a bit longer then the individual reload time because then it just takes away the feel of combat if the reload all timer is a bit longer people still use it because they are feeling lazy
pure win
supporting i like this game a lot and there has been improvements to the stability of the client but theres still tons of problems lack of communication  it seems   and whatnot
i support this in principle but ive got to say that if youre using linux you should know better wine runs eve much much better than cedega  the wrapper for the true linux client   and after only a few weeks when the windows premium client was released it was stable on linux if you use linux you should know this mac users on the other hand tend to be more like windows users and dont care plus they dont really have wine  i think there is a version but its buggy as hell  id like to point out though that cedega is inoti the best choice nor has it ever been some users used to have cedega installed already  a full version of it  and when you install the linux eve client it nukes everything on your base install because cedega werent even clever enough to use different directories  its all in cedega iirc   if ccp were to support wine instead of cedega they would have one less client to worry about and one less partner to worry about  at least for linux   this would mean a faster development cyclealso there is an ideological viewpoint cedega is well known for ripping off the latest versions of wine altering a few things and then selling it on without contributing back to wine  without which it wouldnt be around i dont like that or support it if ccp went down the wine route they could at least help wine make wine better thus making eve better
supporti use the mac client exclusivl and i have to say that it crashes just as much as it did before and it is in ccps best interest to keep mac and linux users playing the game by insuring its quality is maintained
supported its rather insane that between cargo choices i have to choose between 47k or 600ksomething in the 300k range with skills would be rather nice
supporting this i have a friend who watched one of these scandals go down in real time and he was quite upset at the whole thingthen kugu exposed it and some heads rolledps lmao  narciss owning jade

i find it rather interesting i thought ccp normally banned the people who exploit the game not those that find the exploits and report them to ccp to fix at least thats the way i see it i mean come on a ccp person cheated he got caught by a player and then ban the person who caught him thats just pure bs the ccp employee should have been fired on the spot for what he did and then be perma banned from the game not the other way around
actually you have too since in essence we are talking about game design there are industrialists and of that over arching profession there are miners traders builders etc just like there are mercs who in that over arching profession are soldiers alliance members etcand then pirates who arewell you get the idea akita is just pointing out that the inherent game design is flawed because it limits the growth and scale that the many other facets of the game already havefixing this scale for the industrialist is a known issue one of the problems that must be tackled is the risk reward problem for miners the risk reward is broken because of game design those in favor of the idea are not arguing that the market is broken nay indeed the market is working perfectly working far to perfectly given the parameters it has to work with namely the faucets incoming and the sinks outgoingwhat is being proposed is just a simple tweak of the faucets to allow the economy of scale to change so that the risk in mining 00 is worth the actual reward when aggregated out over timeone would think everyone would be for this idea since it would draw more people into uncontested space creating more conflict more wars more well more everything for everyonebut sometimes you just cant lead the blind to water apparently
i cant imagine theres a problem with the riskreward ratio of 00 mining  its worth 5x what highsec mining is and a lot of it takes place inside space secured by your alliance even with the logistical problems associated with it which have gone down dramatically postrorqual of course   its still a valuable endeavour and even if the risk is relatively severe you can lose one hulk per five hours of mining and still come out ahead of a perfectly safe veld miner assuming i remember my mining iskhour calculations properly besides i cant imagine how a tweak to the faucets would change this if 00 ore is the primary source of highends buffing said ore will just drop the prices of highends until the iskhour made by the miners returns to its current equilibrium  which given the nature of the insurance floor would actually drive up trit prices even further youd need to fix the sinks and thats a whole hell of a lot messier than just tweaking refine rates on ores
kazzacyou cannot comprehend what you read very well so ill say it again ore reward is player set mission reward is ccp setrisk is always relative sadly that is one of the elephants in the room that everyone misses 00 is different in a frigate if your 3 months old but not so if your in a battleship and 3 years old risk is infulenced directly by the player it cannot be set in stone just like differentials cant due to open markets the game design is a sandbox we make reality we set prices we mitigate risk of what ccp code into the game we make or break the gameno one should be for the idea it is not thought out as i said before alliances could kill high sec if they werent polishing thier epeens with petty squabbles if they got together and really wanted to break the game all they have to do is embargo empire at every entranceexit thats designed into the game too because it is a sandboxindustrialists if they are not in control of the basic resources are at the mercy of the global market for thier imputs trit  moon high ends too   is what keeping production limited and therfore pricesprofits as high as they are undo that bottleneck then goods and the profit margins on goods will go down as supply will blossom that means only those industrialists with heavily researched bpos can just about make a living  unless they form cartels   entrance to the market is delayed for a year plus for new players you just create a new elite class sitting 237 in a jita station without any risk to themsadly if i was a blind man i wouldnt drink your water as its posioned ive still a sense of smell
and this is the critical mistake you keep on making and the mistake i keep on pointing out but you just dont get ityes mission rewards are directly set by ccp however ore reward is also set by ccp albeit indirectlythe fact the market works as well as it works the fact that people are greedy the fact that everybody tends to do whats more profitable most of the time and so on and so forth ends up creating the prices for each individual mineral according to quantities set by ccp and ccp alonetheres almost no individual influence in this the scale is too large for each individuals effort to matter and the market as a whole reacts directly to changes made by ccp and almost only those changes aloneindividual players have no relevance over here only the crowds have any influence at all
wow how convenient how about applying the very same argument to the minerals in eve and see how your own analogy dictates that tritanium should be a lot cheaper than it is and megagyte a lot more expensivei dont know anything about moon mining but the mineral costs problem is realccps intent was clearly and inarguably that tritanium should be a lowcost mineral costing perhaps between 100 and 150 isk per unit this would have the consequence of making veldspar a lowend ore one that has a low value per cubic meter so that miners are encouraged to leave 10 and seek out more valuable ores such as pyroxeres and plagioclase in 08 and 07but thats not how things are things are not how they should be instead veldspar is consistently the most attractive highsec ore to minethings are not as ccp intented them to be the mineral price balance is brokenthe mineral requirement ratios for spaceships  and probably other items too   need to be changed so that less tritanium is required and more of the other mineralsccp could do this in increments every 8 or 10 weeks they could issue a patch  or hotfix or whatever   that reduces trit requirements by 33  cumulatively   and increases the other mineral requirements by some reasonable proportion affecing all blueprints after 5 or 6 such cycles things would have much improved and the price of tritanium would be much closer to where it should bealso ccp should stop the spawning of intermediate ore quality type the one 5 better than normal ore  because it is pointless to have it in the game   and then they should redistribute ore such that only normal veldpsar is found in 10 to get 10 veldspar you need to go to 09likewise only ordinary scordite is found in 09 and to get 10 scordite you must go visit 08ordinary pyroxeres and plagioclase can be found in 08 as now but to get the good 10 stuff you must visit 07and so forthccp obviously and inarguably intended mineral prices to be at or close to certain values minor fluctuations from these values would not be a problem but what weve seen at least since i began playing  march 2007   can not reasonably be described as minor deviations from the intended prices
tbh the reason why most moon minerals are crap is due to sov mechanics we have all heard about the minerals are free crowd well basically its that kind of conceptccp made sov poss also be mining poss so you have thousands of sov poss that mine any old crap that laying about as its pure profit since pays towards the fuel costs for sov its not like the pos is doing anything anywayso you end up with a oversupply of most moon minerals due to this ccp really need to rethink sov mechanics
also t1 loot drops are just crap anyway  and theyre bulky crap  id much rather have a situation where 90 of the npc wrecks are empty but whenever i find a wreck that is nonempty i get all pleased and excited because ill know that the loot item in the wreck is both reasonably valuable and nottoobulky
qft especially when you figure low sec and shell corporations into the mix i remember doing some low sec moon scouting for a corp i was in and found a high value moon with a lightly defended pos owned by a 5 person corp easy pickings rightwrong within minutes of taking pot shots at the pos one of the bigger 00 alliances dropped into the force field of the pos w a nyx and some dreads ill touch on the significance of this belowso having the bottleneck be at in trit and hence veldspar  being the best source of trit   which is arguebly the safest ore to mine is a good thing part of the argument being put forth is that it is less valuable to mine low sec than in high sec due to veldspars value per m3 there would be numerous ways to fix this on the ore end like increasing the trit yield per m3 in low sec somehow but veld is so compact as it is this would be hard to rationalize hell for 00 you could just make spod smaller than 16m3 a unitand your comment profit margins will go down for who t1 production already requires pe v and well researched bpos to be profitable in many cases and t1 modules are worthless as drops flood the market and named drops beat the base modulesat least in the realm of moon mining most all the materials that form the bottleneck in the t2 production chain that akita mentions are slowly but surely coming under the control of a very small subset of the player base who are contributing to the mass inflation of a few materials lesser materials are becoming more and more saturated to the point where they arent worth the ice to mine them  edit lord waratron about sov holding poses i didnt think about that that explains a lot   hell i spent time running the math and for the most part any of the first two tiers of materials you mine at a lossin either case your argument of  entrance to the market is delayed for a year plus for new players falls flat those skills and that research takes time maybe not a year but definitely a few months and  you just create a new elite class sitting 237 in a jita station without any risk to them as opposed to the current elite class who hardly have to play as they make billions jumping a carrier full of moon materials to empire every few daysweeks at least thats some risk right
my 002 something should be done to make low sec more attractive to organized miners  industrialists especially newer players lowering trit requirements for manufacturing across the board tweaking trit yields in low sec ore or slightly increasing trit and lowering other yields from alloys could achieve some results on the t1 front if done very slowly it shouldnt cause a catastrophic crash in the marketmessing with rat drops is quite the double edged sword removing manufactured t1 drops wouldnt really help budding industrialists youd be removing isk from mission runners while jacking up the cost of thier fittings named drops would still be better and would probably jump in price as well unless you removed those as well then t2 fittings would probably sky rocket this is speculation but its just common sense the if you remove a large chunk of supply from the market costs are going to sky rocketand for moon mining make it so that the less valuable materials have more varied uses that should help drive up the prices from the being just all around losersgoumindongs idea from pg1 is an interesting idea but a little to simple it makes more moons targets for camping at sure but depending on the moon mineral to moon mineral reactions itd be very easy to for certain materials to remain near worthless or wind up with a tritanium problem where market forces cause easy and common materials to be worth more than the rare materialspang grohls idea is a little more refined but could easily suffer from the same problems as abovebimbos response on the other hand i think was a neat idea making it possible to invent t2 bpcs that made use of different materials at some other research material cost of course saying that this will somehow make less strain on the db than just adding different types of bpos so instead youre adding variations on bpcs to the database anyway an interesting ideai think akitas concerns have merit and wouldnt mind more developer scrutiny on this complex subject so a big please visit your user settings to reenable images
indirectly set and infulenced by players is very different to hard coding also the quantities are not directly set by ccp the ratio of minerals derived from ores and reprocessing is but the amount available is a player variable we decide not ccp what to do mine make etc the base price is a red herring cant you understand thatcrowd actions are made up of individual actions that are driven by perception and not reality america as a crowd perceived direct and inniment danger from wmds welcomed with flowers it will pay for its self they hate us for our freedoms there all bullocks plain for all to see if individuals actually looked at the facts you are just pointing at the sky to divert attention to the failings of your perception
not exactly it cost approximatly the same to mine the same volume of gold bearing rock than copper bearing rock but you get grams of gold for each ton of ore while you gent much more copper from each ton of copper bearing ore so when you look the end product gold cost more to produce than the same weight of copper
you obviously have no idea how the faucets and sink in the game work with regards to the minerals market and insurance so really any further discussion with you is pointless at this time
umm captial costs are the same pit and tunnels in same type of rock material handling the same crushing the rock for processing costs the same per unit they use the same infrastructure which costs the same its only the final processing stage that different its like to train skills for a hulk and processing ores etc cost the same no matter what you mine they are theour captial costs they are the requirement for extraction of ore into a useable commoditythe price of the end product over cost of extractionrefining per m3 ore determins how low a quality of ore you ecomonically minethe price of the infrastructure remains the same viability is set by end product price high price means low grade ore becomes more cost effectiveso gold costs more as less rich ores are mined it only has the high price that makes it possible because of rarity but which of the two commodities gives the best price return over captial invested in infrastructure copper just like veldspar
i do understand base price is arse hattery insurance is really a disconnected token  doesnt reflect real cost prices that are player set   because base price is arse hattery its a sand box the only large scale effective iskmineral sink there is is getting blown up ffs building things sinks isk in production cost but the minerals are there still in the market until they go popthe game mechanics just appear complex like your life but everything you do is either driven by food fornication or fear three very basic principles
thats where you are mistaken and the crux of the issue insurance is a faucet just like loot drops insurance dramatically affects how each mineral is priced in fact it one of two things insuring that pye and iso are staying as low as it does right now loot drops being the other
remember why insurance was finally introduced it was to buffer the pain on noobs it wasnt made to be a faucet of isk into the game but as a pacifier to stupid ppl who cant run their character successfully in a no holds bared sandboxwhat you say actually points to what i said insurance is broken its not related to the market or risk but to a base price that was irelevent 1 day after it was set insurance is broken it should be linked to  universal mean price of ship on matket  universal mean price of materials to make ship     modifier for grade of insurance     security level of system where destruction of ship occured  so  1000000  600000    3  or 2 or 4 depending on grade if insurance    05 so 533333  05  266666  or 400000 or 200000  see what happens base price is done away with it becomes totally dependent on the market and the inherient risk status of the system they were inok insurance as an isk faucet it is only printing money not resources but its a cost as well you have to pay for it and not everybody collects on thier payment so the effect is not overly great dr e said so iirc
and to be perfectly honest there are players who have a greater understanding of the market the game the faucets and the sink than dr e hasand any event i support the op its a known issue to ccp and has mild support for fixingim tired of getting trolled this week
the op says nothing about insurance only aboutlack of alternative specd bpos for existing productsthat human greed infulences the gamelack of stuff to use under utilised base goods on  see point 1  that riskreward is set in stone
oh ill argue that wont even take me long  the base price of tritanium is 2 isk per unit if ccp had any particular price in mind itd be that one mind you they generally havent been so stupid as to fix the market to work the way they think it should but even if they were that dumb your price would still be wrong
the point is to move people from high sec to low sec to 00 at some point to make more isk no matter what the price of the minerals are if veldspar in 4 space yields twice the trit of veldspar from 10 space then you make more iskhour in low sec there are already 3 types of every ore in game adjust the modifiers and seperate them across bands i would prefer up to 6 types to cover all the sec bands but 3 types could be workable it doesnt require tons and tons of blueprint manipulation or additional itemsinsurance should also be based on frequency of pay out if we are talking real life here i could do without insurance myself but if it stays then if you lose a ship every 3 hours you should pay more or get less for your insurance than i do if i lose a ship every 6 weeks at most
it would be much better if insurance didnt pay out cash at all but instead paid out a minerals voucher equal to the minerals that went into building the ship minus some percentage  20 for platinum insurance 40 for gold 60 for silver perhaps   but to actually get the minerals you have to fly to a station owned by the insurance corporationin practice people would not then claim their own minerals but would instead sell their vouchers to buy orders on the market and these voucher buyers would then transport vouchers en masse to stations to redeem them for minerals which they can sell or use for productionthats even further divorced from base prices than your proposal is which makes it better  and if i predict correctly so that many players enter the voucher purchasing trade then the transition will be almost seamless for all pilots  
i actually really like the mineral voucher proposal it then really is completely player priced without the horrors of shifting markets and regional price fixing by alliances
personally i think that as the starting point skills wise has changed so much the original reason that insurance was bought in to the game no longer exists it could be removed totaly from the game but all those insurance company stations are now in the game and removal is not an option as the story line has to be kept
an interesting proposal but i dont like it too deflationary make it marketbased to remove the floor and then leave it alone
i think the prices are somewhat off too
i dont knw what the solution is but something has to be done about the balance of riskreward in eve it just doesnt make sense the way it is right now

consider the insurance company in eve to be like a swiss bank they dont ask questions and keep the matter confidential
also need a counter module to the ship and cargo scanners this would allow haulers to prevent gankers from peeking they can still blow the ship up but wouldnt know exactly what was inside so there would be a risk involved for the gankers
signed no insurance
it exists and it actually lets you carry more cargo stupidity of victims is the only thing that makes suicide ganking viable as it stands
what criminals are these that occupy all of 00 could you give a list of criminals and what constitutes these guys being criminals anyway there are a few large alliances and individual corps that do not allow piracy or any form of it and as far as losec i am sure jade might argue with you about sf being a criminal organization i am not sure if there are or they are not really but i am sure he can comment about it i do believe if you read about who they are and how they present themselves criminal activity os not one of there main pursuits its more of a political rp thing and yes pirates  and antipirates   inhabit losec but very few of these guy venture into 00i understand you did read the entire thread that is more than some will do to really try to understand the issue however from you statements like the one above it does show your experience of is less than worldly there is nothing wrong with feeling the way you do but it sounds like what you are saying is they have their area to play i want my area off limits am i close the insurance bit is true but look at the other proposals about the insurance they are pushing to get rid of it all together not only for the removal from being concorded but actually remove it from the game
from the title i got the impression it would be a lame suggestion but its in fact the remove insurance payoff if you get killed by concordvery good idea and preety simpleapproved
i agree that there should be a thumbs down optionapart from that i discagree with the rest of what you say and here is why1   people that get the security hit can get back the lost security status with the ratingmission runing they do it anyway2   lets imagine a common situation a marauder pimped with factioncommander stuff is playing it right and warps to 0 etc of course when he jumps on the other side he gets ganged by several insured torp ravens with tech 1 equipmentthe ravens get back the cost of losses to the concord minus the cost of tech 1 trop launchers and other tech 1 stuff that is ridiculusly low while you kill an 1 bilion ship and get the modules probably costing all together several bilions while you lost after insurance maximun 10millions each without the insurance the cost would be alltogether near 1 billion again but you would gain around 2 billions from the faction stuff so net gain 1 billion profit isnt enoughas it is now gangers may gang anythingnot just the pimped navy bsmarauder with the factionofficer stuff but even a normal bs with tech 2 stuff could be a target even a freighter with scrap metal would be a target i was thinking to learn freighter skill and i dont because of this because when the gangers are losing 0 due to the insurance its very possible to kill your freighter loaded with scrap metal just for the excitement that is why i favor this idea so you still will have profit by ganging the very tempting targets but at least the rest of the players who may fly just a marauder with tech 2 or a bs with some occasional faction module will be safer what you are doing now is more or less an exploit of the game mechanics
pvpers  criminals so you can remove nullsec from the equation you could argue that pirates are criminals because concord dislikes them i personally disagree with this because most pirates i know are looking for pvp and any profits they make are a side benefitif you want the improved performance of faction or t2 ships you have to live with the drawback of not having much insurance to fall back on otherwise there would be no reason to use t1 ships unless you didnt have the skills for t2 pvpers deal with this issue on a daily basis and most of us dont  about itif you want to pimp out a ship thats fine nobody is arguing you shouldnt be able to do that what you have to understand is the more you pimp your ship the more you should be gankable the difference in opinions  among the sensable people   is over what level of pimpness you should have before you should start worryingif you havent figured out how to run level 4s safely by the time you decide to start pimping out a navy raven i have zero sympathy for you there are websites that tell you exactly how to run each and every mission in a manner that practically eliminates the risk by preventing unwanted aggro at this point in time mission running is more of a science than an artmining barges also tend to drop in the grand scheme of things very poor loot  with the possible exception of people who use entirely unnecessary deadspace boosters to tank   there are much better uses of sec status and yes sec status recovery is a serious penalty there is only one way for me to increase it shooting npcs i cant bribe concord cant shoot pirates cant do anything but carebear to recover sec so even though i may be making money while ratting im still being forced to do something i dont like this game is clearly set up to encourage team play not solo the fact that strategic aspects such as capitals outposts sovereignty and even factional warfare require multiple people to achieve should clue you into that eve tolerates the solo player it is not designed for it you cant do everything in eve solo sorry
these cant be level 4 missions because i havent come close to losing my cnr to a level 4 mission
remember you still have to look how each recon tanks as well1   the rook tanks by jamming2   the arazu tanks by dampening3   the rapier tanks by speed  range4   the pilgrim tanks by sucking enough cap to fuel his repperseven with just using a nos and cap boosters there i can only tank for 45 seconds abouts this is with recon 5 energy emissions yada yada yadaonly if tracking disruptors affected missile boats and drones i would agree to giving amount nos amount for range it really needs both to be effective or a tanking bonuswhy not just give the cyno bonus to black ops  they have the laugh tank to stand up to a hit or 2   and give all recons an inert tanking bonus instead1   rook shield bonus  why i have no idea because caldari are shield tankers  2   gallente rep amount bonus3   rapier speed bonus4   pilgrim hp or resist bonusdamage wise if you get rid of the damage the drones do on the pilgrim it will be the deathblow to the ship since not only are drones easily killed they wont do crap for damage therefore increasing the amount of time you are getting hit
agreed this can only bring great things to eve online
hell yes
someone told me to vote for this
sigh already on the bottom of page 2 perhaps i should have just said lawls fix teh missiles they suxors it seems to be the winning strategy for all issues that the csm has voted inbump
being a missile user myself though having not gotten to the point of looking at those numbers yet thats quite ridiculous yeah fix them id even say stealthfix the velocity problem because that part is just plain silly
would love to see developers comment on this issue signed
i think this vendeta has gone a bit too farit seemed to me that jade was unfamiliar with the controls of mutingunmuting perhaps the next meeting should be done using another way irc etcas for the issues he proposed maybe these are not the most popular matters but most of them are valid ideas there is so much space for small and big improvments to this game that no matter where you start its for the best or mostly for the best  perhaps jade is not puting the stuff you would like but eventually his time will be over and then some other will take over in the meantime i say it again i dont think the issues he puts for voting are so bad maybe not the most popular but they do aim to improve things as for his behavior i cant be certain if he overeacted the logs can tell you only so much discipline is needed to a discussion in any case i would say let him be judged in the end or at least after some more council assemblings hopefully he will get the hang of it and become better bottom line is lets give the guy a chance to get better
jade should be removed and banned mooting another mayor was a crime
most of her detractors were already moot
what vendettafor the rest of it you still havent read the thread weve been over all of that multiple times
fixed thats amusing i swear thats what jade has been saying all along
hey guys im not going to read the thread or try to understand the situation at all but you should take my criticisms seriously
i read the topic what matters the most to me is that so far in general the issues proposed by the counsil are useful in order to adress certain annoying game issues i dont care so much if in a circumstance or 2 has behaved in a not so correct manner to some pal of yours i only care for people to get the job done if he annoyed you declare war on his corp and go pod him for all i care
im saving that for the next devhax threadoh contentjade won the popular vote jade gets the chairif you hate that get more votes next timestop crying because youyour candindate has less popular support and get out there and put together a positive campaignseriously a thread full of people voting against democracy is all to odd for me to grasp
seriously did you read any of those meeting reports 3 is a real stunner ya knowif you think this is about in game politics youre missing the pointi do agree on the democracy part but jade didnt get voted to bloat his ego some more he got voted to be a csm chairman and failing to fulfill that role badly especially at the failing to acknowledge your own mistakes part if youre not willing to be reasonable its impossible to work together as a team
well that is the otherside of democracy innityou cant unvote people just because they dont turn out how you wantedto be fair he is the best chairman the csm has ever had
did this get answer cd

yes you can csm are still subjected to rules and regulationsand csm with 8 votees still can put up legitimate issues to ccpbesides the rule of who will be chairman isnt set in stone it could be rotated or be elected by the quorum itself
the role of chair would be better handled by some kind of nonvoting ccpemployee in my opinion since all the csm reps  myself included   have our own votes and interest and aspirations for the game then it sits poorly to have the chair combined with a voting position still ive tried to address this concern in meetings 45 by calling the other reps to do the introduction debate moderation call to vote on their own issues and ive only stepped in when asked to by the leading involved repid invite your to compare and contrast the stormy meeting 3with the far smoother and less arguementative meeting 4 and meeting 5and while speaking of constructive outcomes id remind you that over the 3 weeks of preiceland talks we have successfully tabled from community discussions the following issues for face to face conference with ccp 1 removal of 3090 day time cards2 jump bridges and cynojammers fix3 log server exploitationbacon4 skill queue functionality 5 5 rule is too strict 6 kill rights should be transferable 7 alliances in faction warfare 8 funky pos alterations 9 improve black ops 10 make suicide ganking more difficult11 general eve forums improvementfixing12 csm should vote for its own chairman 13 evaluation of empire war dec mechanics14 feasibility of outposts going boom15 replace doubleclick in a chat channel16 cargo hold size of ships in hanger but not in use17 reexamination of 00 sovereignty 18 reload all ammo 19 small freighters20 drone implants 21 rigged ships and cargo22 aggression timer is too shortvariable hull fix23 improve bombs 24 chat channel pilot listing25 ew icons26 hud minimum sizes27 personal assets hud28 skills page improvement29 assembly arrays 30 experimental industry issues31 science pos improvements32 sell order tweaks33 shares stock market34 contracts improvements35 completion of unfinished story arcs in eve36 roleplay interests in eve  dynamic consquence37 moon mining improvement  dynamic seeding38 pvp ownership of wrecks39 corporation standings slots 40 corporations automatical get alliance standings41 buff large autocannons42 colorblind ui43 account security 44 maclinux client45 multi monitor support46 evemail spam from corp eventseach of these issues stood for the mandated 7 days of public discussion each was brought up in a formal quorate csm meeting and received a passing vote each has been ruled an issue of importance and general community interest and has been documented in the form of a submission template and provided in advance to ccp to form the agenda for the conference in iceland now if anybody still holds that a few sparks and arguments in the debating chamber and some froth on the forums invalidates the good work done by csm representatives who have worked pretty damn hard to get this thing on the road to a ridiculously short timescale then theres not much i can say to that besides  run next time and show us you can do better because i happen to think this inaugural csm has done a damn fine job and anybody continuing to snipe from the sidelines in the face of very clear evidence of accomplishment is being petty disingenuous and mindlessly vindictive
supported ive heard of her antics
no supporti mean no offense to csm representatives but judging from the chat logs it is my opinion that without jade csm would stall on take off
yup would have been a mess without someone keeping it moving structured and goaloriented
i beg to differ in my country we have this funny thing called impeachment when the president that got voted in screws up we can kick him out

thumbs downand youre not using this thread as a bully pulpit to denigrate the council chair out of the 520 replies in this thread probably a hundred are from you personally you want jade to fail and are taking every opportunity to try and make that happen you sir are just as bad as jadejudging from the number of times something akin to but i wuz voted in i are moar important has appeared in this thread the csm seem to care more about some virtual brownie points than the job theyre supposed to do for us a pox on the lot of them worthless scrubs arguing about minutia and taking every opportunity to disrupt the process is not what you were elected to do
i fly enyos quite a bit i would even sacrafice the 5th high slot of a 3td medium slot dont really use missile launchers anyway on it
i like iti love afs but they could become a bit more punchy
if you reduce mass on all afs measurably youd just breed another variety of nanoships as much as afs can use some extra id hate to see that happen sorry no support for this tweak
wont be making another nano ship just bringing in line with other t2 varients support a change and this not too far off the mark though as a vengeance pilot rather another med than a high and keep the low 
speaking for myself id prefer nano assault frigates to nano assault cruisers ive got no objection to frigs being able to buzz around my head too fast for a battleship to swat
you are aware that assault frigs have on average 60 more mass than their t1 hulls while all hacs have equal or less mass than their t1 hulls right and you are aware that since afs base speed would be much lower than an interceptor  with the exception of the proposed jaguar which imo should not get the 5 speed bonus   and their mass would still be slightly higher their overall achievable speeds would be much less than interceptors and more around the realms of normal t1 frigatesis it so wrong that frigates should be quick and agilei recomend that you reevaluate your thought process and once you realize that assault frigates should actualy handle like frigates and that no cruiser should have an align time faster than an assault frigate    and that no mwd fit battleship should be able to outpace an mwd fit assault frigate    im sure you will realize that they desperatly need a mass reduction stabber and caracal aligns as fast or faster than all afs but the jaguar the most slugish afs  vengeance and ishkur   have the same align time as a friggin vexor this is calculated with spaceship command 5 evasive manuvering 5 no implants and no fitting mods or rigsharpy and hawk fit with only a t2 mwd have a lower top speed than a typhoon with only a t2 mwd fit this is with my skills  navigation 5 acceleration control 4   as well as all skills 5 yes i know this doesnt take into account time for acceleration and ship manuverability but the fact stands that a battleship can go faster than an equaly fit frigate
i agree that afs need a reviewif its this review i dont know the proposal is good in any caseone side effect of making the afs faster is that they do become a somewhat overpowered toagainst interceptors
i no likey the wolf has been a great platform in what it does because it uses acs to great effect with the bonus to falloff when you look at minmatar ships you see optimal  arty falloff  ac  usually there are cases where falloff works to both   you may have switched em around by accident but i wanted to point that outother than that i like the idea behind it it would give them the buffs they need
err was no mistakethis is something the community was asking for a long time to switch the bonus aroundjaguar has more speed less pg and less turrets while the wolf has less speed more pg and more turrets this leads to jaguar favoring acs while the wolf can make good use as an artie plataform good enough to compete with the trasher imomore like the vaga and the munin
let me first state again that i fully support a reworking of afs in general no need for second thoughts there just this suggested solutionactually looking at my current setups for my afs i think they might outpace most tech1 frigates with a massive mass reduction  apart from the fastest racial frigates like vigil ofc  well lets pull the interdictors into the equation then my stabber outpaces my dictor if i fit it accordingly quite easily if the revamped afs outpace the interdictors after a change id see that as not exactly balanced considering their heavy tankfirepoweri see where youre coming from and can accept the reasoning behind the op but in terms of overall balance id like to be the assault frigates on par in terms of firepower and tank with most cruisers having a very slight speedagility advantage and rather some other extra like a partial ew invulnerability or resistance towards webbing it is unfortunate that they are often compared to hacs as those are more and more a domain of nanoing to boot but that does not necessarily mean afs have to go the same way taking into account they still all lack one bonus the opportunity to implement a more unconventional feature is there i think absolutely but isnt that more due to some ships  setups   in terms of speed already being somewhat imba thus the problem rather residing with the unbalanced ship than the afs in general i mean the same reasoning could be applied to most intys and the vagabond for example  which i think is mostly okay   and i really cannot see the advantage of having afs go at speeds that outpace slower intys in the future nanoships and my speed pwns yall have already a far too big role in current eveo for my likings

to the cva boys point taken but any increase will just be used in the exact way its done now you would like to identify more unsavory characters its been stated unlimited reds sweet now to the guy quoted above if the player negotiations lead to gangs which crash nodes then we have a problem and its not about people shooting each other clearly you have missed the point of 00 alliance warfare as of 2008 the ui is linked to the blue list ccp should take a simple look and deciede how many blues can an alliance of a certain size have so that way you cant get 3 4000 man alliances blueing themselves  smaller alliances to form 15000 pilot blocks which destroy the node thats what i am getting at if they lock the blues out of the overview then so much of what is bad about eve that goes on in 00 will cease the naptrains will stop people will have to think hard about who they befriend and when somethin goes down realize they cant phone 12000 of their closest friends to come help when they pick a fight

yeah i couldnt understand the reasoning there either the nighthawk issue was well documented and argued and i felt id represented the best points in this thread in my docs i felt it was a pretty clear case that this failed and the far less wellargued battleship autocannon buff passed seemed a bit randomespecially since i fly all 4 races of command ship and do find the nh to be rubbish in pvp and i fly all 4 races of battleship and find battleship autocannons to be pretty good actually ah well we enter strange worlds when we enter the world of ship and module balancing

a few points of interest for passing readers1 this thread is concerned with pvp balance specifically the powergrid of the nighthawk its ease of fitting its balance relative to the other field cs and its ability to fulfil its intended role of gang support pve balance is discussed only in terms of the implication of suggested changes ships should be balanced in both pve and pvp2 the field cs are intended to fit a gang mod the other field cs can fit a gang mod using 01 fitting mods or rigs depending on fit a comparable nighthawk fit requires three this is not balanced3 the other field cs are significantly more flexible  the astarte and abso can choose to fit tackle or ewar while the sleipnir is a fine nanoboat the nighhawk has no such options or flexibility  it is a simple tank and gank ship4 the nighthawk has no range advantage over the other field cs in pvp in pvp missiles are a closerange weapon in general they are not useful sniper weapons because of flight time and explosion velocity issues this is particularly pertinent when the nighthawks useless precision bonus is borne in mind eft may say that hms have a 70 km range  but their effective range is the same as that of hams it is limited to tackle range 5 the nighthawks precision bonus is utterly useless in pvp in addition the intended antisupport missiles of the nighthawk  precision heavies  are broken being worse than precision cruise in all pvp situations that occur6 a comparison with other missile ships is useful base pgsa caracal 530 for 5 launchersb cerberus 635 for 5 launchersc onyx 835 for 5 launchers and a wtfg field thingied drake 850 for 7 launcherse nighthawk 710 for 6 launchers and a gang mod7 a comparison with the sleipnir as the other shieldtanking field cs is also useful we have already established that the nighthawk enjoys no useful range advantage over an ac sleipnir allowing us to broadly compare fits with amls hmls and hamls with fits with dual 180s 220s and 425s respectively nano fits are disregarded here since the nighthawk is not a viable nanoship all fits have mwd and cap boostergang mod toptier weapons named xlsbsleipnir 2 fitting mods requirednighthawk 5 fitting mods requiredgang mod toptier weapons lsb iisleipnir no fitting mods requirednighthawk 3 fitting mods requiredno gang mod toptier weapons named xlsbsleipnir no fitting mods requirednighthawk 4 fitting mods requiredno gang mod toptier weapons lsb iisleipnir no fitting mods requirednighthawk 2 fitting mods required
dunno whether its apathy or ignorance but this is a pretty good example of how horrid the csm is
ah well thanks for trying jade i knew voting for hardin was wise serenity steeles utter apathy to the problem and complete unwillingness to educate himself on the issues is absolutely staggering however wilfull ignorance isnt a quality one wishes to see associated with csms of course whats worse is the suggestion that ccp should check for the total population of nighthawks to see if theres an issue  this goes beyond ignorance to an outright lack of intelligence in fact the flaws in suggesting we balance for pvp based on pve is so resoundingly self evident that i have to conclude that serenity steele knows this and is simply using it as a smokescreen to cover up some other agenda i believe this inconsistency can be fairly easily explained they fly minmatar ships they dont fly caldari ships hence very specific and clearcut fix to an obvious flaw in a caldari ship is shot down while vague please make us more betterer requests for minmatar ships are given an enthusiastic thumbs up
just checkin in to see how this very important topic fared in the csm meeting

bumping a serious exploration issue latest thread on this type of site here
remove this item and you may garner supportotherwise no
why 50 rate in one constellation at all let the spawn be completely random so that people have to explore to find it
perhaps you could say howop nice idea like it as an option
a tactic used by cloaked ships is to wait until the majority of ships are fully engaged to decloak and start ewar mods or launch cruise missiles  bombs with a lower chance of the enemy noticing them and working to counteract themim not saying im against the idea but if i were a pilot who flew cloaked ships alot i wouldnt want to be flashing on the enemy fleets overview once i decloaked
luckily for me ive never had to petition to get my evemail box unfubared because i just ctrladelete but this also eliminates the use of it as a communication tool on two of my characters so yeah fix this please

supporting thisit such a pain contracting amarr ships that have fitted and unsued factiont2 crystals due to this
signedhow difficult is it to complete some of these arcs ea is up and running make some decisions and run with it let the rping corps and and faction fighters for the militias have some influencemore informations on the ammatar and khanid would be great
is this issue currently on the debating agenda i would imagine it should go without saying that it should be
nope it was taken up and voted down because the proposal theyd gotten was apparently too unclear itll probably be brought up again the next time around
the reducing skill reqs to get more pilots into capital ships as a solution to the problem of capital ship proliferation was the thing that killed it for me next time around the issue needs breaking down into smaller proposals with with less of the grand vision and more concentration on the nittygritty of capitals and their role in sovereignty warfare
i own both a carrier and a dreadnought and i would like to see the prevalence of capitals lessened while an occasional hotdrop is fun the real meat of the game is subcapital fightingsigned
isnt the whole point of these preliminary votes to vote on what youre going to discuss in iceland and not actually to argue over the nitpicky details

couldnt this be worked into a real bounty system if you have kill rights you should be able to transfer them to someone in a contract like an item exchange they get isk a ship whatever and you get revenge to make this work kill rights should last longer a few days to a week would be my suggestion
i dont think the 2 month old guy who got one shotted in his caracal  since the only way to actually get kill rights is to not fight back   would be very happy either more likely itll be someone in an unarmed hauler handing off kill rights translation  what i hear at least   whaah i can no longer pop defenseless players with impunity there are suddenly consequences for my actions umm the offended would be hiring a single mercenary  as opposed to a whole corp   to do their dirty work as a plus this would let you hire mercs to even go after even people who hide in npc corps the hard core pvpers should rejoice at that and youd have to be aggrieved to hire the merc so you couldnt hire a bounty hunter for stupid oog reasonsexploitable sure but what bounty system proposed or currently in game isnt its at least worthy of discussionrefinement the revision to the bounty system sabrina proposed in the other thread has its own issues as well
horiblelucky me i am training other frigates for covopbadweakugly like hellconclusion stupid and wrong change
 id settle for this i understand why they did it but yeah the imicus hull is quite fuglydespite this highly logical argument i want my eye candy
dear lord change the heliosimicus model and i will not steal candy for a month
no the current system reduces the number of newb questions in a game were the learning curve is like a 40 metres brick wallthe argument is silly i personally see the rifter as the most beautiful ship in the game my reason to get a t2 interceptor and electronic attack ship with rifter hull because ithink that the hull looks better is just as good at your with the heliosimicus let the slasher and vigil be crappy assault ships that doesnt have any good use in eve combat

pot calling kettle come in kettle i fly the maelstrom almost exclusivly as a solo lowsec battleship and find it very effective it might not be all that great in a blob with poor hitpoints but then i dont fly like that
i disagree with the op 650mm and 800mm autos are fine the tempest could use a boost though
itt effective  overpowered
well i consider it to be the strongest shortrange solosmallgang battleship if that is ballanced or overpowered is not my call i do belive it would become grossly overpowered if large autocannons were boosted and the maelstrom stayed the same however
well i dont know how your using it or fitting  mwd wd web   so cant say your wrong but i find it hard to believe the maelstrom is the best shortrange solosmall gang bs when theres ships like hyperion that can tank similar and tackle with more speed  agilityi do like the idea of increase ac damage and change maelstrom rof bonus to damage bonus to keep people happy and help the tempest vs maelstrom comparisons but as with most changes this affects the arty discussions so really have to fix the whole lot or one at a time and knowing ccp they will go with one at a timei certainly wouldnt complain about large projectiles if1 maelstrom given dmg bonus instead of rof hell yeah real alpha2 ac damage increased slightly3 hail fixed and t1 ammo range updated for todays eve4 tremor given falloff bonusalthough i suspect even then tempest would still need somethingwhile away for the week ill probably use pen and paper and make epic topic  no eft just experience and memory   to type up when back home

from the original  idea   bounty hunter rights to kill in empirei remade the title since the idea developped lots since the initial one thanks to all the feedback and idea of the communityso right now the bounty system is pretty useless the only place to collect a bounty legally is in 00 in a war or make him take your can which in my opinion this way of collecting is brokenso we should redesign the bounty system and add a new funway of making isk in eve by adding a new job bounty hunterfirst the bounty system change a player could still put a bounty in any designated station  in aggressive mode vs the target   but to be a bounty hunter and to claim the reward it will all be done with concord within a concord station secondly conditions to be a bounty hunterhere are some ways we could develope the bounty hunter skill with the killing license the player would have a choice of wich type of license he wants to buy depending on is bounty hunter skill lvlso we give the bounty hunter a choice of a limited number of kills for an unlimited time for a higher price or an unlimited number of kills with a limited time for a lower priceso here is the bounty hunter job a fun new way to make isk in eve as for the grief put 001 isk randomly   it wont happen since the players needs to be in aggressive mode and to claim the reward the player will need all the bounty hunter requirement  buy a license skills standings etc   all feedbacks and ideas are welcome i think this is going somewhere and i hope to have support from a delegate or a ccp member thank you
i support this idea
i support it
so  i should be able to put a bounty of 001 isk on you so my friend can go into empire space and kill you with impunitybad ideaand no the amount of money should not matter there are plenty of people who would throw away large sums of isk just to  with someone
interesting concepthow about a dedicated bounty hunter skill to accept bounties you have to have the skill and the skill level also increases the level of bounties you can take iebhl1  no bounties more than 1 million iskbhl2  no bounties more than 10 million iskbhl3  no bounties more than 100 million iskbhl4  no bounties more than 1 billion iskbhl5  unlimited bounty levelyes you will get some people using the bounty system to grief other characters but is that any worse than say jetcan piracy obviously there would have to be some kind of limit as to how long a bounty can remain active and how many times you can place a bounty on someone before its considered harassment but that could be worked out easilyvery cool concept especially if its offered as a skill it could be a fully legitimate profession and would fix the broken bounty system as it stands nowedit to assist in preventing griefing no bounty can be less than 100000 isk and no player character may have a new bounty placed on them for at least 7 days after a bounty has been collected bounty time periods and cost increases follow exactly the same price rules that wars follow
i like this idea but perhaps to counter dippin dots argument to this idea security status could be factored in as well it doesnt make sense to me that engaging a player in high sec who has a negative security status  a bounty should be a punishable offense
it makes no sense whatsoever to see people show up on the empire jump gate bulletin boards with bounties but oh hey you cant actually shoot at them because of ed kill rights mechanics in empire i dont believe 001 is a valid bounty and bounties should have a minimum cap on them anyway probably 1m but it could depend on the security statusexactly what do you think a bounty is its a reward for killing someone whos heading up the bounty system why its your good old friend concordif you can pay concord to let you have kill rights in empire for war then you should be able to pay concord to let someone have global kill rightsimagine what it could do to jihadswarm if someone blows up your hulk you could place a bounty on their head instead of having to pay merc corps its the same basic idea as hiring the merc corp but without that extra level of interaction
i think it is a great idea supported
it still leaves open the griefing element player a wants to kill playercharacter b soplayer a pays playercharacter c 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter bplayer a kills playercharacter bplayer a pays playercharacter d 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter bplayer a kills playercharacter bplayer a pays playercharacter e 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter bplayer a kills playercharacter bplayer a pays playercharacter f 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter bplayer a kills playercharacter bplayer a gets a warning from ccp that his repeated killing of another players characters is under suspicion of greifingplayer a pays his friend player z 1 million isk who can pay playercharacter g 1 million isk to put a 1 isk bounty on playercharacter bplayer a has his friend player z kill playercharacter brinse and repeatthe only way it would work is if a bounty of this sort can only be placed on you once every longintervaloftime and it would need to be a very long interval at thatin addition to the above problem you can easily get a situation where every member of corp a opens a bounty  not necessarily at the same time   against every member of corp b effectively allowing them to go to war at a cost much lower than through a wardec
sadly the system would have to be more intuitive than that the system would have to check among other things if the person who placed the bounty1 belongs to the same corp2 is in the friends list3 is an alt4 an account payed with the same cc5 has attained recent contact with them6 traded items with them via contracts  private dealing  
if it worked in a sane way it would be fine in addition to my last post about greifing ill offer a third abusive scenarioplayer a goes into noobspace with an alt writes down the name of every person he sees then switches to a more developed character who has earned the right to put bounties on people  im assuming this is a necessary hurdle even though no one has bothered to suggest it yet   on which he puts a bounty of no economical consequence such as 001 isk his buddy player z accepts all those contracts and goes into noobspace and slaughters everyonewhile its a funny story its still a bad ideanote that player a and player z could easily avoid the afformentioned checks by simply communicating via some messenger system instead of being corpmates or anything of that nature that eve would be able to validatethere are lots of ways around this system creative greifers will find them and abuse them just look at suicide ganking
let bounties be an isk sink allow them to increase the level and intensity of navy faction spawns in empire space and let those spawns give no loot nor salvage
yes why notin my idea you will need to buy rights to pod a bounty so if you want to put a 001 isk bounty and your friend pays for exemple 1m isk for a kill its his choice and loss i see it like so he bounty hunter pays1m isk  1 kill right5m isk  2 kills rights10m isk  3 kills rightsetccould be more or less but it makes the bounty hunter choose his prey carefully and not shot a random bounty target he paid 1m for a kill and kills a 40m bounty that is good business but to kill a 001 isk to 1m isk bounty would be a waste since he lose more than he wins
what i dont support is this forum or this threadall those issues seems more important than what youve been lobbying for in herewith the exception of pos being just that still pieces of s

lets not start throwing with mud here shall we that comment wasnt called for by any means
unfortunately that is indicative of jades general disposition with anyone sporting a goon ticker no matter how thoughful supported or detailed a suggestion is he is found insulting members of a single group simply because he disagrees with him moreover no matter the value or merit of a suggestion merely because he does not like the group he actively makes attempts to subvert and damage that groups attempts at improvements to the game there can be no question that goonfleet encompasses the entirety of the game from mission running to industry full scale pvp war to ratting because of this significant body of experience to pull from goonfleet represents the very best in think tanks this can be said of any long term and hardened 00 alliance as long as their opinions remain politically agnostic it is unnecessary to bring it out here as two threads are currently present detailing the wishes of the community to remove jade but the fact still remains there is a hostile entity at the head of a group who is responsible for being the voice of the community to ccp because of his overt and constant bias certain ideas are quite likely to be left behind it is the job of the other csm representatives to be a check on this bias individuals who can step up and side not with politics but with good ideas for gameplay enhancements i truely hope that you will find yourself on the side of the game and not jades side
goons started it
supportthe csm is supposed to be the voice of the masses if the masses want to act like asses then so be it csm members are not there to push their own agenda or bright ideas they should come to these forums see what we want and get it before ccp no
op isnt even a goon or blue to goons or distantly related to a goon jade just likes to childishly attack anyone who doesnt spend their days kissing his  which is the origin of the complaints elsewhere about jades lack of professionalism his immaturity and general lack of competency does in fact extend beyond goonssup lokee also im not sure if we have 200 people in our alliance

i dont like it because it encourages new players to waste skill points 1500 per rat per level is a massive boost to the l1 missioner  ded connections 5 can literally double your bounties across the board in l2 missions its still enough to encourage you to spend your money on it but by the time you get to l4s the money gained is just a joke instead of adding 100 it adds 2 and all of a sudden you have a ed off recentlynoobish player who wasted what feels like a lot of skill points for very little reward now what i would like them to do is remove the unobtainable skills from the game entirely not the ones like mfo that are hardlimited but available but the ones like ded connections that to my knowledge simply dont exist quit deceiving us and filling up lists with useless information also if you can remove all the really weird ones from the database you ever looked at evemons nonpublic skills ugh   thatd be cool too i know why polaris has to be there but the rest should go

im against a return to volunteer moderation on the grounds it is too abusable and moderation by mobcomplaint is not the way we should go im for the introduction of a forumblockignore function though and i think its becoming nearessential in the current climate of the forums
i can see your argument and in that case how about badgering ccp to increase the moderator presence take on more staff and tighten the mandate so that some semblance of netiquette is returned to the forumit may not seem as important as getting a new midslot for your ship of choice but these forums are an important and public aspect of the community and affect the majority of players
whilst the ops idea is not going to be too helpfull moon materials specificaly promithium and disprosium are having a massive knock on effect in the whole market right now around 90 of t2 items require disprosium in their construction and yet it is one of the rarest resources this has lead to a new monopoply akin to the t2 monopolies of the past and i think some solution needs to be found to address thisi agree with the poster making the comment about territory ive had a lot of fun fighting over moons myself but at the same time we cannot afford to have a game based around monopolies in a few resources attainable only to a few who can use those resources to attain an unassailable postition of powerthis oppinion is mine and not my corperatins or alliances
i offered the idea of a moon prospecting post to add a variable moon mining option while leaving the static moon mining intact main purpose of it is to lessen the impact of moon material monopolies without destroying current values completelyso not supported but offering a alternative
changing blueprints to require a more even spread of moon minerals or offering alternate blue prints which create the same item using a different ratio if opposite materials seems the best solutionthe other issue is how sov mechanics work in that you have a flood of massively cheap moon mins because hell you have the tower up might as well mine it right change how sov works with regards to stations  remove the ability to claim sov with mining towers   and youll help fix the problem as welli think any other change would create more headaches then help
i think it should be somewhat like mining asteroids your deposit dissapears and another deposit is found i would favor having a 6 month supply when found though and the possibility of the deposit growing this way you can choose to mine it at the rate it recharges for a long time or throw a bunch of harvesters on it and suck it drythe 6 month supply with 1 harvester is simply to justify setting up a pos 1 month is to short for the horrors of pos setup
there is a huge investment in both time and isk to put up an pos and all associated arrays and batteries this op must never had to spend two days putting up pos arrays and batteries this is mind numbing to say the least the above is not a solution to the moon mineral problema better thread to look at for a resolution to this issue would be found here
this is why any deposit should be good for at least 6 months unless you put several moon harvesters on it
although i have never ever seen an abandoned pos and i would never ever train said skill i support this new skill based on theoretical considerations and  not being ironic of course  in a general sympathy for exotic unpopular unprofitable and ridiculed nicheminiprofessions like a new abandonedposunanchoringspecialisation

what i object to is your frequent use of the word objective in describing yourself and your posts youve used it in many of your posts in an attempt to give yourself a veneer of impartial neutrality in reading your posts its obvious youre anything but impartial or neutral you yourself have now plainly stated you lean toward piracy and that is what has been seen in your posts claiming objectivity when your posts are from a subjective position is deceit your point of view is that of a pirate and your posts support that viewunlike yourself ive never pretended to be impartial neutral or objective ive been very clear about my position and where my viewpoint stems from therefore my credibility is intact something that cant be said for youi stalk people hmmm lets examine that using one of your favorite phrases by your reasoning by your reasoning i stalk pirates  all of them   griefers people who are dishonest  calling them on their bull   all people who have anything to do with anything im interested inwell that just about covers all of eve in summary i stalk all of eve and i remind you of a mysterious someone that foil hat fitting you okay looks like it might be a tad tightshow me where i said or implied that goons were pirates as far as i can recall thats never happened in any of my posts on any subject goons are griefers this is not an insult to goons as they embrace it pirates are not necessarily griefers though some are griefers are not necessarily pirates though some are that having been said they pursue much the same course in the game with regard to use of game mechanics the game mechanic which benefits a griefer benefits pirates as well in other words when you argue for introduction of a game mechanic that benefits pirates you most often are arguing for a game mechanic which benefits griefers as well and therefore you may as well be a goon for the purposes of that arguement since a lot of pirates dont care much for griefers considering them low class i can well understand your objection to an implication you might be a goon if youll take a moment to read the second paragraph of post 26 in this thread youll see that i stated i was wrong to suggest you might be a goon altthat first sentence is wonderful and worthy of the title politician in one sentence you accuse me of trying to silence you suggest youre above that yourself and try to tie me to some of the unfortunate business in the csm meetings its worthy of rove himself too bad its utter rubish but i do admire the way its crafted simple short and jam packed with deceitful innuendoim not trying to mute you or shout you down anymore than you are attempting to mute or shout down myself and otherswindjammer

i can remember around a dozen posts of you and the other members of the csm trying to figure out just what youre supposed to be doing and what your powers were supposed to be and youre still planning to rely on ccp to provide you with clarification and permission to nominate your own leaders a document like this and its bylaws allows a new set of representatives to avoid all that nonsense and waste of time arguments without dependancy on vague and unreliable wordofmouth handmedown descriptions of how theyre supposed to function fly by the seat of your pants methods rarely work wellits not as if the current unfounded csm isnt full of powerplays
only this partyou join fw you get an extra chat channel the militia channel you joined ask for an invite in militia channel and get into a fleet the first fleet i got into was about 80 people it took me about 10 minutes to get to the fleet itself but was never alone no pvp experience needed
i dont really understand what the issue is its not like when you leave corp you can never talk to the same people or fly with them again i left my corp for fw but still do stuff with them the faction militia corps are pretty much noob corps as well so if you want to help people learn the game thats not a bad place either plus if youre in high sec youre pretty much safe to missionits not that hard just use common sense and dont autopilot people make low sec out to be something way scarier than it actually is sure there are camps but there are only a few low sec spots that are permanantly camped so just ask in militia or corp if anyone knows what those are and just avoid them
the priority of the status filtering of the overview seems a bit insane to put it bluntlytheres options to filter based on standings based on security status based on bounties based on corp and alliance and based on wardecs but in order to actually get the proper things to set up you have to mess around with the various filters until something actually shows up properlyclicking to show wardecs but not show anything else causes no ships to be shown because the overview filter decides that wardecs that are neutral standing bad standing bad status or whatnot are not to be included in a wardec setting in order to get wardecs to show up you also have to show the other categories that might be included with wardecs causing more than just wardecs to show up on your overview effectively rendering the filter uselessand of course theres no way to actually test you have the settings right until you have a wardec on grid and if it doesnt show initially youre probably going to be too busy to play with the settings until they do show upso what i propose is the following a change in the priority of overview status filteringsmost importantwardecsnegative standingfleetcorporationalliancenegative securityneutralpositive standingleast importantthis way you can customize what items show up on your overview better than before allow for an easier method to spot wardecs in the areas where its important those groups that are probably hostile to you but cannot shoot you safely in highsec next and so on and so forth

yes it would mean the death of jita as the main tradehub and other system s   would take its place
i wonder how it would effect the economics of the gamei would love this if i were a pirate just because id be getting alot of free stuff but it would send prices sky high due to the main supply of just about anything is jitait would be moved from jita but id expect the market to go sky high for about a couple of monthsto tell you the truth i wouldnt want to pay 60 mil just a new harbenger
yes yes it would thank you for bumping and pointing out the advantages tbh id just like to see all the little rats trying to get off the sinking ship
id go for this either that or the low sec that will scare carebears
we have seen in the past few weeks a lot of problems with the current implementation of the council of stellar management it is my belief that many of these problems can be fixed by allowing the csm to establish a system of rules for how their meetings are run many of the problems with the csm simply come from the fact that it is not defined well enough at this point for their meetings to run smoothly this combined with the fact that meetings must be held in eve chat makes what should be a simple process cumbersome and painful proposed that ccp revise the csms governing document so that they can establish a system of rules and procedure for the conduct of their meetings and a method of enforcement this will not only prevent from the chair running roughshod over its members but also set a system that will discourage personal arguments from making it onto the floor of the csm

please do not discuss politics on the forums saint
yo illaria are you just copy pasting that from michael moores website or are you actually 13 years old
another one
no im a filthy european commie i think we had this already established
um the chair was the one with the most votes and not lack of bias amiriteif most of eve hate people for not being them doesnt it fit thats exactly the representation being displayed pyou removed bits of smack against jade hrm if somebody smacks and gets smacked guess what thats good whats not good is posting your propagandist bs in a forum meant for their communication not yourseveryone  but anyone lacking higher brain function apparently   knows this whole csm bunk isnt meant to do anything its ccps little mindgame within a mindgame called evecheers
well its not as bad as having two members in the counsil who are clearly biased against ccpjoke aside having clear oppininons even of each other are a normal part of politics so i condone it fullywhat the cms is lacking is the usual rules for exchange of opninions that most elected bodies have rules that allows you to speak your mind on topics during sessions but prevent you from making personal attacks and in other ways derailing the procedings including dragging everything to a standstill by debating everything at infinitum
like most politics in real life too often the most vocal are mainly interested in only hearing their own voices seems like ccp and eveonline have found yet another way to assist in making eveonline mirror aspects of lifeparliamentary rules sound like an excellent suggestion but mainly i hope we voters learn from this so that when a second council is chosen we will better understand what we may end up gettingand perhaps rather than assuming that the most votes means chairman someone from ccp chair the sessions  non voting    until such time that the council have had the time to select their own chairperson from within the groupwell be back in a week to see if anything constructive has been approachedccp  thanks for the oppurtunity to fail  as well as succeedand to anyone else who follows the csm with even mild interest remember the start evaluate the finish and see how you could better vote next time
ya know this kind of straight talking is what people have been begging todays rl politicians forseems like batwigg is unhappy he didnt get some beatroundthebush politician bs spiel
funny thing about straighttaking politicians is the way they make certain loud minorities weep bitter tears when they get told what the politician actually thinks
i agree with you here actually the role of chair would be better handled by some kind of nonvoting ccpemployee in my opinion since all the csm reps  myself included   have our own votes and interest and aspirations for the game then it sits poorly to have the chair combined with a voting position still ive tried to address this concern in meetings 45 by calling the other reps to do the introduction debate moderation call to vote on their own issues and ive only stepped in when asked to by the leading involved repid invite your to compare and contrast the stormy meeting 3with the far smoother and less arguementative meeting 4 and meeting 5and while speaking of constructive outcomes id remind you that over the 3 weeks of preiceland talks we have successfully tabled from community discussions the following issues for face to face conference with ccp 1 removal of 3090 day time cards2 jump bridges and cynojammers fix3 log server exploitationbacon4 skill queue functionality 5 5 rule is too strict 6 kill rights should be transferable 7 alliances in faction warfare 8 funky pos alterations 9 improve black ops 10 make suicide ganking more difficult11 general eve forums improvementfixing12 csm should vote for its own chairman 13 evaluation of empire war dec mechanics14 feasibility of outposts going boom15 replace doubleclick in a chat channel16 cargo hold size of ships in hanger but not in use17 reexamination of 00 sovereignty 18 reload all ammo 19 small freighters20 drone implants 21 rigged ships and cargo22 aggression timer is too shortvariable hull fix23 improve bombs 24 chat channel pilot listing25 ew icons26 hud minimum sizes27 personal assets hud28 skills page improvement29 assembly arrays 30 experimental industry issues31 science pos improvements32 sell order tweaks33 shares stock market34 contracts improvements35 completion of unfinished story arcs in eve36 roleplay interests in eve  dynamic consquence37 moon mining improvement  dynamic seeding38 pvp ownership of wrecks39 corporation standings slots 40 corporations automatical get alliance standings41 buff large autocannons42 colorblind ui43 account security 44 maclinux client45 multi monitor support46 evemail spam from corp eventseach of these issues stood for the mandated 7 days of public discussion each was brought up in a formal quorate csm meeting and received a passing vote each has been ruled an issue of importance and general community interest and has been documented in the form of a submission template and provided in advance to ccp to form the agenda for the conference in iceland now if anybody still holds that a few sparks and arguments in the debating chamber and some froth on the forums invalidates the good work done by csm representatives who have worked pretty damn hard to get this thing on the road to a ridiculously short timescale then theres not much i can say to that besides  run next time and show us you can do better because i happen to think this inaugural csm has done a damn fine job and anybody continuing to snipe from the sidelines in the face of very clear evidence of accomplishment is being petty disingenuous and mindlessly vindictive
why exactly are you bothering to respond to jades alts attempt to troll with rl politics anyone who actually believes what jade  illaria    believes will never see reason just ignore the rl stuff or take it to another forumedit 1  fixed quote bracketsedit 2  got rid of rl political reference of my own this is the wrong place for it
cleanedplease keep real life politics off the forums
i suppose we deserved that but still
if it was clearly a problem more people would support it was your claim the counter argument to that was if that was true then we would see more support for issues such as email logging which affect a larger and more powerful userbase that is since we arent your claim is false whether or not its clearly a problem has little to do with the amount of support it gets an objective unit of measurement obtained by examining the issue so that you are no longer unfamiliar with ityou might want to note that i would not have supported escalating this to ccp it is not the result i am criticizing its the process
so you dont like the process ok v0v have a tshirt made nobody else likes it either its on the agenda for iceland to discuss regarding support you cant hold the council accountable for the disinterest in the playerbase in solving these issues if they dont use the forum to support the issues then the forum will be useless you can lead a horse to water that doesnt make my claim of support any less valid im telling you that if you want attention paid to something to drum up support for it youre saying the lack thereof isnt indicative of whether or not theres a problem i agree with that but am saying that if you want attention paid to something thats the way to do it
goum get back in line youre ruining the whole conspiracy
maybe i am not being clear the process of how you are making the decision to vote no if you dont think the issue warrants being sent to ccp fine if you dont learn about the issue before the vote not fine
a month of weirdness i find myself agreeing with goonsdariusi think what goumindong is saying is that csm members who are not informed on an issue should not vote no but abstain if you do vote  yes or no   it should be done with a reason not a i have no idea so i voted an example would be i voted no on that because i did not think we should be worrying about individual ships when whole classes of ships have issuesthen again i could be wrong
i got the impression from the chatlogs that the csm had word from ccp about abstaining suggesting that it requires 5 support escalation votes to move an issue forward and that an abstention is the same as a no vote because of that is that true
thats only a technical difference though one could always wait until everyone who cares has voted and then vote with the majority
yep there wasnt supposed to be an abstain option bottom line is nobody who was running for the position of csm should really be abstaining on gameplay issues  our homework for the meetings is the read the threads talk to players understand the argument and reach an informed decision ive certainly had multiple convos open during some of these votes and been taking external advice on the technicalities  im doing my best to cast an informed supportdeny vote based on what i perceive to the be the best interest of the game
support everything and make ccp cry about how many topics their are really if you dont know about the topic just support it so that they can discuss it and hear ccps opinion
thats true they could do that  but i agree with jade that if youre elected to the csm you should do some research and talk to people in order to gain an informed opinion not abstain i think people abstaining from votes are not doing their jobs
agreed still abstaining would seem like the lesser evil than generally voting no under such circumstances
well if a csm really cannot get enough understanding of an issue to put their name with conscience behind a support vote it doesnt necessarily mean they are stupid or failing  it could mean the issue is not well stated or is confusingly argued  in these cases voting no support can mean sorry but im not convinced and thats fair enough in the process
wouldnt it make more sense to vote for it right now so you can have a discussion in iceland about it and hopefully have your questions answered
i dont understand what you are asking there yordaif people dont agreeunderstand the proposition on the table they cant really vote support
if people dont understand the issuenot proposition issue maybe they should get informedi mean god forbid we have a place on the forums where that can happen or a time for when csms can ask questions
the whole point of the votes right now is to decide what you discuss with ccp if the issue really is so complex that you cant understand it dont you think that having a face to face discussion with the person presenting it and ccp would maybe clear up some of the issues
that was exactly why i said i voted down the issue the issue of getting more support for a topic was secondary
well its actually about which questions we ask ccp we are supposed to frame these things in the term of questions in our documentation for example my destructible outposts thing actually boiled down to hey ccp can you envisage a future for 00 space that includes destructible outposts  yesno   the csm voted to support me asking that questionproblem with some issues  particularly the capital ships online one   was that it was very specific on some of the proposed solutions and had stuff like fixing captial ship proliferation by reducing skill reqs and that really wasnt very persuasive i certainly didnt find any single issue that got raised that i couldnt cast an informed vote on but there were issues that i found poorly framed or badly argued or simply unconvincing and i had to vote no support with my conscience end of the day we do have a responsibility to decide the priority of issues being raised and cant simply blanket support all of them and leave it for ccp to sort out or else whats the point of the csm itself id be happy to see capital issues come up again certainly but id like to see each distinct proposal split into a separate issue and fully argued and described so we can vote supportno support on an informed and decisive basis
actually we voted for the csm to have a discussion with ccp regarding the issue at least that was my intention in voting yes that in no way implies support for the subject matter merely support for the conversation were not going to fill 2 or 3 days with yess and nos there will be back and forth or we will have wasted a significant amount of everyones time
am i missing something voting on issues to have a discussion with ccp about them itd be good if someone can point out where this is the stated purpose of the csmi must have missed it in my readingsi really hope that the csm will one day split issues out into seperate issues for the purpose of making issues crystal clear having a wellframed question and making discussion and voting easier and meaningful  ie each issue is voted on its meritsconcerns   additionally when will the csm start to take the benefits to the majority of eve players into account when discussing and voting on issues40 supports counts as an issue concerning the majority of eve playersrepresentatives are free to bring up anything in a meeting so long as it has been on the forum for a period of 7 dayssubmission templates before meetings hinder this processwhen will csm members  with the exception of a couple   start to interact with the populace via the forums and actually debatediscuss issues that are posted it seems to me that many csm reps are uninformed about issues and the implications of changes due to not asking questions of the issue and digging a little deeper many simply stick an issue up make zero further contribution and then bring it up for voteobviously with a predetermined opinion on the issueive certainly had multiple convos open during some of these votes and been taking external advice on the technicalities  im doing my best to cast an informed supportdeny vote based on what i perceive to the be the best interest of the gamemaybe this would be better before a meeting at least you are trying to understand some issueswhen will we see discussion about issues and their ramifications in meetings when will we see voting on an issue occurring rather than voting just to make a list look biggertake carebruce hansen
actually the stated purpose of the csm was to serve as an oversight committee beyond that our role has been altered to one of taking player issues directly to ccp with the guarantee of a response from themif youd prefer we do that without discussion thats just fine by me but i fear we may not accomplish muchre debatediscussion of issues i involve myself minimally with the issues im most familiar with in various locations i fail to see how my input would be any more relevant than your input on a subject with which you are more familiar to top that off the assembly hall sucks for this purposesorry have to run for a conference call ill come back
re capital ships onlinethis one was a bit of a jaw dropper for me it looked like bane wanted to bring the topic in its unspecified totality to ccp for discussion he indicated he had some specific ideas on how to nerf them or make them more accessable and he also had some ideas he hadnt presented i meancome onlets talk about capital ships you may as well say lets talk about outposts or lets talk about battleships or lets talk about the amarr etc its too large a topic to not break down into specific proposals for a voteunless i was missing something voting aye on that proposal would have given bane carte blanche to present anything he wanted to ccp regarding changes to capital ships and mechanisms which control them without having the specifics of the presentation reviewed by the csm at the very least he was asking the csm to vote on documents that werent available to them at the time of the voteat this point i wont suggest that bane was trying to pull something im not convinced he was i will however say this needed to be presented in a more organized manner and broken down into specific proposals for that reason alone it was appropriately voted downthen posts on the forum which suggest the csm should have voted to escalate it because its an important issue there was even one poster who suggested that those who voted against escalation of banes proposal were uniformed about it should have been informed about it and had no business voting against something they didnt understand what colossal conceit some of what bane was suggesting in the csm meeting wasnt even on the forum thread he started on the subject ie shortening the skill training necessary to pilot a capital wasnt in the op of the threadlooking at the op of banes thread
ive already addressed that in this very thread
thats nice but he hasnt posted the last one let alone this one i guess were switching to jericho fractions site for the csm stuff now and yeah ccp havent posted the first meeting minutes yet everyone dropping the ball all over the place
well complain about it or say thanks to the people trying to do their best in trying circumstances this really aint an easy task and despite that weve pretty much done the thing as well as it could possible be done keep in mind serenity had no formal responsibility to do this  he set up the evecsm site  and our mailing list   because he wanted to make the csm a success not because he was obligated too he could have sat back and watched ccp not get the resources in place in time and watch us fail to achieve much but no he gave it a go and tried his best thats what im doing by hosting these chatlogs on the jericho fraction site i could sit back and not publish the logs but im trying to do the best i can to keep the promises we collectively made as the csmsheesh
so we enter the age of wowi miss the political threadsi miss people acutally replying without just trying to make a laughable comment to boost there egoreading this section just reminds me of what it looks like on a wow board can we all act like adults or at least rp one i think more mod work needs to be done to put a end to the personal rubbish that is going on in here  the csm have been chosen so let them do there best without all the posts having a go flame me all you wantif you were part of the old days you will agree lets just try improve the forums for all our sake
it seems we are in no shortage of whines though im sure we could export our surplus to the wow forums
though you know i agree with you in spirit purgatori eve has certainly lost its way when it comes to adult discussion on these forums  there is a big problem with more moderation and thats that it does come with inevitable bias in one form or another that can become its own evil lets say for example that we had volunteer mods back and they were obliged to investigate and take action when x number of forum posters complained and anything well in the current environment the same 160 odd posters who mindlessly flamed ban jade from the chair on the assembly hall thread could just as easily spam the moderation team and call for a permaban on my  or anyone elses   posting they didnt agree with just because they felt like being disruptive asses you open a big can of worms when you throw open any kind of public opinion function in this environment where there is a loud bullying minority prepared to go the extra mile to get its way through mob votingwhat we really need  in my opinion   is improved forum functionality with the ability to block posters corps or even alliances that we personally feel bring no value to our forum experience there is no reason that everyone should be forced to read the almost uniformly awful posting of particular people or entities some people hate my posting purgatori and loathe anything the star fraction writes  let them block me and it and never have to worry about flaming us againand im not convinced its actually even possible for ccp to moderate these forums successfully at the moment given the fact that the games largest single alliance is a professional forumtrolling outfit of epic scope and obsessional enthusiasm for this dark art and without banning that entity from the game wholesale  which they obviously arent every going to do since it  50000 dollars a month   they  and we   need to live with a certain level of disruptive and abusive bullying flaming and trolling as a background noise since this sort of behaviour is the lifeblood and passion of this particular ingame entity solution is  give us forum block tools and give us a better suite of ingame block tools let the abusive flamers keep flaming and use their 50000 dollars a month to improve the game for the rest of us while we can opt out of reading their nonsense and just stick to shooting their ships in game its a fairly elegant solution
wouldnt professional forumtrolling outfit imply that we get paid to do this if so im missing a few paychecksi guess my posting doesnt really count as trolling though
thank you for the reply  and yes i had to whine because i being a played since day one i left the forums because i felt they went to a point where each thread was a flame or trollthen i thought why am i leaving the forums to which i enjoyed because of other people so hence my threadi love to see some one who can take the time to write a good post and yes some one like jade the times where jade was a political mastermind was great days and i always await a good teaser by sirmolle even though he is my arch enemy from the days of venal alliance i semi agree with the function to be able to ignore people would solve the fact i would not have to read the junk but then part of me thinks other things could be done  for meeve is more then roam and attack pos warfare its the politics that made eve so this is purgatori aka tankuk comming back to the forums to once again join in with the banter even if i disagree with some of you
the funny thing is i actually do know people who are paid forum trolls and you can get employed to do this stuff at the darker edge of the political lobbyist profession i guess you should have a word with your corp ceos yorda  maybe consider going on strike if they dont review your terms and conditions
its me im the goon secret agent in the op i hold the rank of grand marshal of the forum brigade i could tell you but id have to troll youwaitseriously though it warms my heart that jade has to whine about us us being those who posted in the aforementioned thread everywhere and every way he can i think its clear who it is that has the vendetta
yeah but you need to think about the consequences really  just consider whats the worst most abusive thing that a mob of 5000 players could do with this change and then ask yourself if its still a good idea definitely and i have very high hopes that faction warfare is going to save this part of eve really  what ive seen so far is excellent opportunity and dynamism news reportage and systems changing hands now we need to lobby ccp to take account of this stuff in upcoming plotlines and look at exporting the successful fw mechanics to 00 and involving the pirate factions out there since the 00 arena has almost completely failed to provide interesting ic politics and incident these last couple of years yes we do need to look at some radical alternatives to drive the story of eve online welcome back
theres tonnes of interesting politics and incidents just because it doesnt fit your idea of roleplaying  and because you arent even a footnote   doesnt negate it open your eyes
i got bored of the great war when it became obvious there was never going to be a final assault on the death star and everyone was going home bored sorry but i need a helping of actual climax and drama with my space opera
people would probably rather pay me to stop posting i guess i could make my posting even worse instead of going on strike
thats very mature of you good luck with that
ive proposed a simple flexible constitution for the council of stellar management based on the csmpdf as of yet it has only attracted the attention of responces such as too much thinking required not enough crazy emotional reponseone1unfortunately most people are under the impression that the csmpdf is itself a founding document and not a buisiness proposal internal to ccp
i am wondering why there is nothing posted in the proclamations forum you could just paste all the meeting topics results logs minutes and source links as threads there just keep a mod handy for locking the threads once finisheditd be a much more clear display of whats going on instead of having threads randomly floating around the jita park forum of course having duplicate threads around here for open discussion is also neededso good idea or whats going on
we havent yet been told whats going on here its a subject for iceland i guess and yes id definitely like to be able to post the meeting agenda topics and not have them immediately filled by froth and offtopic rubbish  would be nice
sorry for derailing the topic but i just have a simple question for jade will the gtc issue be raised on iceland i think i missed the decision
yes it will first item on the agenda
excellent thank you
they already blame us it really cant get any worsewhy would they ever do that they see goon anywhere and their vision goes red
did someone say goonruns off getting wood for the pyre
agree with you here kb unfortunately its a widespread phenomena vov i think  imho   it also applies equally to jade as well tho some people have made up their minds that jade constantine is if not the antimessiah then an apostle of same tbqh  when i saw that the two american reps were from gfgs  i was a tad disappointed however they have seemed to be able to get their work done on the other hand so has jadecommittees are rarely the easiest places to get work done and committees being run under a spotlight seem even harsherit just appears to me that there has become this whole the other guys arent worthy attitude from many sources are they trying to make the game better all of them then i say giveem a chance to prove itak
this is the best part about goonfleet wow can we get normally smart people to do hilariously stupid stuff
there is a difference between people who take on responsiblities and power because they feel it needs to be done and step up to the plate and people who want power because of power from my irl experience and having leadjoined many a guildcorpwhatever in my gaming life the people who write the most for the sake of creating walls of text tend to be bureaucrats who talk about ranks and rules while making use of those same ranks by misusingabusing any powers they might havein other words they waste time and effort while completely swamping any serious discussion in useless crap about rule 85 section e and how that interferes with rule 37 sub ais anyone really surprised
what constitution this csmpdf is not a constitution or any other form of founding document that is a buisiness proposal explaining why its a good idea for ccp to encourage the formation of a player government and only in very general terms what kind should be encouragedthis is a constitution constitution for the council of stellar management
great idea even if it comes from a bob member supported

signed as i said thats an excellent idea
i agree minmatar caps need some fixinghowever the dread is an armor tanker no what it needs is an extra low and one less mid also split weapon bonuses suck in generalalso its lunacy for having the mothership break the mold and be a shield tanker so much extra training ontop of extra trainingdirectly compairing the thanatos to the nid well its insane the crappyness of the nid with the ops earlier comparasonsheck give the nag the choice of 33 turretslaunchers one less high and one more low let the player pick launchers or turrets for it and that way they can stick in a damage mod in that low and they are all setand somehow fix the nid its just poo
i voted yes but i agree with your point of view minmatar capitals should remain the weakest but the skills needed for them shoudl be diminished so for naglfar for example maybe give them 3 turrets slots with the appropriate bonuses so that the base damage remains what it is with todays 22 or even somewhat less than the base damage of todays by base damage i mean the damage it does without any weapon upgrade mods installed
if you want an idea of just how terrible the naglfar is a naglfar with five officer damage mods does less damage than a revelation with 3 t2 damage mods and the lowest type of faction ammo 
tbh alot of the suggestions dont go far enough i think damage is the way to balance this ship put the cannon back into glass cannon so to saywithout changing any slots or bonuses just upping to 4 turret hardpoints retaining option to fit 2 launchers though and the launcher bonus if you like   with no other changes would go a long way towards putting the damage type and quantity with a couple of gyros  in the right ballpark
imo4 highs 3 turrets 0 missiles6 mids6 lows75 capital projectile rof 5 capital projectile damagebang you have a big tempest that can do light tank shield tank  high dps or armor tank  comparable dps to the other dreads even with this considerable bonus capital projectiles may need a small boost to bring them in line with the other dreadsalso capital autocannons really need to be looked at as fighting in falloff isnt really a considerable tactic when your primary purpose is to be anchored in one place due to siege therefore the high paper dps of capital autos means nothing because you will at least be fighting at some range

poor minnies this is why i rerolled my main after 2 months from min to cal minmatar ships dont  imo  compensate for their high demand of module skillssupport

this is a pretty good idea
coming up with a new ship type just to create a tech 2 version of a hull that hasnt been used yet usually ends badly but this is a good ideasupported but id like to see them differentiated from cruiser sized logistics in some way other than size
i support this idea even though i dont think ccp will get the idea of what people actually wanti was thinking that an antidrone frig would be a good idea a really fast ship with very high tracking speed bonuses but putting out less damage than a normal frigi donno just an idea
a logistics frigate is a good idea but id like to take and do a different type of logistics support role since youve already got the cruiser sized medics i suggest you make the frigate version one that gives bonuses to various types of support not currently being bonused or being so but not used very often by any other ship such as remote sensor boosting projected eccm tracking link target painting make them essentially a little buff mobile it would give these forgotten frigs a role not filled by any other and maybe bring to use mods that arnt widly used atm
have you ever flown one my corp flies them in duos and they can soak up massive amounts of damage that wayfcs have to decide whether to put their firepower onto 1 of them while having their fleet size reduced or trying to simply outdamage the repair amount of both of thema logistics frig would help in roaming gangs as currently cruisers defenitly lack when it comes to keeping frigates in shapeespecially armor repairers have the problem that by the time you lock your target and have gone throu a cycle it is already gone the use of maintenance drones doesnt help much either as usaly the frigates are simply too fast for themlogistics frigates with a decent bonus to repair range and a reduction in repper duration could provide effective repairs to frigates
yer me wants  but three high slots to run a small nos as well as reps
no but ill be skilled into them in about two weeks and my first comment was a bit dismissive  in small gangs theyre just fine see the alliance tournaments for the most obvious example   but every account ive heard from people who use them is that once you get circa 20 on the opposing side logistics cruisers just pop instantly this is apparently why carriers get used for remote rep in fleets  they have the hp to take some hammering even if theyre less efficient in most senses of the word i admit this is secondhand but it fits well with what i know of how everything works but that said how long could a logistics frigate survive even against a small gang rare is the frigate with more than a few thousand ehp and it doesnt take much to pop that you might keep frigates in shape a bit better but your logistics ships will pop any time somebody breathes on them hard
this is not smart on ccp part they are going to be losing alot of members to this game because some people can not afford to run there game to reallife issues signed  save the 30 day

come on ccp start doing inovative things instead of following in the flock of sheeps that the rest seem to do
fairly new around these parts but fully support the requirement for ccp to explain themselves
what a unpleasant move from ccpill sure have to think about a lot of things mainly this account here
thread in general  28 pagesthis thread  same 28 pagesno sign of ccp presenceyou still not understand   
price raise is bad considering canceling 2 accounts
1400mms are terrible having both a char that uses them and a highly specd apoc i feel ed in a 1400mm ship1400mms have like the worst fitting the worst range the worst dps the worst trackingand at sniping ranges  160km   the apoc does almost as much alphaartis need something
you cant fit 6x t2 1400s on a tempest that screams brokenthen you need 2x sensor boosters to lock as far as the tremor can hit and another two tracking enhancerscomps to hit about 140 optimal then if you want gyros ontop of that along with a fitting mod well you have no tank and the tracking is entirely awful with tremor only able to hit stationary battleships
ya
this and then somedont think the mechanics can be fixed until a role for them is settled on whats arty for once thats decided the needed changes will be clearer
this would be ideal change and i would love to see a third tier of artillery but unless the fitting requirements are changed significantly theres no way in hell a bigger gun would fit trans imagines an 1800mm siege cannon then thinks of 8 on a maelstrom

heyai would very much like to have a sent box in evemail it makes it a lot easier to keep tabs on what youve done and still have to do and it gives mail history of sorts every normal mailclient has this feature and id like for evemail to get it as well as it stands i always have to send myseld a cc but thats just not practicalim aware that this will create another db hog but perhaps the sent box could be stored client side anyone interested in this
full heartedly support every email client ive ever used has this functionality why not the one in eve and for that matter make it possible to cc and multimail  like something up to maybe 35 people  
if i can upload 1 gig movies to youtube im pretty sure the database issues involved with making evemail decent can be solved besides a sent box also increase the characterletter limit by at least ten fold
i endorse this product or servicei hate not being able to know what i sent unless i get a response and even then you dont always get the full message back
what he said especially about that character limit
yes
this would be a great addition along with a possible cc feature to make communication among players more efficient
yes it would certainly make some situations easier to handle
oh lord yes again one of those things that ccp should have clued in on around 1990
perhaps a read receipt as well
id generally love to see the features of evemail brought up to modern email systems standards
1and a junk mail box for evemails from any goon
that would certainly save me sending mail to myself while ontopic what other enhancements would you want to see in the evemail clienti can think of pickup evemails through an api  then someone will write a gateway   andor download mails out of the eveclient for longstorage not send evemails through an api since that would spam us all to boredom
i was just thinking that i sent an evemail yesterday that i wished id saved

the simplest resolustion for someone setting 56 lv5 skilsl and then vanishing is simpleif account is active then skill training continues if account isnt subbed then training stops after the first skill is completed as is nowi think this would be greatespecially for the little skills out there that u could really just do with setting 6 of them going waiting say 11 days 7hrs 13 mins and having a bunch of the really annoying 618hr skills finished for ualso really usefull for noobs set a bunch of 1hr skills going or cruiser lv13 going goto workschoolcollegect and they have it finished when they come home its difficult when u first start to have a long skill going whn u are out the house 910 hours the day  standard work day travel tofrom work ect  
i support this request to get throughout and explained response to queue ideaccp much of your paying customer base are adults  despite empiric evidence in forums   that have lives please respect us as suchsame goes for the queue argumentation tbh disable queue on cancelled accounts heck  disable all training on cancelled accounts all i care but allow paying customers to have business trips work funerals and lives with atleast 1 skill long queue otherwise i will have to become a lifeless bum that can manage with the current system playing with what i can spare from social welfare p
no supportbrainless bimbo thanks for sticking with this thread arguing against the opabout alternate bpos  the example of being able to make a ship out of other materials no there is a reason that it takes much more tritanium read the description from what i recall it goes something like basic building block of all itemslets say an airplane takes 1000 units of aluminum  hull   100 units of copper  wiring   and 10 units of silicon  electronics   there are analogous examples in game it makes no sense to allow us to make an airplane out of 1000 units of silicon or copper  there are different minerals for a reasonif you dont get that example try this one im making bread it takes 100 units of flour  trit   and 5 units of yeast sugar etc  other minerals   it would be impossible for me to make this item with any other combination or ratio  it wouldnt be bread it would be matza  and thats grossyou may be right about moon mining  not my area of expertise    but it makes no sense to change bpo mineral requirements or roid availability oh and why is veldspar expensive because even though its everywhere a disproportional number of people enjoy sitting in their big mining ships driving down the prices so be glad you understand economics and make profit off veld
thanking somebody who has no clue what theyre talking about and sticking around spreading misinformation great right so now we go by description and backstory when deciding game balance issues  if you like to take this particular route then how about you read the description on veldspar scordite and a couple other ores around the most common ore type in the known world veldspar can be found most everywhere it is still in constant supply as it holds a large portion of the muchused tritanium mineralall it says is that its abundant as heck yet still needed nothing about being valuable or anythingpyroxeres is an interesting ore type as it is very plain in most respects except one  deep core refining yields a little bit of nocxium increasing its value considerblyhmm somebody should call them and tell them pyroxeres is not even as valuable as poor common veldsparspodumain is amongst the most valuable ore types aroundwhoopsies another such mistake nope sorry its not even close to being one of the most valuable ones nowadaysarkonor the rarest and most soughtafter ore in the known world a sizable nugget of this can sweep anyone from rags to riches in no timehmm right a nugget to get you from rags to riches you say  if the x16 income level would have held true maybebut hardly the case anymore when mining arkonor wherever you can find it barely brings you at best five times  or actually less pending refine taxes and such   the income of veldspar in a nice little highsec hubfunny you should say that because in the old days airplanes were made out of a little bit of wire but mostly wood cloth paper and varnish also not all planes of today are made out of various aluminum alloys but some others out of mostly carbon fiberglass for instanceand that flour could be whole wheat flour could be a flour made out of various other cereals or could even be whole maize flour what do you know its still bread even if the main ingredient used is something completely different i mean you cant claim whole wheat bread is the same as cornbread can you  but its still bread nevertheless isnt it for the i have no idea how manyeth time i dont mine i personally for my own interests couldnt care less if mining in highsec was more valuable than mining in 00 and so on and so forthbut the fact that mining in highsec is equally valuable to mining in lowsec  since the common best earner is still veldspar   even if the game was designed in such a way as to have lowsec be more attractive than highsec miningwise thats obviously wrong for a whole different set of reasons
lol akita tdecriptions in game are not very good are they but they dont mention what profit you expect to derive they just set a relative value all the descriptions of ore are on a per unit basis as well so one unit of ankonor is much more valuable than 1 unit of veldspar cant you understand thatumm lets look at those aeroplanes make em out of wood and wire and they go how fast 160 mph make them out of alloy and they go what 1200 mph apples and oranges your saying a noob frigate is make out of the same stuff a battle ship haha on the bread but its really bread with different qualities and uses just like different frigates do different taskslook akita t i know nothing about you apart from you dont actually have the ability to comprehendunderstand concepts in the written form well enough to apply criticial thinking you try to divert attention from where your argument gets soundly beaten with your use of countless straw men arguments and anlogies you seem to get thumbs up from characters with less than 15 posts as well which leads me to beleive that your trying to manipluate the discussion and drive your idea throughyou do some good stuff like in the noob section with the golden rules the collection of dodont points but they are not your original thinking they are a collection of others work that you happily take credit for because you desire forum credability  btw i easily discovered and assimulated 75 of the listed points researching if the game suited my desires before i downloaded the game the other 25 came within 6 hrs in the rookie channel so only handy for lazy andor stupid ppl  
now i know your trolling
nah just being a bstard nicely
there fixed that for you
now that was a troll well doneyou couldnt resist could you
just accept it no matter how i put the problem no matter how you turn it from how i put it theres no satisfying you youre just deadset on me being wrong regardless of any kind of evidence or inferenceregardless of anything else you can say about it it all comes down to this easy thing for you to comprehend yet keep on failing repeatedly  highsec mining is supposed to be the least profitable lowsec mining more profitable and 00 mining the most profitableyes supposed to says who  everybody but you and those who share your namesake
as a lowsec miner i fully agree with this message andor servicethe only way to make more money in lowsec than in highsec is to find hidden belts which are very rare and not really all that rewarding
as ccp are pvp ppl the risk and reward factors seem to be originally based more on strength and occurance of npc rats thats where the security rating comes from roid types were placed to reflect the fact and thier mineral content too concord was added later like insurance to add a degree of player protection where life was easier as to your supposition that high sec mining should not be as or more profitable than nul sec i have to disagree the skills required to strip mine efficiently in a hulk are the same no matter what ore you mine is it notif you do not want players who are efficient miners and ore processors and who do make lots of cash on veldspar then you have to tackle lvl 3 and 4 mission runners in high sec also because they get great rewards in battleships which are basically the same grade of ship as a hulk in skill points required to fly removes foot from mouth ccp knows that veldspar is the most needed ore as a source of trit thats why its in nul sec too they removed shuttles as it was trit on tap open to abuse a cap on the market without that cap the price begins to reflect demand and miners will mine it to give a supply therefore all your moaning about is too many miners in low sec mining high end roids  low price   and not enough ppl mining veld in high sec low sec and nul sec  high price  
low sec has much greater risks than high sec even if it is only the time it takes to fit out another suicide gank ship the ganker has still used more resources than the low sec guy simply blowing you up rats in low sec get harder requiring stiffer tanks rats in null sec can get very extreme requiring very expensive tanks the same argument about risk versus rewards being broken could be used to justify bs rats in 10 i dont want price caps simply that 00 by virtue of being 00 should have better roids individual min prices should not matter in this the ore itself should be superior the entire reason arkonor is 00 only is because it was supposedly already mined out buy the empires in empire space the same would hold true for teh best veld roids
so why are you still mining in lowsec this isnt snark its a serious question
you make it sound as if you even might be rightno its not a supposition its a fact its been repeated over and over again as a cornerstone of the game since the game started and the only reason you dont keep seeing it repeated is because the devs dont say all that much lately and when they do say anything they try out of all possible angles to say as little as possiblethe idea that you can even begin to ignore that is nearly unfathomable so deeply wrong that its no wonder people start calling you trollyes ther are a lot of other things that are too profitable in highsec and not enough more profitable in lowsec00 but the miningores are just one of those things and the one that has been targeted by this threadyes the rest will have to be fixed too eventually but its not that much of a problem right nowsaying that a lot of other things are sort of broken too with regards to highseclowsec00 riskvsreward balance doesnt give you a shred of right to go against fixing one of the things thats brokenthat you could even entertain such train of thought deems you worthy of your chosen name
i only mine hidden belts in lowsec which are very very rare and usually only contain gneiss which is about 2x veldspar valuethe rest of my time i spend mining velsdpar in a cargo expanded  rigged hulk in 10 which makes more iskweek than mining a very limited quantity of gneiss you can usually mine out a hidden gneiss belt in under a day  
look the op argument is not enuf trit available make a get out of jail card so the limiting factor is done away with as ppl concentrate on activities that provide high end minerals so lets utilise them moreits not about risk reward in any way is it its about a perceived limited supply of trit on the market that is the sole gripe for alternate bpos
signed pilgrim is awful u guys need to overlook it
take away the drone bonus and give it a range bonus its an easy fix if you want damage fly a curse its the same with caldari whens the last time you saw a falcon do any dmg besides youd still have a beasty drone bay and the amount of behind the scenes damage your doing can be immmense make the dam ship a force recon give it its ewar bonuses and take away its dmg you want dmg thats what combat recons are for the idea is to balance the ship not make it a solo god you guys have to remember that neuts  dmg to any active tank
support it
agree
for great justice
as a nidhoggur pilot i support this change
boost the minnies
for pve the current precision heavies are very good you can hit anything apart spider drones ii perhaps and do good damage the diminished signature of the precision heavies helps much against the npc annoying frigates while the supposed better precision cruise missiles have very big signature unable to deliver full damage even to npc cruisers i know you have the pvp in mind but there are also pve needs in pve the frigates never go faster than 880ms so the current explosion velocity of the heavies at 1000 does matter if an upgrade would be made that should be on cruise precision missiles by diminishing considerably their current signature radius while lowering their dps for more balance but not lowering the signature and dps as low as are the current precision heavies that would help against those sturdy tech 2 frigates in lvl 4 missions initially i thought that perhaps it would be better if ccp creates additional missile types like precision mkii for example more inclined for pvp purposesbut then i realised that there is a reason there are these current missile limitations dont forget that it not about a specific missile penalty in particular actually everything is impossible to be hit when traveling very fast regardless of weapon platform be it turrets or missiles at least missiles always hit at non mwd speeds regardless while the turrets keep failing also missiles dont take into consideration your  caldari   ships speed for example a mwd moving turret boat cant hit much while orbiting with mwd on while a missile ship can keep traveling ultra fast and always hit a supposed imobile target  remember nano typhoons  that is why i dont support this idea not because i have this minmatar character i happen to have another account that flies caldari but it just dosnt seem good for game balance
i totally agree wed definitely need an explosion velocity boost for heavy missiles atm the majority of caldaris cant do much against nano ships not many of us are trained in turrets yet we are forced to use them to do any damage at all at those nanofleets harassing the faction warfare battlegrounds  no you cant web them since they wont get into web range   precision light missiles dont have a sufficient range to fight the current nanocamps precision heavy and cruise missiles dont have the explosion velocity to hurt them so an explosion velocity boost for heavies as proposed above might help a lot to do at least a little damage and not exclude the major weapontype of the biggest faction from fighting nanoships
i dont have any experience with t2 missiles as i cant use them but ive gone over your numbers and you make a strong point backed by fact i just hope that ccpthe csm recognizes your hard work and works towards a steady fix for all t2 ammo starting with the ones with the best factual corrections
id normally let blatant fail like this slide but i cant afford to let some innocent hear something so blatantly wrong and believe itspider drone i stats1   all caldari missioning ships have drone bays drake for level 3s drone bays nighthawk level 4s drone bays raven variants large drone bays the only heavy missile nondrone bayed using caldari ship is the cerberus which should never be used in a level 4 and would  level 3s why on earth would you waste missiles on a target like the spider drone2   even if you did for some godforsaken reason need to use heavy missiles on this spider drone your base explosion velocity on plainold t1 heavies without skills is higher than the drones movement velocity with level v tnp its nearly 3 times higher than its actual orbit speed3   if you read my post you would know that the missile damage formula picks the worst case scenario and disregards the other stat given the drones 27mm signature radius your heavy missiles will suffer no loss of damage to velocity as your signature radius reduces it far more that drone would have to break 1150ms orbit before explosion velocity would take over in damage reduction4   precision heavy missiles will go from 288 damage imparted to 48 you will note however that im not proposing to change phm missile explosion radius so you will see no change to your imaginary heavy missile level 4 mission runners performance5   i have no idea why your bringing cruise missiles into this i listed all guidance stats for comparison purposes precision cruise missiles are better in every way than precision heavy missiles hell cruise missiles would even out gank heavies on npc cruisers due to the massive damage increase compared to the signature radius loss6   turret ships actually can drive off orbiting nanohacs obviously pimp 6kms nanohacs will be very hard to hit and take a long time to run off amazingly 6kms is where the changed precision heavy missiles would start doing close to no damage 183 damage before resists isnt exactly scary7   finally t2 ammo is by and large pvp ammo marauders excepted you cant afford to use it in pve nor should you ever need it to begin with saying dont fix precision heavy missiles they are great for popping frigates my drones should be killing is possibly the stupidest thing ive ever heard proposed in earnestto all other posters thanks for the support
zaran if youre shooting missiles at anything frigate sized and below youre doing it wrong use your drones this is quite simply completely false turrets dont care how fast you are going only your transversal its easy for turrets to hit someone going fast if they are at an angle or distance where the transversal isnt very good
this thread and the nighthawk one illustrate the problem with getting the community to comment on caldari balance issues  too many people either assume that were talking about pve or tell us that the item is fine in pve and therefore fine
its hard to be caldarippeople assume that when you talk about missiles  pve and caldari pvp  ew
ive pretty much made up my mind that whoever runs for csm next time as a caldari pvper who understands pvp issues is going to get my vote the but its fine in pve defence gets old fast
1   as we all know when you arrive at the mission area there are several packs of enemies that act separatly as small groups so you try to get the minimal aggro possible you never engage the whole spawnonly just a small pack of enemies each time then proceed to the next in most guristas missions the drones get agrroed from the packs you have not aggroed yet the only way to keep your drones from geting agroo is to agrro the whole spawn therefore packs a b c d which is unprofessional  so i mostly use drones to break the tank of the bses faster i can kill the t2 frigates using precision heavies much easier usually a couple of salvoes will do it i dont remember exaxctly how many salvos i need cause i havent played a lvl 4 in drake for ages its a bit dull to play drake lvl 4sanyway the thing is that i take down frigates t1 and tech 2 much faster using only missiles i got good drone skills with that caldari character but why use drones when i do it with heavies a lot faster and much more conveniently for most guristas missionsfor the same reason if i happen to play missions with zaran that flies apocalypse and maelstorm i try to pop the frigates from afar before they reach me  ab helps much in that   so that i save my drones from the aggro in guristas missions i remember one case in a guristas mission using the maelstorm  without ab   that while i aggroed a pack of frigates i got jammed and by the time i was unjammed the frigates were orbiting near me i had to use drones but they got aggroed by a pack of cruisers far away that was neutral so far i managed to kill the frigates but when i was done i had lost about 7 light drones ii   and that is the problem with the drones in some guristas missions thats why i prefer to use precision heavies when i can  if in drake    2   for the first moments they orbit very fast around you at 5000ms  gradually they orbit for less in fact i dont remember very well that is why i mentioned it before that is why i said that bperhapsb you cant hit spider drones ii with precision i havent been in a lvl 4 with a drake that contained spiders ii  with zaran i take them out with drones since zaran doesnt fly the drake   the problem is in their signature spider drones have a signature of 25 maybe 20 if i hit them with missiles of 150signature i wont damage them much the base 75signature of the precision heavies  the skills gets down to about 45 if i remember right so i could deal them some decent damage like that3   yes but as i said the problem is in the signature of missiles in that case explosion velocity is fine for pve and the lessened signature counts as i mentioned in 2   4   i just mentioned that about the missions in case you hadnt taken into consideration how nicely the current precision heavies work in missions and for the same reason how bad the precision cruiser missiles are for missions with their current large signature radius probably you say that the precision cruiser missiles are great since in pvp with all these ships mwding the signature is not a problem even against interceptors i ve never happened to use precision missiles in pvp so far due to th fact that when i was pvping  for razor   i had not the skills for tech 2 missiles yet5   i bet that precision cruise missiles they do an overall good damage against cruiser ships for the reasons you said but they will be worthless against the frigates cause their base signature even with skills is too big to destroy the t2 frigates that was my point i perceived the mater from a pve scope not pvp 6   perhaps i should have been more precise lets take this example ship a is a nano cruisership b is a turret bs ship c is a raven or a drake  non nano  1   ship a is orbiting ship b with mwd on ship b fails to hit everytime 2   ship a is orbiting ship b without mwd on but in close orbit  ship b depending on the weapon platform it uses may hit some light hit here and there but still keeps missing mostlylets see what happens with ship c1   ship a is orbiting ship c with mwd on ship c hits but for 0 damage everytime due to the missile penalties2   ship a is orbiting ship c without mwd on but in close orbit  here ship c will hit for big damage see the advantage of missilesso missiles will do big damage and always hit non mwded targets turrets will fail to hit even non mwded targets if they orbit too closeand lets not forget the example of nano typhoon orbiting around and immobile blasterthron the nano typhoon will kill the blasterthron because the missiles give it the advantage to move in mwd and hit the opposite cant happen see now the advantages of the missiles in pvp
disregarding the fact that the topic is about pvp not pve i wont coment on the other points you made but i see a deep sens of you not understanding the issue first of all the bs ship attacking nano has a slight chance of hitting especialy if the nano pilot does sth wrong while the missile guy has non because speed  immunity to missiles second did you read the ops post i seriously doubt it the main point of it was to bring the heavy precisions in line with light and cruise nothing more and if missiles are so great in pvp why do i see mainly turret ships  missiles have a lot of drawbacks in the world of nano and some advantages when ships with missiles are nanoed but missile ships are mainly a caldari thing and caldari ships are not the fastest out there so giving us the caldari   some slight compensation for not being able to compete for speed seems a good trade dont you think 
a wellresearched wellrounded proposal has my vote
agreed excellent research  dru
ughhh a simple tiny fix draws this much of a trollunless your in a well tanked turret ship you dont start firing on frigates or cruisers you kill the dps  either starting with the bss or any high dps bcs you can 12 volley the very fact your seriouslly proposing starting a mission by using t2 ammo on frigates demonstrates you either 1   dont know how to play or 2   are trollingactually the stats page i linked you says they move 3kms which matters not as you still cant hit their 27mm signature radius effectively thats why your ship has a drone baylearn to use drones without using them protip you can ignore spider drones until the rest of the pocket is dead if you need to if you are in danger of dying and an elite frig has you warp disrupted you dont really care if you loose a coule hobgoblin ii  they just saved your ship this situation will never occur except in cases of pilot erroryour possibly the only person who uses a pvp based weapon in pve then claims that horrible broken stats are excused because you use them to kill spider drones when 50000isk worth of drones will do that for all time its a pvp weapon period the end that turret battlehip the one that cannot hit you because your too close he just hit you with a 90 web and then a half second later alpha striked your cruiser he also had a pack of drones on you and really did not care in the slightest that you were closea raven  and to lesser extent typhoon   will either hit you for decent damage with cruise or hit you with torpedos which will have drastically reduced impact damage due to signature radius problems neither one will demonstrate the raw destructive damage of 8 megapulse in your face or 7 neutrons etcoh gawd luls nanophoons cant move fast enough to kite a thron to death they arent agile enough to begin with and their absolute velocity is still lol even in this imaginary world of yours that nanophoon is shotting 4 cruise missiles  if you even begin to utter the word torpedo that thron will 90 web you and  your face off   thats not scaring anybody thron either waits for backup or deagresses jumpsdocks please stop trolling in my thread you either dont know what your talking about or your some caldari hater either way please leave now

given that my ac iv unrigged crow does 63kms and will orbit at 24km slightly below that yes the only interceptor that is reliably 45kms is the taranis the ranis is not a tackler it is a killer it hunts targets of opportunity and hits them with some odd 150200dpsevery other interceptor can go at least 64kms unrigged even better depending on pilot skills interceptors can be hit by pulse lasers even at very high speeds 63kms is no guarantee of permatackling a harbinger youve already made it clear however that you dont know how pvp works on the field these changes to heavy missiles make them too slow to hit the vast majority of interceptors those it can hit would already be hit by any other reasonable turret weapon anyways or be too slow to dodge the warrior iis
precision heavies as currently fired by a drake have a top speed of 4875 mswith the proposed boost it will be 5625 msoutrunning either in an inty is trivial
ad hominem tu quoque its also false i am just a prolific forum  get the evidence and make a decision based upon it its not my fault the only reasonable conclusion you can come to is unfavorable to jade

assuming the mass of afs are changed to be in line with their t1 hulls the only thing that will really diferentiate their velocity from the t1 versions will be their base speed ass you can clearly see below most af base speeds actualy below their t1 hulls speed and the 2 that are faster than their t1 hull are only so by 5ms so if the af and t1 hull are spoting a comparable fit  both speed fit or both fit to tankgank etc   then their speeds would be very closemerlin 230ms  harpy 225ms hawk 235mspunisher 250ms  retri 240ms vengeance 235msrifter 320ms  jaguar 325ms wolf 295mstristan    260ms  enyo 240ms ishkur 250msgallente af stats are bassed off tristan not icursus i agree that the dictor nerf was uncalled foras for afs vs dictors they fulfill entirely different roles the primary purpose of a dictor  whether you like it or not   is to drop a bubble not to say that dictors cant fulfill secondary roles aswell but that is its primary role the primary purpose of an af is  suposed to be   straight up combat in one form or another as such you really cant compare the two as you could afs versus other straight up combat shipsas for your next paragraph the problem with you idea is that although afs may have a good sustainable tank they have far less effective hit points than cruisers because of this they need to rely more on frigate elements of survival such as speed tanking and manuverability if they are slow and heavy they can not do this and the wont last very long i personaly am not against these role bonuses like web imnuity but this thread is only about basic changes to mass and ship bonuses lets not derail it too much in that direction
did you not read the note reguarding that example that unbalanced ship is a typhoon fit only with a t2 mwd vs an af fit only with a t2 mwd once you start speed fitting them both the speed gap will widen even furtherthat leaves us with 2 possible culprits either the phoon is broken in its current state or the af is as the only frigate sized ships the phoon is outpacing are afs this leads me to believe that the problem is with the afswith the exception of the jaguar all of the proposed afs in the op will not be any competetion for intys in ways of speed or role i do have a problem with the jags proposed 5 velocity bonus and i believe i already voiced that concern in this thread and more thoroughly in the ops other thread in the features and ideas forum
while i would endorse any good af fix the problem is that its way too easy to make afs severely overpowered simply adding more slots and giving more bonuses would make them the ship of choice for just about anything
dont ruin my wolf please i rather have current wolf than this wolf oh and extra slots but how about pgcpu issues
i kinda agree though id like to point out that then af would become more like inties only that inties would still be better because with frigate hulls speed tanking is your only option anyway
i like the actual wolf too but i think the jaguar is more likely an ac platform than the wolf i was thinking about turning it into a munin style like the harpy big alpha on this onethe added slots without a pg or cpu increase is what i think will balance a bitbut im all open for suggestion what do you think would be a better change to the minmatar line of afs
pezzle has a wizard hat it is perhaps what makes him the greatest thinker and most clearly spoken person in the eve universe and most certainly these forumsif i were ccp i would not only adopt this idea but i would make mr pezzle a consultant for future game changes regarding standingsthe hat comes with him so you get both a wise man and a wizard hat of mystical magical powerso
good idea
i vote yes on option 332 only because it is the only option   a no option would help employ more bumpersticker manufacturing workers  am i the only guy going around with a vote yes on referrendum xxxx on their raven  
sigh welcome to world of caldari i guess caldari should run a 247 whine campaign like the amarr to get anything fixed i realy liked the comparison with other ships and i am realy tired of reading stfu caldari roxx in pve or omg you have pwn ew
agree nighthawk needs more pg for proper logical fits

saving the ceo niece mission set should have a nonstory variant where you just have to save like a vice president or other lesser officials relation it is 10 part but fun best mission is the rescue the damsel before she becomes a prostitute or go get us exotic dancers so much better than cigarettes for relaxing imoi would favor a special mining mission with a super dense ore type something that was the equivalent of mining compressed ore the agent only requires you to mine 23 or 34 of it and the reward bonus could be you just mine the rest of it and sell teh mins some ideas along the lines of getting more player acquired income instead of npc isk faucet type stuff

a better fix would be to adjust the amount of trit incoming so it isnt the bottleneck of so much production
already on the agenda to be done according to the devs
link please i failed to find that did i miss a dev blog or the csm report
ok tritanium price cap has been effectively removed with the removal of the final capinducing item civilian abswell there is still a cap but according to my calculations it is between 65 and 86 pu which pretty much means there is no real cap since tritanium will never reach 65 or more short version i support removal of price caps and i am fairly certain we do not have them anymore at least major ones unless i am mistaken and someone needs to enlighten me then
i support the removal of price caps in general but not this idea the solution is not to make npcsold goods more dynamic but to make it so fewer goods are produced by npcs the more playerdriven the better
this should be the basic idea upon which the market is builtto expound on it further nothing that is npc supplied should be refinable there have been price caps in the past with refining things such as pos modules as welleach item should be player built or unrefinable if supplied by the npc market
i loved the old helios model bring it back

going back to the idea of having a corp or office at concord then why not make a central concord base like in yulai and have a concord militia tab like factional warfare to allow for bounty huntersif u make the cost requirements needed to kill sumone not worth while until sumone has a bounty of xxx amount then it would probs help reducestop peopel just placing 1 isk bounties to cause griefif sumone has 1isk bounty and it costs the hunter 2mill to go out and kill said target they not going to bother the only people who would ever do that is the sumone outrightly going to grief another player which i believe is petitionablethere shud be extra bounty hunter options appear once a player joind the concord bh militia and he will have access to specific locator agents far superior to standard player agents and he can buy an informant skill to get the location quickeralso as there is a militia channel then have bounty hunter channel for them too to discuss locations of bounties and form fleets to hunt a specific target and choose under the militia options to hunt as a pack and share the bounty between the nominated players
strong argumentsand i set another scenarioa player uses 2 accountsaccount a is the pirate and account b is the bounty hunterhe goes with account a and makes the life of a miner very hard the miner puts large bounty on the piratethe player logs both accounts and uses the bounty hunter of account b to kill the pirate of account a so he makes money from the bounty of his victim that is why i dont support this
its not a bad idea but none of these ideas prevent the following scenarioplayer a and b are friendsplayer c is annoyed enough with player a to put a substantial bounty on himplayer d is a bounty hunterplayer a sees the bounty given to him he docks in a 00 or low sec system if they arent in the same corp and just in high sec if they are and asks player b to come to himplayer b pods player a and claims the bountyplayer b sends the isk to player anow did c instead of giving a some trouble worth for the isk paid he gave him isk almost directly in his wallet while player d the bounty hunter didnt even get a shot at the bountythe threshold of making this tactic worthwhile is just one implant free clone which you can get by jump cloning so thats not a problem too and clones arent all that expensive so the threshold is easily reachedpersonally i dont really see a fix to this problem because b can basicly do everything the legit bounty hunter d can do aswell the only difference being that b shares the isk with a and d wouldnt
and how is this different from the current implementationa possible solution to your question would be to not allow the collecting of  player  bounties unless it is done by a concord approvedlicensed bounty hunter and is done in high sec space if the bounty is said to be escrowed through concord as all bounties are then killing the player for the bounty in low or null sec would not be counted a player would reclone with said bounty and it wouldnt be removed until claimed in high sec or the bounty had expired does this then relegate a bountied player to low and null sec space did a bounty in the wild west relegate a person to outlying territories dru
i support the premise the implementation needs workperhaps if the bounty system required something perhaps kill rightsminer a has his can flipped by ore thief b he is granted 15 minutes of kill rights so he docs up and puts a bounty on ore thief b he can because he has the kill rights on the ore thief at that time this would eliminate the griefing aspect of someone jumping into a noob system and writing down a bunch of potential targets the size of bounties  1 mil minimum 10 mil   would help with the griefing perhaps a fee to place the bounty  10 of the bounty amount as an additional cost  also the bounty hunter skill a good idea as i see it would be better served to allow for hunting is the system  level 1   up to the region  level 5   so you dont have to worry that you will shoot at someone whose bounty is a tad bigger then you can handle and get concordedyou pop in to the local bounty office pay a fee for a hunting license and are then allowed to hunt for bounties within how ever many jumps  skill based   from that systeman addition would be how many kills per hunting license 1 at level 1 5  or more   at level 5so my additions to the idea1   require kill rights or something else to place a bounty on another pilot2   require a bounty to start at set level and include a fee to place the bounty  10 suggested  3   make short term hunting license that allows a bounty hunter to hunt in that system up to region based on the bounty hunter skill 4   bounty hunter skill that extends the area a hunting license covers as well as the number of kill tags that are included with the purchase of a hunting license 5   hunting license would last 12 to 96 hours  skill based   or until the kill tags are used up
what you guys are saying is already how it is in the current bounty system in the gamemy idea is to add a new fun way to make isk in eve if you see it as i see it this exploit you are talking about might not stop completely but with the fact of having to pay to kill positive standings in empire and concord it will put a thorn to those current exploits
im sure everybody agrees that there needs to be a way to kick people out of stations the question is how and i finally have a solution that everyone can get behind in the system i propose it would be possible for anyone in a given system to initiate a systemwide vote to kick someone from a station once someone has initiated a vote a dialog box with yesno options would pop up for everyone in the system once someone has voted the dialog box displays voting statistics to prevent abuse nobody would be allowed to interact with anything except the dialog box until everyone in system has voted if more than 25 of the people in the system vote yes then the person is immediately launched into space and is not allowed to dock for 15 minutes if the person is not in a station at the time then the timer is set to 20 minutes
this is even stupider than monster trucks
explain no support
i am sorry you have posted abut it before and i disagree 100 one should not be able to simply kick people out of the station and yulai convention should prohibit it explicitly even in the 00 space since concord regulates alliances anyway i know no one likes a neutral or a red in ones station but it is too much already where they have no access to any serviced other than market and the fact that they can see how many docked and how many in system i mean a cov ops frigate can gather more intel than a redneutral docked in a tin can of a station so not supported
no
lol wut
no
a better solution would be cut out the main reason for them to be in the stationthe market station owners should be able set the ability to buysell from the station based on standings another idea would be to allow people placing orders to be able to restrict the orders to corpalliancestanding implementing both of these ideas would be the most optimal situation
loser absolutly not a good idea
i swear some people arent that bright to support an issue you have to make a check in that little box next to support this topicwe cant get this idea pushed through if you people cant master basic forum mechanics
uhm out of 8 respondents only 1 is even remotely going in your direction and all he asks is locking out market with which i disagree as well so why should we press support button if we do not support it
this is actually the worst idea ive seen in this forum congratulations
momma i want that evil hauler out of the station so me and my ten pirates friends can fire on iti think it is the exact explanation of what the op wantedit a pair of point that the op hasnt thought  or maybe thought very well   no limitation to player owned stations only so it could be done in any system note that it would block the evil minerhauler from docking for 15 minutes  20 if he was in space before the vote   to prevent abuse nobody would be allowed to interact with anything except the dialog box until everyone in system has voted so player can start a vote with a character and lock all the defender of the system till the vote end while people outside the system could jump in and load the grid without any problem
because hes a blatant troll also can everybody please stop bumping this thread its spent too long near the top asis
what a stupid sugestion
loving it lets go
im for it only if the pressing the doomsday device plays dixie and kills ships also we could make it a game bonus for all titan pilots to automatically have trucker caps and buck teeth placed on their in game avatars
 yeah seaking 
lock me   
good idea ill bite
i noticed a couple very disquieting quotes from the most recent csm meeting indicating that the csm is in danger of heading off into even further irrelevancy this is exactly the wrong direction to take chaps small specific issues are the ones that have the best chance of being implemented they have the best chance of obtaining a consensus as to what exactly should be done they have the best chance of not being misunderstood by ccp and being implemented in a way the community doesnt like and of course its the small issues that often have the most impact on a players enjoyment of the game im extremely disappointed to see the csm just writing off small issues as not worth their time you will have much more of an impact submitting small concrete changes that dont have sweeping game wide implications than suggesting major overarching changes to the underlying game design if you say things like hey we all think the sov system needs rework or hey exploration kinda sucks then ccp will cheerfully nod and say great feedback guys well put it on our plate of stuff to think about for possibly changing much later when we have more time to make enormous big changes and absolutely nothing will have been accomplished ccp already knows all these things need work the csm telling them they need work isnt providing new information nor will it move the process along it will essentially have been a waste of your time the csm simply isnt going to be able to get ccp to focus massive amounts of manpower and resources on game redesigns that ccp hasnt already decided need looking at and made a priority of what the csm can do is submit idea for changes that have popular support and are very narrow in scope and not very difficult in implementation fixing obvious flaws in certain ships or modules that irk the playerbase would in my opinion be a terrific use of csm time  and you dont need to get into the nerfing game their are plenty of things that just need buffing or dont make sense for example assault frigates sucking this would be a great csm issue the hawk and harpy having their skins switched easy fix all those threads detailing why certain amarr ships failed hard yep that would all have been good csm material as well suggesting a new niche profession ship great idea for the csm to push specific tweaks and fixes to the ui solid gold for the csm to pursue these are the kind of things you have a chance of actually seeing implemented vauge head in the clouds well wed kind of like the whole game to work differently subjects while diverting are simply not going to be very actionable  ccp will think about them and by and large nothing will get done that ccp was going to do any way all the csm can do is ask them to consider changes which ccp is no doubt doing just fine on their own i bring this up because i notice from the threads in the assembly hall that huge portions of the playerbase are expecting the csm to discuss the small minutae of the game and not just dismiss it as being beneath them its great to some discuss big issues  banes capships online fex   and reinforce in ccps mind that these things they are looking at are important but i think its wrong to just have a standing policy of shutting down small suggestions
the above may be true but it is definitely possible to go too far in the other direction for example ccp may have wavered back and forward on a major change topic before finally giving it the heaveho  if the csm can demonstrate that the player base feels very strongly that this change would be welcomed and is a good idea then ccp might actually change their minds and stick it in the next expansionalso shouldnt be blinkered that a small change is more likely to be implemented  this might be true on some issue but a relatively small change on a specific craft could unbalance its role and make it  well unbalanced im sure there have been many frighteningly long meetings at ccp hq about whether a specific ship would be better balanced with 4 med and 3 low or 3 med and 4 lowi think the csm tackle all issues both big and small if nothing else a definitive no from the devs allows everyone to drop it and move on although how topics which have been addressed and have answers will be communicated on this  very broken   message board system for issues remains to be seen
support
agreed theres nothing wrong with discussing the little things too in fact there arent as many new big topics being posted to this forum since so many of the obvious hotbutton ones have been raised alreadyyes some of the narrow issues being suggested now could be unbalancing depending on potential implementations needless to say though after all is said on the forum and after all is said in the csm meetings if ccp feels that a particular recommendation would be unbalancing they can say so and not implement itthats not to say that the csm shouldnt be taking on the big sweeping proposals too though by all means talk about the big issues even if theyre less immediately actionable
theyre still in the first batch of submissions there are some real highlevel problems with this game and those getting addressed up front is a good thing most of what theyve done so far has been either highlevel game design or lowlevel fixes of stupid annoyances give them more time and they might stick their heads into balance issues at a smaller scale
for frienfly militia pilots   why because its scarry and sometimes hard to resist not to lock and kill  got used to it agter a hundreds of missions  and they will look friendlier   
huh
from the empyrean age issues threadyou also cant suppress the warning you are a criminal blah blah blah when trying to jump through a gate with criminal aggression even if youre in a podthese are just two examples these nerfs were not discussed ahead of time were not announced for the new patch and are not listed in the patch notes even now with the exception of exploit fixes nerfs should not be introduced without warning or announcement nor without a debate about their merits or lack thereof at the very least it is disrespectful to the playersi would like the csm to take this up with ccp and ask them to pledge to stop this aggravating behavior
to be perfectly honest wasting developers time and resources discussing every tiny change that negatively affects someone like your example is pointless following this strategy would lead to patches being delayed for a week or more while the same hundred people and their alts whine about a change that negatively affects them and positively effects  or has no effect on   the rest of eve the devs repeatedly explain their position only to get flamed until they throw up their hands in disgust and walk away from the discussion in addition any change that negatively affects anyone would fall under this category
the complaint wasnt about the change though the change is pretty stupid   its about the lack of documentation or advance warning associated with it ill agree with op here  patches should be noted in the patch notes in all cases except things being intentionally kept secret eg exploit fixes  
now why do you think that change was madecould it have something to do with the volume of petitions that they receive from people who have disabled that warning then do something to invite concord to relieve them of their shipperhaps a better idea would be to change it so that you can dismiss the warning for a specified time period ie an option to remove the safeties if you know you are about to engage in criminal behavioryour solution needs to address the problem that caused the changeqftevery change negatively affects someone and some changes just need to be done so dont expect to be able to review ever change before it is madei can agree with one point that you bring up it would be nice if the patch notes were updated to reflect this sort of information even if they need to make a second revision of the patch notes ie stardard patch notes with a link to verbose patch notesi can cite one example where ccp completely failed to properly document a significant change not only did they fail include the change in the patch notes their design documents were edited to indicate that no change was ever made to top it off the developer responsible for the change failed to pass this information on to his replacement when changing responsiblities if ccp published compressive patch notes it would indicate that such documentational errors are a thing of the pastas for exploit fixes in the past the usual line several exploit issues have been fixed making eve a better world to live in for us all has been replaced with details of what was fixed after the fact it would be nice if that practice was resumed
just change the 1500 isk per level to percentage 2 would be a good number
after travelling about 400500 jumps through all hostile 00 space camping formerly well frequented routes between regions and looking for everyone i found in local for a fight without getting a single shot fired  our setup superfast scanning covert ops arazu rapier 2 vaga   i come to the conclusion that1 all jump bridges need to be removed since you can travel in 00 safer than in empire nowadays  in empire you can at least get suicide ganked because you have to use a gate  2 remove cloaks from all ships that can actively engage in combat operations or disable all weapons on a ship that has a cloak fittedthe whole 00 population seems to consist of cloaking raven pilots who place a pos with jump bridge in an area which is acceptable for ratting noone seems to travel more than two jumps anymore 00 is a place which should be a lot unsafer than lowsec and empire but atm the opposite is the case the risk vs reward thing is way out of balance the tactical aspect of jump bridges is completely abused and favours the defender far too much  although they dont even try to defend   but seriously the complete game is broken it is all blob or spin ships inside stations roaming is a waste of time small engagements only happen at the chokepoints to empire because that is the only place noone can use a bridge scouting in 00 was once a social aspect of the game when people were forced to work together today it is all bridges and an occasional look at some intel channel playerplayer interaction hostile or friendly was once what made eve interesting for years it is about to vanish from the game completely and noone needs an online game to do their own  reallythe cloak part i know it has been discussed over and over and over again do with it whatever you want but in my opinion noone in a combat ship should be safe in 00 if he does not have a pos to sit in or a station to dock
you obviously have way to much time on your hands to go through all hostile 00 space come to geminate where the fun is atmalso after spending years building up infrastructure we should be able to make space safer for ourselves
when i was in 00 i found npc space to be the most rewarding pvpwise the stations always attract people and the fact that no one can claim sov keeps things interesting
i give my support to this issue post since i also feel that the near complete coverage of jump bridge networks has gone way beyond what the designers initially thought  on the other hand if this is what they envisioned i shall be shocked and appalled  i may not agree with total removal of jump bridges especially not the cloaking fix but i do agree that this has become an issue in a sense that it revamped the very nature of 00i should imagine most of 00 traveling pilots who are not the beneficiaries of these bridge networks  ie members of those alliances   have more or less similar view on this matter

theres a lot more fixes than that it needs like some actual search functionality say   but this is a reasonable minor edit also just to save you some possible frustration you are aware of wwwevesearchcom right until the ccp search does get fixed youll save yourself some pretty monumental headaches using that site
superb troll post keep it up
the minutes of the csm meeting on the 24th of may 2008  240508   have been incorrectly dated within the document as 24th of june 2008
i also spoke about the issue in more depth here
a lot of the ire against nano ships is coming from the fact that when people ask how to kill a nano ship they are told they have to go fly minmatar hacs most people want an option against nano ships within their chosen race or weapons system and i feel such choices should be available to themprobably caldari pilots have it the worst their ships are slow and heavy and missiles suck vs nanos because precision heavies are randomly and inexplicably terrible but basically telling people they need to go fly minmatar hacs to counter nanos would be like telling folks upset at sniper fleets that they needed to go skill up for caldari marauders diversity is good but the counters cant be that restricted each race or weapons system should have its own flavor of counter some of which can be better and some worse i dont think your specified proposals capture that racial flavor we want to maintain but you do raise a good point i think it could be better fixed by bringing polycarbons back in line with other rigs instead of being way better than the equivalent module and by making heavy precision missiles not so god awful terrible so that at least cruiser missile ships can hit hacs
still feel that the simplest fix is to adjust agility modifier on webs so that the ships slow down faster it should allow small nano ships to maintain speed as intended and larger nano stuff like battleships to be taken down right quick
already have those to v  ill take 2 thanks
fairly easy point imho please urge ccp to implement a particular subforum  or even two one rp one nonrp   for fw issues at the moment fw topics are scattered between different other forums and unnecessarily complicated to keep an eye on plus not all regulars of the other forums are really happy with it  caod anyone   thus in terms of sheer functionality and userfriendliness a forum for faction warfare issues is needed
i think fw topics in coad are better than other posts there the others  read regular coad posts   sound bitter and circlejerkesquenot supported
or even just a subforum within caod for all necessary fw topics good suggestion
to put it quite mildly and not go into a jadeesq post  sorry jade but you type too much   i put a motion forward that the csm be changed internally so that there may not be two representatives from the same alliance on the boardit gives them the ability to create far to much noise  if something goes against one the other will always stick up for them when it comes to votes then there will always be favouritismccp should have thought of this prior to the elections but quite simply put it should be the case nowregardsaneu
incoming 1 man alliances
i was about to say the same thing but with much more words thank you for saving me the trouble
no the voting system is fine asis and it prevents any bloc from having the power to do much of anything on its own two goons isnt a problem and nine goons is impossible under any set of plausible circumstances
thats like saying a political party cant have any more than 1 representative in parliamentstupid idea is stupid
what about those of us who arent in an alliancebtw people can just leave their alliancecorp for the duration of the election it wont change anything neither do i see there is a problem asis
the csm is an oog entity what pilots are ingame  corpalliancecarebearpirateetc   isnt relevant that they are experienced players of eve online is no support therefore from meiz
kill up
who cares jade is a dumbass
in a word nothe csm is an oog entity and as such what corps and alliances the members of the csm are involved in ingame is not relevant to the council if this behaviour had been from just another pilot it would have been called trolling the csm are expected indeed required the ccp document setting up the council to hold themselves to a higher standard and display that higher standard as an example for others to followthis is my personal opinion others may differ iz
not only youre late to this particular trolling thread you also fail at your miserable attempt of propagandalet me quote the paragraph of the csm document youre referring tothe quoted log from local chat in the op hardly establishes the grounds for a material breach of eula or tos or does itbut if in your twisted little world you really think you have a case id suggest you approach ccp about it instead of bothering us all with your moral grandstandinghave a nice day
jade with your expertise concerning twisted little worlds its hard to argue
sighwouldnt you be lost in the wide reaches of your ignorance you could look me up ingame and from my employment history you could tell that ive never been affiliated with the star fraction quite to the contrary youd discover that i even have been in goonswarm for a while
the behaviour standard in this case being a juvenile hissy fit when you dont get your way
great job at doing partial quotes keratinboy like shown above the quoted sentence applies to material breachs of eula and tosoh and i have another quote for youthis quotes establishes the definition of social contract as being defined by eula tos and other legal documentsand finallyits actually explicitly allowed to state your antipathy towards other players as long as its not a breach of the eula tosbut really why dont you present your case to ccp it certainly would be highly amusing
so jade is unprotected under the eula from the consequences of juvenile hissy fits also i have nothing against jades antipathy towards other people it is an irrelevance i do think that muting people for asking reasonable questions trying to blame your mistakes on those you dislike and trying to justify your actions by making things up out of whole cloth is rather pathetic and bespeaks of someone who really needs professional counseling mostly im glad i dont work with the guy
the crying in this thread is getting rather desperate yes i dont like goons live with itif the terms of standing as a csm rep had in any respect suggested that i would have to censor my free opinions as a player of eve online on the issues of goonfleet  or any other group i might happen to consider represents a nasty conformist monocultural clique of ebullying mediocrity   then i wouldnt have stood under those limitations fortunately for all our sanity there was no such clause and i was elected on the manifesto i presented to the eve player base and knowledge and aspirations for the game of eve online if the story is always going to be whaaaa jade doesnt like goons its so unfair  when maybe you should be asking yourselves why doesnt jade like goons ask yourself truly what is there to like maybe you should focus on your good points rather than relishing the bad and proving every worst preconception of your behaviour with every passing whine and pseudothreadnaught afflicting these and other forum sectionsyou goons come from an organization that represents about 25 of the player base yet you have direct csm representation from 2 representatives and a little under 20 of the csm voting power maybe its time to realize you did pretty well out of the csm elections and learn to sit on your good fortune without whining about how unfair everything is a little bit of introspection can be helpful in these circumstances
more goon manure youd think they would choke on their own hypocrisy guess the world just isnt that fairwindjammer
the op was asking if it was inappropriate not asking whether it violated the eulatos nobody is claiming the latter but a majority of people seem to believe the former
after reading the chat log of csm meeting 5 i believe the csm is due some congratulations that meeting was the first time ive seen the csm function in a manner free from unpleasant behaviour ive not been able to read the log from meeting 4 as ive not found a link to it so i dont know when the change occured or why but it has occuredso congratulations to all of you on the csm finally some light is seen at the end of the tunnel yes darius this if for you toobest regardswindjammer
the csm so far has done well lets see what comes out of it the coming meetings   i have a good feeling about it   
thanksim extremely happy about the recent development with csm i believe the rotating moderation is really showing its worth so i look forward to using this for the rest of the term
in actual fact meetings 124  5 have all been generally constructivemeeting 3 had the fun but even there all the real business was discussedfollowing meeting 3 several csm members made calls on ccp to clarify the role of the csm document in managing meetings the response from ccp made it clear that we were to set our own rules and procedures for meetings this combined with a general acceptance by all parties that we need to work constructively with each other as adults and equals has meant a change in attitude and a more sensible approach from pretty much everyone involvedseveral other commonsense changes instituted by jade post ccps feedback have also helpednamely rotating chair  the person introducing an issue now chairsmanages that section of the meeting therefore if youre going to act like a disruptive  in someone elses section you run the risk of having the same thing happening when you try and manage you own section  procudural discussions have been moved to aob at the end of the meeting when all issues have been discussedif someone does have issues with how meeting is managedchairs decisionsome other procedural point of order ccp has made it clear that we can raise it on the agenda of the next meeting when we can discussvote on it according to our own views of how meetings should run rather than arcane interpretations of the csm documenti have no doubt that at some stage we will have arguements over procedure again but hopefully with everyone acting like grown ups and not politicians trying to score points these can be sensibly resolved without gigantic biterness
yes i agree they are doing a really good job atm maybe they just needed to settle in a bit  shut up windjammer i am agreeing with dont be a toad  it looks like this crew is the crew that will define the csm and how it is operated for future reps good job csm crew
ive had epiphany you guys are slave labour for ccp you exsist so ccp doesnt have to wade through all the crap on the forums you should demand some sort of wage or recompense for your time tbh
actually ccp posted the first three meetings minutes a little while days back theyre not obvious but theyre on the left sidebar  csm is 6 below forums they need to fix up the filenames but theyre there
well duh p note however that cpp doesnt have to do that anyway public forums are usually largely ignored by developers there is no other way to stay saneone would hope that all candidates ran with the intention to put some effort into working for the greater good of the community  and cpp  
you dont think a free trip to iceland is a good enough recompensation i certainly think its more than what could be expected from volunteer work
i partially disagree with the opin regards of the csm work and the political bickering associated with it id like to point out that its in no way different from the political process you happen to encounter in real life politics if you have a tv channel dedicated to live feeds from parliamentarian debate like cspan in the us or phoenix in germany youd see that your lofty representatives there doesnt behave like adults at all in fact a typical parliamentarian debate usually its fair share of trolling and flaming at least in the controversial subjects  id recommend tax legislation and passing the budget debates for it    also bitterly flame wars on voting procedure speaking rights and other administrative procedures arent unheard of in real life politicsid be very wary of a parliamentarian body where everybody is hugs and kisses with everyone else if there arent differences in opinion there isnt a need parliament in the first place in light of this the csm hasnt done such a bad job indeed
you are right but not quite what i was on about  im all for people arguing over politics but my main concern is for example the corpalliance section in the old days 34 years ago that place was always a good read alliances acutally cared about the story behind the war hell we even had a cease fire over kicking tti out in the north now its just lets invade x space then smack them on the forums like it was counter strike another example is the annoying reply to a thread  2nd  im in a bob thread type rubbish  its just a reply to get a witty comment to boost there ego where it means nothing to the thread eve is a political warfare not a space counter strike sim im not very good at explaining my self but i hope it made sense ill probably get flamed but hey for those who were around i bet my last cookie they would of agreed
given that the whole complaint about you as chair was that you decided to silence people for no good reason anyone who requested that you be banned would be both an idiot and a flaming hypocrite you cannot seriously believe this if they were even amateur forum trolls thered be a whole lot more of them than the maybe 20 you see around these parts yes there are individual goons who are idiots any group of 5000 will have those especially if theyre from one of the various cesspools of the internet but to tar them all with one brush is about as silly as say limiting you to 50word posts drop the im so hard done by bull and the savage antigoon bigotry and get back to internet spaceships
yea but you have to understand is was a much smaller player base at that time also you know when you have a peak night of 2000 people online you have to know that there is a big fight on somewhere but you had the smack too it was not all about back stories and what not and some of those flames then were pretty much like they are now the only difference now however is you have a much bigger player base and a much larger crowd of trolls that is porportionate with the growth
any group of 5000 would be held accountable for the actions of their individual idiots if nobody in the group spoke out against them
actually ccp is a privately held corporation and as such are not required to release annual financial statements  balance sheet income sheet retained earnings statement statement of cash flows and other accounting terms that i havent learned yet   they have no obligation towards us and we have no obligation towards them except that which is set in the eula and terms of service
could someone post a link to the csm document in question thanksregardswindjammer
yes lets abandon it with the issues allready sent too ccpoh wait
csmpdf is listed under csm  meeting minutes  why its there i have no idea  
why not just have lavista post iti mean they wouldnt close a post by him would they

againstthe tank needs looking at but not the wepon systems  they are in line with the way they are supposed to work  choise of damage type   adding and subtracting slots is not the answer neither is removing the citadel launchers a solution if there is one that is needed has to work with the current ship

the point of this thread is not to suggest specific changes but rather to point out the huge disadvantage of minmatar capital ships the naglfar definitely needs a stronger tank and needs a significant dps upgrade and i think we can all agree about that even if we disagree on how to get therei highly doubt any issue will go through ccp exactly the way it is presented in the op
its tedious to set up one pos unless one pos is spam then your argument falls apartnor are the problems with pos warfare and those of putting up pos mutually exclusive you can indeed fix both
agree with twd what i hope comes out of this is that sov warfare as a whole gets revised its just antifun on so many levels
you really dont get it do youpos warfare and sovereignty are already being revised but thats going to take months and a major content patch to come about this is something that can be done now to fix a part of the game that is demonstrably broken and which can easily be countered to prevent pos spam this proposal does not preclude any other changes to pos logistics and i honestly cant believe that you havent worked this out yet

i wanted a method to let my settings be separate for each of my alts given the very different ship types they fly a save and load profile system would help my situation as well so thumbs up for me just a couple of suggestions to add1   include the default distance for orbit and keep at range in the profile2   allow load of existing profile while docked
make it so
so lets see it happen already
a good sugestion for a t2 version but personally id like to see a mini blockade runner something more in keeping with its t1 role which is basically a non combat vessel would be great for hauling small stuff into low sec and would give the traders and producers some reason to train frig 5
your post might be a little to late but as a logtiiscs pilot im all for this with fw it would be nice to fit in those gates phowever lets think outside the box here tarminic for one lets not make him tiny logtisics ship yet have them serve the same goal what the hell am i talking about well ill tell youpnew module remote resistance ampsbasically a module that increases the targets resistances stacking nerf of courseor not just an idea panother idea is to increase the mass 200 so that they dont go as fast but give them a 1015 reduction to sigradius per level maning they dont go fast but it takes a long time to lock them hmm i dont know about that one palso instead of 150 to range lets keep the long range to the cruiser put it down to 100 40km range for a frigates reps is awesome doesnt need to be 60kmeditfinal note it would be nice to see a hackingslavagingand mining frigate for these guys too you know to stay true to the role of the tech 1 hull oh wait right cruiser hull p nvm anyways a frigate with say 300 to mining amount but only one turret hardpoint and 300 to slavaging and such would be awesome

raise is bad removal of options is bad and the way the price raise was introduced was terrible
i dont care about a price increase as much as i do the utility of having 30 and 90 day gtcs as an option lets see how ccp responds we already know the csm is worthless this heavily supported topic will be a good indicator whether the csm raising issues to ccp is just as worthless
what he said give us back our choices
and fix the useurope price differences
clearly ccp are pushing ahead with their idea im thinking about not resubing in protest

not supportedif the damage mod is increaced then the clip size stays the same and rof goes down that means you get your alpha but the dps stays the same  you are supposed to have the lowest dps in the game   this i would support because its balanceif the clip size is increaced then the rof goes down and damage mod remain the same since reloading is balanced with rofif rof is increaced then the damage mod needs to come down and the clip remains the same  but this option makes it a gimped hybrid turretpick one not allas for capless  im sorry its a big deal you have high alpha  the hp boost affected everyone   and a good selection of damage types against armor tanked or armor hpbuffed  which is most ships in fleet   ships yes 1400s are subpar but they can too easily become too good the above selection is what i would work with which do you choise i would pick higher damage mod myself

if there were to be a bigger alpha the rof would be increased i think some of us may have been interpreting the wording differently rate of fire could mean to some the time inbetween thus making it higher makes the guns slower however i think you are thinking of it as a literal rate of which higher means faster firing anyway the general consensus thus far is either better tracking or a bigger alpha with a slower firing time the dps would thus remain the same
make the rof extremly fast and give it a 4 clip size this would be an alternative to more damage and slower rof it would then have high burst damage and need to reload or have high alpha and then a long time between shotswhy cant 1200mm be burst guns and 1400mm be high high alpha guns
i havent read every single post in this thread but one thing people ssem to be missing out is that min ships especially the bs are a little more flexible in thier tanking ability than other bs you have the option to go for an active shield or armor tank id like to see someone armor tank a raven although someone probably flies onemaybe this is why arties are missing the dev lovin atm
you can shield tank domis passive sheild tank them at that i fail to see the issue nobody is arguing that the guns should be more dps just that they need their alpha ability back so long term they are still the same gun less actually as there is no way to decrease reload time
the only tank a tempest is fitting with 1400s on is a hardcore tank of reactor controls
lies i for one fly a 1400mmgunned large shield booster mission pest mostly because a providence overtook me maelstorm on the gate once

inanna to me the main reason people would like the jump clone delay shortend even just an hour is that many of us have very limitedset hours that we can play so a 24 hour delay means that we may have to wait an extra day before being able to jump clone back whereas with a 23 hour delay wed be able to get much more value out of our time i do understand having a delay in to discourage hopping around new eden like a rabbit but like the align to button i think this change could make a big difference to quite a few peopleas to my view id like to see it get dropped back even just a single hour to 23 the idea for a skill sounds quite interesting as well and id support that to
lets turn off all skill training for one hour then because the regular eve day has 23 hours

so when you find such a belt you make twice the money you would in highsec and you find the riskreward ratio acceptable it seems to me then that the only problem here is the rarity of such belts  mineral prices are fine mineral usage is fine its just that lowsec doesnt feature enough of the valuable ores to sustain what lowsec miners would be willing to supply would that be a fair assessment
signed
yes butif you increase the supply of highend ore in lowsec you end up decreasing its value thus nerfing 00 and to a very small extent lowsec hidden beltsalso to gain access to those belts you need to spend significant amounts of time scanning down the belt  and training scan skills   akita t was only discussing freely available ore the one that can be found in standard belts and in that respect lowsec mining is exactly equal to highsec mining in iskhourid much rather see a very highyield veldspar roid in lowsec and 00 that gives 2x5x the amount of tritanium that normal veldspar givesdoing this will increase veldspar supply decrease its cost increase highend demand increase their costoverall a boost to 00 mining and to some extent lowsec mining as well
excuse me  have you even bothered actually reading the op  how about you do it now  how about this part  the issue is not so much the fact that something needs to be done but the fact that it needs to be done fastthis issue needs urgent attention no matter what the chosen alternatives are  because theres plenty  how can i say it in any other words and still be clear enough it doesnt matter which exact solution you choose  because for mineralsore alone i gave three separate sets of solutions  two common to both orerefined minerals and moon materials one set individual for each and the third set for minerals was a conglomeration of several possibilities too   heck there might even be other possible solutions too it only matters that its done sooner rather than later because its been broken for so long that some people  yes i am talking about you   almost consider it normalexcept that gneiss is a 00 ore not a lowsec ore if gneiss would be found in sufficient quantities in lowsec without exploration  which itself takes not only time and money in form of probes but also a significant amount of luck too   then yeah you would have a casethe fact he says he mines veld in 10 normally can only mean one thing  the lowsec gneiss mining thats most likely aduro protocol corp mining ops not something he actually bothers doing actively  ie search for hidden belts   so if somebody else in his corp finds this pocket of 00 ore in some lowsec  ie 00 rewards   a pocket where risks are lower than normal in lowsec  since its a hidden pocket not just the usual belt mining   they shouldnt mine it  and even that with higher rewards and lower risks than normal and it sounds as barely tolerable id call normal lowsec mining then pathetic at best
theres only one problem with that but then again the situation is all so completely fubar and ccps actions so counterintuitive lately that it makes little or no sense so you might as well do it  that supposed problem would be mineral flow in the initial specs highends were supposed to be exported out of 00  by a minority of miners   a good deal of midlevels were supposed to come from lowsec  by a few more miners   and highsec was supposed to provide most of the lowends  provided by a vast majority of miners  long story short  and its a long story   the system used to work reasonably well before the introduction of the drone regions  it wasnt very good but it sort of worked so there was no reason for any changes   but with a veritable deluge of highends from the drone regions the whole system collapsed in itselfand instead of having ccp fludizing lowend mineral transfers out into the areas that can useneed it what do we see  the exact opposite ccp nerfs lowend compression rates and nerfs hauling a lot of compressed lowend goodsso if they no longer care about people in 00 importing trit from empire oh to hell with them just introduce those uberveldspar asteroids  x2x3 in lowsec up to x6 even in 00   and be done with it case closed and im only being mildly sarcastic here
supported
high ends from 00 mining would still be exported but trit from mining would be more than trit from ratting in 00 which is the problem i ahve atm if you took current prices at a rough guess i am 7mhour in veld or around 3040m in 00 on ark if you made a 4x veld roid for 00 for 28mhour and a 10 roid in empire for arkonor at 3mhour we would still mine ark in 00 and veld in empire but at least would be getting more trit from mining than ratting again
thats the crux of the issue i really think most people have little to no clue just how much volume in minerals loot drops create both drone regions and mission runners elsewherea good mission runner or drone region user can actually outproduce a null sec miner in mid and high ends and to boot theyll be getting bounties and mission rewards as well they are also combat armed can stay in relative safety compared to a null sec miner as wellthats the crux of the issue why bother mining when the prices are held artificially low because of thisremove high ends and mids from loot and drone regions or at the very least reduce their amounts and youll take the first step towards fixing what is broken
by that same logic you could just make all the ores refine to 10x the current amount to fix the ratio across the board this would simply make the price of all the minerals fall but would eliminate or at least reduce the weird problems that mission loot and drone mins causebtw that is not my preferred method to try and fix this just saying it would greatly reduce the effect of the drone regions and mission loot as mineral sources as opposed to mining
ultimately something has got to give  if you want more mining done in lowsec prices will drop elsewhere you could go the route of adding new ores in lowsec of course if you believe in akita ts idea of how minerals should flow then youre going to want a better source of mexallon than plagioclase and a better source of isogen than omber in there and both should give far more tritanium than existing lowsec ore does nocxium is already best supplied from lowsec but with its price in the tank that means nothing and explains most of the reason why lowsec is bad right now if nocx were at its base price lowsec mining would be 2x as valuable as highsec   personally i prefer the simpler solution of making the lowend 00 ores available in lowsec via scannable belts it requires less screwing about and has less of a chance to break things inadvertently if you prefer adding new lowsec ores you could advocate for that and i wont oppose but my default play is a bit simpler than that im not in favour of removing the need for exploration  as i said above 00 ore in scannable lowsec belts seems like the right way to fix lowsec to me also id like to see some stats on the nocxium market because thats whats really destroying lowsec profitability and who is saying that they shouldnt mine it
the benefit of having higher quality roids in lowsec and null sec of the same minerals is that it still freely allows the market to control teh price of minerals it simply means that the same roid will likely be mined in low sec and null sec as in high sec  this is where the actual  balances come in and sec status bands   if in 1 region the 5 systems have a higher grade of omber that in most other regions requires 4 status to obtain then more people in region a will mine omber than in region b the same with other ores along the border zones of sec status no matter what though mining in low sec will be better once you cross a band to a better version of the high sec ore this allows the market free room which imho is working as it shouldedit also exploration should always be better than normal belts simply due to the extra time and cost of probes involved maybe these better roids have simply been missed this entire time and you scanned them down and profited
truth be told we all may just be spinning our wheels when it comes to changing roid size quality amount since it still is slated to eventually remove static belts and make all roids only found via exploration
it is wow thats stupid its not every day you hear a proposal that would remove the best income source for old players ratting   and brand new players who dont know how to scan   in one fell swoop
i believe the type of exploration mentioned in kazzacs post is the kind using the onboard scanner that doesnt require any skillsmodsetc
im referring to the fact that the player wont know how to do it not any issues about skill points
as your getting annoyed i thought a revist to the op was useful to refocus everythingeve has a free market that means cartels monolopies great profits artificial shortages and every other vice and abuse that can be conceived of thats a free market its call ecomonic warfare winner takes all im all right jack you sad loser no holds barred pvp its ok for an alliance to own every high end moon and set a price its ok to dump goods to reduce prices so others cant profit its ok to restrict supply thats the pointnature of the game do you agree with thatthat is the eve market its deregulated that means that we set the prices and thereby the reward and thereby profit marginamount contained in the rewardas the market actually dictates behaviour we expect ppl to concentrate where the greatest perceived profits are when they are exploited by too many people the price of the goods derived from the activity will decreace due to over supply this way we get high reward goods giving poor profit the reward is degraded by the activity thats the free market at work if a raw material becomes in short supply reward will increace and people will fulfill that demand when they perceive that the reward is high enough to provide the level of profit they wantits not broken its working as intended gluts of products must happen in a free market because of too many ppl entering the market segment as they perceive profit opportunity rewards and profit margins cannot be set in stone as that is not the nature of the games vision now as i said before if changes are made it will happen when tech 3 comes out as thats what needed to redistribute demand for the basic raw materials of production as it actually adds to the game experience on many levels and not complicate it needlessly because some ppl perceive and issue and panic as for veldspar and trit having a rising price its just an effect of lots of new production taking advantage of reduced cost of the other minerals due to over supply these goods will further erode the reward and profit will diminish as they enter the market placeagain reward does not equate to net profit the market will find its own level its a cold harsh world and its not ment to be fair or even
you will still be mining roid hot spots though

surprise surprise do i look like a caldari hater i am caldari for gods sake this character is at leastfor the speeds you are exagerating consider that a crusader  3 overdrives ii 1 nanofiber ii   with top speed of 7100 can orbit at 21km at around 5600 with acceleration control lvl 3 and navigation lvl 5 with an align time of 4 sec crows top speed with these skills is 6100  3 overdrives ii    align time 45   so when orbiting will be less than what you said maybe with top skills it goes up but who has top skills anywayalso here are many cases that an interceptor wont orbit so far away in small gangs that dont have the luxury of a rapier the interceptor may have to web so it will have to orbit closer so the orbiting speed will be lesser also you may pretend you are some expert crow pilot but if you orbit so far away you wont be able to scramble since the crow has no bonus in the warp disruptor unless you overheat but not many have that skill in any case its not always possible to orbit so far also because there is some possibitlity that the target manages to get out of your scrambling range so you may have to orbit closer just to be sure so i loged with this account to show you that even if you pass this change you will benefit me hate me as much as you like for being who i am  a guy that cares about game balance regardless of what suits him best you boost caldari i am happy you boost gallente i am happy you boost minmatar i am happy you boost amarr i am happy i happen to worry though for the player that has only 1 account and the changes may not make him so happy
this is the last time im feeding this troll1   my crow does 63kms 2x odii 1x nfii ac iv learn to fit crows2   interceptors tackling at sub 24km is fail my warp disrupter ii goes to 24km why on earth would i orbit at 21km3   if your crow goes to web expect to be counterwebed and instapopped by the vast majority of pvp targets you will engage4   if you want to orbit closer to ensure the target cant somehow juke scrambling be prepared to take a hit you would take it from most other turret based ships5   drakes dont have velocity bonus to missiles as gypsio stated those missiles wont even catch you once you break 55kms6   none of your points are relevant to this fix7   finally i dont hate you i hate your troll posts now leave
oh yeah well my crusader goes 7100 but still when it orbits at 21  3 overdrives ii 1 nanofiber ii   it doesnt go beyond 5600 perhaps if i had ac 4 could go a bit more but always that speed would be below the max possible speed so improbable your crow to orbit at its max speed as well because the way the game works nothing works at the exact nominal range for example one may have drone range 54km but if you are siting at 54km the drones will deny to attack you have to go down to 53km to actually fire them this from experience so you cant expect that you will orbit with that crow at 24km and that the crow will maintain that exact orbit at all times you need to leave some space to it lets not forget that your target isnt static and that will affect yopur orbit accuracy that is why you chose a closer orbit that the nominal for your disruptor there is no rule imposing that every ship wears always a webber at the mids let alone that it has happened before to be grabed in web by a deimos and still was unable to hit me with blasters probably because i was orbiting at 500 why should the cerberus have the insane advantage to pwn any ceptor in most cases irregardless of mwd or not i am prepared to take a hit but not be pwned with a couple of slavos as you try to make happenhow about cerberus cerberus with the rate of fire bonus makes around same damage as a drake and with velocity bonus with your upgrade will catch even ceptors travelling at 9km let alone that will be the ship that will pwn the nano cruisers even the average vagabond without breaking a sweat why should cerberus be so much upgraded because you happen to fly it they are but you fail to realise it blinded by your arrogancei dont hate you either i hate only your arrogant geekish posts nop i am not leaving
sounds good ive never used the things myself but i can see a boost when ones needed
also zaran the 30 damage was for a ship going about 4600ms your 5600ms sader will be taking minimal damage minimal also vagabonds can easily get over 10kms they arent going to be too greatly affected by this change its mainly the other nano cruisers that will have to start sweating  which is nice because honestly i doubt creodron had speed in mind when they built the ishtar  
just like nothing should outrun an inti in the ships department nothing should outrun a missle especially a percision missle
this belongs on the first page
although im sure there is scope for tweaking of the exact figures it is unquestionable that precision heavies need some sort of boost as currently they are worse than precision cruise in all pvp situations that occurand no more discussing pve in this thread please
this zaran troll fails hard in almost every possible way heavy precision missiles are not very good in pve they are extremely subpar for what you use them for in pve and youd be much better off using drones fortunately for you pve is very rewarding of terrible play and so you can get by even using atrociously bad tactics and fitsthat said obviously pve performance has 0 impact on whether or not something is balanced for pvp so im not sure why you even brought it up unless you wanted to firmly establish your noob credentials now moving onto the interceptors issue obviously you are terrible at fitting and flying interceptors or simply lack the skill points to do it 6kms should be considered a base speed for interceptors and it only goes up from there when you add in more epxensive implants and rigs and gang bonuses 12kms is routine as malvortex showed anything moving 6kms or greater is going to be virtually immune to heavy precision missiles  and dont forget the signature radius penalty for shooting heavies at interceptors and remember that the game will use whichever is least good for the attacker  so even if heavy precision had an explosion velocity of infinity theyd still do crap damage to interceptors because of their tiny sig radius but that wouldnt even matter because they couldnt even hit an interceptor in the first place as an inties speed is higher than the max velocity of heavy missiles shot by a drake  
its supposed to be able to counter nano ships thats the entire point of the vessel it cant right now because precision heavies are bugged and useless  arguably all explosion velocities across the board are too low but the heavy precision missile problem is undeniable  however it still wouldnt harm interceptors with heavy missiles because while the heavy missiles might conceivably be able to catch the interceptor theyd do almost no damage because the interceptor would be flying so much faster than their explosion velocity this is simply untrue see pulse lasers for example moreover consider that if the turret ship being orbited by an interceptor has a turret ship friend the turret ship friend can shoot and hit the interceptor from a decent distance away a missile ship orbited by an interceptor with a missile ship friend is helpless  you can go fast enough to be immune to all missiles shot by anyone on the battlefield thats hardly fair you should instead have to use some skillful piloting to outrun the missiles until they burn out

i agree t2 ammo needs some lovin with faction ammo giving  maybe   9095 of the damage without any of the drawbacks is there anyone who still uses the majority of the t2 ammo types some of the longrange types are still useful at times but the closerange ones are insert appropriate expletive here

i agree with this having run security its very frustrating to hear a can flipper is hitting an op in alliance chat and rush to the scene and not being able to shoot them it also prevents a mixed alliance defense bringing a pvp ship from more than one corp this is especially a problem when the can flippers are using this as a way to pick a fight they flip a can just to pop miners it makes a coordinated alliance response impossible the overwhelming majority of the risk is on the miners and very little on the can flippers the overall effect is to encourage people not to shoot back people just take the loss and end the op
we are early into the factional warfare age and as expected there are several quirks and bugs that present themselves as problems the most annoying and obtrusive i have encountered thus far is that when visiting allies in their space  in example my faction being minmatar and friends being gallente   those allies do not show up as blue much less as a more identifiable blue or purple star when visiting hostile factions  in my situation amarr or caldari   my enemies display as a red star visable on overview and in local so it would only make sense that allied factions display with an easily identifiable markerit should further be noted that while a ceo of a fw corp can set all of the allied factions corps blue they still cannot set the npc faction corp  tribal 24th fdu state protectorate   to blue and cannot be blue to the majority of the pilots in there proposal friendly factions should display with a blue star end to end

this could be easily solved by making the militias as an entity towards which standings can be set as a whole as it is people outside of the militias also suffer from this it is impossible to set militias to red or blue on one go but that needs to be done case by case  ccp response is works as intended so it is not a bug but a feature imo it is a sad feature though

there have been some threads on why some people do not like the current storyline while others do like the epicness of the storythis thread is not about thatthe story now is as it is thats what we have now periodthis thread is about the futurethe problemthere is one thing i want for the future something that was taken away recently and thats internal disagreement factions within the factions bickering that is the kind of stuff that enables great rp  its not the big disagreements with others its the small disagreements between the people that actually share most goals that makes people really feel for a groupif you have someone who disagrees slightly with you you will be able to actually develop the exact positions of your stance a group that mostly agrees but in parts goes the opposite way makes people really able to get emotional about somethingthis is what was awesome about a lot of the great storyarcs in evewhile clear distinctions  obvious blacks and whites unified sides etc  lend themselves to nice stories you can read its the small differences the small disagreements the compromises for a common enemy that make something enjoyable to live in and we are not reading eve we are living in itan examplelook at the minmatar story we have on the one hand the republic under midular and on the other hand shakor her opponent the defiants together with rp groups like electus matari and ushrakhan to support the respective groups both share goals  they want freedom for the matari  but they differ in the means in actually quite small understandings on what would be good for that goal and what would not bethis was awesome it allowed for great rp over five years now small differences within a faction having to unite against the common enemy but not really agreeing ask anyone who participated what the best aurora storyarcs were and you get the muritor arc listed among the best of them almost consistently this story arc gave lots of good rp to all people and that was not because it was a heroic guy going against the common enemy but because it was the tragic story about the small differences between groups who really share a goal boiling over and clashing togetheri hope to get something similar back eventually we have a war now we have to work together but we dont have to like it and the small differences really matterand while we can of course come up with our own small differences having them reflected in the official story is much more rewardingsome ideasccp and the volunteers have had great ideas in the past they will have more in the future these are just some ideas maybe others can add some more ideas toothe matari could have a propeace group and a progenocide group andor the tribes disagreeing on how to defeat the amarr how to free our peoplethe amarr could do with more bickering among themselves  the houses actually disagreeing not just going all hail jamylthe caldari could do with some opposition to heth thats not dying to an acute case of nyxthe gallente could do with the intaki being a bit more separatist about the war  im not really in the caldarigallente story so not sure about these ideas     tldri want bickering within factionsits the small differences within a group that make the group come alive that give you emotions about the groupits not the group being all united against the common enemy a joke as an example     
yep i agreethe conflicts that are completely unsolvable short of violence are interesting but only go so far look how predictable igs banter between the matari  the imperials getsconflicts that have you arguing but not to the point of shooting make for more interesting rp
it seems like a lot of the stories recently have been internal to an empire  the stuff about karin midular tibus heths takeover of the caldari state the stuff about the head of the 7th fleet getting sacked and all that i dont disagree with you on what we should see in future but i think youre being a bit harsh towards the recent past
all the stories have been about the empires uniting behind a single person heth has no opposition midular has voluntarily stepped back and everyone is united behind shakor the heirs of the houses of amarr all said they do not want the throne jamyl is great as an empress thats what i mean we get a story about the individual empires but theyre not about the differences within the empires but about how they put their differences behind them and unite behind a strong leaderwhich is a nice story but boring to rp 
maybe anything sold by npcs can reprocess into 1 trit
nah i dont want people losing control towers for 1 trit just because they misclick for reasons of user error lag or whatever   id rather have them not refine at all than have them refine for a token amount
except your rifter never was any of those things what the hell kind of argument is that anyway

not that i understood all of that but i agree with anything lavista says thats why i voted for him
seems to be a lot of guys dont like the new helios being based on the imicus hull ive always like it but some think its uglyso how about making it black matt black or flat black thatd make it sexy and youd still have the imicus hull
lol that was fast
i hope it would either be changed back to the old hull or imicus hull could be updated to something that doesnt look like a broken falice with a peg leg look at it from the front view if you doubt itdont get me wrong eve has gorgeous ships  hurricane nyx vexor and many more including my favorite of them all  the old helios and then it changes to this broken abortioni feel like just had an awesome night at the club brought home a beautiful girl had tons of fun with her during the night only to find myself in an uglycayote situation in the morningall in all if its a real problem to change it back i support  nay plead   changing it to black preferably nonreflective black to hide this eyesore in the short time it takes me to activate the cloak at least temporarily while i am training for buzzardi love you ccp you are one insanely talented bunch but this design is not one of your best angrymax  covops scout and industrial designer in rl  
indeed i would like it black i mean you cant be a cover ops operative if yo ugo around like a carnival samba dancer please change it do black
black could be betterbut the truth is that imicus hull is just plain uglyits like a fist in the faceand first time i saw it my first thought was omg they ruined it
make it pink
i support this black would be way better
i like the imicus hull
i almost always like black
isnt the color scheme of a ship dependent on the corporation responsible for its development iirc creodron has greenish ships so it would be in line with the standard color scheme granted it looks ugly as sin but thats what the cloaking device is for
i honestly have no idea why creodron makes the helios anyway duvolle  blackgoldish   or roden  blackred   would be nice
the imicus is a drone carrier
bumpi edited and modified a better concept in my first post
while i support  strongly support   renovating the player bounty system i feel your idea still leaves room for both grief and as far as i can tell self collectionself collection is the biggest flaw with the current system if i put a 100 million isk bounty on player a whats to stop player a logging on an alt  or enlisting a friend   podding himself and pocketing your money himself at the moment nothing its this reason why no sensible player would ever put a bounty on their enemys headdoes your system control for this is there any reason why if i have a bounty put on my head i cant simply find a friend with the required skillstandings and have him pod me so we can split the cash if not it hasnt fixed anything much
while novel it opens even more avenues for abuse than the current one doesno support here
more please explain the only problem is already out and its already in the current bounty systemthe problem is the multiple accounts players i really dont know what to do about it there is no way to trace the difference of an account to another ingame unless you know the guy its true that one can get all the necessary to be a bounty hunter in one account and be a criminal in the other its the same as one macro mine in one  or multiple  account and buyssell free gtc with isk or for money i can also add it to the fw one is in the gallentean militia and the other in the caldari same for alliances one in bob and the other in goon you get the pointhaving multiple accounts can bring lots of exploiting its not just about the bounty system this problem is in the eve online game core itselfcontinuing about the ideaabout the ask a friend argument its true and its already there what is coming up to me is1you cant claim a bounty from a member of the same corpalliance 2with the high standings needed with concord and in sec status it slims the chance to find a friend that has all the requirement
the proposed system not only leaves self collecting open it also leaves it open for grief abuse that bypasses security checks and or wardecs etcimho any bounty system should go straight into the ccp coffers as a sink and the amount of isk on ones head increases the amount difficulty and how low into sec status faction navies will spawn to kill you the amount of your bounty is reduced by every pop and could be based on a number of things like ship value etcthe spawns give no loot nor salvage nor bounty and the higher difficulty ones will spawn support frigates for scram nos etcand for players to collect on bounties they have to be in a bounty corp much like fw for instancejust ideas mulling in my head
yes it bypass security check and wardec the guy is a bounty hunter he bought a license to kill and collect a bounty he shot anything else that is not hostile or bounty he losses sec status license and rights to be a bounty hunter it should be a severe penaltyalso i dont think it should be mixed with militia or fw etca bounty hunter is like a independant concord agent npc dont deal with bountys players do
thats the problem door is wide open for lots of grief
ah so to counter this grief a creation of some kind of bh npc corp that would be run by concord and to be a bh you need to be in that corp could be a one time join if he quits no more bounty hunting for him
sorta the idea obviously does not eliminate alts but it would reduce spur of the moment griefing the proposal opens up
worst idea i saw
not constructive  navigator
so  person a initiates a vote person b is afk and no one in the station can do anything until person b has voted
sounds good thanks for detailing the idea
why would your timer be based on time spent logged in is there anything else in eve that follows this logicwhat would stop alts from accepting the contract and podding their mainsits a nice idea and your system for it isnt bad but it doesnt address whats mainly wrong with the bounty system  self claiming it  
just seems to be far too many ways to exploit it and whats wrong with taking out contracts on the  big guys seems a bit bias
thanks for the support it really does look as though this forum was thrown together in a few hours work and im not very impressed with it
throughout 00 there are offline poses scattered everywhere the effort required to destroy these outweighs the benefits  often theres none   so they sit there forevermy suggestion is that offline poses unanchor after a week so that anyone may come and scoop them
simple post really the last player video added to the eve video channel was the day of darkness video and unless there is some issue with it i feel like clear skies it just too awesome for them to not host the video on the download pagethis would help free up the guys using their bandwidth for us to download the movie i mean thats a lot of bandwidth thank you guysi know this isnt a csm issue per say but hell this is the only forum where we can tick supportso do you think its worthy
not seen that other video you mention but clear skies used imagery from another game as well didnt it probably some stonking copyright issues right therehowever it does present both graphics engines in a pretty favourable light so im sure something could be worked out   
signedthat movie is the best advertisement for eve ever
please visit your user settings to reenable images
had clear skies used nothing but eve ingame footage i would have to say that i agree as it does not i think that it does not belong on the official video page
no i dont see why ccp needs to support this
it was a good video and all but it is not a ccp product
its always nice to see devs posting in various threads on the forums but sometimes it can be difficult to locate them if they are hidden in 16page threads i know that there is a dev finder but it doesnt seem to list every dev post madei think a change like this would be simple and very helpful
me likey
if you have a look at evemon and add as many skills that use charisma as possible you will find that it only suggests presence v at about 24 million skillpoints worth of charisma using skills or about 483 days worth of training it seems that this is the case with the other rank 3 learning skills at level 5 it seems a complete waste of time to spend over 2 weeks training a skill which has virtually no practical usedecrease the length of rank 3 learning skills time or just perhaps demote them to rank 2thoughts
how is it bad how it is if you think youre going to stick around for 2 years you can train it if not give it a pass
for presence 5 actually to be useful  useful being cutting out 1 day and 19 hours   you need to train every leadership skill to 5 and every social skill to 5 culminating in 483 days 23 hours 47 minutes and 57 seconds with my learning skills already on a blank account that would take a much longer timeafter 484 days who cares about 1 day and 19 hours and besides who is going to spend 484 days training every leadership and social skill
youre assuming that the devs will never release another skill that requires charismahowever i would not be surprised if some new charismaoriented skills showed up in say ambulation
is this a case of the learning skills taking too long or a case of charisma being an underused attribute
level 5 of rank 3 learning skills not being timeeffective
ok so we have been given the ability to filter out drones wrecks fleet ships militia ships cans etc from our overviews but how about the ability to remove them from our view entirely this would decrease lag a great deal if the server was not having to send the location of every wreck can and drone to pilotsafter this upgrades can be then made to the system such as filtering out ships for example an option that allows a specific pilot not to be shown to your screen this would help in fleet ops by removing all unnecessary ships from your screen reducing fleet op lag a lot less strain would be on systems if they didnt have to load things on the grid that have no use to themor instead of having to load the physical representation of the object in question just having the symbol flying around this way the model doesnt need to be loaded only the location of the objectand how about the option to lower the range at which models are shown so that people with slower systems can reduce what they see to a 100km radius
not a bad idea but cant we already effectively do something very like this by zooming all or most of the way out only the very biggest ships models are loaded and everything else is just dots and icons if youre in a situation with zillions of things on the screen at the same time chances are youre navigating by the overview anyway
it wont decrease lag because the system will still have to send it to you  you wont be able to fly through ships just because you turned them off also isnt this what bracket filters do already
i thought graphic filters are for the overviewand the system will still have to send you the location of the model just not the model itself
the model itself is stored on your hard drive  graphics is dealt with locally and a couple patches ago they brought in bracket filters  screw around in your overview settings youll find them basically for each overview tab you can set up what displays on your overview and what displays in space separately the latter defaults to everything of course but that can be changed its not something ive used since theres nothing id prefer not to know about the existence of   but this is my understanding of how it works
we can give our support to a topic with the thumbs up that you see therebut how about a thumbs down for those who disagree entirely with the decisionalso it would give forumers a way to abstain in a topic something well known to those in csm closed
this thread has been up for a month on the same topic its a good suggestion but its a duplicate
at the moment the caldari far outnumber the gallente or the minmatar especially with the support of the amarr however the sides would be a lot more even if there was a chat like the militia chat but allied militia this would make the sides a lot more even in terms of pilot numbers as well as current victory pointsas a counterpoint however we may want to keep the factions seperate so that 600 player fleets arent conceived some of us like myself play eve on a laptop and although it is a very powerful laptop it does struggle to cope with 1200 moving ships as well as the dronesnot to mention the strain on the serversnot sure about this one myself what do you think
the sheer number of caldari pilots did make me wonder if fw participation would be lopsided does anyone have a tally of the number of pilots aligned with each factional militia if caldari  gallente but  caldari  amarr     gallente  minmatar   then this is definitely a good ideait seems to me that 600pilot fleets engaging each other on the same grid seem somewhat unlikely to me given the way factions claim victories
we are still waiting for the live dev blog which was scheduled for release just after the release of empyrean age heck we are still waiting for the we will keep you informed statement to be fulfilledthere has been no blog information announcements or even an explanation of what the problem ishow hard can it be to get a bunch of people together to answer a few questions
please allow me to refer you to the chat logs of the third csm meeting
touchUFFFDi did actually realise what i was saying just then it was a sort of stab at the csm
oh absolutely im not saying they should ignore big issues they could even mostly focus on those if they wanted im just decrying the apparent decision to stay away from small issues
agreed i dont see how an entire races capitals being terrible is a small issueespecially when they are already going to the csm about large autocannons
with the introduction of fw and the coming of ambulation i thought it might be a good time to introduce a content idea that hasnt been presented to the csm yet as far as i can tell the imminent ambulation release gives it a new twist and it has content applications for fw 00 hisec losec and would greatly enhance several aspects of the existing gamethe concept is simple a very hard to find player minibase ill outline a possibility of how it might be implemented and let others take it from there for the most part1   five roids from very small to very largea  they appear at random and only a specific number allowed in any systemb  they would require a serious and skilled effort to findc  the smallest is the easiest to find and the largest the hardestd  they are in deep space only and never close to existing spatial objects2   once found the following would ensuea  you may anchor something like a mission habitat around it that has stealth pointsb  dependent on the size of the roid it could have limited pos modules anchored to itc  once you fill your quota of modules you may activate the stealth component of the habitatd  it can now not be found according to the ratio of module stealth points to stealth emitter strength3   while operating the following could functiona  the habitat could function as a private ambulation pointb  the roid modules could be used in a normal fashionc  the roid would have a ship storage capacity in line wsized  its detection would open it to attack by anyone who finds ite  the smallest might support a small covert squad or equivalentf  the largest might support a black ops wing or equivalentg  fuel required to operateh  ships dockedstored undetectablei  no effect on sov etcetera4   if discovereda  it becomes subject to local system security and responseb  if all modules are reduced the owners may mine out the roidc  once the roid is gone a new one of equal class is spawned elsewhere5   potential usesa  covert opsb  smuggler or pirate denc  fw forward based  logistics pointe  ghost travel network  if jump bridge or mini jbridge allowed  f  hangout for those in the know  if ambulation is possible  comment there are many ways this could be useful and im pretty sure all the mechanics  except ambulation atm   for an implementation already exist in the game in the interest of being as brief as possible i have not commented on many other uses benefits and elements of just plain fun somethng like this could add to the game im sure others can up their voices on that scorethis only outlines a possible implementation others may well have a better way to do this or additionsthe habitat im referring to is the one you find in missions that has the scrolling billboard on it maybe they would even let us customise the billboard
thats the rats in fw complexes  where u r capturing thingies to take eventually control of the system  
blue you fool
yesh
please think about those people with red  green colour blindness  make it editable
anarchy
csm does seem to think its a law unto its own at the moment lets hope things sort themselves out quickly
the csm members were elected partially based on what topics they said they would put forward to the council if elected i say partially because im sure some voted due to knowing them personally rather than because of the specific issues the number of votes that took place during the actual csm choice stage far outnumbers the votes that have been put forward for any issue in this forum  approximately 10500 votes for the csm elected positions compared to approximately 2500 for the top 15 issues on this forum   some of the csm members promised that they would raise particular issues and im sure that more people would be whining that the issues they voted for in the election were not brought up if it was the case than the number who are whining in this thread about issues that apparently havent been voted on in this forum being brought forward if you look at any government the people vote for those who will bring forward or represent the issues that they feel are most important then there can be personal interaction  writing to your mp in the uk   or major protestsetc against those elected if there are a large number of people who feel a particular way which the government appears to disagree with  eg demonstrations against war in iraq in the uk   this forum is comparable to these protest measures in order to get issues into the focus of the csm the csm can choose to ignore it if they wish or bring it up at the csm meeting unless the 5 rule kicks in this seems a fair system to me and generally quite comparable to major governments even though it is more like an advisory body to the main rulers  ccp  
i support this
you said a mouthful
quite eloquent
the most well thought out proposal yet seen on the csm forum
not supported i dont really see how what the op describes is a nerf nor do i see how the change is in any way significant if every tiny thing were noted in the patch notes theyd be incredibly long personally i find them quite long enough as is and would not welcome a huge number of inconsequential notes burying the ones that are somewhat significant and the ones that are truly significantregardswindjammer
if they listed every single little change it would be near impossible to read the patch listhurrah o
think of it as1   concord have changed their policy regarding their automatic notifications2   police in the real world are not required to send a memo to every member of the population when they change policy3   deal with it major changes yes i think should be on the patch notes but they are long enough as it is changes like we have adjusted the way in which asteroid field spawn on average this results in an additional 0037 veldspar asteroids in any given field or for that matter the concord thought police have started to take a more preventative stance on crime and will now issue warnings to all about to engage in criminal activity i can live withoutgames can be too predictable  i prefer to find out things on my own than be spoonfed every little change ahead of actually experiencing it
truly hideous idea  so terrible in fact itll probably get used
i dont know how this would even be feasible to implement
how exactly would multiple people shooting at the same spaceship reduce incoming damage
makes the strong stronger and removes one of the major advantages you can get with less sp a bigger gang
no iirc ccp didnt want you to be able to directly generate more isk out of thin air with skills
we all know pos shooting isnt fun when you are steamrolling an alliance but it is still more fun then being support whose job is sitting on the gates waiting for someone daft enough to jump through i feel that small ships should have an important role in taking down a system even if it is a niche rollsolutionchanges to cynojammers cynojammers and jumpbridges can only be anchored around the sun of the solar system only one of the two can be anchored so an alliance will have to choose which one the system will have this also gives different systems different strategic valuescynojammers can only anchor large guns with poor tracking and have a damage bonus so that it makes attacking a cynojammer in anything bs or larger suicide thus the only way to take it down is with smaller ships we count 30 rebel ships lord vader but they are so small that they are evading our turbolasers well have to destroy the ship to ship get the crews to their fightersthis will also give smaller alliances with small capital fleets a better chance of defending their space and it will mean that the smaller ships in the attacking fleet are directly contributing with the system takedown cynojammers would also have to prevent people from cynoing out of a system so that defenders cant just capital blob the attackers with no risk or make it extremely difficult to turn on and off cynojammers
csm is already proposing changes to sov warfare gtho of this forumnot supported
sweet can you hear the epic whining when the cruiserbc fleet gets doomsdayed into submission
agreed itd just be funny and yet sad to see someone collecting the immense amount of minerals for a dreadtitan then the tech 2 version especially if it failed
i voted for ank with one of my characters and torn soul with the other im happy with both  ank has been a pretty awesome secretary so far and just because torn soul got voted just outside the alternate list doesnt mean i regret the vote her platform was right for whichever one of the characters it was that voted for her and id vote for her again   
im not sure if this should go in here but here goesas the 30 an 100 day cards have been removed people who like paying with isk the play the game by getting the cards from other people cant do it without paying lots or iskhow about a way of paying isk to eve it selflike a standard rate for different amouts of time an this could go into the lottary or something like thatwhat do you think
the whole point of the gtcs is a legal way to buy isk with rl money a way that lines ccps pockets with money and probably isnt going to change
how old is inanna zuni seriouslyyou remind me of politicians who like to sit on the back bench and  about thoes in the lime light yet if you cannot handle yourself in a mature fashion in your current state i sure as hell would not want you near any kind of position of powergrow up and stop your pointless and self destructive campaign of distaine for jade which is self evident in so many of your postings and the way you say it you dont have to go out looking for trouble its going to find you
haha this is ridiculous jade your in a position of authority grow up you cant just go blatently saying that you dont like a certain player and wont listen to them because they are affiliaded to a certain alliance or corp why dont you just go one step further and say you hate the amarr  wow everacism   imagine if the prime minister of whatever country said that he didnt like black people or people that he wasnt going to listen to christians hed be a little screwed whether that title actually means anything apart form a shiny little forum thing under your name is for people to decide however sort your life out and be more discrete with your opinions regarding the biggest alliance in the game and a large chunk of the player base
sorry only just read this properly mate if you feel this way resign you obviously should not be in any kind of authority ever goons are a big part of the game and simply because they outnumber every other alliance by double means that you gonta respect them as they must be doing something right if they have those numbers that means they are the most popular alliance in the game when the star fraction hits the 5k mark then you can start saying things like why doesnt jade like goons ask yourself truly what is there to likeyes i dont like goonslive with itsaying stuff as above is either a massive cry for attention or the best way to get yourself zero respect from the eve player base and alienate the people you are trying to represent
always these comparisons goons are neither a race nor a religion they are far more comparable to an organization like scientology which stands for certain ideals  or not   they may be the largest alliance but they still only make up a very small share of the player basesome will agree with jade and others will not that is really all there is to it of course everyone is free to speak their mind about it  people tend to do that in politics       but its not appropriate to speak for the entire eve population or to claim a general moral high ground
wow sorry im not going to post anymore because reading around it looks like jade just doest give a 5hit jade stop posting for about 45 days then post on one of these threads something likeim appologise for any misconceptions i have my own personal opinions however i will representat all opinions by every entity within the eve community to the best of my abilities regardless of the alliance they are in respect begates respect mate and if you dont humble yourself a little then your destroying alot of time and effort ccp have put into csm embaressing yourself and them by delegitimizing the very aim of the csm scheme csm is relatively new and needs to gain the trust of the people before it is able to say that it speaks for the people whos to say that you wont start hating kia or mm next youve got to be objective now that you are in authority hit me up in game if u wana chat further about this
six of the nine csm members met in person today and walked into the ccp offices for an initial chat it went well and nobody killed anyone else there may have been a moment or two where this was in doubt but it passed tomorrow we will be getting down to the first day of discussions on the topics  raised by pilots  which we are bringing to ccp and the devs for their response inanna zuni the other three members are en route and expected here shortly their flights were due in only during the last hour  
i dont think anyone brought up eve tv   including mebah well i wont douple post ill leave my idea about eve tv hereok the reason why ccp didnt have it downloadable for money was the fact they didnt want people stealing it however the novel is coming out ad i give it 2 weeks untill a pdf comes out why because there are groups of noneve players that do this my point ccp needs to look at eve tv the same way you would look at a novel you can make it downloadable or have an optional high rez pay for download or downloadable extras sure peopel will steal iit and torrents will fly but the people donwloading these torrents wouldnt of paid for them anyways hell i dont mind 2 a week i just want a copy of what i pay for in other words a free versions of eve tv and a longer higher rez versionust like the novel it will be stolen you cant get out of this fact welcome to the internet however everyone that can spare a buck or 2 a week will and the rest will watch eve tv with ads which is a little cashso im sorry for the rant but maybe i dont know it just had to be brought up unless im missing something and it was brought up   ps another idea for eve tv would be to let the embeded reporters get a spot on the show for the fw reportsalso there is nothing wrong with releasing only one episode a month
they do speak out against the  posters
this isnt terrorism or anything else of that sort where itd be the duty of an innocent member of a group to speak out against someone who does evil in their name its forum stupidity nobody has a duty to speak out against forum stupidity
i just cant understand all of these pointless whines about csm i personally think that they are doing at least decent jobbtw are there any  active   mmo forums that doesnt have any whiners
peter should be chair  he created the whole thing
i completely agree minmatar capitals need looking into especially the naglfar
pretty cool idea
agree with the topic of this threadi didnt look into the proposed high meds lows layouts but minmatar caps need more useful boosts naglfar isnt the best damage dealer anymore not the best tanker it can do both but not great at itnaglfar is still win when you look at it from a dread is better than no dread if naglfar gets more damage boost  more called as primaryid like to see 75 shield boost bonus per level and 3 turrent slots with 75 rate of fire bonus this would move it out to maelstrom platform from split system of typhoon platform and make more useful now if you want really want it to kick ass give it 4 turrent slots nidhoggur is a logistics carrier but whatever bonuses it gets doesnt make it a kick ass logistic carrier if it was boosted to be a better logistic carrier it would be primary means that it needs a better tankedited to give support to this thread
nidhoggurhow to make it a kick ass logistic carrier50 capital shield and armor transfer range per level boost  15 bonus to shield and armor transfer amount per levelbonus 30 to 50 to all armor resistancesthis way it can actually do some kick ass repping fit cap recharger in the mids and decently armor tank because it will be called primary
the naglfar def needs looking at nidhoggur maybe
hey genius when i started eve i played about a month  month and a half  and then i had to quit for personal reasons i cant leave the npc corp and join a real one when i am not playing can i 
oh yes that would help so much good idea
this came up in conversation last night with devs there will be a number of this type of issue which might do so  and yes i support this especially since the increased complexity of settings available since the tabbed overview  iz
thanksbtw your sig is very disturbing to me i find it deeply unsettling in ways i cannot explain

windows is a thing of the past proper 64bit linux allows me to use the computer without distractions  vistas constant popup  dialog hell cough cough   more efficiently and more conveniently please give us a proper native 64bit linux client with premium graphics and all consider abandoning the windows as well while at it   
singed more information please
 suport from me toi have been using various versions of eve under linux now for over a year and have found that the 058 of wine works perfectly for me with premium graphics but that still dont take away from the fact that ccp need to keep us informe
supporti run eve fine enough to mine on linux but i wouldnt consider risking a boat in a mission every time i return to station to dump my load i change res and change back just because it seems to help refresh the graphics glitches i getsound also

i support the idea but take exception to the individuals that suggest that the beast have no fittingswhat is the point of that i understand you are trying to make it look gimped as to not raise the ire of the omg op hauler crowd that is sure to pop up you think this will make ccp more apt to add it they have not done that with any other new ship classtype i dont see that they would be interested in starting that nowwhy not just a normal layout haluer with a greatly improved cargo bay at the expensive of even crappier agilitymass compared to the regular t1s that is gimped enough they would still be easy prey for pirates even more so as theyd be slower to jump than a normal t1 indy to sweeten the pot they carry a lot more stuff so more profit to be made by ganking them or finding them in low secin the end i think the new skill required to fly it the added mass and reduced agility and the fact that its a fatter higherrisk venture are plenty of drawbacks without taking off fitting slots to bootjust my 2 isk  adjusted to 3578 isk because i live in the us  
why transport ships and not racial hauler that would make this ship like tech 3
we love you guys 3
woot a response is on the waybtw people should really read the op its not a thread asking for a skill q system its asking for a response to the issue of a skill q systemfor which i support

man that has bothered me since i started playing this game
i think the perfect inelasticity in the rare moon minerals at high demand is a real problem in the real world there are very few commodity goods that have this profile the only one i can think of is the european markets for carbon credits with their hard caps on total emissions per countryi cant think of a natural commodity that has this restriction gold for example doesnt as the price of gold increases new deposits and the remnants of old deposits become economical to mine this introduces a modest amount of elasticity into the market in modern mines a variety of resources are generally extracted not just the one that the mine is open for so for example the differences between copper gold lead molybdenum and silver mines  a common grouping of elements in western us mining   often are the relative concentrations of these elements in the ore a number of uranium mines usually have other raw materials in useful quantity  coal and radioactive decay products of uranium and thorium for example  i favor the introduction of ways to extract at these trace amounts of minerals maybe even have some present in high sec space im think random amounts about 110 units per hour  with the appropriate mining array   for one or more moon minerals per moonthen on the production side it makes no sense that designs continue to use rigid amounts of minerals there are a number of ways cheaper materials get snuck into real world goods akita seems to have a good way to simulate that effect in eve i approve of it

i saw what nos nerf contribute to do at tempestand it several dismantled amarr recon now is the time to do sometingin italy we say that after some time a problem starts smellingmeh 100 suport this request fix the amar recon asap
option 2 sounds nice
yes i approve of this btw the plural of bonus actually is bonuses  
please this is stupidsince when does being part of an rp brothel disqualify jade from leading the csm
as a fat balding 28 year old man i feel i speak for all of eves core demographic here roleplaying brothels are strange and not a little disturbing to me and i feel it would be but a short step towards that terrible vision that haunts all of us being forced to don a fursuit and serve scantily clad transvestites hand and foot we would be forced to cater to their every desire no matter how degrading i cannot bear to think of it even at night it haunts my dreamsand now the nights are drawing inplease dont leave me alone here with my dreams
the balance point iscerberus should be able to hit a vaga but cause minimal to 0 dmg on an interceptorthe problem with this concept is that a vaga in orbit goes at speeds close to interceptors and inties with mwd turned on has the signature of a cruiserso a little tweak to that could be something like the explosion velocity getting a bonus when hitting targets with sigs larger than the missile itselfthis would be an indirect boost to tp as well 
why should vaga but not cerb be able to kill interceptors
agree jade is wrong to nerf mining barges and force peeps to fit missile laucnchers to tempest
ok thats nice that you have borught to ccps attention is ccp doing anything about it didnt think so
the election where held the csm is chosen you do not get to vote in your rep in the election and vote out mine afterwards
try reading the op and the rest of the thread this has nothing to do with voting anybody out of the csm
giving this a thorough bump because invicta and factional warfare have done me the good service of proving me right
agreedpersonally i believe that the design of webbers and mwd are at the heart of the issue and addressing them will solve all of the problems with overprevalent nanoships and at the same time leave a role for them where appropriate
supported im not clear about whether it is speed massagility  nyphur wrote a very interesting piece on it see
i am glad that this issue is finally being raised in the assembly hall it is a top balancing priority such as nos ecm and damps were before i cant see why the hell it has not been adressed yet
sure but the speed these new afs would reach is not enought to fully speed tank and no reduced signature is another thing that counts

oh do iwell allow me to retort using words of more than one syllablelets looks at the skill caldari industrial trained to level 5this opens up three classes of ship freighters jump freighters and transport shipsfreighters caldari get the charon the largest freighter in the gamejump freighters caldari get the rhea the largest jump freighter in the gametransport ships arguably not the greatest but with a bit of thought can be made to perform their function adequately enoughcaldari have the 2 best heavy movers in the game but are lacking in the transport department they cant have it all but with a bit of thought nearly canand as for the argument  sorry james   that the squire uses slot 6 and thats where my snake or nomad omega goes well thats just ridiculous what do you want your cake and eat iteve isnt easy and nor was it meant to be so no the crane does not need more grid just more thought fitting itand before you ask i fly the charon the rhea and of course the crane and bustard

i support this for both gang and alliance members at the moment the mechanics are heavily stacked in favour of flippers and so what if flippers cant see whos in the gang they should have to take a risk on that in the same way that anyone attacking another player does as somebody said the problem is that flippers dont want pvp they want risk free easy ganks
i dont know why i missed this before butthere are no good ores in lowsec or rather tritanium is worth so much that veldspar is worth more than any other ore in all of empireas for 00 well i suppose thats doable but i dont expect anybody wanting to go to somewhere pirateful in lowsec tbh it just seems like bad business
no that completely gimps piracy if someone were to steal from 1 lone miner they then have to contend with 1001000 potential alliance members which is just absurdgang members absolutely not since you have no idea who you just stole fromif you cant figure out how to work the game mechanics properly when can mining then dont do it there is already ample allowances for defense if you know what youre doing

yeah theyre united now but there was a good few months of bickering and discontent before the new rulers got installed in astoundingly hamfisted fashion of course but still   i expect the pendulum will swing back the other way at some point i agree that it should as well but it doesnt have to be all internecine strife all the time

captials are pushing out sub capitals because everyone  sooner or later   will be able to fly them the first thing a new player wants to do is train for the biggest baddest ship of course years of experience in eve teach them otherwise but that is everyones initial feeling when they first start playing eve with skills training converges to everyone being able to do everything given enough time the real question is why not be in a dread when it gives so much boost to the ego if nothing else further anyone who actually stayed in eve long enough to fly dread and fly it well wont really want to be in anything else also if sub caps are being crowded out thats only because new players arent joining fast enough to fill the lower ranks the higher the tip of the pyramid the more base needed to support it and players just arent joining fast enough to fill that base if anything ccp needs to do a better job of getting more new players unless they dont think their tech can handle it d
my argument is that the rifter is much prettier and cooler to look at and i would prefer useful minmatar t2 frigs with rifter hulls i do not like the design of the slasher and i would prefer the ceptors to be changed to awesome rifter hull plenty of minmatar pilots would agree with me on thatthe op clearly stated the only reason why it should be reverted is because the maulus has a prettier frigate hull than the imicus hull and a lot of gallente pilots agree
changing it back would wreck consistency they should make a totally new model to replace that of the imicus and helios
i support this if nothing else swap the maulus and imucus models then give the old helios backi had to sell my helios because it was so fugly and waste 10 days training for a cheetah
ive been flying the maelstrom a bit now and i think it could use some help seems there ships arent quite up to par as the other races ships at bs size and up as i have read from the different forums and now experiencing myself while bc and lower they have some of the best ships
this is something ive been saying since they changed the model the black waqua lights imicus in the clasic client is much better looking than the greyblue imicus or greygreen helios at the very least use the color scheme from the lachesis dark graycrimson
black is whack yo
black ops needs tweaking yes but giving them the covert ops cloak is just wrong all of a sudden you create ships that are way out of whack
it seems like this does nullify the popular vote stand down if that is your choice but the popular vote should matter for something impeachment should be a possibility as well this is kind of like asking the people to vote in a congress and then letting the congress pick the president either that or the counsel should act like a jury grab an odd number and let each of them represent a single voice  dru
sometimes i like to read what people have to say about an issue before i decide to lend it my support or not if its really that big of a deal then it can require two clicks to confirm a vote but theres no reason for this clutter
we need a vote yes or no thing with a count at the beginning of the thread no reason to waste db space on a bunch of empty posts
this could be said for dreadnaughts as wellthe capital class ships all reqiure racial battleship v of which you choose however there is no bonus associated with that as there is with other t2 shipsa minimatar inty gets 5 to small samage and 75 to rof for each level of minmatar frigate and then 5 sig reduction  5 warp disruptweb rangethe panther which is a t2 bs that requires bs 5 gets 5 rof and 5 dmg per bs levelso my request isinvestigate requirement for racial bs v and add an appropriate bonus for it otherwise remove free timecard we have to pay you just to fly a capital ship
its not a bs so no bonusesand carriers get bonuses for carrier so thats a no
then whats the point of the requirment other than to milk money from you its worthless
its for balance by forcing capital pilots to train their racial bs v ccp reduces the number of capital pilots making those pilots rarer and more valuable to corporations and alliances as it should be the bonus for a capital pilot training bs v is that you get to fly capitalsunless theres a game balance reason why a given capital ship is not adequately performing its mission profile ships shouldnt be given arbitrary buffssorry no support
so basically you are saying that it should take bs 4 to get itno teh next size ship like frig 4 is prereq to cruiser and cruiser 4 is prereq to bs i can certainly see why frig and cruiser v as prereqs seems a bit harsh could you explain what your preferred level is and why you fell it is too high a little more i think i can see your point but before i thumb you i want to be a litle more certain
this is kind of like asking why a cruiser doesnt get a bonus for having the frigate skill a carrier is not a tech 2 battleship different classes of ships dont carry weight forward from the previous class
its a requisite not a relevant spaceship command skill this would be like complaining that racial cruiser skills dont help your battlecruiser or racial industrial skills dont help your freighter and speaking as someone who is probably going to be training capitals in the next several months i wouldnt want it reduced capitals arent supposed to be for the faint of heart or the low of sp the perfect battleship pilot takes a billion isk and a month to qualify for capitals and thats about as it should be
if you think bs 5 is bad the other required capital skills jump drive op 5 jump drive cal training for siege mod etc etc will kill youits supposed to be an elite ship leave it as is
capitals arent tech ii battleships

no takers
its a relatively simple proposal but having a nonportrait style to the names in local like there is to the chat would be great it would allow a lot more people to be seen at a time and you wouldnt have to worry about pictures loading and distracting you the symbols for allegiance and standing will fit within the upper and lower bounds of the font the names are written in so they can be kept there also
i think this ones a duplicate but i cant find the link offhand in any case even if it is this is worth a second thumb

yes this is an issue already being brought to the attention of ccp by the csm this weekend in fact it is due to be discussed i the 1230  1320 slot today piz
this is stupid why does it hide my decorations if i leave my fw corp i earned those ranks and it should always display them just have it say retired or something under it
noif there is no benefit in destroying them they can stay there forever and nothing change for you if they are annoying youyour corpyour alliance  or any other alliance   they are doing something and should not be given away as a free prize
having just finished watching it i like the suggestion but this isnt csmworthy
that would be interesting but i wouldnt want to be the web programmer in charge of doing that
currently it takes 78 days  not sure exactly how this works   for a sov4 capital to drop to sov3 when a station system is taken in the consov area this often results in a rather boring delay as its quite possible for both the sov3 stations to be taken within several days then a wait to assault the sov4 station which often wont be defended thus i belive the contesting period in a constellation sov area is excessively long and should be reduced to two days at most if not removed entirely
get a life  when you are older you will look back at all this rubbish you have written on the internet and be embarrassed at how sad you truly wereyou arent the only one either and i am certain that having regular people playing at being bureaucrats but doing it very badly is not what ccp had in mind for this whole processthis certainly isnt enjoyable to see and is beginning to completely destroy the concept of eve as a game  remember that people  eve actually is a game  i am beginning to think that it was a mistake to involve players in the procedures that could change the game for everyone involved ccp should have had the strength and courage to make their own decisions about the great game which they created instead of bowing to pressure which has ultimately created this monster
you may want to actually quote something of substance when replying i have reported you as your post is if nothing else offensivewhat is truely sad is that many representatives can not even be bothered to interact and discuss issues with the players of eve nor answer simple questions about issues and the procedure they are presented to the councilyou seem to think that the csm council can change the game i think that the csm documents would suggest otherwisetake carebruce hansen  arithron  
by utilizing the capacity for endless wardecs we can get the staggering amount of 5 maybe 6 wars per week   compared to more than 200 which the privateers had going before the nerf patch    i fail to understand how you can describe this capacity as endless so the mechanics on our end were fine tuned more than an year agoivy on the other hand without much effort can push the price for a wardec against them well into the billions and the part which a lot of people dont seem to understand is that the same method can be used by any corp or alliance who want to get rid of empire wars from what i hear its happening already it has been almost a month now and we still have no reply from ccp about that problem if this is allowed to continue they might as well declare empire space a noncombat zone and be done with itone more thing  all the wiseguys who say that ivy is just increasing the cost for a wardec and this is not to be considered an exploit  please learn how to calculate and use some common sense  if you increase the price of tech 2 modules with several billions  that doesnt mean that you are banning them from the market  it just makes them more expensive still  how many people will buy them 
the csm is more like the un of eve so in that spirit the goon imperialist oppressors should be will be stopped by any means necessary pounds shoe on table

i would like to see the csm come up with a solution to stop station hugging as a valid combat tacticit is a very lame tactic and should not be allowedthis issue needs to be addressed for all npc stationsthis way the person that starts a fight would actualy have to fight and get popped  the reason i say all npc stations is because there is alot of hugging down in 00 at npc stations as well as empiredarth maule

the naglfa wont get a change to the missileturret slot layout as it would require a remodel of the hullthe changes will either be in the guns themselves the ship statsbonuses or in the midlow slot ratiocount
me to im doin same i mean come on they raise prices delete some gtcs and wat do we get some wat i can only assume now are slackers that want some kerching  well even more kerching   and wat do we get for this better petition answers not copy past crap better time taken and thought into patches not litening to whinners and moaners that have no idea about pvp atm we have petitions were they just enter a random petition and copy paste from last answered petition and patches its like u have some one sat there thinking hmmm wat do i do with this one then i no ill through this in o and this ooo and this now lets send it out so every1 dls it ooo no the server is down for a week o well lets sit on our asss and drink tea and think about other stuff frickin ridicules just fyi guys me and my mate worked out that ccp would end up earning around 45 million pounds a month from us payers they earn at least 12 million now wat a rip off ccp
ccp has increased the monthly price to play the game significantly and this is unacceptable
the op puts it wellthis amounts to a rate hike and as a customer i cant say i ever appreciate those as someone trying to bootstrap myself up to the point where i can comfortably afford to pay for one or two accounts with isk i can only see this change discouraging my progress towards that end i lose the cost effective option of paying 90 days in advance and i lose the cheap option of keeping an account going in the event that im strapped for cash  or trying to save for something else  and i can offer this as far as a testimonial i might not be playing eve right now if the decision to remove 30day time cards had been made somewhat sooner i had a lapsed account and wanted to give eve another try but didnt feel like paying real cash to play a game i might tire of in a couple weeks  plus the idea of paying with ingame currency appeals to me since i tend to be a sort of on againoff again mmo gamer   so i decided id just go ahead and try to buy a gtc with any isk that might be available on my dead account it turns out i had just enough for a 30day card hence my returnalso before i heard about the discontinuing of the 30day time card  a couple days ago   i thought i might introduce the game to a few of my rl friends  as i have none that are playing eve presently which is one of the things that puts a damper on my enthusiasm about eve   and giving or loaning them the money to buy a 30day gtc as a sort of extended trial i dont see myself doing something like that with a 60day card at least until im capable of making isk a lot faster than i currently doso what ccp should understand is that having a variety of payment options available makes the game more accessible to more people  which means more subscriptions im sure ccp has already taken this into consideration to at least some extent but perhaps it has been as carefully weighed as it should be
agree removal of the other payment options is a backwards step only justified by ccp trying to maximising its profits

well dont go to 05 if concord takes to long imho it is an important aspect of eve that you are always in the risk of beeing attacked as the tutorial states never ever fit anything that you are not willing to lose
losei do full time production in empire but i accept the risk of being suicide gank its been part of the game for years if i do get suicide gank then its my fault for not getting a scout to see if gates are clear ish   their is already cons to suicide ganking first you lose your ship when ever you lose a ship insurence helps but it never covers the full cost of the ship next you sec rating goes down thus youll have to spend your time bring it up while you may be making money doing this if youre into ganking then you are most likely not going enjoy ratting this game isnt wow we dont have pve servers we got pvp server that has some pve aspects in it if you dont want to get gank max out the low slots of your ship with wrap stabs and dont go into lowsec i dont see why you want to play a game with zero risks and you cant lose the change to insurence seems like a cheap blow to gankers to make it more of a lost to the efforts they spend just so some people can make more profit and watch tv as they run missions

agreed speed needs to be reviewed and balanced where appropriate
speed is broken for sure im at odds to what the best solution is as there are many options but the balance is way off
i dont think speed is really broken it could be tweaked just a little bit you can counter such ships easily and its not like they are sporting big tanks and massive damages the second you threaten them they will leave as they tend to be expensive shipsas for invicta nano ships avoid where they are and go somewhere else you have entire regions to wreck havoc in or fit your ships to stop them
nano is out of control it completely hashes up ship characteristics to a point where you can say that the ships proscons are unimportant as long as you can nano it that is too much and frankly its simplifying things a loss to gameplay

i support this topic
i find myself rather surprised at how few people have spoken up in support knowing that at least 75 of the people i talk to in eve heavily dislike the nano mechanic im also surprised at how restrained and few the nano supporters have beenin any case in regards to jades statement that nanos are needed because of other current mechanics let me reply with an analogya man is dying of two terrible terminal diseases hes been to the hospital and the doctors are still arguing about the best method of saving him so far he has survived past all expectations as both diseases are normally fatal within a much shorter timespan nevertheless the doctors have the knowhow to save the patient that much is not in doubt but they disagree on the specific treatments several doctors advocate treating one of the diseases first and several are proponents of treating the other what they fail to realize is that not only are the diseases fighting the patient but theyre also fighting each other the patient has survived this long because the diseases keep each other in check but were one of the diseases to be successfully treated and the other not the patient would rapidly deteriorate further and die thus the optimal solution is to deal with both at the same timeit is much the same with nanos and blobbingcapitalssov nanos counter the blob to an extent but the blob also counters nanos by allowing you to bring more ships that can catch and pin down the nanoers and thus allow you to bring your dps to bear killing not just one or two but the majority of the nano gang take away nanos and it will be very difficult to go on a roaming op through hostile space in 00  but at least empire wars would become more enjoyable   take away the blob and nanos will reign supreme as players continue to choose the little risk option and kill the fun for everyone who doesnt enjoy nanoing themselvesjust like in the analogy if you solve one without solving the other you end up with a dead patient  it will either be nanos online everywhere or there will be little nonblobnoncap pvp out in 00 either way ccp will end up losing subscriptions ccp will also lose subscriptions if time continues to pass and nothing is done as an example ive been on the fence regarding my account status for some timebottom line the solution to the entire mess is to fix nanos and blobssovcapitals at the same time this thread exists to garner support for dealing with the nano part but it would be better if both issues were dealt with together that said if i had to choose just one of the two for ccp deal with i would choose nanos  after all without fun 00 there are still highsec empire wars lowsec piracy and fw without blobssovcaps youll still have nano gangs everywhere and theyll be harder to counter  ps for the folks who have been posting supporting a reduction to nanos click yer damned support this option when you post

lol you started eve after nanos came about didnt you im assuming this is your alt of course because the windjammer character has been a member of an npc corp since he was created 10 months agoyou see when the speed tanking buff happened it marginalized pretty much every other playstyle and made it pointless to fly most other classes of ship in fun roaming gangs you of course would never have had the experience of how much more diverse and fun the game was before nanos came about so you wouldnt know any betternow before nanos were buffed there will still a few speed tanking ship though not many one of them was the vagabond and even though it only did about 3kms everyone wanted one this was in the days before invention and the limited supply resulted in extremely high prices for them that reaches upwards of 250 million each at one point at the speeds the were capable of vagabonds were perfectly balanced they werent so fast that they were effectively invulnerable in almost every situation able to disengage with 100 reliability though they could often escape tight situations which wouldve killed just about anything else aside from a ceptorwhat im asking in this thread is a return to those days when speed tanking was still viable for certain ships but speeds were slow enough that the speed tankers advantage wasnt so overwhelming that it was pointless to fly anything elsenow in regards to your sarcastic comment you seem to be laboring under the impression that i cant fly anything expensive and in fact dont own any such ships let me give you the list of tech ii ships i can flycaldaricovert opsassault shipsinterceptorshacsreconscommand shipsblack opsmatarihacsreconscommand shipsblack opsamarrhacsreconscommand shipsnot tech ii but i can also fly  and own   both caldari carriers and dreadnoughts oh and i have over 100 kills with my nonnano machariel which is worth several billion iskyou mean the day other ship classes become viable in combat will make eve too dull you definitely never played before nanos  you saw a lot more diversity back then than you do now
yeah yeah long list of things you can do good for you i did not say you could not i said you did not want to i choose to believe you can do everything you say you can and have been around for as long as you say you have this has not given you wisdom and apparently it has not given you insight what it apparently has given you is a bad case of future shock and a tendency to moan about the good old daysperhaps they can come up with another version of eve for you eve classic then you wouldnt have to change ever again then you wouldnt have to call for the game to be nerfed to mediocrity then you wouldnt have to widen your sight a bit more oh and perhaps you wouldnt have to suggest that people whom you assume havent been around for as long as you dont have a right to post against your suggestionswindjammer
what about a new variation of a t2 destroyer that can launch instead of warp disruption bubbles webbing bubblesi dont think the problem is the speed i think its the ability to catch them
i dont really understand your logic you say the ops problem is that he doesnt want to play a certain way implying that he should have to that seems to be at odds with calling for varietyi dont claim to be an expert on this issue so im just observing the points raised by both sides my own experience is that the homogenisation towards speed ships creates a certain monotony that is not particularly enjoyable for many players but i also understand that my own experience is just a very small part of the whole picturewhat bothers me about these ships is not so much their effectiveness  so far i would agree that the risk justifies the effectiveness and there are plenty of counters   but rather that its close to impossible to force a nano ship to stay in a fight especially without flying minmatar any other ship class always runs the risk of being entangled in a fight and then either has to win swiftly or fear that reinforcements will arrive which tear it apart a nano ship as far as i can tell can always make a run for it if its just clever enough not to engage what it cant handle almost to the extend of creating a demotivating consensual pvp environment i do think this should only be acceptable for dedicated support ships if at all
i trained my caldari industrialist for minmatar haulers this was one of the reasons
im sure heth has naysayers in the state but they are drowned out by his supporters
how about half your nation defect to amarr
i will be in sub capitals ships for a long time i am not the only person with this goal in mind i cant see how capitals will completely dominate warfare as we know it they arent the new battleships nor will they beeven if they do become this ill adapt will youbut yes bring this issue up for discussion this isnt capital ships online but you can always tweak the system
this is a valid package and it absolutely must be brought up at the csm convention there is no other way around it as the vast majority of players out there live happily in empire i believe that only 00 players will come to vote here creating a false illusion of this not being an issue
no support the ops conclusions are incorrect he misrepresents ccps intent and his suggestions designed to primarily benefit one alliance his moreover most of his suggestions fall well outside of anything ccp has suggested it might be interested in doingthe op has not quoted ccp when he says they feel that capitals are crowding out subcapitals this is his own conclusion not ccps just as it was his own conclusion when he said it would make everyone a lot happier to reduce the training time to get into capitals  from the meeting minutes of the 5th csm meeting where he tried to push this and other parts of his package on the agendait failed  ccp simply wants to reduce a capital ships ability to do everything at once and do it well fair enough they made a start by reducing a carriers ability to be a cargo vessel other proposals ccp made were met with such a fire storm of objection from the subscriber base that ccp decided to rethink the issue several epicly long threads attested to that along with some very inventive suggestions for the demise of ccp zuulupark the balancer credited with the carrier nerfing proposalsgoonswarms goal here simple reduce capital effectiveness against their blobs of relatively new players recruited from the something aweful gaming group reduce the amount of time it takes to get into capitals and the amount of time it takes to become proficient thus they seek to minimize the advantage of established older players to make them easier for their transient new playerscurrently goonswarm has a problem with boredom their players cant be counted on to maintain a sustained effort the grow bored if they cant dominate immediately with massive numbers and when they grow bored they drift to other gameswindjammer
im not a fan of the goons by any stretch of the word but thats a load of crap and you know it windy again it seems you never played back before nanos capitals pos and sov became prevalent just like i mentioned in my other threadand before you say anything i own a chimera carrier and a phoenix dreadnought and have used them both in everything from small gang to pos and fleet warfare can you say the same of your qualifications to speak on the matter
good you have some experienceor at least you claim to now if you could only get your head out of the sand once in awhile and take a look aroundwindjammer
i think its a good idea as it will create some additional role play aspects think of a player police that handles those killrights furthermore you can hire a bounty hunter that kills your opponent
although as the goon points out i do remember to cloak more often now i see only three viable options for this problem1   change it back2   change the new hull into something less ugly my god the raven looks better than this piece of crap and that thing makes my eyes bleed3   let me cloak in station so i dont have to look at that hideous pile of trash all the damn time
actually i just think they should just redesign the imicus completely rather than change it back to a maulus which already has one tech 2 hulldiversity ftw no support from me
basically i like the new hull it looks nice however probably just redesigning the look from the ground up would be more interesting and would make the covert ops more of its own class instead of some jazzed up frigate already in use
back to black please
1 meh on jumprange im not into jumping capitals around so i dont know that much2 no no no the mere thought of a cloaked warping bs is way overpowered3 fuel bay does sound like a good tweaki like the class and its intended role while impractical you could do something interesting things with it and the way the class is now it would be quite unexpected i had trained for stealth bombers before their buff just because i knew it would be a fun toy to play with

this idea is esentualy a larger version of the stealth bomber so it uses citadel torpedos is t2 and uses a battlecruiser hull ie drake huricane harbinger  myrmidonplease discuss
no because it would make them overpowered they would be pos killers while not having the downsides of a capital
there needs to be an anti dread i mean dreads are the anti capital but there is no anti dread other than the dread thus there needs to be a ship designed to kill dreads
they are called battleships dreads really are not good at killing stuff smaller than cap ships battleships are part of a support fleet if a cap fleet does not have a support fleet they will get wrecked unless they got titans then you just kiss you life goodbye
overpowered much
i 3 my drakes i wouldnt want to stick torps on it though  not like this overkill or underkill i cant quite decide whichiz
merely a skillpoint grind to getting capitals battleship v is an immensely useful skill to have anyways
thread setups are taking the fun out of the forums for many of the players simply put theyre overpowered even assuming you can debate the merit of a thread in the first place it will usually shamble on in certain circumstances thread setups can be beaten but these usually require significantly more skill numbers andor effort than it does to make threads in the first place in short the risk vs reward is fubarin order to end the i win status of threads i think it should be made more difficult for threads to be created im not sure how to do this but i think we all agree that threads are overpowered and nerfing them will return balance to forum warfare

i agree
spot on
most of you are aware of a fact that once there was concord agents but because of fast security standing increase they are not part of eve anymore but this topic is not about past never should any idea which was implemented even briefly in game be abandoned mutations are key of development my proposal is very simple1 return concord agents to new edenagents will offer only kill missions100 kill missions  if you ask why only kill missions one of devs before few years stated it just doesnt make sense to give you a sec rating boost for ferrying garbage2 players will need at least security rating 50 or higher in order to use concord agents but this high standing in eyes of concord will not only grant you ability to use agents who just maybe would have in lp store some concord bpcs and premade ships  for a reasonable price ofc  it will also grant you right by law that you with 50 standing can attack in high security space all players who did something wrong  01   and concord will not blink  all other existing game mechanic will remain so if you really want to shoot on that helpless pod you can but concord will react blow you etc  3because of huge popularity which would draw many players from all sides of new eden in order to grasp on new lp rewards there is need for some balanceconcord agents will not give any isk reward only lp reward mission rats will have same loot table like other mission rats
sounds like a bounty hunter option i like it
sooo in other words you wanna be able to be a policeman in highsec without the fear of getting shot at unless youre engaging with youre terms i lold
so you want pirates to be able to run missions for concord with alt char gang up with main char to raise his sec status fast and safeand this ofc
naybut yay if you lower the sec you can attack in high sec to 05
makes hot locking wtz ships very frustrating as someone who has specialised in catching nano haulers it is a big nerf for me it can be overcome as it is still possible to lock pretty much anything quicker than it is possible to scan it but it has raised the cost significantly and made misses a lot more likely maybe ganking needed a nerf but this was not the way to go
i doubt this particular issue would ever affect me adversely  the opposite in fact   but im of the opinion that the user interface should never be an obstacle to the player if at all possible if ccp wants highsec ganking to be more difficult there are better ways to go about iton the other hand if this is meant to protect people from an accidental concordokken the better way would be to make it so this message can be suppressed but to bury the option somewhere in an options menu with some sort of explicit dire warning attached to doing so
signed
do it tia
if a pilot wants to accept the risk involved in being able to suppress this warning and understands the likely response of their action then it seems to me to be reasonable that it could be omittedthe same probably applies to modal room messages during missions which are annoying the first time but really annoying each time you come back throughiz
hail csms i was wondering when you guys talk to the devs about something and get a response you guys typically post aanyways for easier thread navigation i would ask of you all to edit the first post or if a all possible a new stickified thread which readsissue 1 herethe csm and ccp  devs have justdiscussed this issue and anannouncement regarding the outcomewill be made in the near futureissue 2 herenot yet discussedthanks
you know what i know that this has been talked about adinfinitum in the eve forums and that we shouldnt start new threads but you know what until ccp does something about this issue i hope that all sorts of people like rex keep starting new threads to help put ccp into action come on guys im in total agreement with rex in that hey i dont want to have to log on in all the time just to set training for the next skillor if im doing something strange like saylive my real life it would be really great to just be able to do just one more skill so that i could do two midrange skills while im at the office or two longer skills that i want to train when i want to train them over the weekend or somethingi really hope that the new council can give us something about this such a small change that would make so many people happyif nothing else could we please have some response about this from either ccp or the new council how long has this been going on without any response or if ccp is not gonna do anthing about this and is too nervous to anger the clients would someone in authority please just tell us it aint never gonna happen and forget about it so that people can stop the silly bickering thats been going on on this issue for so many yearsthanks

your 1st examplewell i think the blueprint mechanic is there as for the sake of game play after the initial investment any player can build a raven battleship same thing with the blueprint copy mechanici believe in the past that blueprint copies were in fact infinite runs and they were phased out in the name of balance you could say that a blueprint copy is like a textbook that had been photocopied and printed with ink that fades away when exposed to the elements  the rigors of production for example  2nd examplewe need to realize this is in fact a game and those mysterious changes are due to make the game balance unfortunate yes but you cant expect a game that has a lot of tactical variety to be balanced from the start there are so many more players than developers it impossible for them to conceive the amount of combinations that the player base will seek in their quest to best other players yes its unfortunate and im sure nobody likes doing it but you have to maintain a semibalancethe questions1 we are immortals we individually command the power to financially back entire solar systems wealth that would make a thriving planet system with billions of workers pale in comparison this is again a game play mechanic much of this game and the mmo genre is about escapism you dont want to be mopping the deck on an armageddon you want to set the battlefield a light with lasers you can serve the navies both in militias and running agent missions2 not entirely sure but a pod piloted ship is a better interface to pilot a ship than a traditional bridge crew3 where would they go if it was your mission to kill that npc and they warped to safespotted and cloaked then what4 the amount of isk you would pay them would be minimal iirc even 24 isk is the equivalent of a planetside fortune id presume theyd come from planets at their chance to be aboard a starship amongst immortals5 gameplay mechanics how the insurance companies in eve stay in business requires a suspension of disbelief however6 cloning technology is incredibly expensive why would you clone a nonpod pilot who has 110000000th of the latent potential these people arent piloting battleships by the will of their mind7 who knows where do the endless hordes of npcs come from to populate providence belts or busy empire mission hubs8 people are weird the internet allows them to mask who they are in rl9 you do know how to do a lot of things warping navigation activating modules operating scanners targeting even things such as docking protocols to get inside stations this would be the equivalant of flight school for yearsyou cant make eve mirror every single aspect of real life a lot of your questions and solutions addressing that they arent realistic would have far reaching consequences to game play rendering it practically unplayable eve rp is very achievable but you have to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy them sometimes it is a quirk of scifi themed gamesmedia

as a new entrant to eve who brought all of his socguild mates from other games here i can say that the no 30 day cards idea is totally ridiculous when i have 14 days to decide if i want to stay just enough time to get some friends to come over and make toons then ccp says we have to commit to two months at a time or we just cant play anymorei wont tie myself up like that when gameplay during the trial is so limited  many stats cant be learned etc  so to find out if i really like the game now im stuck with multiple months nope this really caused fits for my friends too so thanks ccp for screwing things up for us offline as well as onim hopeful the 30day etc will be back before the end of this 30 days or ill just have to say goodbye seems a raw deal to have the company do this 60 days is inductry standard is simply a lie  try any other game and youll find 1month cards are the standard nobody wants to lose flexibility in where and how they play
as a fairly new user i found the 30 day option helpful to see if i would really stay the course within eve online once those 30 days were up the 90day gtc offered value for money so i went ahead and paid for 90 days worth which i am currently using for me in the uk paying under UFFFD8 a month for eve was rather good lets see how this translates especially with the increase inthe us dollar recently30 day  1495  UFFFD75790 day  3885  UFFFD655  per 30 days x 3  so at this point you have a short term package for the undecided or those who dont need 90 days and a long term package which offers better value for money as reward for long service60 day  3499  UFFFD885  per 30 days x 2  this new card doesnt compete with either card blows the limit on what i want to pay per month and is just plain profiteering the excuse that ccp wants to reduce confusion does not roll as this sudden change only increases confusion and covers up blatant profiteer for those who cant look at the sums like meas such i no longer see eve online as an option and will not be renewing till i can pay the same as i already have per monthas for staying competitivewowus 60 day timecode  2999  UFFFD758  per 30 days x 2  ccp just priced itself out of my online gameplay needs usdgbp forex used for conversion from

thumbs down this program simply takes a piece of information that is already being outputted to the client and presents in a more noticeable manner i fail to see anything wrong with that as far as abusive exploits go its about as bad as customizing your overview to make enemies easier to notice and targeta good user interface works for the player and that means the player should have a lot of control over how info is displayed if the player is allowed access to a particular bit of info  such as the fact that a hostile has entered local or that a particular ship is using a warp scrambler on him or anything else   should be presented in virtually any manner that player desires  via sound effect text popping up in the middle of the screen a line of text in a log whateveri feel its pretty stupid that keeping your eyes on a chat channel is an available  and necessary   tactical precaution anyway its bad for immersion and borders on what we call metagame thinking in pen and paper rpgs having the option of finding or recording an aurora soundalike voicing enemy detected in system or failing that a simple warning tone is far better for maintaining a sense of immersion than watching the chat channel if the local channel were eliminated and and replaced with with some other mechanism of detecting other ships in system  perhaps tied in some manner to your ships sensor capabilities   that might be fine by me but as long as local is the method of keeping an eye on system traffic the player should be allowed have that info display however he likes
ccp knew the large corps were using this type of program for a while by their own admission they only decided to take action when it became public domainso they stepped in and removed its use in the public domainand as before someone within a large subscription block will figure a way to do this again and ccp will find out but it wont be a problem till the other players of eve get ahold of it
 i posted this originally in the features and ideas discussion it was suggested i get it into here too after playing eve on and off for over a year i have collected a list of suggestions which i will lay out all together here some of these i am sure will seem insignificant but i think they add up in the endsystem scanner bottom buttons should be on opposite sides  not so close to each other  accidental analyze happens to me too much   left side analyze middle new scan right view result this format moving the next button in line to a different location in a dialog is an excellent method of reducing user error by designoverview fixed sorting by icon does not seem to work between stations and stargates  mixed sort   example system aramachi overview setting seems to reset to default too easily  from saved type  edit location modifying a bookmark subject does not allow pressing enter to complete  must click ok  right click menu in many locations very bad options are placed next to commonly used options  for example remove station from overview and dock in the right click station menu these should be separated immensly grouping with a separator would be appropriate group one ship actions two travel three bookmark info four overview config  remove type   it seems that a good amount of network traffic could be cut down by adding second tier menus to the left panel buttons similar to the accessories button if i could select assetssolar system when my last assets view was all regions i can avoid the all regions querymanufacturing quote the manufacturing quote does not show the blueprint making screenshots less informative sorting corporate blueprints in the science and industry dialog by copy or me or pl doesnt seem to work properly display the current number of jobs processing next to max 8  3 active  travel reaching a waypoint manually could prompt a vocal  textual notice  waypoint reached  containersadding buttons next to the icons details list buttons for sort by and stack itemsjukebox i have music set to zero when i open the jukebox it is always in play for which i have to click stop it may effect nothing but a clear no music would remove any doubtmisc mouse over current time for full datetime  when left panel minimized   the tilde  perhaps only in my resolution   is almost indistinguishable from a minus sign solar system map when hovering over a group of items  bookmarks moons planets   the list will display in nonvisible location  upward overlapping edge of display   how about some horizontal scroll bars  for example on the scanner having to stretch the interface to see the right side is very limiting it would be nice to get the agent show info from the right click menu in journalagentsmissions  and perhaps also add waypoint can we have some ircd like commands in the chat windowjoin channel open new chat window with channel  removing the need to open the channels  mailing lists dialog etc   in keeping with my previous suggestion  a 2nd tier menu would be ideal two items the normal dialog and a text box  perhaps even a recent list   something that would help with bookmarks is to group them by region and constellation an option to have targeted ships remain in their position on the screen rather than roll towords the selected item box would be very helpful especially given how laggy some systems can be target boxes and positional lines should be a color that is distinguishable from the tactical overlay lines colore damage messages according to the type  incoming at least right   emphasize the amount of damage and attacker with bold or color offset allow damage message window in hud  not log   to be single line and fade outanyhow  thats my 2 cents for nowhope dev finds it useful   raylon

listen theres nothing wrong with one alliance trying to control the supply of dysprosium andor promethium just like theres nothing wrong with one country in the world trying to do the same for oil uranium gold aluminum balsa wood fuzzy dice or whatnot doesnt mean in the realworld any country thats trying to has a real chance of doing that at all in the first place  just look at wars fought over oil for nearly as long as combustion engines became mainstream   because of how exactly the resources are spread over a country the needed infrastructure for extraction and the way how territory is held by nations or if they do manage to do that through a serious combined political and military effort doesnt mean that occupancy will matter much in the long run as alternative means to get the same results are introduced  even if its more expensive than the original used to be its cheaper the alternate way now  what is wrong however is that in this game you do have more than a real chance of controlling the dyspprom supply  and not even with a lot of effort   thanks to screwed up pos mechanics strontium micromanagement and hotdropping capital fleets at the same time sov level not mattering at all in mining speeds and you have no chance of alternative means of reaching the same results unless ccp manually introduces themsince this is a game you have two choices  you either make it almost identical to the real world  by introducing a lot more of the checks and balances that exist naturally   and let it sort itself out or you sacrifice realism almost completely and grab in making some radical changes for the sake of gameplaycontrary to what you might have thought so far  and probably still do   this thread does not advocate the latter course of action but the formerrevamping the moon mining system  different concentrations and therefore extraction rates trace elements in nearly every moon even making sov matter and so on   andor introducing alternative reactions to use a whole lot more common materials and none  or very little   rare ones to manufacture all advanced components this all ties in with making the game  and therefore inherently the games market too   more realistic
akita t has not provided any nonopnionion based arguments in the thread linked in the op in other words this idea is so far only supported by akita ts own personal opinions
donUFFFDt think sofull support and thanks for this very educating discussion i have learned a lot through thisindustry with greater flexibility and more options sounds good
hes right of courseccp should add ersatz to the economy industrialists should be able to produce synthetic dysprosium just like real world industrialists have been able to produce synthetic fuel for 70 years
fine be that way thenit is my personal opinion that risk in this game should be proportional  not much higher not lower either   to the potential reward if you dont share that opinion not my problem and youre free to disagree youve stated as much repeatedly without providing a significant backing as to why my opinions are wrong and yours are betterbased on that particular opinion of mine with regards to riskvsreward  which in my opinion should be and is shared by a lot of people playing and again in my opinion is also shared by the developers of this game   i merely observe how things are not that way not in the world of ore mining not in the world of moon mining eitheras a direct consequence of my own personal opinion on what should be on top of my observations of how it isnt i came up with a few  more than just a few quite plenty actually   options of how things could be handled  and its not even limited to the possible solutions ive listed   in order to restore  what in my opinion were and should be   the proper magnitudes for possible rewards when taking potential risks and effort needed into consideration for both moon mining and regular ore miningbetter now 
honestly akita t enough with the stuff quotesfirst paragraph you say yes i agree with brainless bimbo alliances can use abuse the market in thier interests they can engage in market and gunship pvp to limit supply and maximise profit as its a free marketsecond paragraph is jumbled so jumbled that it doesnt really make sense are you waffling on about americian empire policy and the transitory nature of nation state empires  side note oil was actually a replacement good and will soon be replaced by what it replaced weird thought huh   third paragraph says that the free market in eve and the ability of alliances to control resource sources which continue production even when they are under attack isnt fair is wrong end of storyforth paragraph says regulate the market or destroy the game by making changeslast paragraph says akita t wants market regulation wants existing attributes and the infrastructure attached to them to be changed and start making uranium out of lead silicon and boron because akita t thinks its more realisticnow come on akita you cant even explain or defend your position let alone the presumptions you needed to make itoh regards your reply to capt fina look reward and profit are two different concepts you get high rewards in low  null sec but that doesnt mean you make high profits cost and profits are linked to the market and will always be changing the risk  reward ratio if you cant see that plz remove your head from the bucket its in
congratulations on your first post ever
the only thing not making any sense here is youhow about you put something that resembles a brain between the bimbo ears and let it marinate in the post you quoted for a while maybe you will finally make some sense out of it yes its not written in the most concise and elegant manner possible but you cant expect me to even try and keep it at a highschool reading level all nice and tidy with bullet lists and all after you have repeatedly proven youre incapable of assimilating the ideas of that kind of writing either  as opposed to just being able to comprehend the words therein and understanding whatever it is you wanted to understand in the first place anyway in spite of any efforts to educate you of the contrary  if not dont worry i need a laugh every now and then too so keep posting anyway or maybe i will amuse myself with movies of cats hitting on flashlightlit walls the entertainment type and quality is of a similar level
oh my im dismayed by all the thumbsup to this ideathere is no problem with mineral prices or distribution in my opinion the prices are the current appropriate balance of willingness of the pilots in eve to trade their time between mining running missions and fighting to keep those moon mining stations runningthe only economic problem ive been able to identify in eve is that the money supply is not tied to material wealth this is the same problem that threatens realworld economies tying available isk into actual wealth  i would really cry if people think that isk is the same thing as wealth   would solve most of the economic problemsmineral prices being low or high is neither good nor bad  it is a market balance we do not have any say  and probably ccp doesnt even care  about what the prices should be this is almost as bad as saying we know what the weather should be we know what we want but there is nothing that says what things should be the most ill guess is that ccp has an idea of how many manhours they want it to take to achieve certain goalsi understand that there is some interest in being able to use alternative materials for construction to offset the inability of certain pilots to get the materials they want the mechanism in the game to get those minerals already exists and its called getting into combat unless its not possible through combat or whatever the system is not broken  the other issue is that it makes no sense at all to be able to use alternative materials for existing items and the complexity of allowing equivalent but alternative items is probably beyond tenable  i see this whole debate as i dont want to have to fight for my minerals or other people got the minerals first so its hard to get them for myself which may or may not be accurate however it seems to me one of the guiding principles of eve is that you have to fight for your survival here and there arent any easy ways to get what you want if there are moons that make profit and you want it go take the moons if other people have them and protect them well so be iti do not support the idea of changing any balances like this until isk is tied to wealth otherwise everything is just treatment of a symptom rather than treatment of the cause
so you find it perfectly acceptable that this game has little to zero scale and what you started off doing in the game at day one as an industrialist is what youll be doing at day zero when you decide to either pvp mission run or quitinterestingyou would think any industrialist worth their weight in brains would recognize that the argument is being made to create a more defined reward scalefact there is no point to mine low secfact there is no point to min null secwhywhen you factor in the risk against your reward what little you come out ahead is not worth the headacheeither people really are this clueless to game design or were arguing against macro miners akita im convinced of it now
i was going to write a large dissertation     on this post but decided to take my own advice i was writing and look at different perspectivesat the crux of the matter we have a group of people in eve who run around shooting each other whose reward is either holding as much space as they can or having the best kd ratio others reward is having the highest wallet or the fastestgrowing wallet yet others are to be able to run missions the fastest or destroy markets or create marketsthe list is as varied as the pilotsfor instance the guy who visited every system in eve took a guaranteed chance to be blown up numerous times for the reward of being the first documented person to visit every system there are others who are attempting to obtain one of every item in the game how can an objective or balanced riskreward system be placed on something that is inherently subjectivethis is why i dont like the discussions on risk vs reward there is no way without pigeonholing people into a the most of this type of point only wins scenario you can control or balance or insert other appropriate verb here such a thing so if you want your sandbox youre not going to have balanced risk vs reward because those  balance and freedom   are mutually exclusive in my observation
not suportedbut additional means for freighters to reduce risk needs to be looked at imo people that want to make changes in eve by enhancing gamemechanicsrules andor npcs makes me a sad panda
i do not support this issuesuicide gankers are not targeting decently fitted ravens pimp my ride boats are the targets and rightfully so there should be a risk when you undock anywhere in eve in your 5bil isk raven this is not wow toning down such aspects of the game will make it less appealing to a good number of people

maybe i missed some relevant post but it seems to me that jade claims on scrapheap just that the site is no longer hosted by himand while there might be some issues with his performance as chairman i dont feel that former rping is a valid reason to demand his head on a plate
a good abstract of the issue supporting
agreed speed needs to be reviewed
absolutely agree with definition of the problem
i agree speeds broken only becsue the things that counter speed are broken fix webs and neuts so the huge gap between their range and the current orbiting range a nanno has to have to keep you scramed are brought closer together again t2 disruptors and overheating have moved speedy ships out of the range of their intended counters websneuts bring them up to speed with speed and its a fix no need to nerf speed it needs to be looked at for sure good luck csms
i think you misread me i stated that even with your proposed changes the intie would still be the better t2 frigate compared to the assault frigthe idea of making af to t1 frigs what hac are to t1 cruisers is a good one if we wouldnt already have viable combat t2 frigs in the form of intiesyoull need another incentive to use them perhaps a bonus that makes them less affected by webs or something
i dont support nerfing nanos i cant stand them but i dont support nerfing them either but they need to have counters that actually work webs and neuts  med neuts not bs sized   should be brought up to speed they have always and should alays be the main counters to nanos but they got left behind as the minimum orbiting range of nanos has increased the maximum range of webs and neuts hasnt increased enough to counter them
adapt or die not signed
just no without nano setups solosmall gang roaming against skillblobs becomes even more painful than it already is
this or at least give us proper heavy prec missiles
son of a a nanowhining againhere let me just help you out as little howe to kill every nano ship out there1   killing vagasall nano ships use a rapierhuginn to slow it down use a curse to suck its cap dry cant go mwd with no cap get a few interceptors on it  crows are really fast   using a falcon to jam it and slow it down then blow it up2   killing ishtars kill the drones ishtar then runs away cause it now sucks but get the above mentioned ships on it and bam it diesis your bs fleet going to kill a group of good nanoships no probably not unless the nano pilot screws up but can nanos kill a rr bs gang not a chance in hell if you dont want to fly nano but you do want to kill them bring a mixed fleet get a few interceptors grab some recons and a few hacs they dont have to be nanod smart flying and using tactics can stop a nano ship in its tracks it is much more likely if you stay together send out the inties to tackle and jam with falcons you will live thorugh the encounterthere now stop whning and adapt
supporting thisccp needs to address this issue fast or everybody jumps on the nano bandwagon  and i really mean everybody   and the same situation like the announced carriermom nerf arises when a gigabtic blob thread altered  or delayed   ccps decision
range is not enough agility mod needs to be addressed as wellsee nyphur address this here
i support just think of how stupid something the size of a nuclear aircraft carrier accelerating to 5000 meters per second in little under a few seconds is lets say thats about 1000 ms2 which is a killer 100gs 10 times more than any human can withstand without being turned into chunky salsa in fact even the space shuttle despite the 12mn  thats meganewtons the same unit of measure that the mwd and ab use essentially the space shuttle has a cruiser sized ab fitted   that its engines put out it only accelerates at a slow 3 gsbasically the speeds are fine imo its the rate at which you can alter your speed that needs to be changed i think that the easiest way to do this is to increase the mass penalty to mwdedit typosedit2 to give you a better comparison of the size of things involved here checkout these two links

if youre so willing to bend the rules to allow mwd then why not bend the rules to allow guns to track at 1080 degsec so i can hit your nano ship the tracking limits were imposed based on real physics
spaceship max speed crew checkin inkeep grasping maybe youll find something if you try hard enough
well of course there are limits because the game has to be playable for instance warp speed and jumpgates however that does not mean we need to turn eve in a fantasyland you can go to wow for that

wall of text coming in hotalright my take on capitals i cant fly one but i love them i love being in a corp that will hotdrop them on people or stranded single capitals i love seeing them dropping onto grid as pilots flee and i love being in an inty and having 5 fighters assigned to mebut i think there should be some changes but i dont think there should be changes to the capitals themselves i think there should be changes to subcapitals mainly modules and a change to one insignificant ship here is my ideabattleship modulesnew class of weapon missilehybridlaserprojectile all types one for each racethe new weapons would be a modifed  t3   version of regular weapons that could only load a special class of ammo call them penetrator ammo or whatever but this ammo would have huge anticap bonuses such as 200 more damage to any cap ship it hits drawbacks would be that it makes the guns track like a dread terribly therefore smaller ships would be immune to it but you could have a group of dedicated anticap bs pilots ready to go make it cost a lot to use awu 5 in addition to the t2 skills it would not have any extra effect on possassault frigates little mini tankrecreate the assault frig into an anticapital the new bonuses will be 200 extra damage of all guns to fighters able to fit a new module called capital warp disruptor specifically designed to disrupt the warp and jump cores of capital class ships it acts as 2 points on all cap ships but does nothing to noncap ships has a range of about 10k got to get all nice and cozy with the cap shipable to fit a new module that dissipates the effects of a ddd specifically a racial one one for each race and can reduce the doomsdays effects by preventing 99 of the damage done to the ship still gets it into armor and possibly structure if that race module is fit but the little guy survives to put a point on somethingthose are my ideas at least
i agree andor support this idea
simple idea add more hangars for the corporation offices i know theres an alliance hangar thread but not everyone will benefit from that7 hangars inst really enough to sort up things and using containers are well not that funso simply add more hangars 10 should be a suitable number compared to the 7 todayc
id be happy with even just one extra hangar division i support this idea wholeheartedly first
yes

cool   
yarrgreed
i like all of these but if youre going to be implementing 2 then can you also implement the option to set destination to a region i know of a lot of times i want to accept a public contract or check a market and i have no idea of what the fastest way to get inregion is to do it
youre going to have this in almost any system out there  at least any ive read about   the difference is that it would be more hassle to do it this waystill that would basically be avoided with most bounties less than 30 million isk reason being pirates are proud of their bounties  as are many nonpirates though only pirates would get high bounties due to the fact that they could only be placed by people with killrights etc   i used to be a pirate  and plan to be again soon   and having a bounty was like the culmination of hours of work it was physical proof that i was notorious in some way youll find that most pirates wouldnt want to pod themselves for their bountyalso the timer is another way of avoiding exploitation under this system people couldnt simply play a different account for a week while a contract on them expired not only that but if you took out a contract on someone who then happened to leave on vacation youd have just lost a lot of money for no reason
as far as i can see theres only one real way to exploit it and ive already addressed that point the big guys problem is simply a biproduct of the system i have no opinion about it either way but if you utilize the system as stated youre going to have something like this happen one way it could help game play is to force people that want to get the big guys to plan strategically and pool their money to make it work perhaps a corp contract sort of thing but that would require more balancing
i wouldnt pod myself for my bounty  which sucks now   no matter how high it is i think i am in the minority thoughyou already popped your target and ed himher off enough to place millions of isk on your head which then you claim for yourself you are just costing them even more isk and grief for some people this is the end goali would not waste isk placing a bounty on somebody who can go hey thanks for the isk if heshe so choses i think thats the only thing wrong with the current bounty system and yours
i dont usually do serious poasts so bear with meas is obvious the amount of capitals in the game has skyrocketed over the past couple of years as the amount of capitals has increased so has the amount of capkills and this has led to the all too common phenomenon of capital ships self destructed to deny loot and a killmailwhy is this a problemwhy shouldnt they be allowed to self destruct its their ship right yes but self destructing should be a choice which is risky whereas for most pilots now its just a button you push when its blindingly obvious youre going to die so that you can deny your aggressors shiny stuff and so youre not forced to upload that embarrassing lossmail however  the problem is not self destructing itself its the two minute timer it should always be an option  but more of a risk based thing  as in will help arrive in time is this fleet able to take me down etc etc   thats not the only problem however  it actively encourages blobbing on the target in order to kill it within the time and furthermore reduces the fun in smaller lowsec roaming gangs as these rarely have dps to finish a capital in short order  in this situation most caps can hit self destruct when they go into hull  what do you want doneits pretty obvious to me make the timer longer i would suggest a flat minimum of 5 minutes for all carriers and dreads although frankly id really think itd be better closer to 8  10 minutes 10 should also be the minimum for motherships with this the capital pilot will be forced to choose to self destruct maybe half way through a fight  against a small gang   rather than right at the endi think youre a talentless grieving ganker who emocries everytime you dont get your precious killmail to stare at all daymore or less
well it would be nice to make the timer much longerin the end they dont have a capital anymore and its because you and company leave the kill board stats for the forum trolls and epeen wavers
meh good concept i just dont think it would work
as a sb pilot im going togo with no on this to much but i will admit i did think oh yeah but again too much
our corp mates have been talking about this very thing definitely agree
pirating is currently heavily stacked in the pirategankers favour unfairly so because warp scrambling is so easy and it almost always works   if ws didnt work so well more people would risk going in to lowsec and thus pirates would probably get just the same amount of kills anyway a winwin situation for all no
ill bet youve never heard of wcs
and how useful are they about as much use a chocolate fireguardall im saying is that it should not be so easy for pirates to do what they do make em work for their illgotten gains
and let me guess  youre a pirate
terrible idea maybe you could introduce another module with a longer range with a 50 chance to hit but dont change something that works as intendedall you need to survive lowsec is a little bit of smarts watch local watch scanner stay aligned make safes bubbles dont even exist so you can travel almost with impunity in most ships
well maybe the wcs should work as intendedwhats a bubble anyway
interdictor bubble andmobile warp disruptorsthe visual effect is that of a bubbleyou are a young player obviously you will realize soon enough that your pov is very limited and largely incorrect
how so please enlighten
when i stopped being a noobish idiot i stopped losing ships in low sec to gankers things like avoiding hot spots watching local keeping on the move using my scanner being aligned to warp if i was staying in one spot you can even use alt scouts if you are really paranoidkeep in mind also if you change the warp scrambling system your antipirate fleets would have a much harder time catching pirates because the pirates will leave if they cant win this ironically places the advantage back to the people your absurd notion is supposed to nerf
no you are supposed to have you facts together before you show and post some unqualified whine about how some pirate stole your lunch moneyit is very simple on how the mechanics work read up on the modules and figure it out questions you have to answer is how many points does it take to jam and how many wcs you need to prevent it edit and the wcs does work as intended
this issue really needs more support
really simple it would be pertinent to know want actions plans steps being taken to eliminate all the server side tech issues plaguing the game more then the typical jita annoyances the current state is stretched thin and will get worse as new players start their experience in space how stable is the game we vest time and money to play now and for tomorrow whats being done to solve the issuesthanks side note   i do understand ccp is a software game content publisher not a hardware infrastructure firm like cisco systems
they have built an epic fishtank the water from which will be circulated to cool the servers  see liquid cooled electronics rig   which will in turn ease the stress on the physical hardware components and reduce lag
 rolling eyes to taunt a fix lag topic before it gets any support
i heard that the heat exchange from the water after circulating through the server farm is enough to heat five thousand homes even in the middle of icelandic winter indeed it is gradually replacing the geothermal energy for which iceland is famous
holy the fish tanks in iceland the servers in londonthats some impressive watercooling
they are working on the need for speed initiative and they have an infiiband  spelling   server structure they are developingyou cant avoid all issues though the internets is a big network and a lot of people can screw it up

the main problem isnt that threads are overpowered its that thread scramblers are ineffective on nanothreads

now ive spent over four years playing other mmos and i found out that binding the keys would make things tremendous much easier and better so today i wished to change a couple of keybinds on my setup to allow me to do a lot fast now the first thing i noticed was that there was a couple of locks thats okay when i wished to change f1f5 to simply become 15 and the others for well dont have to explain it all anyways i had to choose if i wanted to use ctrl alt or shift then i simply gave up cause then the keybindings would feel really unconfortablenow i know that the mouse is the main thing you need to play the game but for those who wishes to use the keyboard for something a little more than to chat please make the keybindings more simplified and more free
supported  hotkeys are the key to a good game interface much of the time a mouse doesnt have enough commands to allow for fast gameplay but a keyboard does we should be able to make better use of them of course youll have problems using them if the chat window is highlighted but thats a conflict ill tolerate
first  this is not about allowing alliances into fw    actualy its about prevetning them from interferingissue as black rise popped in the 00 alliances had began the conquest for them their numbers in black rise are increasing and they tend to shoot at militia fleetswhat was beginning to look like a revolution in eve a very successful addition that is turning loads of carebears into regular eve players  well the progress is slowing down because of big alliancestomorrows incident on tama gate where gallente militia got obliterated by ra and exe is just one of manyidea militias arent interrested in holding systems for profit  only for an advancement ang the glory of its faction   alliances fight for them systems for profit  pos and moon mining ratting maby mining  now that wouldnt collide however considering what i have pointed earlier both groups fight each othersmy idea is to make faction standing for alliances when a militia pilot from ex gallente is having his ship destroyed by an alliance x member  alliance x gets a standing hit   now the lower faction standing the alliance has the bigger would be eventual regular retaliation task forces from the gallente faction that means deployment of npc task forces to fight x alliances installations and any capital ships they have in the faction occupied systemsthe standings would get back to normal after some timeas for militia attacking alliances with no negative standings would cause militia standings drop  as the faction dont want to have more enemies    a bit harsh imo  maby someone can come up with better idea   of course only the one that has initiated the aggression will be punished and such an act would make the alliancemilitia pilot flagged for like the rest of the day  no penalty shooting them  no u can comment   
well the free pass to blow up people in high sec is pretty much not in the games best interest not a good idea
i defo like the idea look into it peoplei agree andor support this idea
lol i support this only because i want to have a concord battleship
every warning like this in eve should be able to be deactivated
lets just arbitrarely bump the cost by close to a third to answer the person saying that to simplify can be good why did they not just discontinue the 50100 day etc and focus on the 30 90 that has been in great demand the answer is to increase the revinue all i have to say is that my entertainment moneycan go to the new online space game that i have read about just around the corner
i think they need more time to do something which is quite normal at this pointalso guys and girls from csm it is not unusual to have problems about constitution i suggest you to read some rl experiences from the internet
maybe my question not sound propriate but where i can find logs 4 and 5i tried on
im writing an article on the csm and how its overcome all the problems its come up against should be good ill link it when its posted
been mostly off the forums  back in the game   for the past couple weeks is this silliness still going on havent ccp quietly swept the csm under the rug already
i was actually just discussing with inanna during breakfast 10 minutes ago why the csm forums are so quietwe were thinking that all the trolls were actully csmmember alts but well
they are there in iceland
nah we trolls probably just got bored shot all our loads in this circlejerk and are in a phase of recuperation shrug
actually i have been really impressed by the level of commitment shown by ccp to the discussions this weekend we have all  around 25 people on average   been in this very warm and rather airless room discussing arguing and reviewing the ideas we brought to them this time around for days so not a sillyness and ccp keep a clean office without rugs piz
circlejerk crew checkin in
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
its been a few days how is it going
been really good so far a lot of people are going to be very surprised at just how seriously this csm process has been taken by ccp the press the csm delegates and everyone else involved in the conference
thats good to hear if you omit monstertrucks for titans most of the proposals have been sensible and thought out  beyond what weve seen in previous years   perhaps ccp really did have to buy this kinda feedbackits a public relations boon anyway you see it
well kinda did you see the artbook yet they have titans on wheels more or less p the trains look like a lot of fun
i like itcurrent poss suck thats why people are building so many outposts
ok thank you for taking this to ccp now can someone please tell us something about it what did they say whats going on with it anything
prenerf strength would be overpowered when you bring rigs and links into the picture i dont ever want to see an 80 strength dampi do support buffing the bonus on these ships to 75 though this makes for 58 damps with skills at v 64 or so with two rigs 73 if you stack a mindlinked eos on top of that id say thats about balanced the ship is definitely giving something up for that power but anything downrange of those damps will be severely hampered 10level would bring back 70 damps when rigged but bring a mindlinked eos into the picture and were up to 80 damps and i think most of us can agree that 80 damps are overpowered two of those and a 250km lock range becomes a 16km lock rangersds on bonused ships are underpowered as things stand they should not be falcons that dont need sdas though which is about what a 20level strength bonus would make them 85 strength with max skills and then add two rigs and you hit 937 damp strength add an eos to the picture and well   be interesting to see how the engine handles negative lock ranges

i support this idealooks like another example of too many devs spoil the game or at least at least to devsd working on the same thing and they werent communicating or maybe he just had a brain fart
i dont want to be forced to use a shield tank on any of the minmatar capitals when the nid was moved more in line with an armor tank i got very happy the points the op makes are very valid but the slot changes would completely break dudes like me who love the armor tanked nidso since there is only a yay or nay on this funky forum i certainly cant give a yay to slot changes bummer cuz i support everything elseediti really wana affirm that i support everything else this dude has said high skill requirements weak tanks crap dps our t1 ships and especially the capitals have a lot of problems that need looking at but a slot change really should not be the solution
absolutely great idea

reducing the cooldown time between two individual jumps will not allow you to make much better use of the jumps you have but it will simply increase the number of jumps you can makeid rather see a 48 hours since previous clone jump alternative method of clone jumping instead of a skillbased faster overall jumping speeda 48h for 2 jumps  instead of 24h for one jump   limit would ensure you being able to jump somewhere do something then jump right back whenever you feel like it every two days or make one jump somewhere else daily  like right now   you will not be able to make more jumps per weekmonth but you will be able to make better use of the jumps you have
good idea
looks good

keep it the way it was link to my thread that i probably shoulda posted here  thanks for the guy that pointed me to this main one    yeah most of what i said has probably been said here but its another opinion   
for european players 90 days gtcs is the only possibility to get reasonable prices with the euro being 15 approx we pay 50 vat  according to ccp thats the reason for the price difference   as we pay the same price as the rest of the world  but in euros instead of dollarsto make the situation more interesting  if you live in switzerland for example you can pay in dollarseither return to the old price system for gtcs or fix the price in euros
ok i read this statement and said to myself ok that makes sense 30 60 and 90 day game cards i go to the store and there is only the 60 day came cards wtfan increase in price ok but it makes no friggin sense for new players or long term players to buy 60 day game cards for reasons already statedi cannot forsee myself buying a 60 day game card and i dont have other means to pay for my subscription ccp has until the 23rd of july to make a decision for me
since this was supposed to be discussed on sunday where is the response from ccp as it stands when my sub runs out im not renewing it
yes pleasei really liked 30days gtc
might as well copy this post from the ships and mods forum that looks at 1400mms

3000 a hit seems a bit much but i do agree that minmatar should be the alpha kings and yea i wouldnt mind waiting like 20 seconds between shots to be able to unleash that sort of volley
arty needs some love
there is really no reason it shouldnt be implemented
one dev gave a response that it would result in to many database calls at oncewhat that he clearly does not understand is that we are all furiously right clicking on our gun slots to get the same effect no offense to ccp or anything but his response made me wonder if he plays the gamei absolutely support this it would be an interface change that replaces all of that right clicking for us
not that i agree much with what the dev in question said but to be fair to him if you read his later posts in that thread he makes it clear that his concern is people changing ammo more often if this is implemented that actually would increase database calls he phrased himself badly in his initial posts but if you go back and look now it does make sense
as the original issue i dont care very much about actual software and development support wine is and will be still better than any possible closedsource ripoffwhat id love is proper customer communicationnot fancydandy buzzwordfilled trade fair brochure lookalikes i dont need to know about any exciting new synergies to implement our global vision and other dilbertisms like thatjust be open and honest with your customers and we will deeply appreciate even the bad newswe can always fix our software
fyi folks one of the developers posted over on the mac forum to say that there would be a dev blog about this some time this week regarding the beginnings of a limited beta test for the premium clients
pop3 evemail pleaseimprove the ability for people to communicate quickly and easily and you will definitely improve eve
evemail is such a big part of the game and should have more features
no this is stupid if you want pop 3 access get you own external email addressi do support a sent box a inbox with customizable folders alliance mails where it groups by corp then by person have the ability to mass remove mass mark as read search and other general mail things would be nice as well
get my votenever know if you sent a mail already and if the lagmonster ate it or not
very simple and functional idea all for having this implemented
there was a thread started a couple of years ago about this and i still support it to this day
its even in their own planned page but its been there for yearsresponse wanted indeed
yes please one of the many important ideas which disappeared into obscurity
i dont disagree with you in the regard the sandbox games need to shy away from pigeonholing as you say however there are some fundamental flaws regarding the base system thats the problem its not that the market is flawed the market is working exactly as intended and doing everything one would expect a market to doempire ore offers the best roi ergo everyone is staying in empire and mining empire orethe question that was posed was why is empire ore the best ore the answer is quite obviously and glaringly that high end drops devalue the null and low sec ore beyond the roi value that people feel comfortable venturing out into 00 spacethe intended  at least according to the need for speed initiative   is therefor brokenwhat the solution is can be debated on for likely decades but the fact of the matter is that the base game design is broken and only ccp has the keys to fix it

you cant balance absolutely everything in the game without more effort anybody would be willing to put in true but you can balance things of the same kind a lot easiertheres nothing hard about pointing a finger at what needs to be balanced in highseclowsec00 mining for instancethe risks are clear  in 10  and 09 too   theres practically zero risk outside of human players and even that risk is minimal overall due to fast concord response times stuff you can find here is veldspar  in massive quantities   and scordite here and there then also pyroxeres and plagioclase in 09 among a lot of veldspar and some scorditein 0508 you start getting some minimal amounts of threats from nonscrambling belt rats plus the usual  still quite low   player risks you start finding omber and kernite from 07 and below in some regionsgoing into 04 the risk from beltrats is also slightly increased but the risk from other players skyrockets as theres no more concord to protect you you can find jaspet hemorphite and hedbergite hereout in 00 the risk from players is potentially maximal  not that much higher than the risk in lowsec anyway even less if done in home turf in your own alliance space but thats a different issue   and the risk from npcs is steadily increasing as you go further down towards 10 truesec and the place you can find bistotarkonormercoxitone can only conclude from here veld scor pyro and plag should be the lowest earning ores around with veldspar distinctly lowest of them all and according to base prices thats how it isyou can also conclude that jaspet and omber should be worth quite a bit more than those four and surprise in base price thats how it is toosince the risks are highest for the 00 ores especially those in deep 00 obviously bistot and arkonor should be worth most with mercoxit quite high too  although mercoxit is a whole other issue   and again no coincidence the base prices say the same story here toonow the only reason why actually mining those ores is nowhere near what the base prices would suggest is the fact that individual minerals are too far off their own base prices with tritanium a lot higher and most of the rest a lot lower and the reason why minerals are off their base price like that is the influx of highends from the drone regions  easy to move dropped in massive quantities not requiring a specialised mining setup at all   and the pressure to mine for tritanium locally  due to the multiple compression hauling nerfs and repeated npc refineables removal  in order to fix the balance of riskvsreward for mining  and for mining alone not talkig about the rest   youd have to do somethingwhat you can do now thats a whole different problem anything from shifting ore around or changing the ore refining yields to revamping the mining system to be systemsecspecific in actual yields even down to changing the ratios of minerals needed  or just adding alternative recipies to existing items   all of that can help if done right either individually or a little bit from eachdoesnt really matter which one of those things you do or how much of it it only matters that its done fast and until a proper balance is acheivedso to repeat its not a balance of all subjective things one can do in eve its the balance of only one small aspect a highly objective one too namely mining income potential  with regards to the system security rationg youre mining in  
you amply deserve it nay you have been trolling for it for a long time so i said what the hell hive her  or is it him   the pleasureheck your entire forum persona is built for trolling alone most likely even going only by your namei said equally intellectually challenging to reading your posts i was sure even you could grasp the subtle difference but apparently i was mistakingi apologize to the catswow talk about reading between the lines and missing the whole point entirelyok just for you and just this time again in slow motion and with nice kindergartenlevel explanationsthe strong guys of the time  doesnt matter which country could be ancient greece or todays usa   are always trying to control some natural resource thats important right then for instance oil in the past 80 years or so history is full of other similar things just with less people involved now its really hard to control a natural resource because it does not care for national borders or other such things so deposits of it could be scattered anywhere finding and then getting them out needs a lot of time and effort and the strong guys cant really keep on fighting everybody who is near where the resources are and at the same time keep extracting the resources everywheresay the strong guys do manage to control most or even all of the resource after a lot of effort  wars to chase off those who want to control the resource bribes to the ones leting them extract it buy cheap from those afraid of them and so on   when they try to sell it expensively they soon find out that the whole fight wasnt all that good because meanwhile somebody else came up with some other way to use other  cheaper more abundant   resources to get the same results cheaper than using their full control resource price
akita t im sorry that you start getting personal but what the hell its all you can do as your outclassed all the way down the line when it comes to real debate all your straw man arguments ad hom attacks ignoring of valid points advanced by others and not to mention your flip flopping on the market its free let it stay free but lets regulate as well moaning about oversupply of high ends increacing demand for low ends and then thinking that the high demand for low ends should be met at a discount is laughable in a free market ccp have a vision for the game and i do not think the concept of alchemy has been written for inculsion into the game  your proposal of high end moon mins being made from other low end moon mins   or that ersatz duplicate bpos should exist to clutter up the databasenow remember that the risk reward ratio is market dependent and that reward does not equal profit
since i know i cant go too far into rl politics without a gm scrubbing me afterwards ill just say that your opinions are bad and you should feel bad and leave it at that
but what about the facts
and thats all it is to you isnt it  a debate you dont care about the big picture you care about the little nitpicks there was no straw man argument and my only ad hominem attacks were made after all avenues for logical discourse have been eliminated leaving me to believe im either dealing with a troll or an idiot in which case the only possible arguments are ad hominemnot a single relevant and valid point has been left untouched a lot of irelevant and invalid points have been ignoredtheres less and less artificial barriers like price ceilings or bottom caps even if there still are some as not all npcsold refineables have been eliminated and insurance still bottomcaps the mineral basketif you want a truly free market you would have to eliminate all forms of insurance and all npc sales of reprocessable goodsyoure misinterpreting againthe oversupply of minerals in general drives the price down until it almost hits the insurance fraud bottom capthe relative oversupply of high ends compared to demand ratios of highends drives highend prices further downthe ease of transport of highends and the cumbersomeness of lowend hauling makes that even worse driving tritanium up the wall and highends even further downhey what do you know riskvsreward balance  in the sense of highlowno sec for one   was supposed to be part of that vision youre misinterpreting yet again what a surpriseno its not making highends out of lowends but instead it is making t2 components with a lot more lowends and less or no highendswhat the hell do you know about database programming in general and eves database in particular  apparently not much if youre making such an absurd claim you might as well request removal of several item types that are never used since uh why they clutter the database  guess what no they dont clutter it in any way that it might matterhmm then maybe you mean cluttering it in an instanced way  hell why not force stack everything since that would remove a lot of clutter too  i mean having ten stacks of antimatter charge m in your hangar is pretty much equally bad to having 10 different item types there anywaythis just to give you a little clue as to how far your ignorance spreadsim sure you wont understand it either but who cares im just making fun of you anywaynow remember that the riskvsreward ratios are not supposed to be dependant on anything else except  what a shocker   risk involved vs reward offered for the same type of activity done in different parts of the game universe and that income  ie reward   never meant profit in the first place anyway  so why the hell did you mention that or how is that in any way relevant to what you just said  
wow what can we say you didnt read what ive been writing have younow i just dont perceive your alledged problemsand heres why yet again markets cant work too perfectly and they depend on human greed to function the base price was the market value at the time it was taken all price differentials are open to wild variability as its a free market  within an artificial floor and ceiling thats being eroded   reward is set by the market if the ccp created reward is accessed via the market place  selling ore or loot   and high end moon materials can and should be monopolised by alliances as its a display of thier power in evewith a player driven market the value of all activities is infulenced by others actions and not by ccp who just provide the availability  roids rats drones and moons   and buffers  floor and ceiling values of raw materials   as well as set in stone values as on rat bounties and mission rewards  within known equations   if demand is such that trit is in short supply the market must make it more attractive to mine however as veldspar is everywhere  unlike more complex and valuable ores   players will always gravitate to where the risk is lowest for a given activity now that trit on tap  npc shuttles   has been removed the price of trit has had its effective cap removed so the market can encourage miners everywhere to stare at roids however as after 6 months you make more isk doing lvl 4 missions than providing trit cheaply to players who dont value your time the price can only rise as its in direct competition for time it must be noted that the lack of supply of trit will also effect the prices of other raw materials as trit limits thier use in production a better price for trit will increace its availability and therefore production will increace which will raise demand on other currently over supplied and depressed in price minerals in the case of moons an alliance has to build poss to gain the space means that most moon mining is a by product of this got a moon may as well mine it valuable moons are such an asset  high risk   that they require a high degree of defense they also offer the ability to control the market by denying supplies to drive up the price to empire dwellers who arent part of the support structure that made and keeps the possession of the moon possible its again a display of thier power  market pvp   which they collectivly earnededit i noticed i forgot to address your first problem lack of alternative means of manufacture but making duplicate items from different raw materials must give a different outcome silk has different qualities to polyester even though it serves the same function making ties i gave you an out with existing meta lvl t1 good bpos be introduced to do it
and therefore ccp should either remove all remaining ceilings and rethink availability in order to restore riskvsreward balance or provide alternative means to use whatevers in excess in order to use whatevers in high demand in order for the riskvsreward balance to settle itselfits clear as daylightand thats precisely the problem highreward items should not be available in lowrisk areasso you either make a change to make veldspar a lowreward item or you move veldspar out of lowrisk areasno the price cap of trit has not been removed theres still plenty of places where you can get npcsold refineables that you can use to get tritanium out of the problem is theyre no longer available in each and every highsec station but instead at select locations onlywhat kind of backwards reasoning is that the only way for trit to climb in price is if highends drop in price even further first and they wont increase back much  if at all   even if trit volume traded increases dramaticallythe one and only limiting factor is insurance payoutsyou have no clue how easy it is to hold recapture or deny access to it to competitors for a highvalue moon when your main interest is that kind of moon do you its all about where you draw the linethe place where you want to draw it is far far beyond the level of acceptable gameplay balancesays who you  no they dont have toit would be natural to have different outputs yesbut it would also be natural to be able to use less of something to make a slightly less durable or worse performing object but thats not possible in eve eitherits called sacrificing realism for the sake of gameplayyou know the reason why we dont have newtonian physics the reasons why ships have a max speed the reasons why guns instahit and theres no line of sight and so on and so forththats a halfdecent idea but it kind of needs even more work than this
brainshould low sec offer higher rewards for miners ratters find better rats spawns pos can be anchored and moons mined piracy is much easier on gates and in belts people who live in low sec often pay more for items to avoid travel to hubs through choke points it seems everyone else should make more isk with higher risk than miners in low sec according that is what is confusing me on your arguments
im with you so faruntil this point as soon as actual pilots entered the game the value of things became determined by the pilots not the base statistics this is a working economy in fact the value of things determined by the participants in that economyunfortunately prices dont follow risk in eve just as in the real world prices reflect tradeoffs supply and demand risks are factored in there but they are not the driving force well on second thought they might be but risk is a variable that changes with situation again this observation supports my assertion that you cannot balance a system of rewards against risks because the risk is not objective i wouldnt draw that conclusion i would instead conclude that the aggregate population chooses to spend its time differently than the original designers expected is this wrong can you force all pilots to behave rationally for instance i can personally make more isk running missions than mining my personal cutoff price for trit is around 55 iskunit  far below the market  and this is only running l3 missions   in fact for a mission runner almost all minerals are vastly underpricedovervalued  look at m3hour of ore mined minerals refinedhour and compare against iskhour from running missions and youll see that mineral prices could rise a long way before mission runners would mine instead of mission to make isk  i understand you dont like the balance that currently exists but there is a balance there is nothing that says a different balance would be better than the existing one in any meaningful objective way  base prices in my opinion is a false target   also it is not possible to touch only one aspect of eve without touching everything so id question the position that you can fix mining in isolation also since mining income potential depends on player preferences no gamemechanics change that keeps the game a sandbox is likely to fix thisedit fixed akita ts name i hate when people get my name wrong

i think swapping the recon skill requirement for amarr industrial v one brings out its intended purpose i mean what else can carry 1400 m3 of stuff be agile and use a cov ops cloak after a 30 page thread about making it viable for pvp without any responses what else could it mean ccp clearly wants it to be a haulerand yes i fully endorse this product give it nos and neutralizer range and maybe remove the nosferatu nerf that should stop people thinking lulz when one brings a pilgrim into the gang
i agree i have 54 in all skills and would still be quite happy for ccp to do away with them they are yet another time sink which take attention from the joy of eve imho
most people who quit eve never get to see the exciting bit that we see as their still bogged down by learning skills or being forced to do very very long skills i say just do away with the first teir of learning have have just the socat books
what jade gets up to in game has no bearing on whether hes fit to be on the csm lots of people voted for him because they wanted him there some  most   of them knew who he is and what he does in game if you wanted darius to be chairman of the csm you should have got your alliance off their fat arses and voted for him in the first place
i agree with this fix the fact that this change could potentially mean that the caldari militia can finally kill something and make some of the expensive nano setups less effective does not mean that this error should not be fixed and i endorse itcarrus
the thought occurs that a lot of the current objection to nano ships is because theres a weapon class thats basically utterly uselessno matter how many heavy missiles you fire at a nanoishtar youre not going to do it any damage but at the same time fixing nanoships in such a way as to make the vagabond  and its fellow minmatar ships   actively worse i feel would also be a bad thingsomething as simple as upping the explosion velocity on precision heavy missiles by a bit  maybe to 2kmsec maybe 1500msec  would serve to raise the bar on immune to heavy missiles such that the really good speed ships  eg the vagabond   are still fine in the same situations but the not so good nano ships have a much harder time of it  eg sacrilege ishtar  
seconded thirded and forthed
not seconded it was implemented to limit the overloading of the ships to put in the carriers hangars as there is not a pilot in the ship with the appropriate skills the module dont work and the ship dont get the use of the pilot skills so it is appropriate that the cargo of the ship is limited to his basic capacity not the extended capacity i suppose  never used a carrier   that if you try to put a overloaded ship in the hangar of a carrier it say it cant be moved  if that is not true i think ccp should implement that  unless i am mistaken the change happened when the cargo of ship in a carrier hangar was limited to ammunitions serenity is pointing exactly at the reason why i feel it should not be changed allowing to load the ship as if it was player controlled allow the players to expand the carrying capacity of carriers
actually it does jade won the election the rules say he gets the chairsorry if i was a bit less then accurate in my quoted post
after reading the log and thinking noreal politics are messy you asked for transparency now put on your bigcaptain pants and deal with what it looks like when two people disagree youre seeing the world through rosecolored glasses if you think theres any difference between the arguments in the csm and the billions of arguments to occur between elected officials over the course of human historyour elected officials are still talking to each other and they havent yet started malevolently grinding votes to a halt out of sheer bitterness towards each other by that single metric i am inclined to throw my weight behind their continued progress until such time as they fail to surpass that  low   standard or the next election occurs
out the door
not supportedi think it is the vengeance of a small group of people that could not have their way  or their candidate as a chairmember   and now they try to ruin the whole csm thingediti am just noticing i am wholeheartly agreeing with bob members goons what have you done too me with your threadnaught
is there a reason why t2 nanofibers are equal to t1 polycarbs aux thrusters add less speed then t2 overdrives why not bring nanofibers and polycarbs in line that would reduce speed slightly and make nonspeedy ships less speedy nanoing needs to stay as a valid style of play but some ships just move to fast tbhand the agility thing that nyphur wrote about i didnt know that but it looks like something someone needs to take a closer look at
i expanded on it in an article for massively here its definitely something that needs looked into
i keep forgetting to link that one instead of the original op   
i read nyphrs idea and it is intriquing however would it not be much simpler to have the benefits of nano mods affected by the mass of the ship an interceptor having little mass has the nano mods affected very little and the nano mods are largly unaffected while a battleshipbattlecruiser etc with much greater mass will have its speed modified very little by the nanomods have the mass of the ship reduced by a fixed amount if the ships mass is 100tons have the affected mass be equal to 50tons if the ships mass is 100000tons have the affected mass be equal to 99950tons the same ratio should be applied to max speed agility and accellerationthese numbers have been pulled out of the air but for the sake of illustrating the ideainterceptor 100 tons  speedagility boost 100 of the modulebattleship 1000000 tons  speedagility boost 1 of the moduletldr versiona sliding scale for the benefit of the modulessmall ship little mass  fast large increase to speedbig ship huge mass  slow small increase to speed
not being able to go fast would take the fun out of the game for many of the players nano setups are not overpowered and do not make you the next best thing to invulnerablemission runners playing fw have 2 weeks experience at pvp they should lose to experienced fleets of 4 year old pvp characters nanos inertia stabs and overdrives have already been nerfed and do not need another one
yes yes to fix the problems just train a certain ship exactly what a sandbox game should do force you down a certain path genius
unfortunately this is also true
the main imbalance is the amount of mods increasing speed and mods allowing to kill a fast moving ship the only way to kill a nanoship is to web it other counters eg ecm neuts will just scare it offone mod to kill a nano and except for a ganglink claymore no way to boost its effectiveness there are no rigs or other modules boosting web range or velocity penalty on the other hand you have nanofibres overdrives polycarbs and aux thrusters all increasing speedmy proposal is to release mods and rigs to increase web range that way if you want to effectly counter a nano you will need to sacrifice dps and tank just as a nanoship does to get its speed
nano ships are expensive because they are inherently good
i do not think eve needs less speed actually more speed more maneuvering and such would be lovely yes i want more dynamic fights like the battleships in the videos zooooooooming by in formtion remove 20km scramblers fix precision missiles  other t2 ammo to work against stuff like this
support pushing for this to be looked at though i think its a very very complicated issuefrom my point of view the issue is not the speed tank  in fact i like that this variation exists  i think the problem is how fast they move  yes i know sounds like i am contradicting myself  speed for nanos gives them 2 advantages 1 speed tank makes them difficult to hit2 speed allowing for very very very fast escapesto solve the problem i believe nanos have i think a rebalance to make the nano ships a bit more difficult to hit  reduce sig by quite a lot maybe   while at the same time removing a lot of the speed they have allowing them for very fast escapes of course they should still be faster than a regular cruiser setups but i dont think they should be matching interceptor speedsnow i admit this is a complex issue and my idea might not be great but i certainly think nano fitted cruisers need looking at quite seriously
nerf nanos well some of themships that are built for speed should be left as they are ships that were never meant to go superfast should be restrictedan analogy would be ecm these days only ships that were designed to use ecm modules can use them effectively fitted to other ships the effect is poori think it should be the same for speed setups if a ship was designed for speed then it should be left alone if the ship wasnt primarily designed for speed then it should have more restrictions placed on the maximum speed it can attainhowever they decide to address the nano issue i hope theyre careful about it this one could be a right mess if it isnt thought through properly
the whole point of a nano setup is picking your fights speed tanking does not work nearly as well as everyone tries to say it doesnanos allow a gang of 5 pvpers to have fun in 00 because we can escape the 30 man blobs you remove nanos or make them weaker in any way and you will see 00 get very boring very quickly
i find it rare that they are used that way i often see nano groups in large gangs preying on lone targets before they have a chance to run but it is beside the point wanting immunity is not a good reason to consider something balancedi am all for nano ships having a speed advantage a lot of us just currently feel that the speed nano cruisers can achieve is much faster than should be possible froma cruiser
remember a nerf to nanos is not what is being asked what is being asked is that a buff to the nano counters  webs neuts   be put in place so that the nano is not an i win button because that is what it has becomenanos are going for the price they are because the demand is there for them the demand is there because they are literally almost unbeatable except in a very stacked situation and even then a skilled nano pilot often will escapechange the agility mod on webs so that the bigger the ship is the quicker it deaccerlates that way when a web catches a nano bs it stops dead in its tracks
dual mwds were removed because speed tanking was unbalancedit is still unbalancedfaster ships should have reduced agility factored by sig radius or mass  sig would be better because it would better suit the role bonus of certain ships  speed freaks retain the ability to run away very quicky but lose the ability to pound ships whilst dodging tracking and outrunning missilesor add another module to increase the mass or decrease the agility of a ship  because webs just arent up to the job when the target can just coast out of web rangewhatever the solution something needs to be done to address the balancesmall ships going fast i can live with but the bigger you are the slower you should be and certainly much much much less agile
dont nerf nano boost all race interceptors so they cant be outrun by nano hacs problem solved
so sick of this coming up wish ccp would say something ffs
im fine with the crane having 2 lowslots  its caldari after all caldari always have a paucity of lowslots   but it shouldnt have to use one of them for a fitting mod fitting mods or implants should be required for fits beyond the basic but not for the standard mods every ship of its class fitsits improved agility modifier helps but the advantage of more lowslots on the other brs is telling every other br has better align times and realspace speed than the crane the cranes only advantage is its slightly larger cargo bay4 grid for the crane isnt going to break anything even 1 would mean it can fit mwdcloak without issue if nothing else if you must add 4 grid and move its bay down to the same size as the prowler to make room for the larger generator
i agree completley i use station containers a lot to organise my stuff in my hangers as they often get clogged with all sorts of junk the unfortunate side effect of that of cours is i lose the ability to track certain assests this would certainly make station containers far more functional
while the dev who was saying that searching containers would be a significant added load to the database claimed that it wasnt going to happen due to this there may be other options which might be doablefor example searching specific containers  rather than all containers  or opening a container remotly so one can transfere items to and from iti can definatly apreciate that the search would be even more laggy were it looking in containers i try to avoid ever even opening my assets window on all assets on my main due to the lag it realy needs a filter by system or station or container
more faction stuff is always good

i was thinking it might be cool for corps or individuals to be able to pick color schemes for the ships that they fly with their corp logoalliance logo on the ship might be a good isk sink to charge for custom 2 or 3 tone paint jobs for each ship you want to paintjust a ideadiscuss
i think itd be cool to have your corp logoalliance logo on your ship probably much easier to do just corp logos as they arent created out of gameas for paint jobs meh
play chrome hounds on pvp mode on xbox live and youll see why allowing players to paint thier own ships is a bad idea
i like the idea of paintjobs not letting you select the colour specifically as that leads to bad things happening but instead if you can just select from a list of available colours for each ship
i support this
supports emblems but not paintjobs
i vote for sharkteeth and pinup ladies on my hull how about a furry armor
qfe
yes to alliance members no to gang members good idea though
yes10 would be nice but more would be even better
yes
definately a good idea id add in the possibility of hangers as well for those remote offices that just dont need 7 divisions to function  possibly reducing office rental bill in the process  
no matter how many hangers i have its never enoughsupported
agreed using containers to subdivide hangars isnt the greatest solution great idea
how about a ceo skill or two that does this one hangar without the skill 1 for each level of the rank 1 skill 5 for each level of the rank 35 skill we need more charisma skills anyways and this is one that would actually make sense
if chribba says it should happen then by god it should be good if could change name in individual stations from the default as well
yesalthough thinking about it the whole containerhangar thing together with its rightsmanagement could need a little overhaul imho
yes
might want to consider slightly different colours except greenred  blah blah think of the colourblind etc  
i quote your post because while i would like to contribute something to the thread in addition to just clicking the support box before posting i find that i cannot elaborate or expound on the topic in any meaningful way that would be better than  or yet even live up to   the profundity of the original post itselfyou sir are a gentleman and a scholar and i salute you
being robbed of a capital killmail that you worked hard for sucks a longer self destruct timer for capital ships would be great
killmail obsession is a tragic disease we need to be researching a cure not encouraging it not signed
i spam to prevent spam how ironici could say anything i want here and nobody would read it if i stuck it in when this was really going strong even if there was discussion here  and there is a little bit   no one is going to hunt through 7 pages of signed to find it
i think this forum is a bit counter productive what is the point of having discussions in the other forums if we are just going to have all of them here
i just want to see something done with the tier ii bcs this or really anything
i sort of support this id rather see an anti capital ship class sort of like the spinal mount ion cannon frigates from homeworld basically a ship with one purpose and thats to pwn capital ships its cheaper than a battleship but it has to fly with close protection
only reason to field dreads is to take down poses and other capitals make either one of those reasons obsolete and what use will dreads havecheaper less powerful but more agile equals new form of blob to replace the older one but this time risking less
mmm yes because stealth bombers make battleships worthless right you guys do realize that almost all the damage a dread does is because of the ship bonuses and siege mod right theyd be rather worthless because citadel torps are so slow a bs with an afterburner could probably outrun it and theyd probably do around the same dps as a battleship  going by them only having 3 missile slots   have no cargo room for the huge missiles and be pretty expensive oh and have fun training torps v for this too
burnt pizzas missed meetings late for school late for work missed jetcancycles weve all tried itthere are already builtin features such as notepad calculator and even a browser a little alarmclocktimer wouldnt be too hard  at least i dont think it would be   to add but it would be a very useful gadget
i can dig it edit a thought youd either need to make sure that it doesnt go through the eve sound system until said sound system is something other than a fancy way of torturing the players who use it or accept that most players wouldnt use it for exactly that reason i still like it well enough but that could be a major problem
we should really get this forum locked and the minutes one up and running for disscussion on the turn outs also add the support function to the features and ideas forums pleasethanks
well at least the threads that have been brought up for discussion any way both the ones discussed in the csm and at ccp and lock the new ones that pop up about the issues already discussedbut we should still allow new ideas to filter through that may not have anything to do with whats has been posted as an issue
well my take is thisi and a few friends regularly go out and mine entire belts sometimes 3 or 4 in a session without botting this being said i still have no problem finding ore in high sec in fact even in caldari space i have found mature high sec belts with roids 1020 km across near the cosmos mission sites the only possible reason i would want to see belts changed into exploration sites is if there is a possibility of finding better than normal ore in high sec  ex jaspet or hedbergite  
i didnt even read the wall of text but topic said belts so you got my support
does this apply to high sec and 00 how would you handle npc rats if you have to scan a system to find a belt then hope rats are in the belt youre butchering 00 ratting
noobs are so cute sometimes
 ignoresok then why should a frigate be able to scram both a destroyer and a dreadnought with exactly the same easeits unbalanced
ok unpoliteness aside warp core stabilizers counter one scram point and fit into lowslots they are a direct counter to warp scramblers but hamper targeting speed and targeting range they are designed for travel fits you can not counter a heavy interdictor with these as the module they use has infinite scrampoints  hence the nickname infinipoint  an indirect counter are modules that let you align faster like inertia stabilizers nanofibers polycarbon engine housing  rig   and low friction nozzle joints  rig   they may allow you to warp away before the enemy gets a lock you can counter an infinipoint with these is you warp before the enemy gets a lockknowing this you should also read up on the term nano here on the forums because this is most likely the next thing that will cross your mind  and pop you if it crosses your path ingame   it is currently a very sensitive issue  politely speaking  edit to your question above a dread has nothing to fear from a lone frigate it has enough drone firepower to deal with it plus it can cynojump also no dread will be without support
it has nothing to do with a size issue it is propulsion mechanics and you are not supporting your argument well this belongs in ships and fittings or general discussion until you have a better laid out reasoning on why it is unbalancedand as far as the comment above about dreads not being alone you would be surprised on how many dreadscarriers are lost to players ratting with them and getting popped edir and restructure your proposal and then explain why you think it is unbalanced and make sure you understand the mechanics before you do that it will help otherwise this is troll thread
its unbalanced because a frigate should have little power over a much larger ship it should not only be about propulsion mechanics  it should also be about masssize a frig should not be able to carry enough ws units to scram a ship that size just my opinion  dont have a seizure
well if we use that line of thinking all types of electronic warfare mods on frigate and cruisers would not work on ships that are larger if i am getting to where you are going with this so then the only thing able to tackle say a bs is another bs or capital is that what you are proposing and i am not having a seizure you being a little emo i think
have you tried tackling a much larger ship in a frigate its quite doable but youre usually going to lose that frigate bigger ships will almost always carry a web or drones that will kill you thats really the best counter to a warp scrambler ewar is the only thing that makes a frigate remotely useful so nerfing it makes them uselessas far as low sec goes you have very little to fear if youre not being stupid or looking for a fight
no what im suggesting  in a roundabout way i guess   is that it should take more than one small tackler to stop a big shipbtw i dont have a problem with tackling  piracy at all per se  its all good  it just needs tweaking in my opinionno just i think youre being sarcastic and arrogant
solauren im sympathetic to where youre coming from but i agree with some of these other folks that the mechanics for preventing pirate attacks in losec already existi think it would be interesting to see more specifically getaway mods for pilots that just want to run and not fight such as a wcslike mod powerful enough to overcome warp interdiction but which takes up enormous grid and cpu and sucks cap prodigiously  the idea being that ships fitting them wouldnt be able to do much else or sustain it for very long of course a cloaking device already fills that combatavoidance rolefundamentally though i think the way to make losec more populated if thats the goal being discussed here is to make it more rewarding not less riskyapologies no support
ok fairy nuff just my thoughts thanks
o ya coolaid man style
needs more support UFFFD
this is serious business
capitals are not t2 battleshipsits purpose is to cut down the number of capital pilots out there ccp have stated many times that they never intended capitals to be nearly as common as they are now anyone can get one particularly carriers
capital ships are not t2 bs they are t1 ships does your t1 cruiser get a bonus for the levels in frigate that you have no so neither do capitals get a bonus for the levels in bs you have
as long as you are not minmatar

i think a great many of you will be extremely happy with the results the meetings in iceland were really really productive and i think better than anyone anticipated im going to defer on any details until the official minutes and such are posted but suffice to say everyone is alive and for the most part got along swimmingly
nice good work csm cant wait to see the writeups
the forums are quiet because were waiting for news and keeping up the comments of haha you guys are still trying to argue with jade and convince him of the error of his views is like beating a dead horse no fun anymoreccp hasnt even posted the first meeting minutes typical behavior from them actually despite all the fanfare when they announced this csm thing anyway something will get posted at some point and whatever blah blah blah let me know when whatever issues they decide to fix get fixed
ah did not know about that particular web page apologiesso um whats the proclamations forum for
failed forum experiment
its a honey pot for bans thats what
just got back home today the meeting a success the csm acted professionally overall ccp were open and gave both well considered answers and together we had good debatediscussion around whats possiblenot possible for all the recommendations minutes etc will take a while to put together as we covered over 30 issues as well as lessons on how to improve the csm recommendation process during the 3 days
does that mean we will soon see threads in the proclamation forumid love to get an overview of all minutes ect
ank and myself will be going over the minutes as soon as we are able toother than that i cant do anything but echo serenitys comments it was an amazingly productive trip i just gotta catch up on some sleep
good to hear that it was productiveim looking forward to the minutesi hope you all had a great time therehow are the yogurt deserts    
are the minutes ready yet nook how about nowglad to hear all went well and that ccp was as commited to the csm as they werelooking forward to the minutesoutcome
we didnt have those but the ccp cooks made some amazingly delicious cake o
yeah solvej is good at that stuff i just arrived at home 5 minutes ago im extremely excited about the outcome of this csm meeting i simply cant wait till the minutes are releasedccp listened to us indeed and they were quite open about how we could influence their planning so overall good stuff
just got back myself all in all it was an excellent weekend extremely productive very interesting and i think weve actually done a lot of high quality brainstorming on some pretty key issues and we managed all this in the full glare of intense press attention and camera crews with a great deal of professionalism and intellectual investment from both ccp and the csm really was a bold experiment and hats off to the ccp guys who talked the company into taking this risky venture  it absolutely paid offi cant imagine how it could possible have gone better to be honest was really great meeting everyone and i considered it an honour and a privilege to be a part of this superb inaugural csm details are gonna have to wait till weve slept i think  
its called skyr they get upset when you call it yogurt keep calling it yogurt  
can we have a caod type forum for fw folks to wag their epeen thanks
i have not read it but i am sure someone somewhere has suggested this beforewhy cant ccp do an official killboard for all players kms were always logged now there is a nicer button for them on the character sheetepeen waggling sure but lots of us love statsps i am not an ace pvper i have some dire stats on some kbs from when i started in 00 hehe

the supposed advantage of versatility for minmatar ships does have its arguments but the minmatar capitals really need to be looked at it not as though there are many and varied roles that they can be used forthe minmatar dreadnoughts are in comparison to the number of sps required to fly them effectively the worst sp investment in the game im not exactly sure what the additional sps actually are thoughthe roi on the naglfar is the worst in game although imo after investing all that training time people should be saying things like the naglfar is hard to train up but when you have the skills trained up it does a good 10 more damageso considering the invested training time and the comparatively current weak result i fully support this proposal
its more commonly known as a terrible troll you can spot these because they claim a lot in a small amount of space but really have nothing to show for it

csm has no business dictating or advising ccp on its billing practices csm just makes recomendations about some game mechanics change ideas if and only if they get voted for by 5 of the playerbase  where the playerbase is the nr of accountsi havent read the thread and i have no intention of doing so but if any csm actually took this thread seriously it just goes to show you that not even them knew what they were voted for
i dont see a problem of adding 60 day cards however i dont see a real reason to remove the 90 day ones too this topic needs more support setana you are pointless troll what exactly in my position looks undesided 
wheres that bit from family guy about undecided voters  when lois was campaigning i never find it when i need it  
almost 900 posts and not a single answer from ccp this might mean the end of my game with them and it looks like alot of people seem to feel the same waycongratulations to ccp from messing up an awsome idea the buying gtcs with isk was one of the main reasons i was sticking with this game no way im going to pay more for the same experience
well if they introduce this they better introduce a capital mining ship otherwise i dont see the point 
on the 8th day god said it should be so and so it should as long as only in amarr and on the starmap so we can bask in the glory of the t2 veldnaught edit to support
give the man his true veldnaught 
i did have a small thought earlier lookin at the minamatr battleshipsif its a good alpha ship were lookin at then maybe change the maelstroms rof bonus to a 5 damage one that way none the other ships become overpowered  altho they coudl do with a bit of love   but as a first startin point having 8 x 1400mm iis with 5 per level damage would give a nice alpha compared to what it is at presentits not going to solve all the problems but its an option that could be installed relativly easily am sure since its just one ship becomin slightly more powerful afterall they are supposed to be best alphalousy dpsmaybe add a few more damage points to each ammo types damage types it only needs 1 on each damage type and that would increase damage consiberably the more skilled u area small example fusion does 32 exp32  25 damage  40 x11 damage mod  approx 1400s on my phoon    440now change that to 33exp33  25 damage  4125 x11  45375so yeah just its not a vast difference but you get what i mean ccp can sort the figures outbut my theory is that the more skilled u are then the more the percentage is factored in and ur rewarded with a bigger damage output like  i believe   it shud be

well we certainly argued for it the database calls thing was that because it was an option wed all use it more  and yep we would but end of the day its balancing something thats good for everyone against thrashing the database  end of the day we asked for this they are looking into the implementation fingers crossed

you do realize that such a ship would come with a corresponding decrease in hp from that of a regular freighter but because it still retains the dissadvantages of the freighter it would still be jut as easy to catchplease let the op give an example of a situation in which such a freighter would be prefered over a normal freighter or a tanked transport ship and would not be easily gankable by 4 battleships which would pay their isk loss through the newly obtained cargo

well you touch on two separate aspects one is the fact that highsec missionrunning is far too profitable for the risks involved  compared to lowsec00 missionrunning   the other is that l4 missionrunning in highsec is far more profitable than mining in highsec even with highsec mining being far too profitable compared to the risks involved when compared to lowsec mining and slightly a bit too profitable compared to 00 miningso yes there is a problem when one type of solo activity  ie missionrunning l4s in particular   is far more profitable than anything else you can do for an isk source in a particular area  npc trade routes mining belt ratting   and theres even a bigger problem if any particular activity is not noticeably more profitable in lower security ratingsthe devs have repeatedly stated that theyre trying to get people out in lowsec and 00 as most of highsec is way too crowded with vasts swathes of 00 space being practically empty and a lot of lowsec underpopulated  heck theres even some highsec regions that are sparsely populated too   as long as the network effect of having vast numbers of people in a certain crowded area  market and mission hubs   cant be balanced against additional incentives to leave that area  better income elsewhere preferably in lowsec or 00   they wont acheive that desire of them of spreading people aroundso yes a lot of things are wrong not just miningas for l3l4 missions one possible solution is to make them much more dangerous than they already are so dangerous in fact that l3s would be about on par with a l4 of today and l4s would be basically just as hard as l5s are right now while keeping the same overall reward levels well that or scripting variable delays or variable spawns in missions depending on system security rating in such a way as to have it adversely affect the revenue potential in highsec and boost it in lowsec00 but thats a whole different problembase prices as absolutes are indeed a false target base prices as ratios however are a vital target if all the rest of the current oremining system is to remain intact  ie the rocks remain where they are the mining is done the same way it is done now etc  in order to do that you need alternative blueprints that can soak up larger quantities of highends  and less lowends especially trit   to obtain the same items driving prices slowly closer to the originally intended ratiosif you dont want to do that you have to release pressure from the highends by introducing a lot more lowends  at the expense of some highends   in drone alloys and even some highend oresor sure you can keep makeups but completely abandon the current ore distribution system and shuffle ores around for instance swap omber with scordite and jaspet with veldspar that would solve things in a weird way but it would solve themheck you could instead revamp the entire mining system completely and have all ores available in all system securities just with different concentrations of ore  ie multipliers to cubic meters mined multipliers ranging from say x01 up to x10 depending on ore type and system security  
veldspar is a nice high profit ore to help newbies get on their financial feetrunning level 4 missions is a much faster means to earn income for me and i get to sell highend ores to the market in empire space to bootso what this boils down to for me is that there are only 200 moons each for the two most needed t2 materials well that seems fine to me too since what else are people going to fight over its not like we can have a helen of troy whose face launched a thousand ships so it comes down to territory which comes down to productive landholding productive land means setting up guard posts forts etc the eve equivalent is pos and sovereigntyperhaps someone can fill me in  are all these rare moons in the same place or are they evenly scattered throughout the eve cluster
theoretically they should be randomly  and evenly   distributed across the entire space of eve  including places you cant moonmine them that is in 04 and above  practically it appears that a rather large number  unofficial and therefore not very reliable sources quote numbers up to 70 of the total mineable moons   with dysprosium and promethium are relatively clustered and being occupied or at least under harassment by red alliance  and their friends   who use every tool available at their disposal  including but certainly not limited to out of reinforced mode timeshifting in defence massive capital fleet hotdrops for both offence and defence especially quick defence when the timeshift is successfull out of any enemy active timezone and so on and so forth   to hold those moons under their production  or at least deny anybody else their use   with little or no significant chances of anybody claiming them back for any significant periods of timein other words its not so much that the dysprosiumpromethium moons are too valuable its that the current pos mechanics  setup reinforced modes moon mining etc   is very prone to borderline exploitworthy usage by a relatively small band of dedicated playersseing how chances are slim to none to see any significant progress on the almost totally broken pos warfare field the next best thing is to reduce the strategic importance of those moons to more reasonable levels where its no longer profitable to hold a large capital fleet active for the sole purpose of defending those moons and nothing else
i like the idea of different blueprint requirements to reach the same end it opens up the sandbox a little more which is goodthe picture i have in my head is that a player gets the stuff together to invent item x they then should get a choice of what kind of blueprint in terms of mineral requirements they would prefer less of one thing more of another maybe they have a deal with another corp to supply them with y mineral classic blueprint whatever this would allow people to plan for the future  much like now   and take the necessary steps to make money anyway this sort of thing would allow the power builders freedom to play with their supply chain while also giving the casual builder some leverage vs the primary moon holders
ok i agree that running missions is more profitable but i cant comment on if it is too profitable in the context of your assumptions i would agree that it is out of balance but i dont agree with all your assumptions namely the one about risk being a suitable basis for determining reward as my belief is risk is too subjectiveunfortunately i think trading the market is the most profitable thing you can do in an area do mission runners complain about trading being unbalanced there is only financial risk involved with trading  you dont even have to undock wheres the risk in that hopefully that will emphasize what i mean by risk being nonobjectivei understand that but i think thats dangerous and i think ccp does too you can lead a horse to water and all that trying to force players into an area where they dont want to go is tantamount to failure now if isk etc are tweaked and players move of their own volition thats one thing however the dangers associated with such a shift are contributors to the timeframe i think ccp are wisely taking time to make a correct decision rather than a fast change now because of the possible ramificationsi think the things you have mentioned are just a symptom not a problem in and of themselves the thing that is really causing the imbalance is that i can generate isk regardless of how many ships modules and minerals are in circulation rewards from missions should adjust based on items in hangars and space and insurance etc should just shuffle money around rather than be a source or sinkwhy do we need to keep things in their current locations i thought a goal was to change to different locations  or at least make a more homogeneous population density across space ratios are also largely irrelevant if those ratios are arbitraryarbitrary mineral composition of objects would break things pretty terribly i would prefer to see mineral composition tied more directly into item function personally i would rather see a movement of ore types  eg omber kernite pyrox   from highsec into lowsec before mucking about with item compositionactually now that i think about it that would probably cause a horde of people to jump ship traders to get more isk and midrange mineral prices to skyrocket resulting in wholesale inflation and an overall drop in demand  for minerals on the market  people would likely shift to producing them privately   so the higher prices and arbitrary price ratio of minerals wouldnt really be a benefit to anyone
the most important distinction between mining missionrunning belt ratting and npc trade routing on one side and market trading on the other is that the former ones are mainly  you could argue that in most cases theyre exclusively   pve activities whereas the latter is mainly  and lately quite completely   a pvp activitytheres no need to limit potential rewards in any pvp activities that are very fair for pretty much everybody participating  market pvp being one   only in potentially endlessly repeatable pve activities  endlessly for all practical intents and purposes not actually infinite  things like missionrunning being the best example here  
personally i beleive that ccp have located the ore types according to what they currently perceive the risk reward ratio to be from npc entities sadly low sec is the most dangerous space as its open and practically lawless for players high sec gets concord 00 gets alliances as player deteriants low sec gets nonebut just maybe with the expansion of faction warfare low sec may provide better ratios in future
by your own account then lowsec ore should earn at least as much as 00 ore then why the hell do you oppose something that will bring back the value of lowsec ore above that of highsec ore 
read again plz i even underlined it so it sinks ini say ccp have set reward levels according to npc threats not players why because thats the only threat that ccp have direct control overpretty bloody simple conceptok now go bandage your foot
double post lol
lets see if you can recognize these statements and the logic linking them togethera  ccp set reward only based on npc threatb  sadly lowsec threat from players is much higher than lowsec threat from npcsc  lowsec player threat is even higher than 00 threat from playersd  ccp should make it so that lowsec mining rewards are higher than highsece  ccp should make it so that lowsec mining rewards are higher than 00a implies da plus b implies d even strongera plus b and then also c makes d a definite must and even borderline implies eabc  your statementsyoure opposing statement d which logically follows from a b and cget it now 
what is the problem with simply makes higher yeild roids spawn in low sec and 00 than high sec you have free range still on what to mine ore wise it simply means that you are virtually guaranteed more minerals in low sec than in high sec mining the almost same asteroid minerals still fluctuate as intended and people will still mine the ore that gives the most isk  hour in their security belt it would also help offset the fact that mining for lowends in 00 takes longer than ratting up low ends assuming everyone agrees that mining should actually be the best source of minerals over ratting
problem  none whatsoever its one of the many possible solutions

i can announce that ccp actually liked my idea for spaceprostitutes to become a new upkeep requirement for deep space pos towers
obvious troll is obvious 
not a troll think it through those poor blue collar workers on all the alliance towers need some entertainment right how about they have a morale counter alongside their fuel counter and it begins to slip down when they dont have enough luxuries drink ciggies drugs and hookers to keep them comfortable in the downtime between their shifts maintaining all the hangers and moon mining rather than forcing alliances to shift boring rubbish like robotics and mechanical parts lets have supply convoys of luxuries needed to keep pos grinding away at their optimum levels itd be greatyou need to watch outland and see that deepspace stations are gritty places with hardbitten riggers that need the comfort of professionals from time to time
well thought it through and
post it as an idea and i will approve it great idea

im lost here let me see if i get itjade creates la maisongoon copy all and rehost when jade offline itjade claims that it was all invented by goonsis that rightanyway it doesnt matter to the csm business judge jade by his chatlogs at csm thats all
not that i think ccp will do a damn thing about itthe csm will most likely vote it straight off the agenda like they did with the nighthawk  
csm will ignore it because the pveers will tell us that precision heavies are great for hitting small stuff in missions and the pvpers will probably do the same tbhi think ill get some numbers together later and start a new nighthawk thread asking for the useless precision bonus to be changed to explosion velocity i expect ill be told that the nighthawk is a wonderful antisupport ship with a huge tank and is probably overpowered if anything
a small adjustment to explosion velocity should be in order for precision heavy missiles

average speed of a t2 polyed hac  bar the vagabond   is 35kms4kms which of your interceptors were they outrunning againthe problem is most likely on your end if this is a regular occurrence
the problem is more that people think 35kms to 4kms  and beyond   is far faster than what a cruiser should be acievingi happen to disagree with my alliance mate on this one i do not think the difference in speed between interceptors and nano hacs is the problem interceptors are fine it is just the nanohacs which are too fast
stop whining about nanos and learn to fly rapiers
the fact that you name a specific ship for combating them only serves to further proove the point that they need a rebalance
no need to change nanos they are a great compliment to internet spaceships work as intendedneed good fcs good pilots and you will have good fun regardless of whether you missiles can hit a target traveling faster than you sorry pale just cause you cant kill something cause you fail doesnt mean the rest of eve is having the same problem
we have actually have developed a very sucessful stratagy for killing nano cruisersbut again doesnt make them balancedbut as with all nano killing stratgys i can think of ours requires the use of specific ships with specific bonussand that is the problem
1im sick of dealing with tanked vagabondsthey shield tank their mids and speed tank their highs and can keep up with interceptors while i have no qualms with them being the fastest ship in their class they should not be able to outrun frigates and i
posting in a pitch and fork thread that gives no ideea suggestions except for ive had enough and im not going to take this anymore
all kills should count for rank and standings including kills made so farlets say ship kills are given status by percentage and by type of ship  ie destroyers more than frigates bcs more than destroyers t2 more than the t1 varient etc  pod kills are a tad more than frigates maybefcs get a percentage of all kills made by fleetnote if you are supporting click the support tab while posting so it countsedit another idea is the higher the rank you kill is the higher the status you get by just a bit though
yes
agreed it should definitely be made retroactive as mentioned in the original post
i find it funny that a complete carebear like me can outrank a fleet commander who has killed thousands of gallente also it would be nice to get some parity since killing members of the enemy militia  specifically podkilling members of the npc militia corp   will drop your standings with themwouldnt mind seeing little boosts for being on kills personally would have to be balanced to account for the number of kills a person can get and the average value of the kill but id like to see it
many pilots are not into the caping many people here only for the pvpstandings should reflect thisvibenaion2
yes i thought this would have been implemented from the beginning
agreed fighting and killing for your faction should increase your faction and rank
i support my own post p
here here great idea would make fleet warfare even more rewarding
agreed
if fw is meant to give people a bridge from empire to 00 then they should be rewarded for doing the kind of pvp they will see in 00 i doubt they will be capping plexes  or killing a pos   as often as they are fighting other players in gangs and blobs it just makes sense to give a rank increase for kills
rgr that
completely agree
agreed
agree
agree
yep ship kills against players who are in enemy militias should count for something
instead of providing ranks for pvp other sets of decorations should be developedwhy i dont think rank should be tied directly to pvpkilling enemy pilots is not the objective from the point of view of the militia corporations and the factions giving out ranks you gain standingrank by completing objectives either missions and dungeons both of which are in hostile low sec the npcs giving you ranks care very little  at the moment   how many enemy ships you destroyed in the past month they want their objectives completed keep the current rank mechanic as it encourage pilots to take part in the objective based combat that factional warfare has tried to addyou lose standing with any npc corp you shoot upon be its members pcs or npcs if you shoot a lot of swa alt scouts you will have a low standing with swa you gain standing with npc corporations by doing missions  and now dungeons   for them you dont gain standing with the caldari state when you kill guristas rats unless it is in doing a missionin general more decorations appear to be on the drawing board and there is an opportunity to have a pvp seta decoration option for pvp  the acefor example lets take the classic idea of the ace each nation has its aces these individuals may not be the highest ranks but they are experienced combat pilots and are decorated for their contribution to the war effort when a pilot is listed as dealing the most damage on a kill he is receives a confirmed kill if the pilot participated in but was not the main damage dealer they get 25 confirmed kill this is only against opposing militiarookie  0 combat kills the pilot has yet to be tested by his peers in combatbloodied  1 combat kill this pilot has had a taste for combat but not much more than a skirmishveteran  3 combat kills this pilot has seen combat several times or been part of a major battleace  5 combat kills this pilot has made a name for himself opposing forces should be wary when he takes to the fieldmultiple ace  for each successive set of 5 kills a pilot receives a device that is added to his ace decorationother possible decorations might be theater decorations if you are take part in the occupying of a number  varies by region   systems in a region you gain your races campaign ribbon for that region so a federation pilot who captures a single system in the citadel might get a campaign decoration it may take a republic pilot in the bleak lands 3 systems  due to number of low security systems allowed to be occupied  might even have a decoration for those pilots who lost ships
if this is true then fcs should also be penalized for fleet losses this ensures that one person is not reaping benefits at the expense of his men since they could simply be disposable which they really arent if they were not penalized for losses nub fcs would simply leeroy his entire group into a blob and get some kills and points at the expense of others dying in a fire the entire fleet should get an equal part of the kill rather than bending points towards a particular fc either way i would like a shiny epeen badge for killing stuff
i agree this bunker plex taking is pointless pvp is the way it really the only reason most play fw
just a reminder people check the support box if youre posting
this needs to be implemented
yea
agree
agreed
agreed
this is an interesting idea which should be doable by ccpbut i wish ccp would go a step further and actually database all kills in the game and keep an official killboard for all playersthen they could implement all kinds of interesting metrics to gauge a characters performance wrt pvp
strongly agree
yes oh god yes
nope i want to use that character in the future not have him stuck in just 2 nations space
hellz yeah
just by fighting against the oposing faction you lose status to them unles i am mistaken the theory of this is why not get some rank out of it
please visit your user settings to reenable images
isnt the point supposed to be that we are all supposed to be capping systems and whoever owns the system we are trying to cap should be coming to pvp with us there it seems everyone has just joined up to do the kind of pvp youd do in 00 space it is supposed to be about capturing enemy systems and killing them when they try to capture yours not camping gates and roaming aroundseems to me you should be getting pvp by capturing points if you go to cap an outpost and then kill an enemy fleet who tries to come and defend it then you capture the outpost and all get standings and ranks if you defeat an enemy fleet trying to capture one of your outposts then presumably you get vistory points for the defenceif anything i think they should take the npcs and ship restrictions off the outposts so anyone and everyone can go there to attack or defend or at least do something to encourage people to want to cap systems by doing pvp rather than cap systems or do pvp xp for kills will only encourage less capturing of systems
implement points  doesnt have to be vp and count towards system occupancy althuogh it could   and thus ranksstandingmedals for points based on target isk value and size its not any more exploitable than the current system indeed less so as if you want serious points you have to kill your alt in his golem 50 times instead of in his ibis etc

i did suggest that larger ships grant more status but your idea seems alot less exploitable and well thought out

goodness yes come to that itd be nice to see ship fittings too
dont talk back to her you insolent dog she got elected because of her atributes you know why do you need a new astrometrics ship besides the oh cool new class of ships factor 
yes to gang dont care about alliance  theyll join the fight by providing logistics up until all the targets are blinky red anywayi dont see that its fair for a gang of three can flippers in caracals with t1 fittings to have the upper hand over five battle hulks with t2 combat drones in losec we could open fire before blinky red and just soak up the sec status hit in hisec we have no option but to sit by and watch the gang member being ganked  or simply put up with losing whatever ore is still in the can  i group with npc corp members all the time they dont get the privilege of seeing pirates blinking red when a corpmate is attacked
if this were to happen youd be here whining in a few days and begging ccp to gake it back read up on the origins of the can flagging thing who asked it and what its repercusions were
as it stands right now self destruct serves almost no purpose other than to  off the people who are trying to kill you by robbing them of epeen stroking kill board stats self destruct as a game mechanic should be more useful than that we have seen the commander of a nyx fly one straight on into a station for massive effect why should we not have the same ability in game  collision physics aside   damage should be distributed across targets within the area of effect not static for all targetskill mail generates with parties involved as normal laid the final blow goes to the self destructoryou get podded automatically in the process  every action has to have a price you arent allowed to be a martyr without dying  hullsize time to destruct damage frigate 10 seconds 500 damage within 10kmcruiser 20 seconds 1800 damage within 10kmbc 40 seconds 4500 damage within 15kmbattleship 80 seconds 8200 damage within 15kmcarrier 160 seconds 100000 damage within 20km dread 210 seconds 150000 damage within 25km mother 320 seconds 200000 damage within 30km titan 480 seconds 250000 damage within 35km what will this accomplish1 an added disincentive to blob warfare2 giving you a better reason to kill your self3 giving you the opportunity to take some one or several some ones with you puts on the flame ant suit   ok fire when ready
1   yes it is2   there are some morons out there that when they know they are doomed anyway they self destruct to destroy your killmail why should you give them more reasons to be morons3   although the idea seems very logical it would make titans and capitals even more powerfulso although what you say seems logical it would not adding fun to the game imo
yes 
we need more internal bickering for the minmatar we could have peaceniks we could have genociders and those who support the war as it is currently being wagedthe amarr need some serious division youve already put the houses and the theology council behind her perhaps the speakers of truth could oppose herand give us an update on the situation in the ammatar mandate
cant believe im agreeing with a goon oh wellps i feel dirty  
this is full of failure cascade not signed  not supported
ok i have been reading the csm forums for the past few days and i have come to the conclusion that they are worthless and not going to help the game in anyway reason being is that 80 of the the csms are carebears  besides the goons   that are discussing topics such as capitalonline or titans and cynojammers and how to circumvent it i am calling for impeachment of the current carebear csms as they have no experience wthe topics of 00 being discussedalso as we have seen nothing to date has changed nor will it or if this will not happen that the csm delegation be split up into 2 divisions consisting of 00  low sec only pilots and the other division being that of the empire carebears
id actually truly forgotten about the csmi had a look at the proclamation thread and its empty where should i be looking for anything pertinantskunk
first of all because the chairman of the csm is not in a 00 alliance does not automatically mean that he is a carebearabout the calls for impeachment that are 80 goonies and their alts and fanboys that could not get there candidate as a chairman of the csm instead of living with the fact and move on they now try to get their epic lulz by ruining it for everybody elsethird the topics are discussed by the csm because they were brought up to them by the playerbasedemocracy would be great if we can ever make the damn thing work
just ignore it the csm is so far beyond saving that its rediculous how anyone thought we could have an unbiased 3rd party between us and the devs completely blows my mindthey werent going to change the game before and they certainly arent going to change the game now
living in empire  carebear with all the froth on topcsms that live in empire should not discuss the fate of 00 aspects and way of lifeempire  00 thus they should not discuss the matter simple as thatyes playerbase brought the matter up but in the end the csms are the ones that are going to decide the fate or sway the fate of the matter at hand
well i know for a fact that jade doesnt stick to high sec and we all know that 00 player love to whine at high sec players so why isnt it allowed the other way arround
also dont assume that people in lowsec want to be lumped in with 00capitals and sov mechanics are legitimate concerns some people have you cannot simply dismiss it as hurr hurr empire carebears i am awesome
the whole thing was a failure right from the start i dont expect anything good ever to come out of it
yes the head of star fraction is a carebear the logic is impeccable 1010
you really dont have a clue about what you are saying dont you  carebears  
well those do need fixing
reason i lumped lowsec pilots w 00 pilots is because lowsec pilots actually have interaction with capitals and such
where have i specifically targeted jade constantine
i dont understand what you are getting at
star fraction lives in empireyou said all empire dwellers are carebearstherefore you targeted all the empire dwelling csmsgood troll or stupid poster 
empire dwellers are carebears simple as that they dont want to run the risk of losing a ship thus they fall under the protection of concord  carebearthis is not a troll this is a honest to god post that i think the csms is a failure ccp xhagen had a brilliant idea on paper but unfortunately this is not working out  
definately stupid poster
1 while i have similar concerns if the csm can achieve change from the initial feedback of the meeting with ccp a lot of good came out of it hopefully this is a positive sign 2 the csm is a medium through which the players communicate ie players raise the issues which the csm formalize and present to ccp as a result the composition of the csm should not impact the issues being discussed3 in your opening post you call everyone on the csm a carebear  except the goons   you then continue to say everyone living in empire is a carebear when someone clearly points out that the chair of the csm is not a carebear you ask where you said they were refer to two facts immediate after 3 4 that leads the average reader to the conclusion that you are indeed stupido7
not quite truei am an empire war guy nowdays in the past i have been hugely involved in what you might term real 00 lifei have done pos take downs i have thrown up offensive poss i have organized cyno chains i have been part of campaigns to eradicate alliances i have been in eradicated alliances i have been in big name corps i have been a director of not entirely unknown corpsmany of my old friends got burnt out on the whole pos side of things thats why you will see a lot of ex 00 movers and shakers back in empire nowdays empire war is almost as much fun as eve was pre sov faction warfare gives people the big gang action without the alarm cloak pos fueling  pos take downs
no i actually never implicated the chair not 1 time did i ever implicate jade i have respect for jade and sf what i am talking about is the actual carebears crim de le crim
i completely understand that dhofren i get burned out at pos warfare aswell what my beef is with the csm delegation is the fact that there are csms that are discussing this that have had 0 interaction with the problems at hand and thus cannot properly understand the problem at hand and make blindsighted fixs to the mechanic
itt people think csm has any kind of power and that it is absolutely impossible for the people without 00 experience to let the 00 people do the talking on those issues
i dont see the point of the csm if you trust ccp play the game if you dont quit there will never be a outside body that knows what ccp does or doesnt do
just hire mercs to kill all csm members
this post lacks logic in fact i think this post is completely wrong on all accountssuffice to say i think you should hold judgement till the minutes for the iceland meetings are out also you cant group people im most known as a carebear for instance but that couldnt be further from the truthso wait till the minutes are out i think it could change the general view on how csm operates and have influence trust me its there
funny thing is csm was an epic success and those nine players had a hellova of experience in all aspects of the game in my assessment we discussed a great range of issues and got a lot high quality debate from the ccp team including their leaderdevelopers and senior executive group minutes are being produced to show the detailed outcomes but lets just say a lot of people are going to be pretty damn surprised at how influential this thing is and how seriously ccp is taking it csm is here to stay and i predict the winter elections are going to be pretty massivesure this time round only gs and cva took the thing seriously from the 00 alliances thats not going to happen again i assure youbut luckily for eve and the player base these nine were great meroving pvpcombat dynamismrphardin00 allianceorganizationrpankempireeconomymissionswarconsequencedarius00 alliancelarge scale organizationsovbane00 alliancesovposdierdraempirenew playerswarfareserenity00 alliancesoveconomyfinancelavistasmall scale pvpeconomicsinvestmentfinanceinannaindustryagentsuirpnow come on really thats a pretty damn good group we had a decent cross section of empire00alliancecorpmissioning focus and pretty much everyone had the knowledge to comment intelligently on all issues fingers crossed the next csm does as well
heh i think i can speak for the entire council when i say bring it
someone will whine about the lack of piracy being listed but quite frankly its also presented despite popular belief just a shame no piracy issues were raised
lol i was trying not to out peoples pirate alts you know
i second the hire mercs goonswarm certainly needs more wardecs where i will never see them beyond the mailbox
the only thing that surprises me is that anyone is surprised the csm became a useless titanic failurelike all previous attempts at player representation  star wars galaxies senate   it has become nothing but a collective im more important than you circle jerk in which the only people who thinks the csm means anything at all are the members of iti refuse to take it seriously at all until i see something meaningful come of it for example what is the 1 problem with eve when you ask most people the answer lag nothing else really matters if the servers themselves are unable to keep up with the growth of the game and the size of conflicts does it freaking matter how pos warfare works or faction warfare or unnerfing the raptor etc if the damn game is unplayableso far complete silence from the devs nothing from the csm except pages of transcripts of petty squabbling about whos epeen is larger which i got tired of reading after the second page about this important game breaking issuehow about we end this charade of democracy in eve hire a professional pr person  sorry community relations has been atrociously bad since kieron leftwas pushed out   and maybe a game developer or two ccp isnt going to change one damn thing that they want to do based on votes by the csm  assuming they have some time left over after epeen size debates to tackle anything else    and to anyone who thinks they will ever do so i have some beach property in nevada i want to sell you   the csm is at best a distraction at worst its sucking time and resources away from what really needs to be done
pats alexa on the headthere there
see this is where you part company with reality lag is horrible sure but you dont solve it by waving a magic wand and inventing miraculous internet connections 20x better than the ones we have coupled with uber servers of doom that are so powerful database efficiency doesnt come into the equationproblem of lag in eve comes down to game mechanics that concentrate too many players all doing the same thing in the same place solution to lag is spreading those players out by providing distributed objectives that force fleets to break up and do different things at the same time to be effective in the strategic wargame of eve this are pretty simple concepts and things that the csm and ccp agreed onas for the rest of your post ill simply say you are very wrong and the months ahead will show you just how wrong you truly are
arrogance of some 00 dwellers  total fail
not supporting csm is the coward way outlet them work and them you can judge its like hiring a financist and giving him one week to put the company on the tracksgiveem time to work thats all
jade constantwalloftext is a lot of things but a 00 carebear is not one of them pretty sure he was the biggest ego in the gnw long ago also as 00 people love to poke at empire topics simply because they have alts for making isk or the markets the empire csm have every right to talk about 00 and if you are scared of the topics that will come up quite ing and post some 00 issues for them to discuss with ccp
eh i think you people are starting to make the myth into the man ive seen more interaction from devs than i usually saw from kieron when you consider his job was communicating with us and wrangler seems just fine to meoh and if you have an issue for thecsm that can fix lag a problem that ccp isnt able to fix with cutting edge technology and programming without breaking up the server or something dumb like that then id love to hear it
initial feedback from csm iceland meeting here
bumpnobody against
gets my vote
finally a good ideea  and look so few csm votes for it thats how you know its a good ideea   
UFFFDcould we have an audible notification for ecmscramming
yeah a specific sound for each type of ewar and be able to chose separately which of these sounds we want enabled
like it or not killmails are part of the game and part of the allure for many players i dont see a problem with it since we are already playing internet spaceships

despite i chose to do this once on an alt i cant deny its wrong and vote yes
posting in a thread of a km addictwhy do you want to deny the victims right of using a scorched earth tactic just screenshot it and fake a km with just the ship dying its an accepted practice
so what is the real problemthat they selfdestruct to deny lootthat they selfdestruct to deny killmailthat they they can escape from their locked down ship without ejectingit might be interesting  in a completely stupid and impractal way   to completely remove the option for selfdestruction that way when you find a solo mothership pilot you can lock him down and hold him in place until he ejects and gives the entire ship along with all its modules otherwise just issue a killmail on all player deaths let the suicidal pilot brag about his selfinflicted death on the killboards if he is fast enough he might even get credit for doing the most damage to his own ship ps  not supported because i really dont care
the problem is the 2 minute timer is much too short for capital shipsalso supportin dis
sding capitals are a joke this needs a fix
there have been a number of times where ill encounter some random issue on tranquility which ive never been able to reproduce and which is not mentioned on the known issues page so i head over to singularity to try it out just to find that ive  once again   neglected my skillset on singularity and that im now weeks  sometimes a few months   behind tranquility and can not even try to reproduce what i was doing on tranquility because i cannot fly that particular ship or use that particular modulesure i could still file a bug report but how often do you tell someone that you encountered a problem and you have no idea how to reproduce it as a software developer myself i find that very annoying and rather uselessccp has stated that you should not be able to set your skills on singularity to whatever you wish as that would prevent people from testing skill training  a bunch of hogwash if you ask me but whatever   nonetheless the idea im presenting shouldnt conflict with that it would not allow people to set your skills to anything you wish rather it would simply copy your skills from tranquility to singularityadditionally when someone doesnt pay for their account it expires  obviously   when singularity gets mirrored that account remains expired even when the player resubscribes after the mirror to fix this intervention is required by ccp to allow the singularity account to be able to connect once again my solution should also resolve this in my opinionfurthermore ccp has stated that copying data from tranquility to singularity takes time and effort ive realized this and have also taken it into considering into my idea since were only copying subscription and skillset information very little effort should be involved and it should all be automated theres no moons to reseed no starbases to remove no manufacturingresearch array jobs to fixthe idea is that you can log into your account on the eveonline website and click a button that will set a flag on your tranquility account to set it for copying  or perhaps adds your account to a database of accounts depending on whichever nets faster results  then during the next tranquility downtime a script is automatically run this script looks for all accounts with the this flag set  or all accounts in the specified database   and copies all of those accounts information to a temporary database particularly accounts subscription details and characters skillsets are copied to this temporary database other data  such as assets and corporation information   can be ignored if feasable once done the script unsets the flag  or resets the account list database to empty   tranquilitys downtime resumes as normalnow its singularitys turn for a script during downtime this script is quite similar to the tranquility one with an added feature the ability to convert the data into acceptable data for the current singularity mirror in particular this will apply any skillset changes  new skills get set appropriately for testing etc   the script looks for data in the temporary database converts it and then copies it to the singularity databasethe whole process would thus take two downtimes to complete  about 48 hours at the most after activating the process through your account information on the website this allows for players to be able to catch up to tranquility on singularity so that they may test things there without the interference from other players that they would receive on tranquility this also allows players expired accounts on singularity to be updated with new subscription data from tranquility and this process is not exploitable it works oneway you cannot copy your data from singularity to tranquilitywhat im requesting is for the council to bring this idea to ccp please support this idea
i dont know how well this would work from a technical point of view but i like it in principle its certainly worth having the csm bring this up signed
sounds good to me
had a chat with hardin after he returned from csm meet on iceland and he pointed out that the issue with limited standingslots was one of database issuelagpezzle suggested to raise the number of standingslots in the thread below
seems a good idea just have work on defining how we decide they are inactive  ie how long since last activity  which rules determine they are inactive etc etc do corps need an upkeep cost like alliances have now would not paying that get them scrubbed from the database
cant support this some of us occasionally go away for a while sometimes accounts go inactive sometimes theyre maintained to keep up skill training but have minimal use itd be disincentive to return knowing your corp may vanish and that seems footbullet to ccpbesides who knows ifwhen someone may crank up an old corp again losing that history and structure would kinda suck theres always a chance it comes back online again for rp or alliance or pewpewpew or any other reason we want i cant imagine with the raw computing power ccp has going for it cleaning out x number of corps is really having that much effect on allowable warslotsid be open to considering this if we could get something quantitative from ccp regarding thisfull disclosure yeah im thinking of oracle sue me
bad harlequini defintly agree with you that there are concerns about corpalliance history and as jade pointed out how to impliment itjudge who are inactiveit all comes down to wether or not the database will greatly benefit from such a purgethis is something only ccp can answersince they did indicate that corpsalliances had an impact on their database its something ccp could look into and see if its worth the performance gain vs loss of corpalliance historyif a corpalliance is deleted it could always be reactivated but ofcourse someone could claim the identity right infront of your noseas a fellow roleplayer i defintly see the need to hang on to ones pasthistory and i see your concern
just noi can see why you would do it but the data resources from what i understand is not the issue inactive corps doesnt add load its just standings that is the issue and the way it worksso really i guess there is just too many concerns with this without benefits i suppose alliances just have to manage their standings
i dont think the reason for this upcoming is not managing of standings but rather the difficulties you have to face wenn founding a new corp many names and tickers are already used looking some corps up you find them to be a one man show as i am not a friend of such i support this

i would like to see issues that are brought up here available on an ingame interface essentially there is too much rubbish and such on this forum and i often find my self paging back to find if there are any updates on a particular thread i was interested in this is certainly not the only solution but here goes a person would bring the idea up on this forumif the idea got enough votes it would be transferred to the live server where actual voting by the players would take placefrom an interface on the live server you could see the issues that made it give your actual vote towards the issue being passed see the current status within the csm see the votes for and against and it would have a link back to the forum thread if the thread made it to the csm they could lock the thread or place it under another archived part of the forum and keep this for current topics the issue that i see is that this is way too messy its like trying to vote an issue in a korean parliament lape lets streamline the issues and make this whole process manageablepardon if this issue or something similar has come up i am not aware of any similar solutions  dru
i love it great idea me  forgot to support

no 
i would rather see destroyer class torpedo boats myself  not stealth tho  
would be a good feature it could be placed on the navcomp bar and simply blink when any number of player defined timers goes off not exactly the best for mining but i think there are better solutions for module cycles
obviously there are other ways of achieving this but an ingame one would be nice imo as thats where you focus your attention while playing   
agreed just as theres a notepad and a calculator ingame a timer would be handy
yes then our dependance of a mmo would be complete 
it also should have an alarm p
we have a forum for that already
sorry no  its fun
well if your point is fun then sure it should stay open p
that would just move the chaos to where its even less helpful nah leave this open there needs to be a place for unrestricted brouhaha before it gets distilled

agreed preferably with some skill
i was against the introduction of jumpclones and i am definately against a reduction in the timerthe problem one of force projection the very convenience that people crave for casual play is unbalancing when in the hands of more hard core playersthe ability to be in any one of five locations in the blink of an eye in to a station jam packed full with ships of war bristling with weapons and out in to combat moments later is bad enough  but at least currently you can only do it once a dayno sane player would want to increase peoples ability to project force in this manner  it would benefit my gameplay greatly but that does not mean i think it would be good for eve  i am actually interested in if people want jump clones so they can move about easily or if  as i suspect   they can use them as a way to protect implants when they pvpif it is the later then maybe rather than screwing further with the already unbalanced jump clones maybe it would be more pragmatic  and certainly more honest   to propose a new mechanic to protect implantspersonally i dont think that implant protection is a good idea either but i would take a move in that direction over shortening of the jump clone timer
deffo love this idea everytime i jump clone now i am worrying in case i will miss a fight somewhere because of the long cooldown
24hrs way to long supported
yes  i also support the remote termination of jump clones as mentioned earlierdoesnt make sense that you can remotely terminate regular clones  essentially by moving them you terminate the old one   and not terminate jump clones remotely
there isnt a shortage of asteroids go off the beaten path to more deserted system and profityou can make the choice if its worth hauling it a little extra to sell it or not
chribba is supporting dis so it must be good ps did read it  i hope its not a pipe dream of ccp either
i am not supporting because the idea of belts on the fly as a solution for macroing sounds great however lets not kid ourselves macroers will just devise a way of scanning them down first creating bookmarks and then working off that list also the solution to overcrowded belts in hi sec is simple move to low or null sec plenty of ore there its almost as if thats what your hulk was designed forless macromining is good however what happens when eve loses a chunk of its community i would say that 1 out of every 5 miners ive met in hisec were unavailable no guarantee that they are macroers but still could the reason that ccp doesnt stamp out macroing is that macroers still pay 15 a month as well as cool beer drinking all around fellas that they seem to be they are still businessmenif this idea is to get macroers out of high sec then i say this wouldnt help so i do not give support get a better idea and i will support as far as ccp finding new ways to go about optimising their database  they shouldnt need a request from the players that should be something any good dev team and dba should be researching already dru
i like this idea also hoping it will bring a wider variety of ores found in these new belts
i like the idea of dynamic belts in theory but i fear they will screw it up the way they did with the rest of explorationspecifically you will end up spending 3 hours scanning 20 systems just to find a belt that contains half the roids that existing ones do today
im just getting into eve online again but this time i want to pvp but i currently have no decent pvp chars so i want to buy onei dont have 34bill so i need to sell my old charsi see i can transfer the characters to another account but i cant export xml data and this makes them hard to sellso i would like to get some clearence on this issue do you really have to activate accounts on order to sell the characters on there
the content of your post doesnt seem like youre bringing up an issue that needs to be addressed instead it seems like youre asking a question of the general public to which you already know the answer after all if you could export the xml data on inactive accounts then you would have done so and wouldnt need to post about how you cant give ccp their money and get on with your character trading   
yes pay the 15 bucks  drups feeling heat from flameball coming beware epic lolz
we all know about ship bumping what about missile bumping or missiles which are actually aware of their environment and so will avoid ships and suchlikeafter that we could go onto highspeed antimissile defence by having fast moving ships which can fly into the missile thereby protecting the intended victim
have hundreds of additional collision detection needed for each player using missiles nobesides line of sight and such doesnt appy to this game sadly
hey you stole that idea from the french navy where would one keep such ships and how many would you be able to carry i can carry about 16k missiles can you carry 16k antimissile shipsunless of course you are suggesting for a way for frig pilots to sacrifice for a mom or something the idea sounds bad because all you would have to do is place 500 frigs in front of something and essentially they become amazing armor blob factor goes waaay up
a 500 frigs lol  using them as armour just give all of them a single primary  profitb one missile breaks a hole in the armour and all the other missile will just get in through that holewho knows you have defender missiles which stop missiles why not defender drones
as an addendum to what chi quan has said and as a phobos pilot my self if you can get your align time under 4 seconds you will likely get away from most non remote sensor boosted interdictors  in low sec  and for added protection is the mwdcloakalignuncloakwarp trick highly effective in getting hidden and getting into warp in under 4 seconds of exposure
welcome thank you for posting your whine exit is that way 
thank you for your constructive post im sure there is a section for five yearolds here but youve missed it by quite some margin
thanks thats useful  ill look into that   
like the title saysthis csm thing started just a few weeks ago and already everyone and his mother is posting threads and ideeas search function has been a joke ever since i started playing and compared to some here im a yungunintroduce an automated function that at lets say  100 aproval votes makes the thread sticky every week after that double the requirements 200 400 800 1600  most of you know how this progression works without good visibility an ideea is going nowhere and without being sticky the only good visiblity you can give a thread is to start a flamefest
well we now know a lot more about which kind of issues fly and which dont and have a much better idea about exactly what ccp would like us to be bringing them in the formal meetings in the next week or so well be publishing some guidance about how the eve population should go about formatting their issue threads in the future to increase their chance of being taken up by a csm rep and successfully getting voted through the csm itself the more groundwork and research done by the community poster the better rationalized the arguments and a decent level of understanding what can and what cant be done within the fabric of eve online will help these things along immensely sadly we arent going to get better forum tools in the forseeable future so we are going to have to live with this forum functionality  but hopefully itll become apparent which issues are getting successfully escalated and well post some examples of good issues and bad issues to give people a headup on future submissions the number of approves is a very rough indicator of how good an issue is  with the exception of joke threads and stuff like that   but i dont think it would be a good idea to have these things being stickied and i think the forum mods would hate us for adding to their workload in any casewe did agree within the csm that each meeting would take up the 2 most popular unaddressed issues each given week as recognition of forum input from the community  alongside csm tabled issues   but if it gets to the point that these are always joke issues were going to have to rethink
the ability to find useful information quickly and easily is paramount in this hustle and bustle world of information and technology finding information for mmos and specifically eve online as its the most complicated game in the genre is also very important all of the information you desire is located somewhere on this website but most of it is so difficult to locate you cant find itlooking for that specific post detailing a guide or a spreadsheet to help you out good luck searching for information via the search bar at the top right is a recipe for aggravation hits are outdated out of order or simply not listed sort by date doesnt work as posts still arent kept in any order while sort by relevancy only lists threads from last year and never anything recentthe search bar needs a revamp or better parameters to pick up newer posts and information no longer do you have to search page by page for that post you made last night now you can find it all quickly and easily
eveo really needs a better search function
a thousand times yes
would you also like the moros to be replaced with the model of hulk hogan now that you are posting this 
in my opinion there shouldnt be a war dec system based on rp since the ratio between rpers and nonrpers is quite skewed to the latterheres my suggestioncurrently you pay concord as certain amount of money to look the other way while you wage war against another corporation the cost is scalar with the number of war deccs and last for a certain timethe current price of is quite low for most corporations but you should also remember theres smaller corps with 15 members who want to wage war toohow about having war deccs scale with the price you pay for them the amount you bribe concord for also determines the amount of isk damage you may cause to a corporation perhaps determined by the base price of the ships you destroy youd have a given factor for payment to damage calculation say youd pay 100mill isk and you could do damage to that corporation for 500mill isk in totaltheres other things to take into account of course like the number of war decs and if the war should last indefinetaly
ya they wont do that they make way more money the way it is now
looking forward to reading the minutes as well as seeing the newspaper articles
just got back alsoccp clearly treated the whole process pretty seriously our meetings were with senior devs from pretty much every department within ccp  many of whom were giving up their own personal time over the weekend to participate in the processi wont go into too much detail as minutes will explain more but basically on simple issues we basically got yesno answers and if it was no we got pretty goodstraightforward reasons why it was noon more complex issues it was clear that much of what we were proposing was already being looked at by ccp on some items we were definitely intune and on others ccp explained why technically certain things wont work  or may work  but only if gigantic resources in terms of programmer time are thrown at them  but even there we sometimes came to compromise solutions which ccp are looking intowhat was very rewarding for me and other csm delegates was when occasionally there was a a lightbulb eureka why didnt we think of that moment where a csm ideasuggestion either directly or indirectly prompted some sudden insight and improvement idea it actually made us feel like we did have something useful to bring to the party it was also interesting to see how the various carebear vs hardcore pvp dynamics play out even within ccp and i particularly loved the reaction of one dev  who shall remain nameless   during the can flipping debate  who loudly exclaimed but thats my stuff in summary it was a great experience and i think both the players and ccp will benefit from it going forward my main concern is on timescales  while ccp are taking forward a lot of our suggestions these are by no means guaranteed to enter the game short term  or even by the time the next csm has to be elected   but at least we know they are on the agenda and in the pipeline now  and we will of course be using our exalted position as internet chieftains to push things along anyway completely knackered  had to take a half day off work this morning   but also very pleased that i took part and that everyone worked a lot better face to face than they did in a couple of our online meetings long may that spirit of cooperation last
yeah this is typically the point where an anticlimactic period occurs you guys are all excited about having done a great job and accomplishing a lot the rest of us will read the minutes and discuss them and fight over them and maybe come up with even more ideas and issues and ccp will need time to even start implementing some of the stuff yall discussed so maybe well see it next year or latercoding takes a long time so interest in the whole csm process will probably disappear long before ccp implements anything unless you and future csm councils keep track of the current issues and their status and ccp implements some sort of status reports for issues beyond the initial yesnosoon response to keep them on the front page
so when and where are we going to get the meeting results im getting rather curious
when its ready our secretary has got a lot to write up and get signed off so you will probably need a little patience
you are still alive and there was even cakei do think that cake is a lie
nah was all true there was pretty epic cake too ccp have a lovely kitchen on their top floor that produces very nice food round the clock and has very attractive cooks
i have a little patence very little are the minutes ready yetno how about now
i love the serious lack of imagination on the part of the op following the old song and dance of somehow world of warcraft is eves archenemy like superheroes or football team rivals or something that by comparing them everyone is going to go into a froth and act on the ops transparent agendagrow up
i would like to thank this ideas detractors for blatantly showing their biasby ranting about the evils of shooting people in highsec in any nondefensive manner or saying you want to be able to continue looting with impunity you show that your own petty wants outweigh your desire to improve this game this has in my most humble of opinions firmly placed any reasonably unbiased opinion firmly on the dualownership side of this debatethank you
all updated im going to ask the mods to clean this thread so there is more room to breakout into more categories
nobody complains about the training time on the typhoon because the typhoon is sodding awesome when you get there the naglfar is not
i was hoping to just fit this into my capital ships online topic but unfortunately that got voted down for the iceland meeting however i will try to push this issue forward for the august meeting i would prefer to label it as balance between dreadscarriers within their classes however
remember why the csm was implimentedcorrupts devs  hi t20  gms caught cheatingetc etc etcgame mechanics are a part of their job and your post just shows that you have no clue what they were voted for
signedccp just want to raise sorry to level the etc subscription price 
tbh one of the worst things ccp has done
signedtaking away choice is bad
raising the prices and introducing a seemingly arbitrary timecard while removing options is one of the most ignorant decisions i have seen in a long timei wont be renewing my subscription if this stays since i dont especially enjoy grinding isks 5 days a week just so i can get to do it all over again next month cheers
i support this please dont get rid of 3090 days
well its not going to be popular with this thread but since this is a big issue and people are understandably interested to hear the answers to the questions we asked the answer is basically they  ccp   dont like the the various grades of gtcs because it overcomplicates the admin and it does nothing good for ccps profitsultimately theyd prefer people to be directly subscribing by credit cards  or alternative payment means   and while gtcs are going to be there as a fall back option they feel no obligation to support all the various types we used to have or keep them at the same effective discount theyve become true the relative weakness of the us dollarpressing them on the issue yielded the very honest answereve is a premium product with a huge development effort high class graphics and major design on new features and functions stuff like walking in stations is a whole new graphic engine thats world class in the industry and fundamentally its our choice as to whether we want to pay for quality or notso the outcome is basically60 days cards is what therell be and we need to understand that ccp would much rather people directly subscribe by credit card  or alternative payment method straight to their accounts  more money gets to ccp development that way and as gamers we have to decide whether we are happy paying a bit more of a premium product or not eve was never designed to be a discount mmo and is never going to be priced that waywe did make the point that it would have been better for ccp to be more honest about this message rather than mix it up in slippery marketing spiel and claims that this was an industry standard pricing structure and that kind of thingthey agreed in the future we should get less marketspeak and more plaintalkingfull answer will be covered in the minutes when we get them published but thats pretty much what itll record i know its not what a lot of your wanted to hear but i can see their point and ive got to say from my own experience of the gaming industry i do respect this kind of wantthepaymentdirectsentiment  it works for a quality outfit like stardock and does ensure that our subscription and payment goes on a far more direct route to development funding than typically occurs when funds get chased around the table in the marketing and distribution sphereend of the day i started paying in gtcs last year too my reason was simple economy the relative weakness of the dollar made buying gtcs for dollars a nobrainer for a euro based player simply because it was 33 cheaper ccp have told us theyd rather we subscribed directly and all payed the same rate sure wed gotten used to a discount but ultimately weve all got to decide whether going back to the paying the basic rate is worth it for me it is and i can respect the honesty in describing this game as a premium product that costs premium rates seeing the significant investment still going into eve and getting first hand insight into future and upcoming expansions helps of course  but ultimately everyone needs to reach their own understanding with personal budgets and just how much you are prepared to pay for your entertainment for me its pretty easy i dont buy the cheapest beer in the pub and i dont expect all beers to cost the same no reason why all mmorpgs should be a uniform price either and im happy to make a payment decision based on what i perceive eve is worth rather than comparing it to other products and lamenting the loss of weak dollar gtc discounts hope everyone finds this answer informative
this issue brings up the problem with the csm there isnt really any real power there if ccp refuse to address this issue  as they are   then no one can do anything about itif so many people want the cards changed back then ccp should do it regardless i expect quite a few subscribers will be lost due to this
well the power was the power to ask a question and get an answer we can question ccp we can make suggestions we can set priorities for fixes to game issues and generally influence the future development of gameplay focus thats all pretty impressive stuff but sometimes were going to get answers that the player base didnt want to hear and sometimes answers we specifically didnt want to hear and its up to us as discerning adults to just understand we dont always get our own wayi didnt get my way on the destructible outposts thing but i got to ask the question and got a very detailed response respectful discussion and ultimately a potentially excellent compromise solution on the issue other items on the agenda besides the gtcs got a no for various reasons but all of the refusals were respectfully presented and informatively justified by ccp i think its very important to realize that csm is not a wish fulfillment mechanism if were taking issues to ccp we have to explain why they are in the interests of the community and just how they will benefit the game just as ccp need to tell us their reasons and position on gtcs sure its hard that some people  myself included   will now pay more for our subscription but i do respect being told straight that the change means more money for ccp and more money for development that will keep eve online as a premium product in the industry end of the day they promised wed get the chance to make proposals raise issues ask questions and get substantive and detailed answers from senior staff at ccp they kept that promise now the challenge to the community is to best use the csm procedure to benefit the game of eve online for all of us
i think a very clear indication of ccp not being swayed by the vocal minority the plain fact is that the previous gtc structure did not make financial sense for them to keep and arguing against a company looking after its bottom line because of the insignificant dent it puts on your own pocket is not really effective
well that seals the deal then1 account on july 24th ill train a long skill in the hopes that my rl financial situation gets betterhere is the breakdown1 battleship every week t2 fitted 120140 million isk1 pilgrim every 2 weeks t2 fitted 200 million iskthis equates to needing to farm 13 billion isk per month on average to just pvp onadd in a 90 day gtc  400 million isk   i would need to farm 1353 billion isk per monthfor a 90 day gtc and funds to pvp with  this is a pvp game right   i would need to farm isk for approximately 1 month for 2 more months of play timenow that 60 days are almost the same cost as 90 days where i would need to farm for 1 month pvp for a month etc to afford game  pvpno thanks that is too much like workso farewell  on july 24th  very poor decision ccp
yes please bring back the 30day and 90day gtc lots of good posts here for the reasons why
signedthis is a very poor choice in direction for player retention
bring back both 30 and 90 dayedit of my 7 active accounts i will be going down to 5 and probably fouras more people do this they will be loosing money they must think they are going to be getting more first time players i dont think they will make the money they think they will
that is actually ridiculous and embarrassing congratulations ccp you have just alienated a huge section of your playerbase with your greedy notions  all the tripe about premium remember guys this is a active player base of at most 35k people at a time ccp are using a tiny amount of server space compared to majority of other major mmos  it simply boils down to this 1 ccp wants more money and are prepared to make eve the most expensive mmo on the market to achieve this 2 ccp wants to be able to predict its profits well in advance so wants everyone to pay monthly via credit card  in spite of the credit cruch i would just like to add  i want no further part in it and will be terminating my subscription
your newsletter i will subscribeopinion threadwatchers is this specific enough  current alpha values are useless vs current ship stats boost arty alpha   to warrant its own thread or should we continue to show support here  help arty in some as yet unspecified way  edit i fully support what i glimpse of siddys idea of shipshaking ducttape unwrapping rustflaking shuddering volleys of horrificallysized shells that rattle your teeth when you fire em even thru the pod fluid but may or may not miss completely hit the guy next to you only get fired once every other week or some combination thereofi think snipers can have a role with massive alpha strikes in finishing off wounded targets or suddenly adding an extra whomp to a target who previously thought he was tanking just fine maybe discuss
exactly this sort of damage is what artillery needs it will make it feared and actually fulfill its role artilery shoots huge projectiles really far and while may not be accurate makes up for it in shear powerand about the maelstrom bonus change i think thats a great idea 34 times people are fitting artillery on the maelstrom so give it some support towards alpha and the damage bonus would help that losing the rof bonus would lower dps and the damage bonus would boost alpha keeping the ship balanced
t3h real 1400 threador how is see minmatar race shuld be
i am flying an abaddon instead of a maelstrom for just this reason theres a lot of minni stuff that needs fixing the tempest is borked 1400s are so outdated i havent trained large projectiles yet and the only useful bs minni has is the typhoon
it was revealed during the csm thattherefore i move that ccp focus additional resources into providing the mechanisms to allow individual corporations to sign up for fw whilst also belonging to an alliance
i thought ccp didnt allow alliances to sign upto faction warfare to try and cut down on blobsif ccp now allow all the rp corps within alliances to sign up empire will be worse than 00 for blobs  from what ive seen its pretty bad as it is
give me the ability to join without leaving my corp and alliance
sounds like a plan tbh there should be consequences of course killing any opposing militia member should give you standings hit  does it do that now   choice and consequence o
thats working really well i take it i mean theres never a caldari militia blob roaming around is therethe antiblobbing should be built into the mechanics of system capture  splitting people across objectives being more efficient   rather than being an arbitary limit saying no alliances
10
personally id rather this did not happen
10
damn right
10
10
aw yeah
10
10
from an rp perspective would be good for me if this was timed with the dawning of the new minmatar governmentdo it
10
10
do it
im happy to support this and ill undertake to write up the issue submission for the next round of formal talks of course i personally feel its a pretty clearcut thing and it would be of benefit to many rp alliances and will help balance out fw and bring more people into those conflicts and enable further exploration of the system capture mechanics and associated gameplay areas what id also like to see from people supporting is how they feel the multiplecorporations from single alliances issue is handled though the fix we were told about basically allows any corporation currently in an alliance to join a militia while staying in their own alliance  so its a situation that can lead to some complexities that will need to be addressed in the issue   for example an alliance with 4 corporations 1 one corp could join the amarr militia theyll be able to shoot  and be shot   by the gallente and matari militias  but in empire the other 3 corps wouldnt be able to help them this could lead to confusions 2 what if all 4 corps joined different militias  theyd be at war with all the fw militia corps and themselves3 if all 4 corps joined the same militia itd be pretty much as if the alliance did join the militia as a wholeso we do need some guidance on the rule to be followed here if this proposal is supported shall we say1 if any corps from the alliance join x militia then the rest of the alliance corps can only join x militia too2 if any corps from the alliance join x militia then all the rest of the alliance corps must join x militia3 only one corp from the alliance can join x militiaetc etcsee what i mean we need to not only support the principle but also what specifics we want to see im personally in favor of any number of alliance corps could join any one militia but once any single corp has joined up the rest of the alliance corps can only join the that militia too hence ensuring that alliances can only effectively support any one militia
i support this wholeheartedly and believe this should be a prioritythis seems like the most sensible iteration  once corp x has signed for a militia y then other corps in the alliance can only sign to militia y helps stop silliness
1 but with the stipulation that only one corp from each alliance may join fw
perhaps make it so that the executor corp has to join first then make all other corps have to follow suit
10
damnit do i have to agree with rodj 
oh gods please yes as ive said before rpers unite into alliances to keep their own specific diversities while working together towards a general goal it allows us to make up for a shortfall in numbers the might join one specific corporationtaking my own alliance as an example if you were to merge two of the major corps  gradient and reawakened technologies  it would be like dropping a box of ferrets high on frentix into a meeting of a stalinist planning committee just after a funeral  apologies to gradient there  please dont hurt meeeeee    the idea of one corp tolerating or even hiring the attitude of the other would be completely unbelievable in an alliance with separate corp chat channels its much much easiernot all the extant alliances want to be their own faction living in 00  when we created ourselves we didnt know we had to some of us have decided to serve a faction and those of us in that boat would very much like to join the big war our factions are in as full participants not as pirates lurking on the boundaries
i think its one of these rp pride issues that we have to get on board regardless of wanting to shoot amarrians in their faces  though since its an issue to let us shoot amarrians in their faces it aint so hard to understand   
id say option 2 for preference or option 1 as a second choice option 3 is pretty much the same as where we are now in em with one corp farmed out to the militia and the rest of the alliance waiting hopefully for one of them to wake up
yes pls3 is meh 2 would probably be difficult to implement under the current system 1 is of these my favouritebut i vote for 4 once one corporation in an alliance joins fw i would block the two hostile militias for the other corporations in the alliance the other corporations then may  but do not have to   to join either the same one as the first or the allied one and i would totally leave it to the alliances themselves to how to deal with it if they cannot agree on a sidebut if that would delay implementation just remove the block and let them do whatever
i wont if you give me some of that frentix and never tell my ceo i took it
something like this please maybe not the else on frentix bit but something of the rest of it
o
how about the alliance can only join amarrcaldari or minmatargallente saves friendly fire issues
im with else
some thought needs to be given to the declaring war mechanics either way if you have alliances and militias as war targets you have two overlapping  possibly 3 if you count individual corps   as war declaration targets
getting pvp pilots into an alliance that wants to go low sec is hard enough without fw draining away all the available pilot poolsupported
i support this very very very strongly it es me off that i cant be fully involved in the new sandbox because i am in an alliance especially since my alliance has been doing for five years what the matari militia was recently formed to do what involvement im allowed is limited to a small number of inceasingly expensive wardecs or causes a loss in security status its ridiculous that i have to leave my alliance to enjoy this aspect of the gameif individual corps were allowed to join without limit this would be fine and alliances could be left to deal with any issues caused by corps joining opposing factions alternatively ccp could allow alliances to declare support to a faction  only one and this support should be reflected in the alliance info   then allow corps in the alliance to join that faction or the allied faction one possibility is that this could be juryrigged through standings possibly by declaring the opposing faction red or something similar
not supportingthats not to say i dont think its a good idea  in theory   im more concerned about the effect of having multihundredmember corporations joining  and you know there will be a few   i think that would be the kiss of death to skirmishwarfare in fw and the last thing we need is more blobaction in losecin an ideal world sure
this 1 we actually put namtzaar kin in a holding corp because most of us wanted to participate in fwa controversial decision to say the least and one which was entirely forced upon us by the silly existing rule
1 simple as
10
the inability for rp alliances to properly interact in the rp based war we have been waiting so long for is for me the biggest dissapointment in eve so this sounds like the fix we so badly need to me perhaps the executor should be able to select which faction their members will be permitted to join for example the ushrakhan executor selects minmatar and all of our corps get to choose minmatar or stay out of fw

i affirmarize
would be nice if they fixed the black ops ships pretty useless right now

the original idea why i posted this in 2005 was to have a midsize transportation ship that would not eat 1b isk and be still suitable for my transport needsmy needs have changed as has my profession however the situation remains the samei do not need a 1b isk ship to move the 1 freight can with my entire possessions   yes i know risk yes mom   because the risk is too high with one of those to loose not only your belongings but even 1b in ships worthwith the proposed smaller freighter i want it to have the same limitations as the big brother though with a smaller ship comes also lower mass and better agility making it still possible to catch that juicy ship but not as easy as a big freighterbut whatever changes you implement they will simply not counter suicide ganking of such shipclasses which is being classed as overpowered in other threads anywaymy personal preference for this ship is the reduced costs and the more suitable cargo space for persons like me who do not need 900k mUFFFD of cargo space
my apols as i thought i posted during the meeting but this topic was discussed during the csm  ccpmeeting this weekend and a full report will bepublished in due course i can let slip though that it was received very favourably and is likely to happen in a future patch   around 4x an indy was suggested as likely and being able to pick up from jetcans is probable tooiz
 bad connection post duped deleted  
this is down right mean we are waiting with all the patence we can  because hardin told us to have patence   yet you and the other members keep dribbling out little snippits like thisjust plain mean
me does the happy danceoh my god this just feels wow
well dont get too carried away  though snoopy dance is always fun   as every thing we discussed with ccp where there were positive vibes is a case of might get added into the development queue might get to be in a particular patch and might get pushed up or down the development timescale as their whole process is  quite correctly imho   one of continuous review of how to improve things their development pipeline is very fluid  but yeah im doing a little dance about things that i hope will arrive one day soonUFFFD too piz
signedif ccp cant implement this then the counsil is truly broken
2 or 3 skills max i support
i just read the op and was going to say this i would say that great minds think alike but i would rather not go there with a gooniei do think that the only way to settle this system is to set reactions as today its one mineral but if ccp rebalances it will be something else and the same cycle will happen so ccp needs to set it so that a more common mineral 100  xyz   can be turned into 1  abc   mineral or something of this nature so that the system balances itself and ccp doesnt have to balance it every 6 months
umm not a bad straw man argument there akita  now lets seeyes i said a b and c the straw man is your d and e which you misuse my obervations your points b and c to advance look what part of ccp cannot take into account player actions as they are beyond thier control do you not comprehend the inherent security status of low sec is reflected by the rats not the players rats are programmed at a set rate and strenght according to security status players vary in strenght numbers and occurance and are too variable if players were taken into account any system that has playerspirates in would be considered low sec under your straw man dont bring in concord as its an even later addition  and a reactive mechanic   and was made to reflect risk reward hence suicide ganksand statement d is in operation you get high returns mining in low sec even with depressed mineral prices i do make more profit in low sec mining in a burst than i do in high sec
higher yield roids still have to compete with easy to obtain  read much easier than mining   loot and drone drops
in a hulk i can outmine high ends on ark and bis compared to a friend running drone complexes in a group i get an even bigger bonus i can live with that for whatever reason drone bounty is paid for in mins i would say they need more low ends to allow for production in deep 00 easier instead of the overabundance of high ends though what bugs the hell out of me is that i can with nearly maxed skills  for solo i only need exhumers v and di v instead of at 4   and cannot get straight trit mined from huge 00 veld roids with t2 veld crystals faster than my comparatively crappy cruise missiles skills can get me trit from rat loot and believe me i have very crappy missile skills i dont want to trash rat loot drops because for most of the game space  nondeep 00   mining is faster than rat loot from cruisers and frigates beleive me i tell everyone in corp who wants to get me veld when i complain about trit shortages to rat and sell me the loot instead of veld mining drone mins are specially designed to be the bounty reward in refinables trash loot from standard mobs giving me more of any mineral than mining focused on that mineral while also giving bounties just miffs memy 02 isk
gee i dont know which part of a implies d dont you understand  b and c are just reinforcing itall of the above its not something that resembles your opinion it is your opinion you do like to use words like that a lot as a last line of defence dont you troll at best negligibly so at worst not at all point being its nowhere near the ratios its supposed to bethe point was in introducing much better yield veldspar  and other lowend   rocks so youd be able to mine lowends at a relatively decent rate  compared to mining highends or getting them from alloy drops   in 00 so it becomes feasable to sell ships cheaper in massive amounts out there almost so cheap that it makes sense to use insurance fraud on the spot instead of hauling some highends to empire to sell them there  that means more highends get absorbed locally instead of getting exported  which in turn means whichever highends escape that treatment get a higher value when exported
bimbo is epic    i love this thread i wonder what bimbo would do if akita took the effort to eliminate all his points by devgm quotes  i can think about many that i saw myself  i did quite like the alternate shuttle bpo example that would allow to transform one mineral to other mineral given some waste and costbtw the largest problem with tritanium is the manipulation cost associated nerfing compression on trit was a bad move as it increased the cost of manipulation greatlyfor example you need around 8 million units of tritanium for a dominix battleship  from memory i did not check the actual bp   that means around 10 jetcans of veldspar  one yields around 700k trit   thats only the tritanium you can get the needed midends from about 12 the cans of various midend ore and highends are even less efforti do not loot every mission i complete but i can build a dominix like every month from loot alone no need to mine a single roid  i will have even abundance of highends to sell and fund the insurance  the other nice idea in this thread was the mineral usage by system type fe shield components need one mineral armor components another laser turret components next one etc this would be based on the originating region ore there is to my knowledge and exlusive ore for each highsec empire of course each component would require also other minerals but the one selected will make the most part of it in terms of final isk cost misc items will have a mixed mineral composition without any dominating mineralcoupled with the component manufacturing idea chronotis mentioned a while ago it would make great benefit to the gameon the t2 components i think equal rarity ore should be equaly used ie having almost the same price thus they should be equaly distributed amount different modules so the actualy module usage will determine if the particular material is popular or not
your logic sucks at best your axioms are woefully insufficient to prove your desired conclusions a is a statement of how riskreward ratios were calculated originally  theres no moral content there b and c are similar statements of fact as regards risks from piracy d doesnt follow from the three of them together let alone a on its own in order to prove d you dont just need to prove that ccp neglected to consider player risk when establishing relative roid values you need to prove that it was a mistake that should be fixed and none of those statements even attempts to do so one can destroy your entire argument simply by accepting point a in its entirety yup they did so what   in order for you to derive your d youd need a logical chain like thisa rewards to mining should increase as risk to miners increases  you didnt mention any normative principles in your original construction  b lowsec is riskier than highsec  implied but not stated  c therefore rewards to mining in lowsec should be higher than rewards to mining in highsec  your d  of course you can replace b with mining in nonminmatar highsec is riskier than mining in minmatar highsec due to jihadswarm or mining in busy systems is riskier than mining in empty systems due to lag and player theft or a bunch of other statements that you presumably dont want to make despite their validity and even after all that all youve proven is that the current system fits within your principles because hedbergite is still worth more than veldspar the point youre actually trying to make here that mineral relative prices have to be adjusted to more closely resemble base prices and their 41 ratios is probably unprovable with formal logic and any set of remotely plausible axioms but even if it is after that display of logical prowess i feel confident that you wouldnt get there even if it was formal logic is the most powerful intellectual tool there is but its got hard limits on its applicability dont mess around with it unless you understand it and are willing to apply it as rigorously as is needed to do the job
akita t my romanian speaking friendyou really do fustrate me but ill perservere with you as maybe youll get the pointyes your d and e are made of straw as they already exist in the game as the distribution of roid types you are using my observation on what players add  b and c   over and above what ccp are responsible for  a   to advance your position when it does not applyif low sec had no player threats it would provide a much better return than high sec no matter what you did mine rat or navel gaze ffsagain it comes down to ccp cannot take into account player actions as they are beyond thier control you agree that i can make more mining in low sec what we disagree on is how greedy we areshould be you want a substantial reward difference i dont i just want it greater just in proportion to npc risk which it is again you quote ratios but again i say ratios are using figures dreamt up by devs like base prices the moment they were set to paper they were wrong as they depend on the market which is at the mercy of players the only ratios set in stone is the mineral useage in bpos an average of all bpos requirements would be the ratio of mineral requirement not reward expectationsyou are trying to distort my post to advance your aim you sadly remind me of an americian administration lackey bet you could have sold iraq is a clear and present danger as well as any of the shills that did to the people who lack the ability to think criticallyedited to spell romanian properly lolz
you can make more mining in low sec solely due to exploration belts which exist outside normal mining parameters and require special nonmining skills and equipment to find kernite which is the only roid i am aware of which is in 2 or less  i could be wrong here feel free to check me   beats veldspar by less than 10 for total volume add the fact that you will get full cycles of veld while kernite is bigger so part of an ore is normally wasted and you cut the total volume you mine down by an average of about half a roid per source it is small but i am trying to be exhaustive herethe difference between 10 sec mining veldspar and 2 mining kernite is mostly negligible editmore research kernite is 4 and less hedgbrigite is the 2 and less orefrom eve geek if this copies rightwith a cargo capacity of 900000 mUFFFD your ship can carryveldspar 9000000 units  27027 batches   6983776800 iskscordite 6000000 units  18018 batches   6840540576 iskpyroxeres 3000000 units  9009 batches   5550355922 iskplagioclase 2571428 units  7722 batches   6702546726 iskomber 1500000 units  3000 batches   5365780500 iskkernite 750000 units  1875 batches   7496068182 iskjaspet 450000 units  900 batches   4744731870 iskhemorphite 300000 units  600 batches   6423799680 iskhedbergite 300000 units  600 batches   8148282240 iskgneiss 180000 units  450 batches   17233090146 iskdark ochre 112500 units  281 batches   16002340298 iskspodumain 56250 units  225 batches   10711893150 iskcrokite 56250 units  225 batches   32055170948 iskbistot 56250 units  281 batches   36353383298 iskarkonor 56250 units  281 batches   41503410576 iskmercoxit 22500 units  90 batches   40973551110 iskhedbergite and kernite beat veld hedbergite by approx 17th but is not found in all all regions and only found in 2 space or less amarr and gallente get hemorphite which is less than veldspar not saying you cant move but there is clearly a very small difference here exploration belting and jumping to 00 ore gnesis is about 2x veldspar though
character limit on previous post for some reasonccp has stated repeatedly they want people out of high sec and into low sec and 00 more the region they added is mostly lowsec for factional warfare now people will not leave high sec where they have more protection for low sec when their is no monetary benefit this of course implies to mass populations some people just get twitchy in empire surrounded by neuts but for most people this is true
and that distribution of roid types no longer matches the original reward values and the reason for that is ccpintroduced changesno i am using your own statements to logically show you how according to your own logic if one would respect any sort of riskvsreward balance you personally should actually be supporting e or d at worst ccp cant take player actions into account but they can take into account the potential actions of players and their cost in form of consequences as such highsec lowsec and 00 are properly delimited and can be easily differentiated in terms of potential risk levelsnpc threat can quite directly be determined by ccpthe fact you can mine traces of hedbergite here and there in some lowsec systems or the fact you can try and find some 00 ore in explorationonly pockets is hardly appropriateproportional rewardyou freaking dense little thing those base prices and those ore base price ratios those are the intended ratios for rewardswhats so hard to understand no they were quite decently followed in the early days and even for a couple of years thanks to plenty of checks and balances in various forms included but not limited to npc mineral buy orders at 55 of base price and refineables at 180 of base priceand therefore my claim that its ccps fault the initial ratios no longer mean muchand the bolded part is where you are  partially   mistakend follows from a without needing b nor cwhat it does need however is a bit of commonsense lets call it a2  they did so for a reason and that reason never dissapeared so from a and a2 d most certainly does followone can not destroy the entire argument by accepting point a in its entirety and your rethoric question is not so rethoric at all it has a2 as a clear response
hold ondid you read herschel yamamotos post just above mine and what do you mean original values come on the real value is what ever we the players who are the market upon which ore is realised as isk think we want to pay for it is worth the base price ratio on ore reflects the npc set security level the reward level has always been set by the market which does not reflect npc threat  reward ratioswhat did ccp change umm lets think they removed npc buy orders for trit at 1 isk and then shuttles thereby making npc trit ceiling of 36isk not so available meaning players have to use the other players via the market and allowing tritveldspar prices to rise yup they removed buffers to free the marketno player risk cannot be counted in the security level equation as its an infinite variable thats not logic you are using its wishfull thinking you can potentially die in a 10 system in fact people did all the time in the past so they had to make concord to persuade people not to do it so much low sec does not have a deterrant gate guns come on they are not a deterant but an irritant but that doesnt change the fact that security level is npc related not player relatedso do you want a player driven market place you know a truely free market or do you want cement mixed with your sand ccp as you have observed is going free market as its where the pvp opportunities are so captialist free market or communist price control oh i remember you hate communist price control you told me about 15 pages agocpp are fully aware that mining rewards are totally dependent on the market  as they always have been   they are fully aware that minerals dont follow thier base price and ratios as the removed npc buy orders so we the players could set them ccp are also aware of what the changes they have made are doing as they knew what would happen they arent stupid they get 300k ppl to pay them every month and grow every month too so your claim that intial ratios dont mean anything is correct and ccp are fully aware of it because they seem to have caused it as it drives different decisions and outcomes in the game
no thats not yet a ceiling were getting at we only got close to it in the panic following shuttle removalthe real problem was when they removed the really cheap tritanium sources in form of coupling arrays reprocessingand that specific move was an abject failure on their part  removing the first stopgap without balancing the rest of the structurethey shouldnt have let tritanium get close to the ceiling in the first placeand the only reason tritanium got to the ceiling was because they introduced the drone regions with an insane abundance of highends  combined with a total lack of other useful drops not even isk  making the drone regions the main supplier of highends of the entire eve galaxy   a change that was completely and totally under their control sending all mineral prices spinning out of controli want either a truly free marketeconomy combined structure or some form of price controlhaving a free market with a frozen economy is the worst possible combination  theres no real freedom in the market that way merely the illusion of freedom  youre only free to do whatevers most profitable competing with other people doing exactly the same thing in exactly the same way until you can no longer tolerate the low margins and get out thats not a free market thats a jokeout of the two options i would prefer a truly free market as close to a real life market as possiblethe ability to use different materials to get to the almost same results is a small part of that closer to reality thingand the market itself is totally dependent on changes ccp makes with virtually no player influence whatsoever barring reaction speed to the changesfully aware of the facts maybe fully aware of the reasons i seriously doubt itagain aware of the changes maybe aware of the effects prior to the changes even if repeatedly warned about it by players i seriously doubt itoh the theyre not dead yet so they cant make mistakes argument i really love that my claim  you mean your claim my claim is that the initial ratios are the intended ratios and the ratios ccp should move their collective behinds to maintain  witing certain tolerance limits anyway  the game reality says otherwisethe game reality says ccp as a company has no clue  even if there might be some individuals with clarity about the issue theyre not in a position to do anything about it or not allowed to speak of it yet  no clue ast to why people wont leave highsec in larger numbers no clue on how to handle mineral issues and so on and so forthoh yes i did go there
some questions because ive never completely understood the standings system   and some ideaslets say im a pirate and i kill a mission runner who has a perfect 100 sec status with a npc corp do i lose status with that npc corp i know we have a concord hit etc but ive never actually read a detailed breakdown of how security interaction works with npc corps beyond concord itself im also not a pirate so ive never tested it either anywayhopefully if you kill someone whos quite beloved you take a hit otherwise my idea for this is completely useless im going to go forward assuming this is true and if it isnt true well it should be1 most people getting ganked are mission runners miners people with positive security status with an npc faction of their choice2 npc corps almost all have central hubs that everyone ends up migrating to because there are simply more agents to give missions in those areas less worry about long flight times between one agent and the next3 most characters live within a 78 hop sphereif all these things are true why implement a faction just for bounty hunters just allow npc factions to self regulate what that means is just implement bounty hunters into already existing factions if youve been over by npchauler corps galactic headquarters ganking people chances are a lot of the people you killed were doing missions for npchaulercorp and they were loved by its board of directors you take appropriate negative status dings from npchaulercorp and once it hits a certain point they decide theyve had enough of you and start shopping around for bounty hunters add in a seperate tab of the lp store that lists bounties that have been put on players that anyone with enough lp and a high enough standing with the corp can buy the higher the bounty the higher the lp needed to buy itfrom an rp perspective i see this as a much better idea than adding an entire new set of corps and factions to eve it makes pirates pay attention to not just who they are attacking but more importantly what they are attacking its no longer warfare on newbs newb corps and carebears its a attacking the status quo and the status quo normally figures out some way to hit back heck you could take this to the point of once a npc corp hates you enough youre no longer allowed to dock there have goods there so sorry youll have to contract them to a trusted friend and have them smuggle the things out to you it puts real penalties on ganking in a way i simply like better

i support removing the intel function from the local channel provided the ships scanner gets improved to provide better than currently available info and even locallike info but at a very limited rangethis is basically the tradeoff that ccp greyscale was talking about in this thread and that goumindong is just not able to comprehend
so wait players who were recruited from the something awful forums are complaining that someone once ran a vaguely smutty website
the thing is the vast majority of people who voted for jade already knew full well about the existence of la maison and they still felt they wanted him to represent them however much you may or may not like it he is there to represent the x many people who voted for him you cant overturn their votes
nice that you agree but i think that ppl that use af today will be glad enought with this simple boostthats exactly what i disagree webs ab and mwd are an issue of their own and have some good ideas proposed mostly about making webs get a signature penalty and mwd getting agility penalties and etc these things alone would improve all ships below bs size like cruisers destroyers and etc
agreedshould have been that way as the emphasis is on pvp
agree
i support this wanted to fly the green maulus for a long timenow im almost thinking about training amarr despite the fact that the helios beats out the anathema in most every attributesigh whoever said on this thread that the change was logical but ended up messing with a lot of people just for the sake of consistency  and therein breaking more than it fixed   was brilliant okay so it was a mistake to have the maulus hull from the beginning i understand that well it ended up being a mistake a whole lot of people likedand thats not a bug thats called serendipity dont break things twicemy goodness small incremental changes dont rock the boat completely changing ship models is not small nor incremental
yes give us the old hull back
signedthe new hull is awful
no it isnttheyre pushing topics where 10 people support them just because csm members like it even when support was very mixed just because they like itthats not representing the players thats representing themselveslike jade and docking aggression timers  which is a utterly horrible move with the dpstank figures as they are all subbs ships are practically guaranteed to die to baitblob tactics and bs are fairly likely too if the timer is extended too much  
well pretty much the whole csm and every dev in the room ended up agreeing that if you fire a weapon at another player in eve its pretty lame to be able to dock out of combat 45 seconds later and its doubly lame if you are doing it in a capital ship that cannot possibly have its tank broken in that time span dockundockdock games round stations are hideous gameplay and most pvpers know and appreciate this if you are worried about being baited then scout and take care about beginning engagements  dont feel that the safety blanket of redock after aggression is something you should automatically have in all circumstances
while we are doing sweeping statementsliving in 00  gankers who only kill people who have nil chance of beating them in combatnow i know that my statement clearly isnt true sweeping statements never are same goes the other way ya know  not everyone who lives in empire is a carebear i actually respect the way in which you want to play the game i just dont wish to be a part of it
bump 2
along with that absolutely no isk back from suiciding hisherits ship that would make the choice of pushing that button a little more desperate and knowing that they will not get bupkis well that might make them think twice and weigh out what is more important to them
thisi dont see the reason for selfdestruct in the first place imho the only way it should be allowed is if you had a radius of death and destruction like a smartbomb that affected friend and foe alike thats selfdestruct none of this wussy oh look im magically an egg now buhbye as sail away on my fairy wings magicpainlessdetonation crap
not agreed  i believe voiding the insurance on ships that self destruct would be better
issue is not to increase self destruct but rather to give lossmails to the top damage dealer simple solution  do what happens if a npc kills a target  which is send a copy of lossmail to top player damage dealeri will support this on the basis that the issue is about lossmails rather than the time limit
heh ive said it before and ill say it again someone killed themselves for you saving you time effort and possibly a few ships in your fleet and your crying because you didnt get a text fileremember no insurance not even the default for them if they self destructnot supported reassess your priorities instead
i just wanted to restate again that we are in fact playing internets spaceships solol irony
sry nop you still get insurance thanks for playing
i think i have an interesting solution for this problemincrease the time that is fine with me but right now self destruct is like thistick tock tick tock boomwhy not instead of having the timer count down have self destruct slowly do damage to the ship slowly draining shields then armor then structure then boomthis way the attacking force may actually get the kill rather than the self destructin addition why not send a kill loss   mail anyways with the selfdestructor as the final blow and the rest of the gents who did damage show up on the kill as normali think this option would go a long ways to ending self destructs for this reason
as most player know npc ecm is not influenced by sensor strength of the target  there are numerous dev post attesting that   it is the only ew not affected by the characteristics of the target shipas long as it was affecting mostly player ratting or doing normal missions with relative little interference by players it was a small problem but now faction warfare missions and complexes see often a mix of pc and npc in the same combat that make this a game balance issue as a caldari navy npc jamming the right  or wrong depending on who you are   ship can change the tide of a battle and the target has no possibility to influence or prepare for this  to reiterate sensor strength included the effect of eccm dont influence the jamming chance of the npc the target can be in a noob ship or a bs with eccm and the npc has exactly the same chance of jamming him  all other ew can be countered with the same modulesskills against pc and npc  or cant be countered if it is a target painter but still the situation is identical against pc and npc  so i think it is time for ccp to change how npc ecm operate and modify the chance of jamming to include the effect of the target sensor strengthnote i dont ask for ecm use removal from the rats or for the player ecm to work on the rats

i couldnt agree more whats the point of a weapon if you cant use itagree
what if we just remove tachyons then you dont need to whine about them and you still got your regular beam laserstachyons do much more damage than other long range weapons
amarr have the highest damage hac and the best sniper ships in the game they dont need more buffs they dont need more improvements there are already plenty of reasons to train amarredit the only thing i could support is a slight buff to the pilgrim and more dervisity between their battleships like 1 beam 1 missile 1 nosnewtew bs like caldari have its a good formula
please also boost the t2 heatsinks atleast 25 im abaut to finish geddon lvl 5 and dont feel like spening money on faction stuffalso as this thread said amarr needs more grid to fit atleast 1 plate with full tachyon rackits silly to see how tempest fits the powerful 1400mms without any fitting mods not to mention megatron with overpowered railsfittings 2 platesthere is no point using amarr ships in fleet since we cant fint cap rechargers and armor all my lowslots are taken by rcus  
so you would rather have all this rubbish and such ingame moar crap for them to change and add into the game inevitably leading to something being inadvertently brokendo i have to type out the words not signed
huh you could try reading the solution instead of guessing from the title if you like the in game interface would essentially be like a ballot box a clean and simple interface in which to vote on the topics which would act like a ballot box and status monitor of the latest topics whereas the forums  which contain the rubbish   would be more like where the political mudslinging would take place the only link to the two would be a simple out of game link to the forums i dont think their would be issues with it being broken as weve had in game corp voting for sometime now thanks for trying out though
although i am not against the idea of an in game voting interface i do not think such an interface will solve the fundemental flaw of the csm which is a requirement for votes from a fixed percentage of the user base to force the csm to take up issues this is not a flaw in the ideals of the csm so much as in the implementation asking all subscribers to keep up with all these issues is simply too much putting it in front of players in game will simply pass the burden along to another medium it is wishful to think that a casual player will see the votes and take the time to read the forums to become informed about the issue up for a vote my suspicion is that one of two things will happen  people will ignore it just as many ignore patch notes that have a real impact on their game play or people vote almost at random based on a superficial knowledge of the issue presented
i actually thought the csm voting thing would be ingame i was quite surprised when i saw that it only made it out as a forum
well cruiser sized ships with special torps of signature radious of dred each one removes like 1k cap from hitted capital ship these would make great anti capital support
this assault bombers that would fly in wolfpacks and inflict massive damage on capitals paper thin ships that could be easily taken down with a rifter  or small pos guns they would need to have much less nano potential than interdictors  as speedtanking a dread with your small sig radius should be trivial  until drones reach you  
okay this one has an alarm
as i posted in a thread with the exact same idea ccp does not like jet can mining why would they put something in game that makes it easier
you do know that the csm allready talked to ccp right they got back from iceland
yeah i just said above it should stay openstill it will be locked anyways in 12 days and well be back to posting on a forum the devs will actully readthe whole point of this forums is the csm tell ccp what is written herethe game dev forum still gets dev feedback
this is kind of a lost case that has been forgotten far to long caldari players unitewhy do our beloved crystal implant set not work for our capital shield booster the description has always said that the set will give a boost to shield boost amountwhy do we not have an officer implant that allows us to have more shield can you show me a set of implants that you think would like nice on a caldari capitalthe armor tankers has had an advantage far to long i suggest our dear csm will push for developement no to slave implants for capitalstotal ban for officer implants with more then 5 armor amounti say again unitesoren

hello csm membersas some of you might know minmatar is laking in some areas i know people disagree  agree on this however quite a lot of treads are made in the past  some new ones currently in discussion we like to have somebody who can help us just to get an honest opinion from ccp who whatever also i would like to suggest you check the following treadlinky
the large autocannon issue was brought to the csm by bane and there are issue threads in the assembly hall about minmatar capitals and large artillery but i believe they where not discussed by the csm
well thats why i am asking kindly for a help of a csm because it neeeds to be discussed its a rather large problem just check the tread  you will see it
this got discussed in an optional aob slot at the conference ccp didnt have time to do the background research to give a formal technical response but they did let me present the issue and we had a good round table discussion of the pros and cons it appeared that dual ownership is a nogo because of programming issues  but there was general support for flipping the ownership from the killed pilot   gang   to the killing pilot  gang   as a reward for actually performing the kill  basically treating pvp wrecks like npc wrecks   we dont have the formal minutes yet but im pretty sure we voted this as a high priority option and since its just a simple flip of ownership rather than new programming id be hopeful wed see action on this within a decent timescale ill certainly be following up on the issue during my term on the csm
flag the thief to anyone not just the corp who piloted the blown up ship1   that way you can shoot those that take from the can that are in npc corps you cant counterwardec2   someone that wants to help the person blown up can retaliate in their name3   alliance mates in different corps can defend ore cans in high sec4   give griefers a whole new profession ganking gankersmore pew pew all around
the frustration of not being able to keep what i kill because i cant tractor or protect my kills is extremely frustrating taark

100 agree with the op and on a sidenote the devs seem to think making minmatar pilots train 2x as much to be competitive is balanced because they just gave us a minityphoon

thatd be great can you possibly give us an outline more specifically how this will be prestented at the august meeting
this discussion and the ideas put forward by yorda definately have my support
total support especially on the dreadnought front
i support this idea i also think there needs to be some kind of change that will stop docking games personally i think if you undock and are at war your redocking timer should be longer like a minute instead of 30 seconds and to jump off a similar idea the deaggro timer should be much longer for redocking if you undock start fighting releasing your going to lose you just stop shooting and wait your 30 secondsanother thing if your at war with corp a and people from corp b starting remote boosting or use some other method so they can be flagged if you attack them they should stay flagged for all of your corp recently had a problem where we attacked a guy from corp b we didnt kill him but every time the log ships repped up one of our guys they had their aggro timer reset so the guy from corp b came back and attacked the log ships but the combat ships couldnt do anything about it that is a load of crap in my opinion if someone attacks one person in your corp your whole corp should have that person flagged maybe not to start but once they open fire they are fighting the corp
must support better pos setup

minmatar large projectiles in general need a serious review especially the 1400mm arty

my friend swapped from a maelstrom to a raven with minimal cruise missile skills hes much more capable of actually killing thingseven in pve we need some love for artillery lower rof higher damage multiplier and fix the tracking how do 1400mm track so slow a team of brutors with wrenches out there undoing the mounting moving it to the side and refastening the gun to the ship after a coffee break
loli could totally see some guys sitting on the ship getting the order to shoot the enemy and out there with the cranks adjusting the gun pivot hows that look hmm more to the left
lol yeah u could probs imagine it on sum old carry on minmatar film moving the cannon left right upand down lol
supportedthe 1400mm artillary was never brought in line with the others ever since its alpha was negated due to the hp buff
signedbut i believe all large projectiles need to be boosted
its not only the 1400
waaaaaaagh baby
this convinced me
this has my vote as well as this in less words
would be nice
give me the ability to join without leaving my corp and alliance
i actually know that there are already a few   if you dont want multihundred member corporations join do exactly that sorry your corp is too big to joinif you dont want sovereigntyholding alliances  or corps in them   to join do exactly that sorry your alliance is holding sovereignty we dont serve that kind hereetc
1my only concern given that this will generate an influx of larger corps into fw is whether the losec sandbox  bleak lands etc   is actually big enough to accomodate the additional pilots20 man gate camps on every gate in the region does not sound fun 
not supporting this unless an alliance signing up for fw at the same time also sign off on their ability to claim sovereignty
personally i think it should require a vote by the whole alliance where they choose what militia will be joined then the interested corporation with the needed standing would be capable of joining only that corporationthink about it if it was done as you suggest without a vote the first corporation to join a militia will lock all the others to a single faction it is not something that should be decided by the fastest corporation or even by the holding corporation
yes yes please fw corps to be allowed to retain their alliance ties
this i dont want to leave my corp to join up to a militia a militia isnt supposed to be a massively organised corp but a group of individuals comming together for a common cause dunno that made sense but it did in my head 
number 1 has my support
supported its disappointing that cva and uk are limited in their participationto prevent  more   powerblobs forming maybe only certain alliances could be permitted to sign up their corporations rather than looking to mechanics to be the be all and end all the case is brought before a dev  maybe someone in community management   who decides whether to tick the box for alliance x so the rp alliances would likely be guaranteed participation but the likes of bob or razor or goonswarm would have to work harder maybe even this wont be necessary the more people an alliance has factionally warring the fewer people they have defending 00the big problem with tying fw participation to not sov holding is cva
this isnt about alliances joining fw its about corps that are part of alliances joining fw whilst retaining membership of their alliance
i dont see how it makes sense for a corp to commit to being part of an alliance then also commit to being part of another alliancefaction a way for an alliance to commit to support another would be betterif it was to go ahead at corp level then this option would be the better of the choices
supported but i would like to see every corp in an alliance allowed by the mechanics to join whatever faction it likes the potential fun of shooting alliance mates is simply too great to pass up
yes obv
option 1 seems to be the best to me
go for it  especially since part of the outblobbing that was raised as a worry has happened but partially as an effect of various alliances not being able to join in their side is getting blobbed  
10
1 this cause has my support but reguarding the above comment you may as well create a corp outside the alliance in the name of the alliance as many have donein theory id like to see corps being able to join as they like but in practise entire allian
yes
had a good discussion on this one we made the point that its literally impossible to kill capital ships and well tanked battleships within the current 45 sec docking aggression window and this needs to be changed we discussed the variable dock timer  after pvp aggression   for different hull classes  ie the bigger the hull the bigger the timer   and also a general increase in the timer to reflect the incremental hit point buffs received by all ships over the last few years of patches  ccp recognized that by firing on another player you are committing yourself to pvp and there shouldnt be an easy get out of the jail free card from dockundock gameswe also raised the issue of remote repping being abusable in station dock range  stargate jump range   warfare and addressed the possibility of having reps vs a ship in aggression timer counting as aggression for the repper  ie if you rep a ship that cannot dock due to the docking aggression timer the repairing ship will also get the docking aggression timer   additionally we raised as a ui issue  could we get a dockingjump aggression timer visisible as a countdown  similar screen area to the global aggression timer this got registered a high priority issue for fixing and balance
we had a good long discussion on these i made the case for the changes proposed in this and other threads on the subject and csmccp debated the role of blackops and current limitations in the game environment outcome was that csm advised this as a high priority issue and the prospective solutions on the table are 1 increased fuel capacity  probably through implementation of a custom fuel bay for jump capable ships that allows balancing on fuel capacity independently of cargo bay size 2 immunity to cyno jammers for covert cynos 3 looking at the viability of adding other ships to the covert bridge capable class  including potentially the deep space transport grade tech2 industrials   ccp were less keen on increasing the jump range  felt that landscape of eve regions should still be an issue in deployment  ie those long pirate jumps were supposed to be a problem for blackops  similar on the specific buffs for lessening sensor resolution penalty grid and fitting improvements black ops supposed to be valuable for their role logistics and tactical flexibility  not as straight combat 1v1 ships etc as i said though csm presented this as a high priority issue  and im very hopeful well get action on the fuel bay cyno jammer immunity and additional classes of covert bridgeable ships within a reasonable timescale its flagged as a serious problem and fingers crossed well get fuel bays big enough to function and covert cynos in jammed systems soon as possible
good to hear they will be looking into it
black ops need rebalancingsupporting general idea
the most ridiculous shipclass gap in the game its friggin crazyi just want to be able to hual one jet can of ore without spending over 200mill isk on a mammoth
a itty v with rigs and expanders and gsc can empty 2 full jetcans came in right at 105m last time i bought it and it insures for under 2m isk even worse than t2 insurance i love this idea and am soon to have a new favorite csm i think lol
i know people keep telling me dont haul stuff in a ship that costs less than the goods but 100m uninsured value hauling around 6m isk worth of veldspar seems a little dumb   wholeheartedly support this idea even though its already been favourably received by ccp i especially want something for mining ops so i can visit a belt tractor the fleets jetcans  which means a few high slots no turrets   then run back to base low slots for nanofibers would be nice to allow more agility so the round trip from station to belt to station doesnt suffer a bottleneck of 2 minutes to do a 180UFFFD turn
supported its definitely a gap in progression
yes i support this not for long term but for those short skills even if it were just que 1 skill up or make amount you can que unlimited for 24 or 48 hour period if you had several 2 or 4 hour skills to dolets at least hear why ccp remains with this log in every 2 hours just to switch skills bull it does nothing to help the game really
i support simply getting a response i think a que of somesort  set number of skills   would be supported by military people facing year long deployments or month long schooling
im tired of switching skills at odd hours of the night make this game more accessible to people who arent jobless zitfaced delivery pizza eating nerdcore players
a skill que isnt needed for when i dont have time to log in and play  thats my choice   its needed for when tranquility crashes unexpectedly and i cant log in and change skills even a 12 hour 1 skill que would be a great improvement at very least an official response would finally put this issue to bed
yea
supportedunfortunately ccp wont employee a skill queue feature as this would encourage people to leave large periods of time between log ins and eventually get bored of the game  forget about the game  get out of the routine of playing the game etc this would result in people starting to realise that theyre paying for something theyre hardly using and ultimately ccps subscription income would go down
you are assuming they implement an unlimited queue ccp isnt that stupid
this debate is still ragingheres my final observation for this thread when two observations disagree at most one can be correct usually neither of them are
why you still care about 2002 prices didnt you start this thread by claiming to like the free market if so why are you so eager to return to the days of commandeconomy ceilings and floors on mineral prices that requires no balance no finesse and no respect for player time skill investment or choice of career youre just changing the laws of economics to suit your preconceptions i admit it does work in a fictional universe but its still as stupid as it would be in reality lets review here are your original aea  ccp set reward only based on npc threatb  sadly lowsec threat from players is much higher than lowsec threat from npcsc  lowsec player threat is even higher than 00 threat from playersd  ccp should make it so that lowsec mining rewards are higher than highsece  ccp should make it so that lowsec mining rewards are higher than 00with the argument youre using being that ad and abce and as stated before your argument fails miserably ac are descriptive statements de are normative claims you cannot prove a normative conclusion without a normative premise i grant the truthfulness of a but all it implies is that mining rewards were originally set up to be roughly linear to mining risks from npcs it doesnt imply that theres a problem let alone that your solution is correct b and c are irrelevant to a to the point where i dont think any sane argument can use them together a says that rewards are based on npc risk b and c talk about levels of pc risk if npc risk is the basis of the reward structure pc risk is pointless to discuss and what i meant by accepting a in its entirety is that if you say rewards were originally based on npc risk and i agree youve gotten precisely nowhere towards proving d yes rewards were established based on npc risk rewards still increase roughly in line with npc risk  there are a couple blips but on the whole its not bad even after years of price changes so given that rewards were established to line up with npc risk i can acknowledge that by pointing to 2003 prices and i can even accept a2 by pointing to the fact that its still fairly good now actually by doing so im accepting a related point  that prices should line up with npc risk which you never claim  but i figure ill cut you a bit of slack the funny thing about all this is that i agree with your fundamental point  lowsec does need boosting something fierce but the problem is that you chose to make that point in such an offensively stupid way that i couldnt let your squalid excuse for logic stand uncontested you use descriptive statements to make normative arguments your method is rife with non sequiturs and you speak of my rethoric sic   question when i didnt ask any questions let alone rhetorical ones your methodology is a miserable failure and i figured it was as good a time as any to attack it
i ran out of characters on the last post but i couldnt let this little gem gothis word free marketi do not think it means what you think it means your complaint seems to be that the laws of physics and engineering are consistent thats like complaining that everybody at a pga event is shooting for the same hole from the same tee  oh no its been reduced to a contest of player skill inconceivable furthermore your proposal from what i can tell wouldnt even fix this socalled problem  youd just create more different ways of getting the same low margins when your solution doesnt fix your problem you need a new solution   industrial margins are hardly low right now you just have to know what to build i dont have any points in pe and i still routinely see goods i could produce at a profit i dont bother since i dont keep stocks of blueprints or minerals around and i can only run one line   but any halfway competent industrial character is earning 20
god i hate these forums i was just writing a 2000 char responce when it suddently reset everything for no apparent reasonsummary of what i wanted to say2 possible solutions1 very highyield lowend asteroids in lowsec002 increased yieldm3 for veldspar  best done by decreasing veldspar volume  result highsec completely mines out veldspar  increased supply    reduced veld cost  increased cost for everything else
the removal of npc goods like coupling arrays for reprocessing to circumvent player based supply had to go just like shuttles which mirrored them on a smaller scale cant you see that ccp are trying to make easy ways to gain trit dissapear from the game over time to promote player activity ccp are trying to use players instead of code to set supply and value as they already set demand they are going towards the true free market ecomony where pvp is the name of the game eve is non consentual pvp after all its made by griefers for griefers so its stands to reason that market griefing has to be built in as its part of the eve vision truely free markets always get dominated by only a few parties  why do you think adam smith said they were bad he did you know   mom and pop farming dissapears  and i know all about that   as monopolies take over but there will always be niche markets  like organic   where small operators can profit from however in eve the structure of alliance  corporation  sole trader all can benifit as the demand can never be satisfied for trit with higher trit prices more noobs will mine corporations will start to fight over veld fields but for that to happen the price has got to risehigh trit price is a pvp opportunity for all in the roid belts corps fight over who gets the roids pirates get more targets and miners get more reward but with increaced potential for grief to maximise profits high sec mining corps will have to look to skilling up for a rorqual and moving to low sec due solely to war decs over competition for veldspar roids also with the introduction of fw which does seem to make low sec a bit safer from player agression ccp are trying social engineering instead of set buffers to change players behaviour as they know the greatest profit for the least perceived risk is where players will gravitate too thats where im coming from its ccp vision griefing for the sake of griefing the powerfull abusing thier power until another powerbloc stomps on them it also offers countless opportunities for ccp for game devolopment to keep all those 5 year old players interested and attract new players if you look its always corrective leaps via new content not nit pick every month or so if someone preceives an imbalancetake the very long view from an objective stand point you know roughly the eve storyline progression and its base paramiters that they sort of work to you know that every 6 months or so change will happenso dont get so worked up over a molehill which is what it is at the moment the current situtation is liveable under for the well foreseable future no low sec and 00 miners are migrating to high sec to mine veld for trit people may meta game it but even though meta gaming is lame and takes out the fununcertianty of life in eve  which is where the spice is   its not the same effect as the main moving out of alliance space
first off for industrial characters its not so much just margin anymore but rather margin times volume sure you could be making shuttles and selling them at 30k each for a whooping 200 margin but at barely over 200 shuttles a day production limit using all possible lines thats a measly 45 mil a day actual profit at best which kind of sucks imo so unless you list potential top profit per day alongside those margins your claims are at best irrelevant can you maintain a 20 margin for 1 bil daily investments  what about 500 mil daily investments  its all about profit per day from a certain level upward not about profit percentagesecond my argument was never about margins for industrialists that margins remark was just that a remark on how things work heck one of my mainstay arguments pretty much anywhere in productionrelated threads  be it t1 inventiont2 manufacture or whatnot   is that margins will always be relatively low for manufacturers unless you introduce a true economy of scale  ie manufacturing hundredsthousands of any unitsbatches will result in a perunit cost far below the cost of manufacturing a single unitbatch   im not even sure where the heck you want to go with it as this was never the presented problem of course none of the solutions presented here do anything for it since theyre solutions for something else entirelythird my complaint is that the laws of physics and engineering are complete and consistent in the real world yet in eve theyre all but a pathetic simulacrum theres no such things as research and developement in eve  a player can not create an item that doesnt already exist and the selection is very limited  you can not research ways to use cheaper materials to get a similar product  you can not improve the performance of a product by using better materials and so on and so forthfor this reason the claim that the market is playerdriven or the claim that the market is free has next to no value  of course its player driven driven by how many people do the math as opposed to how many fail to do so and how fast they adapt  of course its free free to not participate when profits are too low for comfort or free to participate where margins look good all in all everything in the eve economymarket is predictible given the full data on changes when you can always very accurately predict something that hardly qualifies as free anymore does it 
dont make me laugh other than the goons jihadswarm  which focused on ice miners mostly   a killing spree that only really lasted a short while  if theyre still at it the kills are negligible in volume   theres really not much in the way of griefing over veldspar miningtheres still plenty of veldspar in belts of systems within 5 jumps of jita and the price of tritanium buy orders there is pretty damned high if even there theres really not much of a competition going onungh why do i even bother
you understand what your saying and what it implies lots of veldspar roids in what you consider to be no risk space still doesnt supply sufficient reward to give enough profit  time ratio to promote it as a eve player activity basically miners dont mine solely for trit  veldspar   because they can mine better profits else whereedit or do other more profitable things ffs having to put something so bloody obivious in is pandering to utter stupidity but ill do to stop more cretins edityes you get it finally veldspartrit is undervalued not the other way round at the moment
do you even play this game or are you just intentionally spouting nonsense the only reason nobody mines for veldspar is that everybodys running l4 missions not because everybody is mining something else or somewhere elsemining veldspar you get around the equivalent of 5 mil iskhour solo in a covetor or up to 10 mil iskhour in a larger gang with a mindlinked commander while flying a hulk and splitting profits with haulersspeedrunning l3 missions in a drake you get more than 5 mil iskhour pure cash from bounties and rewards alone up to 10 mil iskhour if you consider everything else too  lps at a decent exchange ratio the occasional implant storyline etc  speedrunning l4s in a cnr however will offer at least 20 mil sikhour in bountieslp combined more per account and with less risk if youre dualboxing  50 milhour on two accounts combined is not abnormal  so if you need something or somebody to blame blame the fact mining is too lame to be an attractive alternative  unless its very profitable   and missionrunning too freaking profitable  even if a tad bit boring after a while  
bimbo your position is flawed the problems are real the devs are aware of them and are working towards solutions to fix it
and where on gods green earth can highsec miners find something more valuable than veldsparpeople arent mining veld because theres something better to do  missions trading pvp whatever   not because trit is undervalued its like comparing apples to orangesalso what kazzac elentria said
i posted a lot of numbers to back myself up to prove that veldspar is better than most anything else until you get to true 00 ore i look to have been ignore to continue the bickering though
because we still have the same 2002 blueprints that were created and calculated based on those base prices and price ratios cant you comperehend such a simple fact prices price ratios and riskreward system changed but the blueprints are still the same as they were in the beginingget that into your think skulland special one for bimbo we have a free market in the sence that you are free to starve to death you are not free to change anything but the price you cannot invent more effective methods or alternative sources to take advantage of material shortages and manufacturing limitsso we have a free market but a fixed economy based on fixed laws that were set in stone in the begining and did not change since
moons pos and sov need fixing nto sure this is the way but discuss it

lol you peeps really fall into a trap cant you understand what i said sorry for not adding pictures or mentioning the bloody obivious  every competing action that has a greater profit potential   as you are too slow to grasp the big pictureif mining for trit is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract minersall your really pointing out is that lvl 3 and 4 missions belong in a higher risk area like low sec as they pay too highly especially when loot and salvage is taken into account to be within the risk reward for high sec as high sec only has frigate rats in belts it should be a given that the highest mission rat should be cruisers with the very odd bs after all higher reward deserves higher risk kazzac i looked at jades posts 
then you werent paying attention csm meetings covered the 00 dilemma the fact that there is no drive to move to 00 space despite that being game design they also discussed the broken sov mechanics how they affect the t2 component market with regards to prices etcit all got covered you just fail at reading comprehensioneither that or epic troll is epicand thinking about it i just agreed with jade in regards to some positions i feel dirty now
signedthough i dont nessessarily agree with every akita says this one is spot onthe biggest reason that eve is not a free market is due to the restrictions that ccp has put into the manufacturing process lets say you were making a car in real life  yes i know its a game   if the prices of steel went through the roof you can make your body panels out of aluminum then electrical prices soar driving up price of that so you switch to polymars crap the epa just altered its rules on dangerous chemicals so you now are building your body panels in brazil where the restrictions are lowerin eve you have none of those options if the price of moonmaterials required for t2 ships are out of wack because of lack of supply  or market control of rare moons   you should be inventing alternative methods of building the ship with different materials as it is you are bound to an overpriced supply of arbitrary stuff with no method of getting around itgive us alternatives because what we have now is mostly a shift in market control from the bpo owners to who controls the moons hardly a free market if anything the prices are even more tightly dictated now
you need to check the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on checkbox too im seriously leaning on the epic troll is already epic option myselfbut hey free bumps 
but we are not currently discussing moon materials or t2 but riskrewardprofit ratio and how it applies to mining and trit so only half of akita ts op and not the half were discussing in these few postsumm makes me wonder
this is a game and its suppossed to be fun however a free market without the options i mentioned will always spiral into a deadlock situation where those with the resources have everything and the rest can live on scrubs that wont make for a fun game also there will be no challenge for anybody to attempt without a ridiculous high barrier to entry  as was the t2 lottery  you are arguing principles regardless of their application and results of that application and we are arguing game balance to make a game fun thus we have no meeting point in the different viewsno use arguing with you  and akita tried realy hard  
there right there you shot yourself in the foot with a giant bazookaif mining for x is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract minersthat is exactly what akita has been  saying for god knows how many postsreplace x with mexallon isogen nocx and your argument that trit does not need to go down in price is flawedjust look at procurement specialists pricesevery lowend ore is less valuable than tritanium thus by your statement above it would mean that miners should be attracted to mining mexallon isogen nocx by increasing their price this will never ever happen without ccp interventionrarity should be directly proportional to value yet for tritanium it is notif mining for mexallon is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract minersif mining for isogen is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract minersif mining for nocxium is not giving enough profit then the price must rise to attract minersget it
you are an idiot you always only pick a very specific part of the whole and never try to reason from the perspective of the whole game universe you never seem to connect the dots  or are unable to  
well like said before your certainly lived up to the brainless partfree bumps indeed
fixdbut other than that yup couldnt have said it better myself
umm currently the price of trit is high as demand out strips supply other minerals are depressed as supply out strips demand due to the limited supply of tritakita t has been saying nothing of the sort shes saying trit prices are too high the ratios between the minerals are broken and she wants them reinstated look at the opyou are calling me out on me agreeing with myself wtfoh trit is under supplied ie rare in porportion to its demand as its a huge volume that is required i argue all the time that trit prices are too low for this very reason
i thought internet spaceships were serious business not fun whats fun its a subjective when you look at it so some have fun ratting others mining others sitting in jita doing the 001 isk manipulations you just want cake because you dont have what the big alliances have as they arent in here moaning about the price of trit are they
no no no i agree with the position that veldspar gives a great reward not in proportion to risk in high sec but my point is under current market conditions to meet the demand for trit its price will have to rise regardless of risk reward as its under supplied because its such a high volume demandedi have seen buy orders for 37 isk for trit the average is 3 isk there is enough isk around to allow a for trit price rise were all just greedy and dont want to pay
bimbos statement was that trit demand far outstrips supply thus with trit being the shortage mineral the price of trit must rise to attract miners to come mine it for the production train to get going againno other mineral is used in such vast quantities  please everyone agree with that statement   and tritanium is currently the largest deadlock mineral so prices are having to elevate above originally intended to make it attractive to minemy issue is that the only way to fix this problem  for those who agree it is a problem as the most abundant mineral in the universe should not normally be the train stopper   is to reduce the quantities required of tritanium adjust bpos or increase the supply somehow this is like having a deadlock on universal hydrogen it is everywherenow i dislike this but my specific concern is that mining for a mineral should always be the best source of that mineral this is why in 00 where i mostly live i want better yielding veld so that i can mine trit at a better rate than i can rat it it makes rp sense and on the reverse side giving empire poorly yielding arkonor and other 00 roids allows the economy more freedom and i didnt want to give a buff to just 00 i have mining friends that stick to empire too
not really an issue in 00 trit prices are lowered because it is so friggin painful to haul it to jita for selling high ends match jita much more closely do to logistics i still buy trit at 2 and pyerite for under 1 on buy orders all teh timemy main is telxkiskisrowr in goonswarm but procurement comes up first alphabetically
qft
well as moon materials and roid minerals are derived by different mechanics they should be split up this whole thread has been plauged by picking on parts of peoples posts so if you want me to discuss the whole moon and roid thing in one topic it wont happen as both are drivencontrolled by different mechanics even though they both effect t2 production and alliance captial production  who shouldnt have issues with prices of raw materials  moon mins are totally under alliance control roids are not but what akita t wants to do doesnt fix the issue in a decent way its not elegant and good code is always elegant
of course he said that relative trit demand is too high because relative highend supply is too highhe said that trit price is too high and that the market supplydemand works fine therefore it logically follows that1 trit demand is too high2 ratio between minerals is brokenim really tempted to report you for stupidityinability to read sadly thats not a valid reason to get you gagged
how can trit demand be too high its a reaction to what people want to build ffs low cost high ends have stimulated production which has led to the shortage1 trit demand is too high also means too many people want to build stuff doesnt it2 ratio between mineral values are not reflected in the market place as they are linked to supply of individual minerals to thier demand requirements in game the roid ratio is fine its just that high sec has too many high reward activities and mining veld doesnt cut it anymore why mine when you can put on your posing pouch and run lvl 4 missions which really belong in low sec if the riskreward is taken into account ratios of requirement is set  bpos   but pricesreal values arent as they are realised in a player run free market ecomony with a free price system

akita t did point out that the drone drops do not balance and she is correct the drops are too valuable for the risk  reward is set too high   and does lead to a localised trit shortage as miningreprocessing for trit is not cost effective also it does have the potential capacity to flood the market  which is what akita t suggests but im not really sold on as its only 8 of regions out of 63   its a fix that is better than adding alternative bpos as its quick and easy and doesnt add pointless stuff and removes a localised anomoly
victory at last  recognition the fact that zydrine and megacyte prices crashed heavily while tritanium experienced a heavy supply shortage almost immediately after the tntroduction of the drone regions  theres a lot more than just one  theres eight of them all of them generating almost exclusively highends out of every belt kill valuewise  thats basically one drone region for every other four 00 regions   should have been a dead giveawayin base values you get something akin to 3 to 6 mil isk worth of minerals per drone battleship kill iirc which can easily happen every 5 minutes or so if not even more often allowing those drops to be almost perfectly balanced mineralratiowise would be akin to letting the drone regions be almost fully selfsufficient  youd only need pos npcsold consumables and thats about it   so you probably want to only partially balance them  say leave 13 as is and change 13 of highends value in mixed lowends values that way you end up with only 13 of the previous value as export potential  so in the end you finally arrive to  almost   completely agree with one of the several solutions i presented in the opand it only took you what 8 pages 
why not every other 00 region can be t1 sufficient until you start trying to produce cap swarms cap swarm prodruction simply takes more than 1 region of resources so no region can be sufficient by itself for that
what i say your name and your happy lol you do understand that i really only disagree with you on the perception of severity and the choices you give for rectifing it i prefer the market to fix it as far as it can as thats better for the game in the very long term i am totally opposed to the different mineral requirement duplicate good bpos as it doesnt really add anything into the game apart from pointless complexity for its own sake i think i may have suggested  if i havent i should have   the addition of bpc meta lvl t1 good drops from rats with different mineral requirements as it stays within the story of eve and is of limited overall effect as it is producing existing goods that cant be manufactured at present and have a ready market those goods could be anything that drops now but it also leaves it open to ccp to give pirate faction ships as a logicial extention an addition that a great number of people would like to see i also agreed with on page 1 here both of these add to the existing game by broadning it opening up avenues not yet explored that already exist a tweak not a revamp which will be tech 3 in a year plusim all for a free market ecomony with free price systems that totally rely on player demand and supply no npc station shop sources of minerals via reprocessing and insurance being tweaked to provide only a portion of the daily eden mean value of raw material cost of the ship when it was destroyed that way player loss is mitigated to a degree and discourages ganking in high sec unless its really profitable mining reward will always be driven by the market  and the market by logistics to a lesser extent   and roid composition will continue to reflect security status  npc threat   its known that ccp have been comtemplating changing the roid allocation across eve that will be the time to tweak mineral make up and refinable quantities of the ores to lessen the trit bottleneck in production as the player base and thereby demand grows risk reward is broken but i feel that its the lvl 3 and 4 missions that break it they offer too high a risk and reward in comparison to the risk of the space they occur in they should be located in the security status of the average rats level they employ so nothing larger than a rat cruiser could appear in high sec space mission runners get low sec rewards fighting low sec npcs in high sec and thats a bigger problem as it stops migration to low sec however fw has open up the opportunity to move them expand fw at the same time and let them have relative safety as missions are more a home guard role instead of a skirmish role like fw
yes l4 missions in 8 space are a bit absurd wth is concord doing to let multiple criminal bs in players cant get in ways to alter productionthe actual ways to alter production belong in a separate thread use that one or start a new one but the idea that something can be changed to fix it isnt bad i still say that adding low ends to drone mis to produce more sustainable drone regions and introducing higher yield low end roids in low sec and null sec would allow the market to fix everything else itself the drones and rat loot artifically devalue mining but i would not want another you get more ore fix the suggestions like the 110th ore size where nothing can help mining dont really fix that disparity of trit needed vs minable amounts compared to zydrinemegacyte needed vs mining amounts sorry i think i rambled long day and getting tired
thats not how you seem to be expressing yourself not by a long shot the market cant fix it ever all by itself without ccp interventionif the current ores remain the way they are right now if the current blueprints remain the way they are right now if the current drone alloys remain the way they are right now if missionrunning remains this profitable and no other price caps are removed nothing at all will changeif all remaining price caps will be removed tritanium will slowly drift upwards while the rest of the minerals will drift downwards screwing up the potential revenue ratios even moreif insurance gets removed  or reduced   the entire mineral market will suffer a relatively even percentual drop until the new balance pointif missionrunning in highsec becomes roughly equally profitable  given similar skillattention levels   to highsec veldspar mining then you might finally see a surge of tritanium volumes with trit prices lowering slowly but surely to the breakeven point between missionrunning and mining but that can only mean a huge outcry from the missionrunner crowd which for better or worse make up a significant portion of the playerbase so this option is pretty much out of the questionif drone alloys get changed to include a rather equal value composition  basepricewise   of all mineral types in a typical drone belt rat drop  not in separate compounds which can be discarded but in each and every compound   then their influence gets nullified and we go back towards a prekali mineral pricing scheme still we wont quite get there yet since the old cheap trit reprocessing options are no longer there and demand for capitals is increasing the more the game progresses  and thats tritheavy   so its still just a mere bandaid rather than a fixthe only two permanent fixes which no longer depend much on the drone regions or anything else for that matter is either the alternative blueprints idea  which isnt all that great for ore minerals but its workable and requires no coding just the addition of some static data   or the total revamp of the mining system in such a way that all ores are present everywhere but no matter what you mine mining that specific ore in a lower truesec system will always result in more ore of that type extractedso there you have it  urgency because a change introduced a year and a half ago screwed up the mining system and recent changes have done nothing to fix it quite the contrary  and a list of possible solutions from stopgap measures and bandaids that require little actual work on ccps behalf to complete solutions to current and potentially future problems  problems in case the solution presented is not chosen but only the bandaids applied  
the goon on page one had a good idea need to go wash my mouth out with soap
ganking should and is a perfectly valid option however ironically those against this proposal keep quoting that eve should have consequences when theyre busy using a system without consequences namely suicidingat present if i want to suicide gank a target i  my friends roll 12 alts fit suitable ships  kestrels are quite popular   gank the target collect the insurance and loot forward both to the main char and delete the altthis happens rather a lot the sec status hit that comes with ganking becomes irrelevant in this case on the other hand if a kill in highsec resulting in concord voided insurance payouts it would at least require sufficient profit to be undertakenrisk vs reward the gankers should be risking something the mission runners already are
change is needed
not only should jade be banned from the game  but the internet and childrens areas of major theme parks as well
this statement is so full of fail its not even funny    he is role playing something we all do everyday not only that hes an adult this thread needs to be lockeddeletedak
well made the pitch and ccp certainly took the discussion seriously we had a decent discussion on the topic and debated the pros and cons and motives behind it there are technical reasons why outright destruction of outposts isnt currently possible given the interdependency of programming and database issues  market clones etc etc   and we were asked the question of what exactly we wanted to achieve with this proposal answer to this boiled down to a   a way for non territory holding alliances to hurt territory holding alliances without becoming territory holding alliances  ie more options in the 00 sandbox  b   increased cost of warfare in 00  attrition   making the cost of fighting more significant on the alliance scalec   reward for raiders who can take outposts we were offered a compromise solution around the principle of pillageable outposts  where forces can take outposts and pretty much strip out the fixtures and fittings  station services   and melt them down into componentsminerals etc and ship them out in freighters this gives a reward for capturing outposts that is useful to roving pvp forces space vikings and a penalty for lost outposts  reclaiming owners would need to invest again to restore stripped down services bad outposts in poor positions on the map could just be stripped out by their owners forcing any enemy groups wishing to utilize them as beach heads to invest isk and materials to bring them up to functional status i felt this to be a very good compromise solution and was happy that ccp gave the topic all due attention and respect and made the time on the agenda to think through the implications and offer a decent middle ground option in formal debatemade running for csm all worthwhile
im slightly disappointed that i didnt find this thread earlier but there is a better way to change 00 stations in my opinion making them destructible isnt the course of action id take instead id prefer to see all assets in the station lost and the conquering corporation able to run off with the spoils i will not deny that is more and more difficult for small alliances to get a foothold in 00 but that could be dealt with in other manners  more space removal of the dreaded local or congregation with other small alliances the idea of blowing up stations would bring metagaming to a whole new level instead of haha i stole your titan it might be haha i stole your station all your assets and then blew it up further more destructible stations makes reconquering space much less desirable and leads to less pew pew this is good if you like the idea of the superblocs continuing to spread like a plague but it gives small alliances even less of a reason to settle permanently in nonnpc controlled 00 by allowing conquering corporations to pillage all the assets of a station i think youll achieve the desired highrisk eve gameplay without risking the further 00 foothold the superblocs maintain
that is why i disagree with the idea of this topicit would permit the very strong alliances to just go and wreck everything the smaller ones have build so that would be very hard for them to get back the lost areas since to built outposts is a huge investment on the other side the very rich alliance would hve no problem after devastated the weaker alliance outpost and lead them to go back to empire out of frustraion would have enough funds to rebuild everything at a later timeit has been said also that very big alliances consider certain parts of 00 as crap and they would prefer just destroy everything there and kick out the holders only to leave empty space because for a big bad rich alliance a piece of 00 may be considered crap but for some opther players it could mean lots of fun and value with this new idea you destroy the fun of players belonging to smaller more personable corps just because you the big bad mega alliance decided that their space is crap to you but not enough crap top let the guys be this is griefing and kills the fun for many playrs not beloging to the biggest alliances out thereit generally favors the destructivenonconstructive way of playing so not supportedps and jade i supported you in other threads but i dont think this idea had enough playerbase support to give you the right to go and present it to ccp on that matter for me it was an abuse of power on your part
not signed after reading it all i can only say one thing about this thread ridiculous
i look forward to seeing this thread continue after the 6 months are up and jade and the other csm members are replaced by the new lot  because people can and will be that stupid
actually jade has been removed from chair they decided on rotating the chair position so jade isnt the permanent chair anymorecongratulationsyou have won
is there any pricebesides funny hats

i support this for the simple fact that the chair engages in childish banter with his criticsyou dont see real world people of power posting videos on youtube to call their critics names and liars not that this has happend with the csm yet  
well heres one this ones even betterthis one is epic slap across the facewe could certainly go on but anyways heres the bottom line ccp recognize that the csm delegates represent different interest groups from the community and its our role to best represent our constituencies we had an excellent historical lecture on the roots of icelandic democracy during the csm conference and heard ourselves described as internet chieftains responsible for thrashing out laws and policies in open and passionate debate this is raw democracy and plainspeaking and its very far away from the sanitized imagepolitics of idealized process that some on this thread have lamented the lack off we had a superb conference in iceland and each of the csm delegates did an excellent job in representing their constituencies and supporters and cooperating in addressing critical issues to the game at this time at the close of business i asked my fellow csm reps if theyd be happy to see me continue as chair till the end of the first session of the csm and got their full support so thats the deal really anybody who didnt like the way ive handled the chair position this time around is welcome to stand at the next csm in the winter and who knows get the support promote your message appeal to the voters and get elected and youll get a chance to show us all how its done until then lets get back to business
in my poor mind itll bring too much power in the frigate hullbut af need love definitelyhere is what we have discussed many times in the pastfirst of all af should have role then it is time to rebalance  if need  in real world such ships have application as carrierbased shortrange fightersthey are durable have power but lack of range and need support mainly in refuellingrepairingin eve you cant actually dock to carrier which is sadand there are no real role for af which is sad twicethings can be solved by set of changes but id better ask our fc to explain it he have very structured and rocksolid view of how it must workill try to post tomorrow
it only seems logical
i like this idea as something for the drawing board im in favor of anything that keeps the arms race interesting and evolving taark
pay attention closely because this is complicatedi trained a long time to get my nano ship as fast as it is i spend upwards of 300mil on each of my nano shipsthe list of ships that can kill my nano ship happen to take the same amount of training and time it took me to get itif you want to stop a t2 cruiser with anything not t2 then your delusional unless i screw up when im flying it
how inconveniant to be required to use alternative tactics and  shock horror   change your fittings occasionally
supporting for examination i dont want a complete reduction as some are advocating id like some proper thought as to the problem and solution goumindong  marcus gideon have put forward some interesting notions from which something could be spunpeople are busy arguing about 00 causing nanoships well sure and if nanoships only worked in 00 this would be ok trouble is they work everywhere else too where the counters that people propose often are not as simple to musterfinally whilst there is some credence to the notion that your insured 20m raven shouldnt be able to kill my 250m uninsured vaga this isnt really valid logic given ccps continual statement new players should be just as capable as old players new players lack cash and sp and therefore arguing that the only counter to nanos is to get out of pvp until youve trained  earned more is not a valid one tongueincheek   either that or we get the truth out which is that older players are vastly more effective and theres no point in pvp and everyone less than a year old should just get back to highsec npc corps and stop wasting time and giving free kills away i think this proves the entire point of the need for a rebalance since when has anyone ever tried to argue that nothing but a carrier can kill a carrier or a battleship kill a battleship next well be arguing that frigates must not be able to kill titans
thats the point i suppose catching nanos does not require a change of fittingsit requires a change of ship to a limited selection that are sucessful only because they have a specific bonus
thats completely flawed should my crappy noob ship be able to take a battleship can one battle ship take on and kill a carrier then why should it be that way with nano shipsall i am saying is it is pretty easy to stop them a decent interceptor pilot can stop nanos real fast intys take what 3 months to get into from the day you start playing the game but should your t1 destroyer be able to stop me no should your big slow bs be able to kill me every time i show up nojust because it takes a certain type of ship to stop a nano doesnt mean its broken it means you have to train a certain type of ship wow imagine that you dont have an i win button against my nano but either have to use tactics a few certain ships or just accept that i will be able to escape
actually no an interceptor pilot has very little chance of catching them unless they to also nano setup which youll find if you do that your inty goes pop pretty quickits a simple fix really change the agility mod and force larger ships to take much longer to accelerate and then change the mod on webs so that larger ships slow down that much fasterthen your little ships can still coast out of web range everynow and then like intended and your larger nano bs and hac nanos etc have a much harder time escaping a good web
on the contrary  my retort to your original flawed logic was perfectly fine youre now changing your tune that its all about 1vs1 which is not the point at allit remains the case that for virtually every ship in existence a group of other lesser ships can go take that ship down it rarely matters what ships those are just as long as you bring enough such fights when committed to are decided prior to actual combat by fittings and numbers and skill nanoships by comparison turn this on its head allowing the pilot to dictate what engagements they fight and to run away from those that are unfavourable conversely antinano gangs must set up specifically for them with specific skills and setups and may even find themselves at a disadvantage because of itccp stated their reasons for changing the wcs restrictions as wanting pilots to commit to fights it seems reasonable to continue this line of thought rather than have a double standard  or will you argue that only the rich and old should be able to not commit to fightsput simply whilst i empathise with the notion that says youve spent time and money on your nanoship that is not a valid argument if it were we could go back to wow and have levels where time spent in the game determines how effective you are at combat i dont think that that is healthy for eve

signed the nh needs a fix both to grid and the useless precision bonus
140ish pg and something to replace the useless precision bonus is what nighthawk needs to be viable in pvp
although i strongly oppose too much balancing and equality in this game and i love how each races ships are very different from other races i do agree that the nighthawk should be at least slightly improved if not both damage wise and power core wise at least one of these improvements is needed for sure
as someone who just started flying nighthawks i can say wholeheartedly agree that something needs to be done about this
im a 100 caldarionly character but the crappy crane have made me think about training for the amarr prorator please make the crane more then just a nice looking blockade runnereremet
not really true with a pg implant let us assume the crane gets 4 more grid now if we fit for optimum align times  polcarbs and istabs   including a mwd and cloak and a buffer shield tank i get the following statsalign time  ehp  base speed  sig rad  cargoprorator  23  9769  250  1389  3125viator  26  12222  266  1389  3750prowler  26  11618  289  12706  4063crane  26  13895  258  14439  4375what is striking to me is how much quicker the prorator aligns than all the others but this is balanced by the others having 2040 more cargo in this configurationi think 4 power grid and 10 sig rad would be fair for the crane  translates into roughly a 01s quicker locking time for a decent hic for example   as it really needs something it is significantly worse at in comparison to the viator and prowler to compensate for its larger base cargo and buffer tankhorses for courses as always if you want the best ship for a particular job then you need to train more than one race
economy currently planets are pretty much just warp able objects with the cool stuff in orbit around them  belts  moons   issue flying to empire to pick up npc manufactured pos fuel  maintenance resources what if we  pod pilots   could scan planets  and maybe moons too   for the resources required to run stations then had the ability to set up factories or mines in the confines of a tower pos or an outpost to run and control those terrestrial structures perhaps multiple types of structures per orbital body based on the resources on that body and the type of pos available this is a huge can of worms but if it is possible it could add a massive new dimension to the player based economyuranium mines where you can actually use those slaves that fall out of mission objectives or if your a softy you could use robotics insteadrobotics factories suitable locations for establishing factories to make these little gadgets plus all the components that go in them that are currently included in npc markets  electronics which can be used for t2 metals microchips silicates etc  cattle ranches because everyone in their right mind just wants a good steak every once in a while  outpost maintenance anyone what do all those docked pilots eat   exotic dance club well they need some where to work and putting them in jet cans is such a waste oxygen distillery pos need it very few planets have it in abundance that just names a few potentials all the fuels and npc produced items could become player produced additionally create an empire demand for these products based on maintenance requirements for those stations let shortage and the economy determine purchase prices while some goods are manufactured in empire they are not sufficient to cover the demands of billions of the empires residents basically any item that is demanded or produced by the 4 major empires  or player alliances   to feed and maintain their citizenry and stations if it can be produced in nullsec could create a much more vibrant and profitable economy the advantage to this is that is adds much greater depth to the economy and encouraged development of nullsec this could add a new level of sustainability to 00 life and make alliances and factions truly independent in addition to sustainable life in nullec it would serve to tie the alliances to the empires via supply and demand the disadvantage is that we would all need to train a lot of new skills if implemented i dont know how to run a uranium mine now or a cattle ranch additionally it is a massive development project for ccp probably on par with other major depolyments comments please taark
how about combining this with the need to buy planet property first the realestate market this would produce could excite once more the industrial playerbasewho doesnt want to own x of jita 44 p similar to renting offices todayon a more serious note owning a property would need to mean something and your suggestion answers that nicely
i have spent a lot of time in nullsec in the past a significant portion of my eve career one of our biggest issues was that theoretically we were a self sustaining alliance we could build our ships weapons and bullets but we had to run to empire for everything from oxygen to robotics in order to prop up that industry if i was a selfsufficient mega corporation  which is how i have viewed alliances and their corps   i would want to build additional assets in my territory that make me as self sustaining as possible if pilots had a way to create their own logistics base it would add new dimensions to the supply and demand  pilot and npc   empire economy inter alliance warfare combat logistics and trade logistics if npc stations began demanding products for their maintenance  in addition to what they buy now   that could also serve to encourage more trade in empire and more profits in nullsec other then the size of the perspective sandwich something like this could add a lot of color to the universe
interesting idea this would take a lot of time to flesh out and implement but its an interesting idea and worth talking more about
would add a whole new dimention to the game what about the stations that orbit the planets in high secwould the npcs who own those stations also own said planet and would you be able to put up a station in high sec if you could get 100 ownership of a planettribe
excellent ideas we should definitely be able to exploit planetary resources and the alliances in 00 should definitely be able to become self sufficient i support this
pvp is typically a group activity in this game but when it comes to making isk thats almost always done alonein empire people run level four missions or they mine lowends or they play the market or they build and sell ships and mods all of these things are mostly solo activities sure you can run a level four with a few of your friends for fun but the game disincentivizes it because you make more isk doing it alonein 00 people rat alone or mine alone or run complexes alone  using two accounts   etc moneymaking is typically a pretty lonely activity sometimes someone invites a few friends along to run a difficult complex but those are pretty infrequent opportunities and only a handful of people are needed out of an alliance of hundreds of players occupying the spacei would like to see the game mechanics push player toward cooperative groupbased pve activities for making the real isk thats the visionthese are things that are not the visionrare pve encounters that are wildly insanely profitable but that are tied to specific static locations in space andor that only support a few players at a time see static complexesgroup activities that can be completed by some lone wolf with one account running a battleship and a second  or third   account running a logistics ship see most complexes currently found through explorationventures that require groups to do but arent worth the time and effort of running with a group see level five missions  which technically be soloed with a carrier by the way  ventures that require hours and hours to see through to the endventures that yield rewards that cannot easily and immediately be divied up among the participants see taking a fleet across the map to take a dyspro moon that feeds profits into an alliance wallet that you never seeventures that allow the participants to be any safer than the sec rating of the space where they are playing allows if youre doing a group activity in 00 then youre just as vulnerable as you would be when rattingexcept youll be with a gang of your friends if hostiles come aroundany form of nerf to the current state of mission running or ratting this is about adding something new to the game not about taking anything awayif the vision is met when i log in to the game there should be multiple groups of my corpmates who are eager to have me join them in one of several fun reasonablylucrative group activities solo mining and ratting should become the domains of the antisocial and those who dont have enough playtime to complete a group activity i will no longer need to have a movie playing on another monitor whenever i need to make some isk in evewhat do you think sound fun
replying to support my own idea
this was a huge topic of discussion and covered a while range of subjects we were able to ask is this supposed to work this way  ie are you supposed to be able to jump bridge capitals into a cyno jammed system   and the answer was yesccp did intend it to work this way and it was supposed to represent defense advantage and give the defenders capital superiority they came back and asked us do the csm think its current balanced and should defense advantage be lessened and we all  pretty sure   answered no its not balanced and the cynojammerjump bridge situation needs to be looked at as a high priority since its not improving 00 warfare and is currently very unreasonable in the current state of the game
agreedeven if there were some advanced features to allow corp or pos related mails to go directly into appropriate folders that would be a start

absolutely
thisand i want the name of my ship to be written on the hull somewhere dammit
i used to want this until someone brought up a pointlaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag
i think a small emblem on the ship would be appropriate as stated above they are generated ingame and i would hope it wouldnt create much additional lag as for painjobs thats a big no
people have been asking for this since i started eveo and before there are places where thing get laggy just because the little thumb nail pics of people in your address book are loading whink what would happen when you have a blob enter your system all with custom paint jobs one point i havent seen brought up is ship identification as an example with three types of some frigate  merlin hawk harpy etc   visual identification becomes a chore  i understand the overview but some times it is nice to look at the ship up close to gage weapons before you attack  cool yes practical no
this could be an interesting idea however there should be an option to turn the goddam things off much in the same way as you can turn off effects etc etc
the server does not issue rendering commands direct to your video outputi think what most people are envisaging is choice of paint 1256  or we could go nuts and make it 2 bytes 165536    andor the logo of your alliance that isnt comparable with thumbnail portraits for data transfer
yes but the server would still have to talk to your client to tell your client what colour to paint xs ship when you pass it at a gate and the 45 people out side jita in horrible pinks and greens and the 500 fleet battle
how many paint colours do you imagine there being1 byte for colour  256 colours2 bytes  65kyour 512k link runs at 64000 bytes per secondthe 45 people outside jita would add much less than a millisecond to grid loading time the 500 person fleet paint could maybe add one or two milliseconds to the load
i like the idea itd be cool to see corpalliance logos andor paint jobs on ships if its feasible
cap ship warfare needs to be looked at
the simplest method of implementing this would be something like the ships logs that ccp used to usewhen someone kills you and you have kill rights on them a log book is dropped in your hanger marking that person and the expiration time of the kill rights whomever has that item in their cargo bay can shoot at the person it is attached too i implemented something very similar in the nwn world i worked onthese items can be sold via contract or the market or traded to others nice part is if someone does attack a target and loses there is a chance that the contract is either blown up or recovered by the target needless to say if he recovers it no more worrying about who is going to be shooting next time simple effective minimal codingedited forgot to support
singedi like the old helios model and it was one of my favrite ships next to the myrm and hyperon now i cant stand probling at all dam thing looks horable
is the release of the minutes in ccps hands or with you guys
those were the days dthough on biggest ego i dunno there were a lot of egos involved there
youre not wrong  hell sirmolle dbpreacher blacklight halseth durn robeyone the list goes on  that stuff involved a lot of egos
a capital mining ship  i dont want to speculate about the attribute of the shipim not saying it should mine more than two hulks something decent and balanced a decent tank and some drones bonuses
the rorq does not suffice
you do know that posts that dont have a support tick count as no votes eg bumping or failing to remember to tick support when saying yes weird but there you go thats what you get in a forum with no poll systemid call this expansion for the autopilot almost essential
do any of you guys actually know anyone who actually does that i dont besides it could only be done with two accounts and a whole lot of logistics  getting your alt in the same system as your main without implants   besides youd pretty much have to kill people  without them fighting back for them to get killrights   on a regular basis to get a bounty worth podding yourself for and someone who does that is pretty much going to be a professional pirate  which means if my theory is correct that they wouldnt pod themselves for a few million isk   and lets face it the current system makes this even easier so my idea would actually be an improvement im not going to say its perfect but it would allow for more indepth bounty hunting
there are now the 10 attribute skills plus one lonely little learning skill i am interested in a tier two learning skill that maybe costs a lot of isk  compared to other learning skills 79 million isk   and would probably require a large training time multiplier  7 or 9   but pays off with a 3 bonus to training speed for a maximum of 15 at a training level of 5 this could help close the gap between the very young players while allowing older players to diversify their skills or master others if a young pilot trains hisher learning skills then adds a potential 25 speed bonus that would greatly help integrating young pilots into eve the issue becomes balancing against 400000 titan pilots comments please taark
im a newer player and i have an element of sympathy but i have to say no to thisfirstly the skill times are there to require you to specialise to pick a few roles to be good at not all of them they also tend to require you to experience various roles before you dive into the deep end  start with frigates move onto cruisers and so on  secondly there is no endgame in eve and the total number of skills to level 5 would take something like 10 years now its the journey that is important not the destinationthirdly your argument is fundamentally flawed eve should be balanced such that old or new doesnt matter you can become effective at quite a few things quite quickly a few percentage points here or there doesnt make that much difference if youre attempting to allow new players to catch old players this proposal does not succeed for two reasonsif you want new players to catch up this assumes the older players dont just use this skill to extend that lead on top of that what do we do in two years time when the current crop of new players are ahead and the new players want to catch up
another month of grinding learning skills no thanks
if there was no learning skills then the ranks for existing skills would be less tbh more learning skills is a bad thing if you want ccp to forever maxout everyones learning skills with some bonus to those who already trained it up then that is something that is more intresting
the problem is that its the older players who would be the ones who train the skill up first thus widening the gapalso telling new players that they have to spend even longer training learning skills isnt going to enthuse them
no no it wouldntlearning skills are an unfun and unwanted waste of everyones time to begin withif you think the game would be better with shorter train times make that thread and you might get more thumbs
guys guys i think youre missing the pointhes talking about the 12th skill in the learnings tree the second tier learning granting an extra 3  or just still 2   to attribute values  just like the tier 1 learning grants 2 per level  the most logical option would be to have it a rank 3 skill costing about 315 mil isk  35 mil base   having as prerequisite learning iv and granting an additional 2 per level to attributestrained to l4  takes about 23 days   it would pay off in around one month or so
no we knew exactly what he meantits just that it is a really bad idea
im a middle aged pilot and i am pretty sure that about a year ago there was something like 11 years worth of skills to train in eve so there is no shortage of upper limit i would train something like this to about lv34 because there are dozens of skill sets i am still interested in exploring if someone is not interested in additional training that is nothing anyone should care about let alone hold against you but i would love the training boost because i want to do more with what i have i would just like to have the option open to anyone to choose for themselves
why youre not forced to train it
oh god no here we go again with the youre not forced to train it crap no you just fall further and further behind everyone else like starting the game 4 years later then everyone else isnt a big enough of a disadvantage every new player i encounter spends the first month or so training learning skills and perhaps a few other skills along the way i know i sure did and hated it nearly quit but anyway this would greatly widen the gap between new players and old because the older players who already have hacs  hics etc already have maxed their training skills   gunnery  etc   and will simply train these new skills faster   5 implants  and thereby further reducing their training times and widening the gapi do see your point though maxed players will diversify mid range players will catch up but that doesnt work for the real new playersand yes good luck balancing that with cap ships attributes are much more important to the higher ranked skillsi appreciate your idea but im afraid i have to give it a big thumbs down honestly i wish there were no damn learning skills
in reversefirst no if an older player can afford the 5s that far out strips the fractional increase im talking about second build into the system is diminishing returns for higher levels of training so the greatly widen the gap as you put it becomes mute if you train battleship to 5 as an older pilot it will probably take you 3550 days depending on your skills and implants a younger pilot would be able to finish the learning skills to a reasonable level and start training into cruisers and those weapons in the same time that the older pilot spends on battleship 5 big deal the older guys can either train multi racial ships  which coincidentally would place them again at the same level as the young pilots   or they train some long skill and the young pilot trains learning and is pvp capable before the older guy gets that additional 5 whatever from that fifth level train i think something like this would help modestly with the larger ships like you mentioned because if you have a base atribute of 20 and you get a 10 bonus from learning plus another 1015 from what i propose  lets say 20 bonus total   that means your result is about a 4 point increase from 20 to 24 on your attributes learning skills dont just help the dedicated planning  skill nerds like me they help everyone who plays and wants to plan their skills further then a few days
actually people with 5s would get more out of your uberlearning skill than those without them the learning multiplier applies to implanted attribute points just as it does to natural pointsyour scheme would increase the effect of 5 implants from 55 up to 625
any new learning skills are welcome in my book 
at worst you progress at the same rate  or at a similar rate  however percentually speaking you get an advantage as a new player in catching up percentagewise with the old playersthen theyre stupid with the revamped system we have right now theres absolutely no reason to go with anything but all l4s in the learnings and thats done in two weeks topsgiven how a lot of l5s are mandatory for advanced skills that are not even that great and how l5s take almost 5 times longer than getting from zero to l4 that means every little percentual gain means a huge actual performance difference gaindo you think t2 ships are all that great compared to t1 ships  seriously think again other than specialist niche ships theyre not significantly better than the t1 versions it only seems that way to you since you have much better support skills nowfor something that takes 23 days to train but boosts training speed by 8  or even 12 if you go with the 3 per level version   at worst you can talk about older players getting l5 in it as opposed to not getting it at all so at worst youre looking at the older player learning at 23 faster comparatively however the lower guy just got a significant boost in training speed for minimal extra effort which will allow him to bridge the gap between useless and usefull that much fastersure the older guy will finish his third l5 battleship or his second dreadnought l5 faster too but who the hell cares 
actualy the developers have spoken on the topic repetedlyaccording to them the net effect of the leanring skills were entirely negative1   it bascialy becomes the first skills learned meaning that players end up defacto frozen while their learning skills catch up granted the new player experience has helped in that a lot of skills were added but they have also talked about ways to get rid of the learning skills  either by auto granting full learning skills or allowing the skills to level up parallel to a nonlearning skill   this has been seen as a bad thing by the devleopers because of comments in places that have public coments on mmos you see coments about how your stuck with newbiskills for over a month while you learn the learning skills2   all skills implimented since then were placed 1 or more levels higher simply because they had to factor in the faster learning skills bascialy their idea is that you have to choose how you specialise yourslef not make it so that you can play the flavor of the month game every day
to be blunt i dont have a problem with the idea of them adding more points to the skill stats but i do realise the problem from the developers point of view when it comes to adding new skills
forgot the third and fourth point3   even the fact that the old skills are able to be leanred faster is a negative because with the new skills being set higher than they would have been without the learning skills the new skills ended up being a barrier to advancment4   the frustration factor of someone who thought they would be playing for a period of time and thus planned accordingly with their learning skills who leaves early  thus waisting time with learning skills   or late  why did i not train this learning skill 1 more level  
theyre not stupid theyre obsessivecompulsive p
sorry but im on the if there is ever a safe way to replace learning skills to do it list of peoplelike removing advanced learning skills and making implants go up to 10 replacing all current ingame implants with times 2 the number current so 5s become 10sthen it becomes part isk grind in which players would be able to earn them while learning the basic skills so you could in a way get both at once
discussion on bombs ended with the outcome that they are currently too expensive and too difficult to employ to be cost effective in the current eve environment theyve been sent back to be looked at as a priority by the balancing department and id hope to see the cost of manufacture reduced and changes to allow the bomber to launch them from a little further off  to give it better chance of escape   bottom line we flagged it as a neccessary balance issue and registered opinion that they are not working correctly on tranquility at the moment
this one came up for debate  ccp didnt want to interfere and said it was a matter for the csm to decide the csm itself wasnt keen on writing the principle into the rulesconstitution for future csms and the general outcome is that any future csm can pretty much decide for itself how it wants to govern meetings and debates we did clarify that the documentation will be changed so that chairs can step down and be revoted if they wish at the end of the formal meetings in iceland i asked for a formal show of hands on whether the csm reps were happy with me continuing as chair for the first term and they all said yes so thats pretty much the end of that next csm will have the chair decided on majority vote but there will be some clarifications in the csm document to clear up the rules and ability to decide these offices
thanks  anyone else
nothing wrong with scorched earth there should always remain the opportunity to deny your foe loot  and if you care about such things killmails  extending the timer is pointless unless there is no way to cancel it otherwise the moment you enter combat you turn it on and then cancel it when it looks like youre going to winfrom a purely economic view the use of selfdestruct has no impact on warfare the pilot is still out a capital ship and the modules if your intel is any good at their job you wont be relying on killmails to estimate the economic damage of your fights  not with these tactics about anyway   if you want to make a case that selfdestruct impacts your isk revenue from loot then make that case
i read a post on another thread and i thought of this idea to introduce scripts for the damage modules aka for the ballistic control systems magnetic field stabilizergyrostabilizerheat sink it would work as followsi will take a heat sink ii as examplecase 1 without script it would work as now 10 damage increase 10 rof increasecase 2 with damage script it would go 20 damage increase 0 rof increasecase 3 with rof script it would go 0 damage increase 20 rof increasesince as we know 20 rof  20 damage in dps this would ensure that some people would prefer to use rof in cap stable ship setups but the ones that would like better alphalower ammo consumption would go for the damage script even if in the long run would give them lesser dps to rof script that would offer variety and would help with the artillery problem as well to some extend so what you think
how is 20 rof better than 20 damage 20 damage has a higher alpha same dps  better when you figure in reload time   and lower ammo consumption
itd be a boost to damage mod stacking on the whole  you can separate them into independant stacking queues making them half as nerfed ships that have the slots could quite conceivably fit 6 damage mods if they wanted to get added dps  i dont have the numbers at hand but i imagine 4 mods under your system would be better than 8 currently and 6 would be far and away better since theyre still operating at better than 50 efficiency because 20 doesnt mean the same thing in those two cases assume a gun that does 10 damage every 10 seconds or 1 dps the 20 damage would make it 12 damage every 10 seconds or 12 dps the 20 rof would make it 10 damage every 8 seconds or 125 dps mind you the higher alpha lower ammo consumption and lower cap use do compensate for this somewhat but for raw dps on a single module the rof mod is simply better
wow my mathfu is weak tonightwouldnt that kind of defeat the purpose of having the stacking penalty on them in the first placei am not supporting the modules that were given scripts were done so because they give two different types bonuses sensor boosters increased targeting range and targeting speed whereas weapon upgrades give rof and damage which are both factors in a single stat dps
these might work better as rigs10 dmg  moar alpha   for 10 rof  shots take longer   or10 rof  less time between shots   for 10 dmg it would have to not be stacking penalized with current dmg mods racial weapon rigging could reduce the penalty down to 5as it stand the current rigs are fairly useless with the way they stacking with dmg mods and effect gridcpu its rare you have the gridcpu to spare and have less than 3 dmg mods already
no i was not intending to skip the stacking penalty this way the stacking penalty would work per module not per script so even if one would put 2 gyrostabilizers ii with 20 damage script  1 gyro ii with rof script he would get the same stacking penalty as with 3 gyros without script as it happens today and about the specific percentage amount increase the script gives it may seem stupid to use the rof but the increased rof could be more beneficient to guns that contain lots of ammo like autocannons in pvp where the artilleries could get benefited by the increased damageand the exact values could be different the scripts could be set as  50 damage  50 rof so the current 10 damage 10 rof gyro ii would get to 15 damage 5 rof with damage script and to 5 damage 15 rof for rof script so to tune down the extreem alphas and the high ammo consuptive rofanyway it was just an idea
00 is pretty bland except in absolute quality there isnt much variation between one region and the next this comes with a problem a few conquerable regions are good for everything they have buckets of every sort of mineral needed for building and excellent rats i think that needs to change i am not advocating making all regions equally good  as opposed to the current situation of many being equally bad   simply nuancing the hierarchy rather than poor  geminate every region between deklein and fountain great wildlands  not conquerable i know but still crap   providence etc   and awesome space  delve deklein fountain etc   i would like to see different regions being best for different sorts of resourcesin short i propose that stuff spawning mechanics be adjusted so that different hierarchies develop so regions a b and c might be the best places in eve to mine but d e and f might be the best ratting areas  outside pirate 00   as opposed to a b and c being best for both mining and ratting in fact the nuance can go further maybe d e and f are best for high end mining but g h and i receive special extremely high yielding variants of low end oresfirst however a couple of general changessystems exist where one is lucky to encounter even a single npc bs spawn and the ores are barely better than in empire this should be changed in two ways firstly ore quality and rat quality should be decoupled secondly the general quality of rats should be improved throughout 00 as a baseline id suggest that 25 spawns in any 00 system should contain at least one bs decoupling ore and rat quality is necessary for my proposed 00 adjustments while generally increasing rat quality makes all 00 worth settling in for a time even if its just a small corp moving in for a few days rattinghigher yield ores are also improved instead of offering 510 more yield they offer 1530on to the meat of the matter the following are six different ways in which regions could be strong note that any particular region can have any combination of the following characteristics super regions are still possible and desirable they give players somewhere to aspire holding but we get rid of armpit space that is simply not good for the game if players cant make any money theyll never be able to challenge for the good stuff a region should always have something worthwhile but that is not to say that certain regions shouldnt have more good stuff than othersthe first category of space is the lowend rich highend poor 00 area this space may not have large quantities of high ends and if it does those ores will only be found in a few places while concentrated versions will not be present at all  and maybe there will only be flawed  15 to 30 yields   versions of the high ends as well   however they do have especially concentrated low and middling ores  50 yields or even more   obviously different regions might have different concentrations of the various low or middling ores rats are average unless the area is designated a particularly good ratting groundthe second category of space is the highend rich lowend poor area this space is pretty much the reverse of the previous category abcms are abundant but low ends are only available in standard or flawed variants the 50 super ores of high ends exist but are very rare indeed  perhaps only harvestable from gravimetric exploration sites   rats are average unless the area is designated a particularly good ratting ground
the third category is the good ratting area this has a higher than average chance of encountering bs  perhaps 50 chancespawn of encountering at least one bs as opposed to the basic 25 this number can of course be adjusted   and is a good place to find the local rat types complexes via exploration besides being good for raw isk they are good places to find the named items that are needed for invention  if i remember correctly   unless the area is designated as particularly good for certain sorts of mining it has the average 00 mineral concentration access to 1530 low and middle end ores maybe a few systems with non concentrated high ends such space might be popular with pvp focussed alliances they have access to liquid wealth but dont require huge amounts of infrastructurethe fourth category is the good salvaging area conceptually it is related to the good ratting areas but come with certain gimmicks besides having the increased chance over vanilla 00 of encountering bs they have access to two or more kinds of npc and a higher chance of finding good salvaging sites and possibly mixedrat complexes  think worlds collide  the fifth category is what i call the luxury area these areas have an enhanced chance of encountering faction spawns  though they do not necessarily require the increased chance of encountering bs   and also enjoy high concentrations of high end complexes  with all the increased chance of finding deadspace loot that is entailed   making new faction content possibly t2 faction ships would make these areas particularly notable a less dramatic gimmick could be t2 faction mod bpcsthe sixth and final category is the specialist industry area these are the best places in eve to find booster materials or invention requirements augmented and integrated drone sites might also be incorporated into this category they may even have a high concentration of salvage sites of course a single specialist industrial area will not have all these qualities itll just have one or two like luxury areas these are confined to small areas boosters are not a great foundation for a territorial alliances entire industry to be based upon specialist industrial areas are also fairly poor miningratting areasso how would this system change eve geminate for instance might be designated a good low end mining area but have no other notable qualities delve might become a good high end mining area with better than average ratting deklein could be similarly endowed perhaps it has a guristas luxury area and a good salvaging designation perhaps it spawns guristas and serpentis togethernote that areas dont have to encompass whole regions some regions might have no notable global qualities but instead become a collection of specialist industrial and luxury sitesby diversifying 00 it becomes possible to cater to a wider variety of playing styles and possibly different styles of colonization or alliance mentality could prosper in different areas possibly leading to culture clashes and the disruption of power blocks would the pvp alliance in a good ratting region always have common cause with the industrial conglomerate stuffing their barges with 50 lowends next door what with human risk aversion this is perhaps an unlikely end but with 00 catering to more than one playstyle were more likely to have different sorts of alliances rather than one sandbox catering to a particular sort of palyer we have several interlinked sandboxes where the rules are slightly differenti deliberately make no reference to moon minerals these are an existing way of nuancing space and i dont think dramatic redistribution is necessary that said where a region has 20 or more high ends i think the balance might be skewed too strongly
signed  how ironic  whilst were on the subject why have this forum or more accurately why have discussion in heresurely it would be a heck of a lot simpler to have each issue be a link to one already in features  suggestions  where the rubbish ideas usually get blasted because the people who care are there looking   and just a yes or no herei guess my point is this is where issues are presented but we now have two features  suggestions forums to checkedit doubly ironic  managed to lose the support bit by editing
i agree that this forum is the place where support is shown for proposed ideas not the place to discuss them thats what the other specialized forums are for
agreed missions fw etc npc jammers should work like pc jammers
agreed but i need to say something on this i have noticed that when i use eccm the enemy npc jamming is reduced severly compaired to non use an eccmfor example i did once a lvl 4 against guristas on a drake with my other character without eccm and i was like permajammed with intervals of a few seconds only when i did the same mission with a bs and eccm on this character i could comfortably do the mission i would get the occasional jamming here and there but nothing irritating so maybe after all the eccm works i cant have been lucky every time i mean before using eccm the guristas mission were a pain i was simply trying to avoid them cause i was permajamed now that i use eccm i do them regularly without much jamming in any case i vote for yes
if sensor strength isnt already included in the calculations it should be
same mission same conditions same sensor strength warp away dock and return you will see that the number of successful ecm change it has more to do in breaking a session where the rng was throwing a lot of extreme results than in having or not eccm at least in the word of the devs eccm has no effect whatsoever on the chance of npc ecm to blind you
agreed and cant see any good reason why not
you should be able to change your skills anyway on singularity
not the corp deletion but removal of standings to that corp if ceodirectors havent logged in for 3 monthsfor alliances if there are no alliance ruler out there for the same timethat way corps will have their standing slots freed without bothering to check if the subjected corpally alive  shall i prefix it with still clause  pswould help dealing with zombies too
news flash as far as i know none of the implants that give bonus to boost amounts or duration work for capital size modules or ships the only thing that works is the implants that increase cap armor shield and the like i think this is probably a known issue and ccp likes it that way for some reason
sigh i wish sirmolle was on the team at least he knows how to really communicate with the playerbase

eagerly awaiting minuteslist of rough time line and or reasons why issues are not feasible
sweet  still has dreams of working at ccp so im very jealous p  also the forum for the minutes is dead p
haha my better part thinks she can eat it without an issue p
i expect things to go uphill from heregood show csm
theres a fetish for that if you two are interested
i have read two articles giving both sides view of the csm meeting that just took place in iceland the first is the csm viewread it here the second is an interview of a ccp representativeread it hereassuming youve now read both what do you thinki think ccps view of where csm should be working and csms view of itself are two different things it appears csm went in with a list of items the players want fixed  most of which ccp was already aware of and have in the pipeline to fix   ccp wanted to hear from them big ideas of where the game should go nexti have definite ideas of where i would like to see the game go next i havent heard any plans past ambulation yet from ccp i think its high time to introduce planetary activities to eve to begin with they dont need to be much different than stations you land at a spaceport and do station type things as well as interacting with the planet itself i see room for all kinds of businesses players could engage in on planets everything from farming to factories to planetary mining  opening up all kinds of new ores and minerals   i see opportunities for players to terraform uninhabited planets and plant colonies there i see new resources for players to fight over and new ways that system control can be established in short i agree with ccps view of thingswe need big ideas from csm not bug fixes
i can agree and appreciate ccps view on what csm should bring up i think it was inveitable to bring up smaller issues in terms of vision also i think the big issue this time as expressed by several council members internet chieftans   was the lack of expectations that ccp has openly set towards the council we can hope that people will start thinking big after reading the interview with noah i urge anybody who has good ideas for where eve should be heading over the next few years to post on the assembly hall
i think it would all depend on which employee they interview regarding what ccp wants from the csm each department head at ccp would probably like to see how players feel about things that department may have control of not just the future design of the gamethe only thing i dont like is when noah says some little niggling ui issues and that kind of stuff if the players felt it was important enough to talk about then it is not some little niggling issue whatever the issue might beat first i felt that this was nothing but a pr stunt but i still voted my opinion has changed about the csm and i hope that the players the csm and ccp can work together and really accomplish something
i think this shows that the usual forum crowd are out of touch with how things workthey have these illusions that the devs do not read the forums and because the devs do not post in whine threads they are no aware of the issues of course they are aware i will question your intelligence level if you seriously believe they are notyou know arguments like that is not what eve is about with the csm we the players actually have a saying in what eve is about and where it should go not that we can dictate it but we can inspire the developers with good reason and creativitybickering about the ui or nanowhines are not inspiring at all contrary it is rather boring because you are already aware of these minor issues that not even all can agree to is an issuebtw i like the concept ideas for cosmos 20 bring it on
frankly i would like to see a lot more discussions on the gsm forums involving topics on these two pagesbtw the csm should have been poking ccp about an update of those pages
i was really dissapointed to not see my revamp of satation undocking pointed voted into the csm docutrine i still believe this was one of the idea that ccp was looking for a complete rework of something looking ahead and such even then that idea wasnt very big but if i had posted about my idea of letting players walk in space well i think i would of of gotten flamed silly pstill im going to run next time anyways under this banner of major game changing suggestions to bring to ccp i believe that the newer players however are where all these idea will come form as even myself as a trhree old player will see old issues before future ideas sometimes phowever its important to get the incomming  as in 48 month player   players ideas on what direction eve could go after ambulation or within itso now that i have a passport ill be running and hopefully you guys will see me at the fanfest this year too    in which maybe ill run a little campaign booth p
im going to disagree as to the reasons for the difference in vision the biggest reasons we  as a community   are bringing up the smaller scope issues is that we dont know where these annoying issues are on cpps development schedule on any particular issue we dont know where they stand therefore instead of working on future ideas and grand vision stuff were stuck squeaking on the the stuff that may or may not be in the works cpp and the csm are going to be stuck with these issues from the community unless we have a better idea on where they are goingnow i can understand the wish to keep certain things close to their vests in order to surprise us with fun new things or to keep the market from insider trading issues but for the stuff thats not covered by those two we only get advanced warning of stuff when a dev blog comes up cpp has let the section after the patch notes grow very stale so we realy have no idea whats coming in the long medium or short term nor do we really know what systems  or ships   cpp is keeping an eye on with regards to future balancing changestherefore cpp is going to receive a lot of stuff that they can honestly say yes were working on it to which the community replies yes news to usits still a transparency issue now im not knocking cpp as they are much more transparent than say blizzard but there is still going to be some duplication of issues due to lack of awareness of development direction on the part of the community
thank you lavista i voted for you to be on the council and i believe you guys are going to do a good job it was inevitable that this thing would start slow but i believe it will be something big as time goes by
while press releases  even by actual members of the csm rather than a neutral observer   are all good and well it is the actual implementation of these which will still prove wether the csm is actually effective at all or still a pr thing and tbh im holding out of any further comment until i see a full list of the minutes from the meeting with ccpits always been noted the ccp prefers to take the opinion of the majority rather than the minority which the csm still is which is why they never solely operate on the forums influence and the csm is more a representative of the forum population than the in game population
my big question after reading about ccps vision for the csm is how the csm is supposed to handle making these bigpicture suggestions should they be issuing a prioritylist looking at that planned features page its all well and good to be adding all these cool things to the planned features list but what it comes down to is which one happens first
i was quite disappointed by noah wards interview to me he seemed to be coming over sometimes as extremely jaded and not at all enthusiastic and other times as a bit of a pompous ass i think that giving the csm no real guidelines in what was expected of them and then to complain about what was delivered is a bit hypocritical its like hiring an artist to paint a picture and when its finished saying oh youve done it in an impressionist style i wanted it cubist after all it would just have taken a one sentence note by the way guys we would prefer you to look at big gamechanging ideas rather than niggling little things these presumably are the sweeping plans that  as he was constantly reminding the interviewer   take years to implement im sure interest in the csm would wane if the first delivery of items raised wasnt until 2012fact is though what was presented was a fairly decent cross section of what the players actually care about  albeit truncated due to time and feasibility constraints   i personally couldnt really care less about faction warfare  its impact on me has been pretty much zero right now i cant really be bothered with ambulation  but i dont know enough about it to make an informed decision however what i do care about is how irritating insert minor ui tweak here is because that constantly affects me in gamesometimes its the little things that make your game stand out above the others  its a dangerous thing for your player base to play the game in spite of reasons x y z if their tolerance for those issues is eroded over years of them not being addressed youve lost a chunk of players because you were so busy focusing on the bigger picture that you let the little things get away unfixedbut hey what do i know  im not a game designer  at least not a computer game designer ive done plenty of the pen  paper variety   im just someone who has to deal with the end result as a consumer
i wouldnt get too despondent about that interview we really did go into the csm process pretty blind and were making a lot of this stuff up as we went along in a really tight timescale in an environment of immense forum background noise and we still ended up with excellent discussions and great engagement with ccp one of the areas well definitely improve next time around is simply giving ccp much more advance warning of the agenda items which will let them appropriately categorize the niggling issues and big vision stuff  many of the small issues just needed a yesnotechnically impossible style feedback and didnt need a formal discussion slot on the agenda i think thats why noah was saying it was a bit disappointing to see those things taking up face to face time at the cost of the big picture development issues next time around well still have room for the ui fixes and little things but because were submitting them well in advance those will probably come back with a simple list of outcome that doesnt really need talking about in depth part of this is a learning process for all of us csm and eve player base too going forward from here were going to be able to give you example issue submission texts  that worked   guidance on what kind of things we can do what kind of things we cant and how to effectively word and present the proposals you want going forward and end of the day were going to improve the csm process for everyone
and you did a great job you guys   
little niggling ui things   you what do you expect the issues to be issues will always be the stuff that you dont fix sometimes for years apparently youre aware that certain aspects of the game are issues but the fact that weve been complaining about them doesnt mean youll fix them and you want us to bring up grander thingsfyfg  fix your game   and well talkyou want the csm to filter the signal from the noise they have things weve said need attention are the damn signal not the noiseedit i guess now we know how ccp feels about us and our silly issues you know the things weve spent the past month or so arguing passionately about
no he was saying that because pointing out problems with the game in front of the cameras is bad he wanted philosophical discussions about game design which makes ccp look smart and on the cutting edge of game design he didnt want issues he wanted ccp to look good on tvthey are on the cutting edge of game design btw but damn it the bugs and the parts of the game that are crappy just pull them back and annoy us to no end too technical prowess doesnt trump lack of polish dunno why they havent learned that by now
a may be in correct in saying this  but why is item 10 in this list of issues to be raisedreading through the linked thread it seems that most of the respondents disagreed with this suggested idea
i believe bane said he would try again next session there are 2 more sessions not at iceland but with ccp with our current csms
totally agree
serenity did you just take the updates i made before or did you go through and get all the new ones too also make a category for topics that have already been taken to ccp and dealt with we really dont want those ones coming up again because doing so seems useless not sure if that should be a new thread or how you want to organize it but there should be a list close at hand somewhere
i did all the updates from before then asked the mods to make more room for categories as most of the posts were now full so now there is more room   good idea on the ones ccp has already dealt with ill reorganise the content to make that next to the index
since mission running is my thing missions  agents suggestions for improvementissue small changes to make missions more funplease can you add to the relevant sectionta muchly

epic fail ccpits one thing to increase prices but trying to hide it by claiming the removal of time code options is to conform to industry standards is pretty dirtyim also concerned about what this means for subscription rates will players only be able to pay in 60day increments there as well if not what is the rationale behind giving some players a range of paid time and pricing options and taking it away from othersif you need more money raise prices across the board and be transparent about it
most of players wants ability to be in one system with 1000 others without fear of lag or dcs if lag issues and dcs was things of the past less people would whine about this raising prices ok you solve problems fixed bugs and exploits did everything to make game more enjoyable here you go i dont mind price raise you would have much more this kind of answers but sadly this isnt my imaginary world
this situation needs to be revised an open discussion gets my vote
tbh i dont play this game to look at stuff in the stations i play to blow ships up in space make this add on optional and charge more for it dont charge people for something most will not use or wont bother with after they have spent 10mins or so looking at itbring back 3090days even at teh higher european rate

why not give every single player the choice to decide if they want to pay for that quality or not why force us to pay extra for these new features and expansions why not give us the option to buy extra features and expansions only if we choose to it would be a great planplayers who want new content pay more for it and players who dont pay less and retain the option of buying cheaper short term tcs thats better than losing players completely no i would rather pay 3050 every time a new expansion comes out instead of it being forced upon me along with price hikes and removal of convenient options such as buying 150mil isk 30 day tcsso far it might be still possible for me to grind 400mil for 60day tcs every now and then in between paying with my credit card however if that option also gets removed which i can see happening its bye bye ccp its been fun while it lasted either way i will now be forced to renew my subscription much less often than i used to if anything ccp should give us the option of an unlimited skill queue they could at least give us that much given the recent events
agreed
i dont know if it is already mentioned but players playing the game trough steam still have the option to buy 30days for 1495 usd can ccp explain this

supported with the proviso that sovereignty holding alliances are excludedi think that this would better reflect ccps vision of 00 alliances as factions in their own right and avoid the possibility corps belonging to such alliances taking factional warfare breaks to keep board pvpers happy i believe ccp are right in thinking that this would distort the intention of fw at the moment an alliance is just too convenient from a mechanics point of view  war dec functionality etc   for empire based groups to forgo this has unfortunately resulted in many smaller groups ideally suited for factional warfare being denied the chance to participatewhat i would like to see eventually is a third tier of player organisation the player controlled faction these would have the option of being made up of multiple alliances and would be by definition exclusively sovereignty holding in other words as soon as an alliance claimed sovereignty it would become a player controlled faction and as soon as it lost its last system they would be bumped back down to a plain old alliance they would of course be barred from factional warfare tt
prove he is the only one to receive a ban over posting personal infoif people had really had an issue with how ccp had behaved over this and many other issues they would have voted with their wallets long ago its not exactly hidden from new players either so that argument that people have invested too much into eve to walk away over such an issue doesnt really hold as the growth of the game wouldnt continue if people really did object strongly
the only one we know was banned for it as the bans are private posting what you have posted is against the eula like saying that player xx was banned for so and sofor all we know there can be thousand of players  and probably there are some teen of them   banned to posting real life informations kug was the only one making his ban know through outside forums from all i know that is the difference
just because people havent quit eve doesnt mean that the wrongful banning of players should be ignored your argument is trying to say because people still play eve means that everything ccp does is right also you are wrong when you state that this isnt exactly hidden because almost all talk about  gets deleted pretty quickly and in order to find anything about it you would have to go back through years of dev blogs
prove me wrong then because like you said the details of a ban are hard to come by and kept private it would require me to have access to the records of all bans to prove my point but much easier for you to prove yours so find me a case where another player posted real life information on the forums and got a permanent in game ban
thats not how it works i dont come up to you and say there are a thousand unicorns hiding behind jupiter prove me wrong if you assert something the burden of truth is placed on you you have to prove what youre saying is fact everyone else doesnt have to prove otherwise
you made a categoric statement but offered no evidence to back it up then claimed you couldnt and say that its much easier to counter your argument because its more likely that theres evidence supporting the counter to your original argument so in effect your saying that its far more likely that there is more than just one person that been banned for posting personal information so in effect youve said your original statement is highly unlikely that kinda also brings doubts to everything else youve posted in this thread and seeing as you the op kinda makes me doubt the founding of this thread full stop if your willing to counter your own arguments going back to your original post it gets harder and harder to see your point yes kug revealed what was going on he did the community a service there not gonna dispute that the methods are questionable not for me to comment on but how he acted on the forums even with the best of intentions was still a violation of the eula and tos in no way does his previous actions for the community exempt him from the rules if you make one player exempt you open the floodgates and every tom  and harry will be demanding they be let back into eve because what ever they did was in the best interests of eve in some ways its comparable to vigilantism a vigilantly is still a criminal subject to the law even if hes acting with the best interests
quite hard of hearing it is prohibited by the eula to discuss bans on forums so you will not find information about bans especially perma bans in the forumgot itmost players will not discuss perma bans outside the eve forums so you will not find information on who was banned and whyonly those like your hero that will start whines saying i was unjustly banned for revealing several people personal informations will be found and ccp will not comment in those outsider forums or in the ccp forum on that
the evidence that i can provide is other people posting real life information about others and not receiving bans because of it kug got banned for posting the real life information of other players on eveo other posters have posted real life information of others on eveo and remain in game to this day now i was incorrect in stating that he is the only one to receive a ban for this because its impossible to prove i can state that its extremely hypocritical to ban some for this action and not ban others as well my point is kug is not the only person known to have posted real life information on eveo but he is the only person known to have banned for it therefore it is completely ridiculous to ban him for it
supportedpeople should have the ability to queue up skills as long as their subscription is active after the subscription expires the last skill in training should continue to train till the end just like it is now but the other skills on the list should then not train until the subscription is renewed however you gotta admit that even this would be bad for ccps business because people dont have the ability to queue up skills they sometimes waste valuable subscription time due to unplanned circumstances you might forget to set next skill training or you might suddenly have to leave for a long time these minutes and hours you wasted add up this ultimately equals to you having to renew your subscription more often than you would have to if the skill training process was more automated im sure ccp can see that and so i seriously doubt they will listen to this idea i know i definitely wouldnt if i was running their business
i agree with the idea of a single queue spot to allow for skills ending during work or in the middle of the night
i would be in support of either one set backup skill or a one skill queue you could limit the first skill to being under twenty four hours remaining i would use the backup skill to train something i want to train but its too damn long so you could chop chunks out of it while finishing annoying 310 hour skillsi have tons of unfinished skills all over the place on both characters my time is limited and unpredictable because of work it would give me more control over training as some weeks i cannot plan when to logon due to real lifei cant wait to see the response and explanation
an official response to this subject would be good
from my notes of the discussion it was pretty much a yes in the following form something like  you nominate a primary and a secondary skill the primary is the normal training skill and when it runs out it automatically flips to the secondary this means you get to put the short timeskills anytime you like in the knowledge that theyll flip to a longer secondary skill when they finish this was seen to address the main problem of short skills finishing at odd times without giving into a formal 510 whatever stage skill queue that would just let people never need to login i think we voted the fix a high priority so hopefully should see action on it soon
but i like mining so i want it fixed anyway lol changing all the bps and fixing mining like this versus just fixing mining was my perspective that is why i recommended my idea so strongly instead
to be fair bimbo did start out saying that calling it a critical issue was misleading also bimbo did sound for several pages like she was against the idea in total and not just how important an issue it wasdoes the thumbs up mean we support this being looked into or that we support all of akita ts proposals they need a second thumbs up option i guessedit ok and yeah i already voted support figuring it was the this needs discussed option but after 8 pages it gets hard to remember sometimes p
it means what you want it to mean thats why you have commentsit usually means you support either the idea or the stuff written in the opin this particular case the op clearly states that how the issue is solved is of no particular importance it only states that the issue is urgent and needs a looking at asapbesides showing support to an issue only means you want the issue discussed by the csm which only means the issue might get eventually presented to ccp not even necessarily in the initial formin other words thumbs up means you care to have this issue discussed about  more or less   officially
isnt the purpose to carve our own empires why would being self sufficient be bad it seems like the point of it all yes trade has to happen for t2 components and datacores for t2 stuff and pos npc fuels but for everything else we should be able to provide for ourselves i am the melt it down guy and my wife is the build it back up girl for 7080 of our in corp production when the troops are home
signed for additional countersi find is ridiculous that someone can freely scan a ship and know whether they will make a profit or not1  insurance for concord kills need to go2  skills need to be added and the shipcargo scanners shifted to chance based according to those skills3  countermodules for the scanners need to be put in4  mechanisms need to be put in to allow a support fleet to protect slow vulnerable ships
1   it is a popular suggestion2   ship scanner is chance based already3   there are already counters that make cargo scanning impossible4   webbed instawarp freighters remote repping support falcon jammers scouts
every time ive tried it ive been 100 successful if it is actually chance based what skills effect both scanning and countersgscs and freight cans havent blocked scans for a long time what are the counters1  remote rep doesnt work cycle rate on the remote reppers is slow enough that at most one cycle gets off before concord would respond as it is once you factor in lock times plus with the very short range of remote reps on anything but logistics ships combined with the random jump in points you cant bring your reppers to play on the ship you need to protect 2  falcon jammers cannot counter until the attack is underway or they get concorded meaning the ship is already mostly dead before they can engage they are also helpless against gank squads of bss as they cant lock and engage enough targets fast enough to drop the dps to save the gankee3  scouts works but there are many places in eve where you have the option of going through x gate or going through lowsec to get to your location no alternative routes are available meaning if you do find something you cant go aroundbut this has been covered many times in the 100s of threads on the subject
although i hardly operate in high sec these days and i dont believe high sec should be 100 safe i do believe it should be reasonably safe it seems way too easy and riskless to gank just about anything in high sectldr version agree 100 with leandro salazar
i would hope that the parties involved in this discussion are all aware of how easy it is to avoid suicide ganking because it is easy to avoid unless your iq is less than your shoe size
you only train learning skills to overcome an initial handicaptherefore i support this
even vets had to train them so leave them be and introduce more afaic
i quit playing eve when i first started because of i got tired of training learning skills for a monthnow i got all at lvl 4 or 5 but i would have much rather have them removed for the newer players
i do a lot of mission running  it definitely forms the largest amount of the time i spend within eve online there are a lot of posts on these forums about missions but in line with ccps wish for the csm to address more farsweeping issues i got thinking about the direction in which missions could be movingi think that at the moment the largest problems with missions are that1   they are relatively static in that once you have selected the mission the same things always happen  you kill x structure it drops loot you kill y npc a fresh wave of npcs appears and so on2   they can all be done with a single ship set up3   they have no grander structure missions with a logical next stage never deliver that next stage and each time you get the mission its all worded like its the first timesmaller points with missions are4   very little apparent tiein between standings andor agent quality with the difficultyimportance of the missions5   the agents give out inappropriate mission types6   there is not enough variety of mission structure to increase the spicei believe that unless all of these issues are addressed then we are basically wasting our time some of the issues are intermingled  eg fixing 1   might have a positive effect on 6   the win here for players is to stop missions being as much of a boring grind both for the ones running missions as a profession as well as those who are doing it to farm some isk the win for ccp is that players will be less bored by content and will be more likely to subscribe for a longer period of timeso to address my points one by one1   static missions i propose a solution here of simply randomising the spawns instead of having a specific set of ships appear each wave of enemies has a rated difficulty ie a particular wave has a difficulty level of 5 a bs might have difficulty rating of 25 a bc 15 cruiser 1 and a frigate 05  instead of the spawn being a fixed spawn of 2 bcs and 2 cruisers throw in the chance of it being 2 bs instead  these numbers are for illustration only im not trying to say all bs are as tough as each other or that a cruiser is half as strong as a bs   you could rate specific named spawns or ship types higher and also modify the rating depending on the fit  a tackler frigate may score 06 rather than the standard 05 for instancealso very randomisable are structure loots and spawn triggers i will credit the forum readership with enough brain to figure out the details without further guidance d2   single ship set up this would need some new missions putting in i have put some ideas on my thread here but in summarya   missions requiring a smallhull ship be it for speed stealth or other reasons such as a piratehacked acceleration gateb   new tactics needed  a tackler is required to lock down a ship with too hard a tank to break in order to reach the loot or the need is to get in and out undetected under cloak continued
3   some of the issues here can be resolved by a simple rewording of the mission text so it doesnt read as if its first time every time even a simple flag that gives the current text the first time the mission is run and then gives text like you remember that guristas space telescope you destroyed a short while back well they have done it again the persistent little buggers  etc and so forth however to truly address the issue youd need to have missions that escalate by mission level for example in the fictional mission blood raider extravaganza the level 1 version might be a handful of frigates in first ds room a structure  a cruiser  named commander who with his last breath shouts this wont be the last you hear of us   and maybe a few frigates in room 2 the level 2 version might go to 3 rooms upgrade to a few more cruisers and the commanding officer of the level 1 boss level 3  45 rooms bcs and tough cruisers the next boss up  secret room level 4  etc4   the graduation of missions may well already be in place  it would be nice if it was a bit more visible i have a standing of 100 with my  q19   agent 100 with the agents corp 85 with the faction and yet i get a whole string of low value easy missions i would expect that as you increase standing with the agentscorporationsfactions that they would trust you more and give you bigger better and more important work to do  i also believe that once you get into the upper 9s of faction standing that they should trust you with the smaller caps as well but maybe thats just me      5   the table of which agent types give out which types of missions is wellestablished however with some of the divisions you may as well not bother surveillance agents give 95 kill and 5 courier internal security the same command gives 97 kill 3 courier security is 90 kill 5 courier and 5 trade intelligence agents give 85 kill 15 courier and so on  percentages based on the table on wwweveinfocom   if i work for an intelligence agent i want to see missions where i am actually gathering intelligence if i work for an rd agent i want missions where i am testing out experimental mods or rescuing an npc ship where something went wrong if i work for an astrosurveying agent i want to do some surveying and exploration i could go on fact is we need more than four mission types  kill courier trade mining   in order to properly supply the agent divisions which we currently have6   ive mentioned some ideas for some variety in mission structure in the above sections and there are more on my other thread so i will not repeat them further here there has to be something more than go there kill that come back or go there mine that come backall of the above is aimed at addressing the boring  repetitive state that missions have come to i dont like that people can power grind missions using a single ship and a single set up because they are all variations on a theme there is some hope on a recent dev blog in which ccp are looking at implementing several new missions i just hope that they are just not more carboncopies of what we already haveother things for the futurethere are other things to consider for the future of missionrunning as well or course  for example playercreated missions i personally cant see how that would be achievable  eve players are not generally noted for being philanthropists to create missions for other pilots to do courier missions can already be done as can trade  market orders   continued 
i can see a future for mining  manufacture missions based on a contract sort of thing particularly once it gets higher than individual level a corporation could set up a contract requesting for example 100 million units of tritanium or 1000 cargo expanders  or whatever   listing the payment delivery address and timescales which could then be accepted by either an ambitious individual or a specialist miningmanufacturing corporation naturally there would need to be default payments to stop people griefing by accepting these contracts and then just not fulfilling them therefore denying the target corporation the goods it thought it would be receivingcompetition between players for the same mission  idea by morgenrei    give the same mission to several players at once either in compoetition to complete the thing the fastest for extra reward or making an impromptu gangconsequences for missionrunning beyond missions themselves  also by morgenrei    so youve run so many missions your standing with guristas is 999  me   they are not going to like this you are en route somewhere when your warp drive gets temporarily disrupted and you drop out to find a squad of guristas bs sitting there waiting for you  and they are not happy give them scrammers so you can escape if youre in a shuttle or something and quick off the mark otherwise better hope youre in your mission runner and ready to fight
of course i support more variety and dynamics in mission runningive just grabbed out an old thread about an idea of player created combat mission i was participated in mission editor  should there be onei still like the idea but the different opinions in this thread were quite conflicting
1 almost identical to my proposal 2 i like this idea too i think i may even have suggested something similar in the features and ideas discussion specifically id like to see missions that focus more on electronic warfare stealth speed etc3 interesting but it seems like a lot of effort to write two descriptions of a mission only to have one of them viewed only once per agent5 agreed this is a pretty basic thing but a huge annoyanceyou should start a new character as one of the industrial career paths i believe that they have things like mining and manufacturing  even invention   missions though they may have changed that recently
its a wellknown fact that currently eve has some of the worst pve content of any mmo with pve content this is terrible but i understand that developer time is limited here are some changes that i think are relatively easy but would make missions much more interesting overall1 fewer npcs better npcslots of small easytokill npcs are pretty boring in all honesty cut their numbers in half and double their damage and tanking abilityprosless graphical lagslightly more interesting missionsconsless loot and salvageincreased mission difficultypotentially laborintensive to implement  ie lots of time making changes to each mission  no more unnamed t1 lootcurrently the loot dropped by mission npcs consists of 7590 crap and 2510 highend named equipment this has the effect of destroying the t1 market and reducing the viability of mining as missionrunning yields a lot of minerals from reprocessed worthless loot removing unnamed t1 loot will make looting a bit faster and also yield more highend items that would make up for the lower volume of lootprosmore viable t1 market  less competition from missions  fewer nonmining sources of mineralsfaster mission looting timesincreased mission profitsconspotentially laborintensive to implement  ie lots of time making changes to each mission  mission leaders that retreat unless scramblednpc ai at the moment is insufferably stupid theyll spend an hour pounding on your ship even when its obvious that nothing is going to happen and wont retreat after your ship casually blows up two thirds of their force obviously this is a tricky situation because you dont want to frustrate players and you dont want to generate lag eithera relatively simple change could add some more interesting dimensions to missions is to designate a leader within a group of npcs this npc will have a better bounty than normal npcs and will occasionally check to see how much of his force is remaining  technical details to follow   if most of their force is destroyed they will attempt to retreat by gangwarping themselves out of the mission area you can stop this from occurring by warp scrambling them  or alternately let them go   i dont know exactly how it would be implemented as i dont work for ccp but as a programmer i believe this can be done without noticeably increasing server lagprosmissions become a bit more like pvpmissions are more engagingconsmay slightly increase lagpotentially laborintensive to implement  ie lots of time making changes to each mission  more dynamic npc spawnscurrently a mission will spawn an exact number of npcs every time its played of an exact type this is one of the main factors that makes missions predictable and changing this can help make missions more interestingthis could also be done fairly easily each mission spawn is assigned a point valuefrigatedrone 1 pointdestroyer 2 pointscruiser 4 pointsbattlecruiser 8 pointsbattleship 16 pointsiinote these are just sample numbers real numbers would be balanced by ccp based on damagebounty valuesetcia mission with a spawn with 50 total points could be spawned as1 battleship 2 battlecruisers 2 cruisers 2 destroyers 6 frigates2 batteships 3 cruisers 2 frigates4 battlecruisers 2 cruisers 4 destroyers 2 frigatesobviously limits will have to be placed on this in order to keep ratios from being skewed too towards small or large shipsprosmore dynamic mission contentconsmoderate difficulty of implementationpossible balance issuesi think that these three changes combined will make missions more enjoyable more dynamic and generally less souldestroying as they are now itll also have some pleasant sideeffects for the t1 market and mining can i have your support on this
please also see my thread here   i think my main concern with the above is that if your mission objective is to kill or capture the leader you would be kinda screwed if he warped out inevitable response to it will be to kill the leader ships of a wave of npcs before the others therefore removing the check for them to warp outalso not too sure about the whole loot thing if youre going to remove the loot you will remove a fairly major source of income for the mission runner and also stop the new player experience in realising that some of these oddly named things offer better performance than the regular mods however if you were to balance that with a revamp of manufacturing to allow for higher quality than normal mods to be developed by higherskilled players might workand i gotta agree with the dynamic spawns thing since thats in my post too   
thanks ill check it out ive thought about this the easiest solution is to just not have the objective npc be part of a group with a leader regarding killing the leader ships before the other npcs to keep them from warping out this is a perfectly acceptable strategy in my opinioni should clarify here by loot i mean unnamed t1 loot only so youll stop getting things like 1mn afterburner 1 but will still receive any of its varieties in the loot table ill update the op to clarify
sounds like a good idea but i agree that it might be hard to implement
both thumbs down  vote here  one of ccp design directions is walking in stations the more stations there are the more this expansion will be for everybody

no way 00 needs more infrastructure building pos is a way to allow for regions to remain populated to allow pos to be destroyed would mean when an alliance pulls out of a region all the infrastructure would go with it  as it stands 00 needs more infrastructure not lessand when we take a region and overextend ourselves in the name of pvp do you think we would leave anything behind except promodyspro deathstars and cynonetworks to have the ultimate advantage do you think bobwould have left all those stations the goons and reds are living in now if stations were destructable 00 would be a constant state of build and destroy build and destroy the only way i think this should be allowed is if you can have lots of stations guns and be able to man them from inside the station  but it would have to be amazingly well defended
exactly and moreover lets see what would have happened if that idea was already implementedlets suppose this situationa big bad strong alliance of the sw invades the northwesthe has the best means of destruction and manages to conquer one system after another with easethe problem is to manage to hold all these areas becasue there is a problem in that you cant posess so many players to control effectivly all the space you want and jade came here and proposed something to remediate thisnow bob can just go and destroy the outposts of the other alliances then retreat back the next week the alliances manage to make new outposts but guess what bob returns and destroys them again and again and again till everyone pays large tribute to bob for a non aggression pact bob wins eve and gets big trophy cupa week later everyone leaves eve to go play something elseas it is now bob has harder job to do if they declare war to some other alliance they need great efford to conquer systems because as things are now they give the weaker guys a chance to fight back because the expansion at a very large scale is very hard because you need to be able to hold the systems you conquer and be able to fuel them and be able to defend a large front etc and all that needs big player numbers
supported i think this would make 00 combat much more rewarding and excitingalso give the ability of deploying mannable sentry guns around stations

well i appreciate your position on the issue zaran and also your reasoned debate on various other threads but id like to comment on this abuse of power point the long and short of it is that i stood in the csm elections on a particular manifesto and was presenting myself as a candidate to advocate small unit pvp dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem in 00 space i published in advance the kind of issues id be promoting and taking to ccp if i won i got the largest number of popular votes on that manifesto and felt that gave me all the authority i needed to take the issue to iceland what we need to remember here is that the nine csms represent different parts of the eve community and not all those parts will agree with each other or see the worthiness of particular idea the assembly hall forums is a chance for the general community to express an opinion and make a case  but its not absolutely binding on csms unless an issue reaches the voting numbers required to mandate an issue going on the csm agenda we have the responsibility to look through these threads and judge popular opinion on a variety of factors in this my read on the thread is that pretty much everyone who supported the motion in the election campaign posted in support here pretty much everyone who opposed it in the election campaign opposed it here there are reasons against well expressed but there is a lot of just parotting that position and many many alt posts and oneliners that bring nothing to the table the principle of these assembly halls is that we only register supports  we dont allow votes against and thats because its not really a vote per say its a place to discuss the merits of issues and have them seconded by members of the community that feel its a good thing to talk about strictly speaking it would be okay for a csm rep to raise an issue that got 1 support  seconded   and 500 posts of not support  and it would be for the rest of the csm to represent their own constituencies at the csm meeting level and decide whether it was a valid issue or not in this case  for example   this thread got 48 supports  which places it midway in the supports on issues table for the things we took to iceland   it got 506 responses of which many were not support but you do need to take those with a pinch of salt  we know that each player can post with alts not support  we know its easy to just copy the arguments of others and post not support for political reasons etc etc but ill grant you it looks on the face of things like a relatively unpopular discussion point so if that was the case then it would follow that the csms would reject it right but at the csm level it got 79 votes to escalate it this represents 11007 votes  the combined electoral support of the proescalation csms  vs1671 votes  the combined electoral support of the antiescaltion csms  and that does represent a very different picture i think youll agree all im saying is that dont assume that we  csm reps   will always be swayed by apparent unpopularity on these issue threads one liner not supported really doesnt matter in the big picture good arguments do ill say absolutely clearly now that my own personal metrics for supporting or denying escalation on issues has nothing really to do with any number of one liner not supports but everything to do with good arguments one good post with wellreasoned critique is worth thousands of negative posts and at all points im looking at these things as a   does this issue benefit the constituency i was elected to represent b   will this issue benefit the overall game of eve c   is this something that i think could be done
and ultimately look at the outcome we took the issue to the ccp had a decent discussion i now know that removing outposts from the game is not technically feasible  within a reasonable programming budget due to crossdependency of other ingame systems   but we do have an excellent compromise solution on the table now involving pillageable outposts if this question hadnt got raised wed not have discovered that so im very confident that in the long term this was a good topic to raise and i believe the 79 csm vote that represented 85 of the cast votes for the 9 csm reps shows that the system really is working all the best
this is a good compromise i like this as eve gets older and isk because more and more readily available more outposts will just keep popping up on a whim all these expensive toys are becoming old hat and far less speciali hope they make it sufficiently expensive enough as well as difficult enough so it isnt too easy either way
points taken jadeone more thing though you mentioned that you got elected for to advocate small unit pvp dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem in 00 space which is what happens in real life too politicians use mild or words to describe much harsher changes they have in mind and when they get elected with a vast majority of votes they claim that they have the big majority and promote their plans but the truth is that if the people who voted for them knew in advance the whole package of changes things would go much differently you mentioned that you got these many votes and i cant deny it that if that is the case and you got all these votes of course typically it is as if your vote  11000 people but what i suspect is that you didnt tell them your whole idea of how exactly you were planing to promote small unit pvp dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem in 00 space because the terms you used could mean anything and it was very smart of you to use these words i mean i would have voted for you if i had read these promises but as you see when i read the whole package of your idea i disagree with it and i bet that every single of the 11000 people that voted for you for this exact thing had a different initial suspicion in their mind on how this would be achieved lets see what one would get out of your words1   promote small scale pvp people would think that you would help so that things would change so that a small alliance composed of small corps can have a chance against big alliances what happens with your idea is the exact opposite2   dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem that could be anything but for certain sounds nicewould i vote for you if i had read that probably yes because with the words you used it seemed very cool but whaen i would get to find out what you really meant to do i would disagree but now it is too late i still dont know if all these people suspected what your were planing or if they got deceived by your very cool sounding terminologyso i am asking you had you mentioned the whole idea as it is posted here or only these nice phrase about advocation of small unit pvp dynamic outcomes and entertaining mayhem in 00 space i wont get back to it i am just curiousand that doesnt mean that i dont agree in many other matters you proposed
only makes sense
definitely heres the paragraph i used in my election manifesto  linked below the sig and here on the jita park forumsi was entirely honest about the things i was going to be promoting well in advance i dont think destructible outposts came as a surprise to anyone who read the election manifesto
no support
yes we really need a thumbs down option there is some crap ideas getting peddled here that need banishing so that ccp dont even contemplate them
on 2nd thought id like to have the option to post a thumbs down too but that we still have to post to show support if you care about the issue you wont mind if people know what you think on it
but if a thumbs down was implemented it may stop the thread being turned into a free for all with people baiting and derailing the subject which also is not a petition  umm forgot to support

so what you are3 really saying is that you should be able to kill my nano shipthats what this boils down toyou think an escape tactic is flawed that a ship fast enough to outrun a bunch of lesser ships should not be allowed to persistregardless anyone who armor tanks an interceptor needs to learn how to fly them anyone who tries to shield tank an inty needs to learn how to fly them they only nano thats all intys do thats what they are designed for howe do you not fit 4xod2 on an interceptor my inty with gang bonuses and no implants goes about 9k way faster than any nonbillion isk vaga  billion including snakes across the boards which for high end snakes is a whole lot more  i understand its aggravating to not be able to catch and kill a solo or small gang of ships but thats why we build them that way there are counters yes they require tech 2 ships i see nothing wrong with it when vagas get away from me i say damn should have caught that fool i dont start screaming nerf nano ships
nanos  invincible
and what do you think will the nanopilot do when he relizes hes getting hit for any significant amount of damage hes going to get out of range its not about how to damage nanos most times even drones can hit them but you cant hold em down even a overheated domination web only has a range of 195 kmand if you neut them they can still use the remaining time of their mwd cycle to gain rangeat the present state you need a combination of ships or rapierhuginn to take down solo nanos if you want to fight a nano gang you will need a significant higher amount of non nanoships to be able to kill them  blob
not supported nanos are not invincible unless the pilot is a total idiotthe amount of training and isk spent on those ships should be rewarded with higher survivability nano is fine learn to counter it oh and yeah your pve drake will not be good for it
not suppoortedimo nano ships is working as intended and are not invulnerable
fit a neut to your bs wait for them to turn it off  they will due to cap   then neut them watch them sit as dead ducks with no cap no speed no nothing then mwd to the in a battleship and web them and kill them in 1015 secsalso note above killmails nano upon nano killed by a rupture a ruptureyes those 6mill t1 cruisers
i generally agree with this as others have said its a very complicated topic intertwined with a number of other things but leavings things as they are render smallgang warfare to be very difficult any interceptor who can catch up with a nano to tackle will usually be taken down in a few shots well before the rest of the fleet has a chance to catch up
not signedfew days ago we took 3 plated bcs  brutix myrmi harbi   and an arazu into lowsec to look around came up against a nanorapier nanocurse and a falcon we disengaged unwilling risk the arazu to counter the falconwhen we left the rapier was in deep armor and struggling with 2 webs and 2 scrams on it the myrmi was running low on cap charges thanks to the curse or we would have stayedour blaster brutix couldnt get into effective range and the myrmi was permajammed so didnt get its drones  t2 hammers and warriors   into play but my harbi was having no problems at all ripping into the rapier even before we got the web on it  overheated mwd ftw   if we werent such carebears and made the conscious decision to leave i would have had that ship
couldnt agree more with that statement applied on even a more general scale
i dont fly a nano ship but i also do not support this idea there are plenty of affective ways to counter a nano ship yes you have to make a dessision to fly that type of ship instead of another but isnt that what this game is about choices if you nerf everything you dont like eventually everyone will be flying one type of ship and one setup because that is the only way the game will be 100 fair leave the nanos as they are and get over it

interesting idea but if implemented it should work both wayit is cutting the umbilical cord between 00 and empire as 00 will no more need any empire resource but then empire should stop feeding 00 entities with free isksthe only empire resource will become the isk so it stop self spawning in 00 in the form of bounties and subsidized insurance the isk spawned by rats should be substituted by better drops so that the the ratter final reward will stay the same doing that 00 entities will become rich er   in assets but cash poor so keeping a reason to trade in empire  converting the assets in isks  if that is not done each 00 big alliance will become a totally self sustaining entity without any need of external relations
you  all   raise some interesting points this would be a huge can of worms but i think that it could integrate nicely with some of the planned walking stations and yes i have read the planetary interaction but i think that a more precise use for terrestrial resources would add detail to the eveverse your point about cutting the umbilical cord between 00 and empire is a head scratcher now that i have had more time to think about its implications i think that as a counter balance to the desire to be self sufficient that the monetary reward for marketing goods and services  station parts and food stuffs   to the faction  npc   stations for their station maintenance there would probably need to be a strong demand incentive in empire for those goods one method to handle the issue of 00 divorcing itself totally from empire space could be the structures needed for terrestrial structures are only produced in stations like caldari steel or chemtech to build a greater role for those racial corps in the player economy use a system similar to the one used now for control tower parts where they are best purchased in empire then transported to nullsec i think that a greater roll for the lesser known corps could make them more relevant in the eveverse and that would be a good nice side effect a second solution could be that rarity per region be utilized to assist trade similar to the moon mineral rarity not a ridged hierarchy but more like the racial preference for certain results some areas just have a little more of some thing like uranium vs oxygen rarities being reversed over regions thank you all for your positive feed back so far
interesting idea that has potentialthe md forum goers have been calling for a removal of nearly all npc related items in favor of everything player made this could work
ive advocated for this for a long time actually less reliance on empire good fewer npcsold goods even better
lot of thought to put into this development but definitely a route to follow the only thing to avoid it to transform what now is a isk sink  npc produced pos fuels   in a isk faucet
i fully support this subject i have posted many threads in the back and while ideas may differ here and there planets need to become something important in eve they are scources of all life and raw minerals more than any moon or outpostand if you vote for me in the next csm election ill make sure planets are on the voting agenda for the csm meetings
im all for it as long as isk making in ways you speak of remains just as hard as it is for miners or mission runners if it becomes easier for pvpers in the process this will ultimately screw things up and make the pvp activity the only activity in the game one of the reasons why eve is such a good game is because it offers so many things to do for a player it offers relatively equal rewards and incentive for doing all that provided you trained the right skills and you know what you are doing and you know how to do it well taking that balance away will no doubt have negative impact
huh well at least tell me what sucks about this idea  too vaguehard to understand what i mean you prefer singleplayer for making isk there are already a bunch of great grouporiented ways for making isk that i dont know about making my idea irrelevant you dont want the developers to spend time on this when they could spend it on something elsei know that personally ive had about all i can stand of ratting and missionrunning all alone its so damn boring its not even like a game anymore  although i love pvp   it seems like if there were a cooperative component making isk could be made into a more complex gamelike activity instead of just a big repetative grind so consider this an invitation to flame and explain why this idea sucks
i didnt see it but might be blind why not scale the mission waves by the number of people currently at the deadspace not straight 1 to 1 mind you but maybe 3 people get twice the spawnsedit mining is much more fun with a group where you can bull in the fleet channel
i support this whole heartedly it would make it more clear how the player base as individuals view and support the ideas given
1 account 1 votei agree
1 vote per account seems fair
i agree
good ideas by the by anyone think of any else that the op can edit into their starting post
18 sometimes the wallet blinks without provocation  when no balance changes order changes shares changes etc have occurred  
i doubt anythin is gonna be done seeing as many of those issues have been there since hte beginning but signed
according to ccps lead dev these would be niggling little problems that they dont want the csm looking at and therefore unimportant but signed anywayyou can do 4 without the map by the way  if you have bookmarks in the people  places folder you can use set destination to someonewhere you dont already have a waypoint set and then use set destination again to where you want to go cumbersome still though id rather have a right click in space option of remove current route setting or somethingas for the market suggestions maybe a quick fix could be to set it so that it does a data load when the screen is opened but then have a refresh now button rather than forcing a refresh every time any information is requested  obviously on a salepurchase a minimal amount of data would need to be checked to make sure the item is still there to sellbuy but thats better than a full data dump every time   result  reduced server load reduced lag reduced visibility of nonexistant multithreading looks like a win all around to me

does anyone who supports this idea have an idea of what this would do to 00 battlesjita or any location in space for that matter with more than x amount of ships lag bomb ftl the servers would have to transfer your logo and paintjob anytime you landed on grid with them i think lag is enough of an issue with this game wait until technology improves before this should even be an option the server currently only needs to load the standard skins and its still pretty bad this is just asking for it while to the untechnical this sounds a cool idea it is not it would make high traffic spots and fleet battles even slower  dru
thumbs up but only if you can turn it off and get rid of the lag involved
on this note can we please get an established idea on what the hell is going on in federation politics right now its hard to talk as a defender of democracy if i have absolutely no idea what parties are represented by whom
seeing as issues will now carry over to the next election here goes my post   cooler weapon effects that dont effect gameplay at all what do i mean well its simple really you allready see these effects i propose on capital weaponsgattling autocannons have a cool model of a 6 barrel gun ststem the autocannon itself fires a shot every 2 seconds now while my idea doesnt change the dps or for i believe it would make the weapon cooler when fired if graphicaly it fired 6 shots every 2 seconds note once again completely cosmetic changeanother place weapons could look better are ammar quad lasers opr lasers in general how cool would it be if while pluses stayed the same if true lasers were graphics a solid beam that never lets up to add to this the laser effect could move around the hull of the targeted ship swaying back and front as it tracks tearing the hull apartother changes include any weapon that graphical shows 2 cannons or says its quad for instance now you take this a step forward and add in shield effects so those 6 shots a second on the minmatar gatling gun make water like ripples when stopped by the shieldsand to make it even cooler while your shileds are up the shields should open up a little making holes for each shot you fire or in ammars case form through the shields pulling a bit with itand becuase its kinda under the same idea capital ships have cool looking wrecks why not other ships at least give battleships wrecks that look like the hull of the ship and move down from therevote mothermoon for csm the potential canidate
not entirely sure about this  current csm has another 5 months  or so   to serve and they have another meeting in iceland in 3 months dont they   hang on this should only be the kind of thing we would get if we were playing a premium quality game with a monthly subscription award winning graphics cutting edge programming and design oh looks at ccp  waits 
i think some of your suggestions are a little too much however i think weapon effects should be looked at and always a toggable graphics option for playersbut really truly believe projectile weapons need cool effects how come there is no visible explosion on a target vessle when firing artillery just one example
yes i know some of my ideas are a little over the top but if taken to ccp any list of upgrades to weapon effects should be listed down by time and resources meaning yes the whole shield thing is a bit instance but the idea is to get the smaller easier to program detials in and think towards the future 23 years down the linelike explosions for atries great idea
youre right battleships and dreadnaughts did become obsolete by the middle of the 20th century and building of these stopped however building of proper battlecruisers stopped too also if were going to compare the navies of eve to the navies of now then cruisers should also fade into the background as they are far less common now than at any time in their history frigates would remain reasonably common however we should all be flying around in either carriers or destroyers as they are the 2 most common surface vessels which have comparable versions in eve
you know before ccp boosted cap hps by 300 folks thought that cap ships were nice but to fragile for routine use actually once upon a time im lead to believe a deathstar pos could alpha strike a dread out of existence if ccp wants to deal with cap ship online they need to reexamine the cap hp buff of two years agodal
wasnt just cap ships that have gotten an hp buff the hp buff also hurt minmatar on the scale for fleet work and their specialty of high alpha but when people have so much hp alpha didnt matter as much but this stuff needs looking into
it was a 400 increase and the chance of a deathstar oneshotting a capital back then may be a little bit of a tall tale  if it was a minmatar large with all large artilleries that all got wrecking hits well maybe but ive never run the numbers  
not reading the last page where the csm reply is before posting priceless
i have read some of this thread here and found the ideas to be very interesting perhaps we can vote on having the devs seriously consider themreal space initiativethe different style of jumping from system to system is the most interesting to me
supported of course
over all i love the idea though i cant support it it would mean an almost complete redesign of eve at least the major parts of it the idea is great i would love to play this game however i think it would need to be eveonline ii
supportedalso a createremove hangar option would be nice  some people need 3 hangars and others 20   and it would be nice to have that option not only for corp hangars but also for personal hangars  i just thinking about personal mission running assets where hundreds of items must be collected in one single hangar today to have the possibility to sort this a bit would be fine  all this of course only if such an improvement does not contribute to lag otherwise forget it
supported even one additional one would be nice
yes please
please especially since any pos utilization requires the player to put potentially valuable resources in corp hangers
definitely need more hangers my wardrobe is getting very clutteredhang on is that not what this is about   
would be great
helloin the market under implants  skill hardwireing the imlants are only divided by slot typewhat im proposing is the possibility of more divisions that is make the current slot divisions into those ones with expanding arrows and then under each one have the implants divided into type like tracking enhancing turret damage etcan example is thisslot 9 would have turret damage booster side effects mwd cap usageetcsorry if ive made a hash of explaining this basically make the implant list look like the turret and bays list with more drop down divisions

ccp should bring back the 30 day time cards as a lot of places in australia are not selling the 60 day ones anymore this is stopping people like myself from playing eve simply because we dont have credit cards or debit cards
they need to introduce 120 day gtc as well
if only there was a 31 page thread about this already on the board   i believe this was raised in iceland by the csm and the response was that the change has been made because their pricing model wasnt working as intended  tm   and they needed the extra cash that this change would generate in order to fund new developmentto answer the op though i personally feel that ccp should be able to provide you with a list of stores near you which still sell the 60 day cards  i am aware that in australia near can be a relative concept   note that as 60 day cards are now the smallest denomination that more shops will start stocking them again assuming that the reason they stopped buying them in was because most people wanted the 30 day ones  might be worth a conversation with the store manager of the place youve been buying your 30s to let him know 60s are the future   
perhaps if they didnt all go off to iceland in the first place we wouldnt have an increase assuming they had expenses paid for them to go of course
you know in all likelihood it costs ccp more to pay for the streaming downloads in the alliance tournaments than it did to fly 9 csms out to iceland right
now neither i nor you know that  there i can roll my eyes as well
not if we vote in all australian members next time round9 round trip tickets from adelaide as to reykjavik please
i work in travel ill see if i can find out how much that would cost and how long it would take pretty darned sure that qantas dont fly to iceland and iceland air dont fly to australia   
supported but it needs to be looked at and tuned
if you know how to mine with a rorqual please tell me i beg you
mining drones is all i got if they give us medium and heavy mining drones it might be even more useful
just mine in your mothership with harvester drones v0v
please keep this thread serious 
unfortunately the ability for people to gather ore is already pretty impressive  a capital ship for mining couldnt be any better than a hulk otherwise it could potentially do bad things to the mineral marketi would be fine with a mining capital ship like this howeversimilar  no more   ore output than a hulklarge cargobayore compression technologyperhaps a bonus to mining laser range would be interesting
we dont need a capital miner so much as we need variety in mining itself strip miners and the hulk are the end atm just adding a drone specialist mining ship nearly equivalent or equal to the hulk or some other ideas would be great it would be like saying no ship will ever be better than a vagabond so every trains only for it and anyone without it is considered beneath it
id like to see an offline moviemaking package for eve where the wouldbe movie producer can place stations celestial bodies and ships as they please and then direct those same ships to maneuver fire warp etc at predetermined times this would be accompanied by the ability to place static cameras anywhere with a multitude of additional camera tools and to record the events as they unfold so that these setpiece battles can be replayed repeatedly for the perfect fraps capturinganyone who has played the il2 flight simulator knows how easy this is and how it allows for some incredible movies to be made with a minimal of fuss if we had these tools i believe wed see a lot more highquality movies and a game such as eve deserves it
you can its called triexporter  evesearch it   and your favorite 3d modeling tool i prefer 3dsmax
nah i dont like that kicking out of station thing but as an instrument that two people  the vote initiater and another one who never votes in the dialogue   could completely lock any actvities in jita it sounds cool if there were a 50 support option consider that box as checked
voting op gets ddd by monster trucks
please ccp support the wine project directly   
bump 3 so it doesnt get burried
as others have suggested i would like to see a seperate fuel bay for the black ops so that they still have room in their cargo bay for enough ammo to last a while
as many of you know you can only train one character per a account thus leading to a decent amount of players to have multiple accountsi would be interested in discussion about a way to allow us to train multiple characters on one account but there really no reason for ccp to allow this due to they would lose profit i do think there are people with single accounts that boardline wanting to start a second character or buy a character with isk   and if there was a small charge of 5 usd per a additional training slow on a account may be profitable for ccp while being profitable it would also be a benfit to a person like myself who doesnt really need to be flying two accounts at the same time but does enjoy being able to train and fly for a vary of ships
supported kinda dumb the op has to double post to support
this has been debated to death and i just have to say it no it would seriously screw with the balance of the game  imagine training up a freighter pilot to trade a badass miner and a specialized recon pilot at the same time   if someone wants to do that now they can but it takes a lot of excess cash or isk so theres at least a cost if you want to start a new character sell your current one  if it has more than 5 mil sp   if it has less than 5 mil sp you arent really losing much by starting over
agree to disagree since character sales are supported you would be able to train the pod pilots along side your main and then sell it off it would make the character trade market die completely because everyone would be able to do it
im not sure what you guys are complaining about the current system is a lot worsesigned
like some already said none of the boost amount implants work with capital modules for a good reason i might add because with a highgrade set a shield recharge rate on the passive buffer shield tank would be completely out of balancenot really the thing is implants and such giving extra buffer which doesnt regenerate on its own just gives some extra time for the ship to survive before it is popped recharging buffer can very easily make the tank stable against much larger amount of dps than the tank could survive without the extra buffer besides passive shield tanking is already pretty awesome as it is
afs clearly failing in anything because they behave like bricksze mob demands nano afs add lowslots to afs match massagility of afs proportional to hact1 ratiosnanoafs would render interceptors useless  turning the tables introduce heavy interceptors  vagabond with ceptor resistances   and match hacs massagility proportional to current aft1 ratiosno just kidding    nanoing afs will bring more fun
i dont really care about the csm one way or another im of the opinion its just ccps joke on us players  a distraction of sorts having said that every time jade makes a goon cry i like him more and more goons have stated pretty clearly their goal in eve is to make the game miserable for everyone else why should anyone on the council other than the two goonies care two figs about what they have to say stfu and go back to ganking miners
personally i would prefer any biases to be in the public domain  if jade had not said anything about antigoon bias but had instead kept it secret and sabotaged goonswarms sarcasm no doubt noble and glorious sarcasm grand plans with his awesome power to call a vote in csm meetings  a power so awesome that my knees are trembling really   would that be any betteri have way more respect for people in the public eye who acknowledge their personal bias than those who try to hide it
the direction this thread is turning isnt a surprise as long as goons keep coming from a place of us against the world you might not be surprised if the world treats goons as suchcsm im glad you had a productive meeting keep up the good work
well i know i for one am getting impatient for the notes now im told ccp will have to go through the iceland face to face minutes first may i please remind you all that ccp has yet to publish meetings 15 still my guestimation is that we might see something at the end of the csm term if there is any ccp actually reading this  please  if the meeting was such a fantastic success why are the notes and list of yesnonot possible  still unavailable this continuation of not knowing means issues that have answers are still being kicked around in assembly needlessly would it not be more productive to section out the done items i mean really the in development page is from october of last year 9 months old okay rant off  edit  i have been corrected 2 of the meeting notes have been published  not in proclaimation where they were to be  
our csm secretary has had rl intrude quite brutally this week and the minutes from our side are going to be delayed a couple of days please be patient this stuff will get done in the mean time there is a mostly good shc thread covering some general issues and outcomes hereand ive been going through some of the specific threads on assembly hall and giving the results as i come across them i know its frustrating to wait but please try to be understanding if you do want to know what happened about anything item specifically just ask and ill check my own notes and try to give you an answer okay
but were the fish yummy
thanks for the link jade google search only goes so far   
to be fair it is a bit tough to get past the minutiae or niggling as he puts it when it has been a thorn in the players side for so long i would wager if we can get a lot of these niggling issues out of the way you would see quite a bit of grander ideas cant see the forest from the tress kind of issuebut ccp has to understand that the first blast for the player base will be the things that we a   have been promised to have been fixed b   do not understand why it can not be fixed because of the lack of communication  if there is a lack of communication you have a lack of understanding if we do not understand how are we to focus on the grander ideas  if ccp would just open up communications a little better their customers would probably be willing to work on topics on a larger scalebut overall i am glad to see this happen it seemed to be a good initial run i think now the csm has to look at the suggestions in a different light now if they viewed our concerns as niggling then we have to start being creative
agreed its hard to look in building up your mansion even higher grander when the garden still has yet to be tended or the driveway needs repaved etcpolish and clean the house first before we start making plans on room additions
this to be honest in fact going even further try to build up on poorbuggy foundations and the whole thing could collapse every new expansion introduces more bug and imbalances and these things ccp promise to fix then they sweep them under the carpet with the next insert big idea here expansion and we never see them fixed building new content over bugs only creates new buggy content and there is only so much buggy content one can take we can go and beta test for free if we want bugs why would we pay for the priviledgeit seems to me that the real issues and conserns are just niggly issues to ccp but i suppose their record of issue handlingbug fixes already told us that
back in the day when i did martial arts my instructor used to tell me that the better i wanted to be the more perfect i needed to be with the basics he used the analogy of a pyramid  the higher you want to build the pinnacle the wider the base has to be sure you could have a narrow base but if you want the thing to stand for five thousand years and more the fatter and sturdier it needs to besimilar thing to this really  before you want to start reaching higher  ie lurching from one big thing to the next big thing   you need to make sure that the basic code and indeed game mechanics can support what youre trying to do
been doing metaphors and fables and hints for the past few years nothing gets through to them not even the frothing at the mouth ive done above you guys feel free to continue to ever so gently try shrugthis is ccp
why should they listen after all the whole tone of that interview was that according to noah we all know jack about game design  he is the man the uber authority on the subject and its his responsibility to smack down all those upstart youngsters who come bouncing in with enthusiasm and fresh ideasi am paraphrasing here  but to be honest thats the impression the interview gave and why i called him a pompous ass in my earlier post   personally i would think it would be better business practise to figure out how to put those fresh ideas into a game without stripping them of their sparkle and shine otherwise it will just go stale but i dont earn big bucks as a lead designer so  kowtows to the man  i am not worthy
reading a pdf instead of a book lol thats a new one no thanksif they had the book for the kindle then i would totally buy itevetv needs to be purchasable through amazons unbox and apples itunes for like 199  episode i spend more on coffee in the morning  or the subway  jg
right but then it can be stolen and thus why ccp didnt do itwhich is silly because its unavoidable now a days even gamnes and suchhowver my point is even less people will pay for it if its pay per view becuase no one wants to pay for something and not even own itso by working with itunes and maybe making eve tv twice a month instead of every week players like you and me will give ccp moneyhowever i believe a low erz shorter free version would be needed to but its to late for this csm so for the next one
i dont know if i believe rampant digital theft is the reason why evetv was closed down i bet there was more to it than we know maybe they were operating the show at a loss maybe they lost their actors to fee renegotiation churn maybe the production team couldnt control costs effectively maybe they didnt get the necessary number of viewers they neededpeople will pay for stuff if there is value radiohead kinda proved that point recently yah otherwise itunes and amazons unbox  and their kindle device   wouldnt be selling so well we wouldnt have had the writers strike  or be threatened by the actors strike im not trying to litigate a case here there is rampant theft but there is also commerce and a lot of itas for evetvs perceived value id pay 199  episode  thats about itjg

most definately has my support
i wouldnt support this because it would be bad if 2 corps in the same alliance chose opposing factions same goes for joining as an individual while within a corp
very important change
supported
i would agree but only if the corps in the same alliance can not sign up on opposite sideshow disfunctional would that be hey in 00 we are best buds defending our space but in the militia we are killing each othereither alliance as a whole picks a side and then the corps can join or not join that sideor the first corp to join one side locks all other corps in that alliance to that side  which i dont like as much because it could cause alliances to break up   but hey maybe thats what we needat least if its an alliance decision then the corps in the alliance can vote and if they dont like where things are heading they can leave knowing in advance what the alliance is doing
i want to get back into my corp tbh having to create an extra corp for the alliancea   added an extra administrative layer noone neededb   splits the alliance which sucks
first of all how can you not see how much fun that would besecondly what if youve taken the time to reach standing 10 with caldari and amarr on your only character but your alliance does a vote on which faction to join and it comes up minmatar what are your options1   grind minmatar standings and destroy the standings you worked to build with caldari and amarr2   make an alphaclone character on your account and fly around in a noskills frigate  and wish you were playing as your main the whole time  3   buy a second account just for fwi mean clearly ccp should just start forcing people to buy a second account when they subscribe at this point because so many things require it seriously though i dont want to have to pay 2b to buy a decent character for fw i just want to play my damn counterstrike in space already
not supported
apparently this was not the main consideration for the restriction listen to the most recent pod cast warp drive active an interview with ccp zuulupark during this interview ccp zuulupark reveals that ccp was concerned with large alliances sweeping the field with sheer numbers thinly veiled reference was made to a specific alliance but other large alliances seemed to be of concern as wellregardswindjammer
he may be an amarrian but damnit hes got it dead to rights on this issue
supportedive been wanting to see this for a long time freighters are expensive slow unable to tank or defend themselves carry way too much for what most players want require big protection and generally they are just a corp tool rather than a player tool for the marketing industrial player they are more trouble that they are worthsomething smaller and can be fitted with a minor degree of protection  even if its only 2 or 3 midslots for a shield tank   is needed to bridge the gap 100200k cargo  carries 1 gfc with a small amount spare   and more agile than a freighter the primary resource in eve is ore so it should never be limited to not being able to carry it im tired of moving large amounts of trit after a spell of mining to sell at a better price but needing 5 or more trips each time an expanded itty with rigs carries 35k thats only 35 million tritanium a pitiful amount compared to what a single person can mine in a session however a freighter is overkilleven if a small freighter was 200 million isk or so it would be worth it
saying is not proof you have to actually show it if its impossible to prove its kinda of a mute argument then but it semi proves the other point that others have been banned for posting real life info in your opinion it may be hypocritical to only ban some of those that post real life info but im fairly sure ccp reserves the right to treat each case individually and look at the circumstances surrounding it just because he might have pseudocelebrity because of the incidents that led to his ban doesnt give him any right to be exempt from the rules im fairly sure there are others that have been banned for posting real life info should their ban be also lifted change the rule for one you have to change the rule for all
if you do a tiny bit of research you will find the proof he is talking about in its whole
torshin is the one affirming something so he can work to prove it
no supportthe csm was not formed because of the banned individuals revelations ccp did institute an internal investigation process largely because of incident kug publicized but this has little or nothing to do with the csmat the end of the day kug took actions intended to harm ccp and ccps player base when he attempted to blackmail ccp in clearly indicated he was intent on repeating his actions whenever he felt the need ccp is well within their rights to protect their property and exact punitive damages by permanently banning the individual in questionkug knew the rules and the penalties for breaking them he did it anyway regardless of whether you think hes a heroe or not he did what he did the wrong waywindjammer
you are exactly and remarkably wrong
looking at the ships and races you notice somethingfaction  race 1  race 2   frigate cruiser battleshipangel  minmatar  gallente   dramiel cynabal macharielblood raider  amarr  minmatar   cruor ashimmu bhaalgorngurista  caldari  gallente   worm gila rattlesnakesansha  amarr  caldari   succubus phantasm nightmareserpentis  gallente  minmatar   daredevil vigilant vindicatorfactions using minmatar as one of the skills 3factions using amarr as one of the skills 2factions using gallente as one of the skills 3factions using caldari as one of the skills 2i would like for them to think about some of the lesser factions and the ability for them to have faction ships that would make it so that every one had an equal amount of ships that used their spaceship command skillsthey have already added implants to some of the lesser factions this would just fill in the feel of the factions even more
sisters of eve faction should i think bridge the caldari and gallente technologiesrescuer  frigatepreserver  cruiserhope  battleshipark  transportindustrialfaction bonus 1 2 and 3 points of warp stabilizermaybe would have large cargo areas and huge structures but be light in attack abilitiesalso could have probe bonuses and be relative faster than other ships of the same class  less turret points less mass  just an ideagood luck with this idea
more combat races would make since since all the normal pirate faction ships are about combat so the sister thing doesnt seem to fit also that takes the point of the blockade runners unique bonus and one of them would do it better
sounds good add more diversity constantly building ont he current races is good but something different would be nice
in fact another amarr  caldari would even it out till they add 2 new factions of ships to bring them all up to 4 or 4 new factions to bring them all up to 5
an amarr  caldari faction ship might work really well with faction warfare going on also because they are allies
some naming and shiphull suggestions on my partequilibrium of man  amarrcaldari  frigate  nihilistclass frigate  punisher hull  cruiser  maniacclass cruiser  maller hull  battleship  murdererclass battleship  armageddon hull  intaki syndicate  gallente  frigate  nagaclass frigate  maulus hull  battlecruiser  rhakshasaclass battlecruiser  myrmidon hull  battleship  khumbakharnaclass battleship  hyperion hull  carrier  mahadevaclass carrier  thanatos hull  
also remember that the hull could be new looking think succubus and other ships they are not tech two that have a more direct relations ship to the base hull like the rattlesnake is a scorpion hull but is on paper a better raven
i support thisthere are two ideas i can offerulfhedinn  minmatarcaldari   close combat and speed berserkers in space using missiles may be a bit op though grantedthe seekers of the void  amarrgallente   drones and toughness religious fanatics seeking ascencion through technology
one problem with that is that it keeps the racial spaceship command skills at one more than amarr and caldari
thats mainly because angels and serpentis both use gallenteminmatar as combination not because my offered combinations dont exist a even distribution would have all empires to be used three times but with the angelserpentis double youll end up with a gallenteminmatar bias
other corps that have implants like the pirate corps in the history and game nomad bonus to agility faction thukkerproblem minmatar and they already have one more than caldariamarr harvest bonus to mining laser range faction oreproblem they have ships already see mining barges virtue bonus to scan probe strength faction sisters of eveproblem humanitarian organization most likely not making awesome ships edge reduction in booster side effects faction syndicate problem another gellente groupmordus legion commandthe origin of mordus legion lies in the gallentecaldari war when a group intaki military personnel sided with the caldariproblem is its gellente  caldaritheir implants from rev 3 centurion bonus to optimal range of ecm rsd tracking disruptor and target painters faction mordusrogue dronessome factions mix and mash them together into a set of three shipsproblem most likely gellente   and as seen gellente already have one more than caldariamarrpossible fix that would make the bias equal it would be like the amarrian sansharoyal khanid navythe royal khanid navy consists of ships designed by the dark amarrians themselves with a bit of help from the caldari which the kingdom has always held good relations withpossible solution it is amarr  caldari and with faction warfare going on it might make enough since to have a group of ships only thing they would need would be a quick set of low grade implants and it would fit the roles of having implants and having faction ships that use two different spaceship command skills
i like anything that puts more hulls in the game but to be honest i dont want a general all purpose ship there are lots of those already in the game and most of the current faction implementations are just larger stronger more pew pew versions of well rounded ships that are already in game i like limited usability in ships stuff thats very good at one thing and maybe not worthless in another but at least highly crippled outside of its area of influenceso personally i think we should be moving toward a more focused look at ship role design with not just faction ships but all ships which ccp seems to be doing anyway so ill support this not because i think there is any real imbalance on faction ships they are simply there but more because i think something interesting could come of it if someone can think up a way to implement them for pew pew that either doesnt already exist or is currently setup in some anemic way which with a little love could make it a truly viable playstyle

you serious yay
well the devs wanted regions to be only partially  or rather said suboptimally   selfsufficient in order to encourage trade of various items andor materials between thembut when they turned around and nerfed mineral compression and carrier hauling the whole idea became kind of questionable
yes i am quoting myself p this is where i would limit it myself i think minerals being available locally for basic t1 manufacturing should be in every region it is why i want drone mins revamped to allow for more resonable quantities drone region logisitcs are terrible in large part because of drone minerals favoring high ends so heavily i know i am repeating myself sorry
i cant be bothered with the rest of this argument but to be honest the argument about the high price of tritanium bores me if tritanium price is high it means that tritanium supply is low and tritanium demand is high thusly at some point some bright spark will be motivated to get into his mining vessel and mine veldspar mining veldspar at this point can be seen as inherently profitable due to high availability low supply and high demandi give the tritanium price issue over not to a problem with the market but to either a lack of capable miners or laziness markets are inherently selfcorrecting because profitable niches are quickly filled by intelligent individuals seeking more money the tritanium crisis will sort itself out because people in eve want to make money to be honest on the scale of easeofextractiontoprofit ratio mexallon probably ranks highest as plagioclase is plentiful found in a large number of hisec regions and provides a goodly supply of mexallon my fortune when i was a miner wasnt made off of veldspar or bistot  it was plagioclasesmart industrialists will always fill a niche in a market because smart industrialists both want and know how to make money
1 dont put more then 23 hundred mill on your ship2 use alt scout which would be tiresome after awhile3 use cloak which kills scan resolution5 forget any lowslots and fill them with istabsnanos6 what other counters are there exactly the only real feasible option is number 1
no insurence for highsec ganker sounds right
option 2 being the most obvious its not that it gets tiresome its that you dont want to interrupt your isk flow by spending time ensuring your safety failing that go ask the low sec mission runners whove been living with ganks long before ppl came crying to the forumsalso l4 missions dont require a pimp fit to complete so your low cost option is also finescan res isnt that big a deal in pve tbh at least it shouldnt be in some cases a cloak wont save you anywayits easily done and im not going to tell you how as ive said before it is a multi player game you dont have to be in the same corp to work together
ok caps for stating the obvious suicide ganking is only a problem for ppl to greedy to scout there you go soloution number 1suicide ganking isnt broken but for the sake of this thread remove hisec gank insurance you low iq too lazy to work out how to stop it cry on the forums and hope its fixed in our favour suckers will stop cryingnews flash voiding insurance wont stop hi sec ganksthank you and good night
its not the learning skill training time that is the problem its the stupid advice given to new players that they have to train them all right awayyou can train the skills you need as well as the learning skills on a rotating basis thus keeping you in new toys and gaining faster training time without outright sacrificing either one for the other
i like the idea to remove them its ugly for new players to spend time to learn learnings but the new way need to be balance well as old player it does not hurts me to lose the time i spend in them i got my bonus for them and without them new players can consentrate on the funny things like new ships and weapons in fakt of this eve becomes a lote more nooby friendly and we all profit from more eve playermaybe ccp can put a explore the universe thing in the game for example the newbie becomes the mission to fly to ruins in a system or the the mission to fly 10 jumps into 0 space  with a guide in the front of course   and from the expirience the car will get in this mission the pilot will get a short boost on one of the attributes for example 2 to willpower
but remember that learning skills take patience and eventually eve has to a lot to do with patience learning skills also scare away those fps morons yes we might get more active playersbut their qualitylearning skills dont just speed up learning but you also learn while studying your current skills getting a new skill everyday would make you skill hungry not talent hungry ive done tons of research on itemstactics etc while waiting for learning skills to finish
i dont think that learnings change the quality of new players and i never hear that they make some one skill hungryand at last i forget to hit the support button d
this is a very very bad idea first off eve is about players all playing the game together but at the same time no players are  and the same the learning skills like all skills are a huge part of that system1 we all had to go through learning the learning skills as a noob its part of being a noob2 you dont even have to learn the learning skills if you dont want to its a choice some people only learn there learning skills  the 1st set to level 4 and stop   then they learn the second set to level 4 and stop   these people then pick other skills they want and or need and in the mean time lose out on skill points for all other skills in order to get what they want now3 as a person with all learning skills at level 5 both sets i sacrificed the ability to do alot of skills in the beginning of the game but now im learning way faster then many others esp with implants thats becasue i made the choice to sacrifice then to gain now some of the friends that i started playing with all of us from day one started at the same time i now have well over them in skill points some of them as much as 5 million sps why because i decided no i will wait to fly that battleship or t2 ship a few more weeks now im making up for it and bypassing others of my chars age because of the choice i made to me thats an advantage i worked for buy planning aheadeve has never been about people being  its been about everyone being different and one way i might be different from others is i wanted to learn all the learning skills to max while others did notthats eve  its about choices and about being different
indeed  but the one to be viewed only once is the one already written   i have one  a 23 mil sp miningmanufacture one ive only recently started missioning with her though and while i get her skills high enough to fly her kezzie well enough to avoid being popped on the kill missions i am still ploughing through level 1 mining missions which suck there seem to be only half a dozen missions when she actually has to mine stuff  which she is breezing through but since she is flying a hulk to them that isnt really surprising   but the majority of the missions she is running are courier with a smattering of kill missions i mean wtf is that about comes back to my point about appropriate missions for agents  im talking to a mining agent give me more bldy mining missions if i wanted to run courier id do distribution agentsedit  regarding the linkage above to the mission editor thread i think that would be a great adddition if some of the issues raised in that thread were addressed i am an avid player of the thief games and some of the best missions ive played are ones submitted using the level designer and if ccp are hiring people to playtest the submitted missions for balance i will happily send them my resume p
im actually for a massive drop in t1 loot from missions even if it means i make a little less isk simply because im of the mindset that industrialists get  over
i disagree on some of the details but overall these are good ideas i like my t1 loot but im willing to part with it if its done right ie dont just take it off and call it even that stuff is a good 20 of mission rewards at times   and the rest just seem like either common sense npc distribution changes   or nifty ideas a need for pvp modules in pve  
support im very interested in seeing iskmaking activities become more challenging and fun i especially like the idea about missions needing a tackling role to be filled because it encourages group missioningalso another related topic
fewer  better npcs  no t1 loot thanks
yes especially regarding the removal of unnamed t1 loot and the more dynamic npc spawns
signedand maybe add a more advanced ai and targeting behavior to all rats
i like everything apart mission leaders that abandon the mission area unless scrambled because it will generate much trouble for players flying slow ships  bs   without an ab in lvl 4s if you plan to remove that part i will aprove
good ideasi like the idea that some leader would order some of his forces to cover his retreat if his forces are getting creamed what could also be included is  as with some missions now   that after a given  perhaps random   amount of time that leader returns with an overwhelming force as related to the ship  or ships   that chased them off in the first placewhile i like the idea of more dynamic missions  variable spawns   various different ships of similar types  groups of weak ships or smaller gangs of tougher ships   i worry that balance may be thrown off if the right combination of factors come together
i like
explosion velocityprecision light 3000ms precision heavy 1000ms  ccp you got a typo here it must be 2000 precision cruise 1000ms
all precision missiles need a buff especially heavies
this is absolutely true t2 missiles should equal if not exceed t1 versions especially in velocity and duration lag issue the explosion radius thing consumes far too many cpu cycles and i wish that you just had a look up table instead of a floating point calculation involving trig functions for every explosion if you want to balance the game we understand but not at the expense of magnifying lag complex math should be calculated rarely maybe one calculation every few seconds could set a scaling factor the present algorithm wastes server side resourcesnow truely even if you do not find a way to save the many milliseconds each explosion takes to calculate the t2 missiles all fall short of expectations for any purpose all of the t2 designs are flawed regardless of skills ship bonuses or implant bonuses a t2 missile should always fly farther and hit harder than a t1at the very least the ops general idea is correct  and very well presented too   and i feel is very conservative his suggest is just the beginning of an effective game balance  oh and i am not much of a missile fighter i feel the same way about t2 hybrid ammos they are unfairly nerfed  thank you edited to add my vote to this idea
agreed precision heavies are just utterly horrible
matter solved thenits relieving to see the people were not deceived in any way i submit myself to the majority thenperhaps the destructable outposts is not so bad idea after all and the way ccp thinks of it is a milder compromise if it was implemented and if supposingly an alliance would raid an outpost and strip it from its services what kind of isk would be needed so that the outpost be restored to its former state
i do not support this idea though jade may have acted hastily in the events in question this does not mean he should be removed from his post for itwas it rude yes but not unreasonablejade was elected like everyone else and should and undoubtedly will continue leading the csm until the end of his termsimply put if you dont like jade when the time comes and jade decides to run again dont reelect him

people shouldnt be using these threads to discuss the issues in the first place if you dont support an idea then dont postderailbait the thread simple as that
only bumpsorry this is the op hit the wrong toon by mistake
agreed
you also agree to loosing faction with the opposing side for each kill then right
this already happens so no loss inplementing this change
definitely agree that the importance of planets in each system is greatly below where it should be and that they should be far more significant than just acting as a warpable celestial object as they are currently allowing inhabited worlds to be developed in order to generate pos components strontium jump drive fuel and other necessary consumables for the sovereign alliance would allow for interesting developments and this could additionally provide a target for small gang logistics disruption for example npc hauler spawns could automatically deliver fuel to control towers but be vulnerable to hostiles intercepting and popping them or planetary industrial centres could be hacked or targeted to shut them down for a given period such a move could see the development of whole new specialisations for example an alliance could grant players the planetary governor role  which would require a new set of administrative skills to be trained something which could boost the value of the currently neglected charisma statline   and give them control over a particular planet to go and simcity it up managing its output and needs to produce goods as the alliance required this would reduce the need for npc sell orders and the market distortions they sometimes create as well as allowing spaceholding player alliances to loosen if not cut the umbilical cord of npc empire dependency and function more like sovereign powers in their own rightit would be great if we saw the introduction of spaceports on the planetary surface which functioned as cheap minioutposts  with fewer station services and perhaps limited hangar space   to make neglected areas of space habitable without having to plonk down 30b or so for an outpost  and who wouldnt want to build their very own mos eisley perhaps complete with cantina band ultimately though inhabited planets should also be the key to system sovereignty look at the recent background writing on the capture of new caldari we didnt get fiction about stront timing or station pingpong the caldari showed up around the planet with a load of dropships and deployed troops to the planetary surface to capture it and frankly thats a far cooler method of taking a system than playing who can anchor the most giant space needles

i like this idea and support it id like to see group missions force different types combat setups for the group though there shouldnt be a defacto mission running ship instead youll need a well balanced group of ships to complete it tacklers heavy dps support blah blah blah set it up to where missions work like small gang pvp implement a gang cap so people just cant bring 200 ships to play but instead streamline it for a minimum and a maximum amount of players allowed minimum means that if a gang only wants to have 3 members the mission is possible but they better have each one of those members performing a certain specific role to do it maximum should be self explanatory the mission is allowed x number of players if the game detects anyone not inside youre gang doing anything other than sitting there including getting targeted or targeting all the npcs turn tale warp out and despawn mission is automagicaly a failall that can be balanced reworked rethought whatever but i want strategical and tactical group missions not just bring larger numbers and i want them to be a viable way of making isk
i like the principle of this but the devils in the details  do you create a whole new batch of agents to deal with this or do you overlay it onto the current system i prefer the former gives you an excuse to spread the lag without nerfing santenpaa   but if you go for the latter how will you deal with the screams from solo missioners  what level does this kick in at do you start it low to let newbs in but risk people running gang l1s instead of solo l2s or do you do something crazy like modify l5 andor add l6  do you just make the new gang missions the same but bigger or do you do new things do these new things include mechanisms of forcing players to gang up to complete the mission loot splitting nuff said and thats just a sampler of the issues youll face with this its complex and touchy and if you do it wrong youll  off half the subscriber base i know ccp said they wanted more bigpicture stuff and none of these issues are disqualifying but theyre all things to be very careful about
yep
group missionrunning is only one aspect of what i had in mind here are some of my ideas for that aspectwhen you interact with an agent you have two options im looking for work and my friends and i are looking for work if you choose the second option you get a mission that requires a level of player cooperation and interdependency that simply cannot be achieved by one guy running multiple accounts the mission needs tackling and ewar and remote repping and sniping and so on all done at the same time and with some real player skill in order to win and in return the players get rewards that beat what they could earn if they were running classic level fours all alone enough to make it worth their while to go to the extra trouble of putting together a group and doing something more complex than activate tank f1f8players would be able to take part in these group missions from day one just like with classic singleplayer missions they would scale in difficulty and in rewards by level the lowlevel missions train newer players in how to cooperate as a group by gradually introducing the players to different group roles and tactics those same skills that are introduced in group mission ultimately help prepare the players for group pvp if they choose to play that side of the gameno artificial mechanics would be needed to prevent soloing or zerging the group missions they cant be soloed because theres too much going on at once and sure you can zerg them with twice as many people as the mission requires but then everyone gets half the profit they would otherwise enjoy elite groups of friends who run missions together should feel encouraged to hone their teamwork and personal skills to tackle missions as quickly and efficiently as possible without bringing more people along than the mission requireseve is not a game that lends itself to cooperating with strangers i think most everyone knows to only join a gang with friends and corpmates so if theres loot to split i would expect a group of friends to be able to come to a fair agreement on how to split it without the game doing it for them some missions might even require a salvagerhauler role to be filled to get the loot out before its too latei think theres a lot of potential for fun drama and heroism there and again i dont mean for group ventures to be limited to only missions what aboutgroup mining endeavors an incredibly rich belt of ore is found but pirates have learned of its location as well can you and your friends mine out the belt and haul away the ore before the pirates arrive with overwhelming forces all the while defending yourselves from their advance guardgroup exploration complexes kind of like what we have now only more complicated fun and difficult  like the missions i describe above   so as to require an actual group of players instead of just some guy running a second account with a logistics ship scale up the rewards to match the difficulty so that it beats out mindless solo rattinggroup ratting at every planet theres a pirate installation of some kind the installations are defended by highbounty ships and haulers fly in and out with ore mined from the surrounding belts and other valuables very lucrative to lay siege these strongholds but if you try to go it alone youre asking for a quick death the installations might be equipped with a wide variety of defensive measures so as to require groups of player to work together to overcome them
lets explain some counter reasons why only some pve things are done in groupgroup missionsratting you can divide the bounties decently  equal division independently from the real contribution but it is acceptable   but you cant divide the loot and you have no chance of checking what the other people has looted damn that faction bs had only a tag and standard modules true or falsewe have got a officer xy module i will sell it and divide the gain player divide 500 millions true sell price we have found only some ton of regular modules i will pay them buy market price ouch i get more reprocessing them in a game like eve faith in other people honesty can get you only to a point thenthere is the problem or really evalutating what the drops are worthif player a want to sell for fast cash and player b want to put it on market at a high price as it will sell in a month who will decide explorationgreat i have spent half day to find this site and get 15 of the reward like the othersany kind of activityyes i would love to do xy but i can start only at 2030 at 2100 i am leaving with mygirl so we shuold complete for 2050 eccmining is one of the best group operations because it get a increased result for group effort  more security and more yield   it is easy to divide the profits a single player can enterleave when needed without doing much damage to the others all things not shared by other group efforts your vision is beautiful but would require a lot more thrust between players  in eve    way better npc ai a serious commitment for ccp in developing pvei dont see any of the above as probable with all the above any step in this direction can be good so let support your idea
actually i was thinking of it more like thislogs onoanyone wanna run an exploration encounteryessome of us already are you wanna join midwaysureokaylove tookay ill just find a new one for us gimme a bit10 minutes passesokay guys i found a couple of options do you like a or bpeople decide which encounter to runeveryone travels 23 systems to the encountereveryone runs the encounter in 12 hourseveryone makes more isk than they would if theyd just been rattingas for the trust issue i have ingame friends that i trust and i trust my corpmates and alliancemates we split loot all the time when we do roaming pvp gangs this shouldnt be any harder
sorry but finding a exploration site is more like 2 hours i have complete thrust in my corpmate in my 5 mens corp  they are all directors and i routinely research my bpo in the corp pos without locking them   hard to say the same in a 150 man corp especially if it is regularly recruiting 
hence my vision to change the game to make them easier and quicker to find in addition to more profitable and entertaining to complete
wouldnt it be ironic if we used all our characters to vote for this
good to see two representatives are supporting this alsoagree totally take carearithron
actually and contrary to possible appearances but it is one account one vote currentlyduring the csmccp meeting i had an issue up about this problem  that we  as csm   cannot tell whether or not the 5  at that time   vote had been reached as it was an account measure not a pilot one and we were advised that should the numbers replying to  supporting an issue where no csm member has picked it up then it only takes a moment for ccp to give us the number of accounts represented as opposed to avatarsthis means that  a   making people decide which is their main character on a given account doesnt need to have an admin process worked out and  b   that the issues cant be stacked as you worry aboutiz
its good to hear that ccpcsm is on top of this issue however at the moment as has been shown by people in this post the level of support being shown against a given issue is being skewed by people voting with multiple alts and unlike ccpcsm its those figures that we see and use to gauge how popular a given issue actually ishowever the idea of only allowing main characters to post in here would help to reduce the noise in the forum thus allowing greater focus to be placed against important issues as opposed to issues constantly bumped to the front page by people using multiple alts to give the appearance that an issue is more pressing than it actually isplease note however that this isnt directed at anyone in particular more of a what if potential situation
thank you very much inanna for the info it really does clear things upedited for grammar
i have a g15 keyboard owned scrubs
g15 ftw but yeah for those who cant afford one supported
i think that topics covered by the csm still being in the assembly hall may detract from other topics not yet discussed some people may not know they have been covered ad read  vote for them while they could be contributing to other issuesshould we move them to a separate forum label them
yes on both counts though im unsure of what impact it would have given that even with a multi page thread on an issue that tends to stay near the front page  skill queues   we still have multiple people starting their own threads on the same issuewhile moving the issues dealt with to a seperate forum in order to increase clarity would be welcome it does lead to the issue that someone will look at this forum not see the thread due to it having been moved and just start another one
ccp said they wanted more grand ideas to come out of csm well here is my grand ideai want pirate factions to have a larger impact on eve i do not like that currently their largest reason for being is to dump huge amounts of isk into the game and really nothing else this idea is a tiein to factional warfare but it doesnt have to bethe four empires are currently fighting back and forth over lowsec this means a lot of flux my idea in its simplest form is for pirate factions to try and capitalize on the current state of chaos they do this by randomly a few times a month invading a system in lowsecthis means the pirates lockdown a system gate camps station camps roving parties reserve fleets the works players then need to kick them out this should be a massive undertaking that takes a day or two for factions to complete it comes with its own special missions storyline missions maybe even a few cosmoslike missions can only be done once per event but can be done again at the next event   all of which can only take place during an insurrectionbasic working would be an overlay to the current fw system the server decides that its bored and its time cause problems for everyone it then picks a system in lowsec preferably several one in each region of lowsec it then flips control of that system to noone controlling it its owned by the pirates after that its a race all factions get a point total for missions completed against the pirates whomever can get to the arbitrary magic number of points needed first is able to start the normal system of taking ownership of the system caviet is there is also a timer for every hour after you hit the magic number if you havent yet taken control of the system points are deducted maybe putting you under the number needed to try for the capture of course the other factions could also hit the point total and start trying for the capture at the same time after ownership of the system is claimed pirates stop spawning and mopup work beginsideally what youd get is a bit of controlled insanity youd have large groups of npcs fighting large groups of pcs both of whom are then ambushed by another group of pcs along with all the back and forth that it brings it really wouldnt be who brought the most ships because a small group of 56 people in the right ships while they couldnt normally hurt a group of 2030 in this type of gameplay could really cause them some pain as they arent there to win the engagement but instead to simply make sure the other side doesnt win and hopefully make sure that the pirates take out as many of the other sides ships as possible at the same timeadditionally because the pirates keep spawning at some timed interval say top of the hour every hour   one empire really cant lockdown the system without a huge number of ships if each lowsec region gets its own event at the same time it should spread it out enough on the cluster that no one faction should be able to bring enough ships to any one event to allow that sort of one sided victory without giving up several other systems in the process so we should get some rather interesting fights out of the ordealabove is the idea in a nutshell now there is one idea which does not go into that system but that ive wanted for awhile now in reguards to pirates  running out of characters for this post  
pirate class shipsempires dont get them they are completely 100 pirate only they also require skillbooks you can only get from pirate factions example after awhile the pirate factions have decided that they dont work under the same set of battle conditions that most fleets do so theyve came up with the privateer class ship its a frigatedestroyercruiserwhatever which is uniquely suited to the idea of small gang pvp or whatever   you need the privateer skill to fly it plus whatever two empire starship skills would normally be required for a ship of its hull classi have no idea if any of this is technically workable i have no idea if its even a good idea but it is one direction id like to see eve heading in
i support the idea of giving the pirate factions a greater role i know a lot of people talk about the jove but personally id be far more interested in seeing ccp develop the nonempire factions furtherim not so sure about the insurrection idea id rather see the pirates taking on a proper joinable fw role the pirate ship classes would be a good move though
my topic on pirate faction ships might be something adding a new racial skill for ships isnt very likely right now but the fact that the ships get bonuss from both racial skills is a fun gimmick that and the fact it is would more likely be easier to hack and slash two techs together than creating a entire new tech and probable easier for balancing
pirate only faction ships are really just something i think is neat and i didnt feel like writing a second thread for it so i just rolled it into this one the first part of the post is really the meat and potatoes of my idea and truly i dont even know if its a good idea i just want discussion about making the pirate factions more inclusive to gameplay i find the current implementation of them as boring and half baked for a game of eves complexity it just seems than we can do better than using them as kill quests in the same manner that every other mmo on the market uses its npc factions maybe not make them game defining points in the game but at least allow them to make the game more interesting and give it some flavor in how you interact with them
i wrote a thread check it out
large railguns are dual barreled on their icon however when i see them on the rokh they are single barreled they need to redo the turrets and the way they move on a naval gun the whole containing assembly doesnt move just the barrel although i am giving support to this item i believe that ccp should work on the gaimplay issues and on game balancing more than graphics a great game will make up for ok graphics but great graphics will not make up for an ok game
hey as an artist working an internship at a small time game company i have to chime in we love to have stuff to work on while the programmers work their magic even if it doesnt make it in were still making stuff all dayand contrary to the belief we all know a bit of programing to get by
im in favour of this however just like someone above mentioned this should be more of a side project that can be rolled out slowly over time while focusing more on the bigger gameplay affecting issues
i completely agree im sure the client can handle extra bits n bobswhich is a really good point ccp have stated before they work in cells and that artists mainly do arty stuffit seems that ccp do have quite a bit on their plates these days in the old visual department they have ambulation assets to create as well as the rest of the eve universe which were left out last time such as npc deadspace structures pos planetsmoons asteroids ect there are also rumours of the good old ui overhaulhopefully next year we can see cool gunneryshield effects d
has anyone actually thought this out at a certain point you cant make the changes anyone is proposing why because there are going to be a lot of players who simply play the game dont get involved on forums and while may dislike the current playstyle are going to complain as soon as their capital isnt nearly as useful as it was before you can nerf capitals you can boost other classes against capitals but the end result either way is going to be a very angry playerbase who hadnt been vocal before and suddenly are now because i guarantee you that as much as we all hate pos warfare now if hundreds of dread pilots all the sudden find that their main reason for having dumped several million sp into dread just up and dries up they are going to be less than happy even if they hated what they didthe only true answer isnt a broad sweeping set of changes or one massive change but instead a well thought out slow progression of changes over a year or twosomething like but not exactly like this im sorry if this looks machiavellian but this is simply an example idea of the timeframe not a true fix  step oneremove pos warfare rebuild and balance all the dreads in the game for a new role which is going to upset a whole lot of people so to sugar coat it intentionally overpower dreads at the time of the change people will still complain but theyll complain less if all the sudden they become awesomestep twosix months down the line on the next large patch bring dreads back in line with real balance figures for their new rolestep threenext large patch introduce some specialty mechanicsmodulesships that are purely setup for some sort of anti capital warfare under balance them not so much they cant do their job but enough so people get used to themstep fourand the large patch after thatrebalance the mechanicsmodulesships so now hopefully everything is fixed
supported i dont know why people are not supporting the discussion of capital ships really while discussing them with great vehemence
id like maybe to see capital ships have subsystems like outposts have a bunch of battleships disabling a titans doomsday by targeting one of its subsystems  high slot subsystem for example disabling a motherships drone baycargo bay destroying any dronesfightersequipment inside and stopping it deploying any more  maybe even a subsystem that allows it to control its fighters and drones    disabling a titansjump freighters  yes i count freighters as capital ships   jump drive subsystem to stop them from travelling destroying a dreadnaughts highslot subsystem disabling its ability to siegethese subsystems can be repaired but maybe only with nanite pastein stations and not by remote repping  since the subsystems are more complicated than structurearmour  
because the proposal of the op is an open ended discussion without limit as to what would be discussed in other words the proposal is to engage in a discussion between the csm and ccp where nothing specific is decided beforehand in such a situation the csm reps would have freedom to make whatever suggestions they feel needed to be changed in capital ships without first presenting the suggestions to the subscriber base or even to the rest of the csm representativesin essence if this proposal were approved for escalation it would allow suggestions on capitals to be sprung full blown upon a csmccp meeting without prior notice to the public other csm representatives or ccp itself this would bypass the regular methods of input from the subscriber base discussion in the csm meetings and notification period ccp requiresany opposition to such ambush like suggestions would not have time to research or word their response while the person offering the suggestions would have had time to create a presentationas far as the subscriber base is concerned wed find out about the suggestions and their implementations after theyd already been accomplishedwindjammer
a discussion where we could hear ccps open ended ideas on where to take it for the community as a whole to look at
ccp already dispenses information on their ideas in dev blogs whenever they wish that information to be divulged further the ops proposal is designed to present ccp with ideas not necessarily the other way roundwindjammer
present ideas nothing says that they have to implement them it would be something to think about open up a dialog and discussion so we know the limitations and other factors that would allow people to present new and better ideas that are in the realm of possibility
literally this is a request by the op to present suggestions to ccp in the name of the csm without informing anyone of what all those suggestions will beideas which are presented to ccp from the csm are suggestions to ccp as to what the csm would like to see happen and by extension are presumed to be the desires of the csms constituency the subscriber basethe ops proposal would be a way to present ideas that avoid input  either support or opposition   from the subscriber base or other csm representatives further it would do so over an unlimited range of unspecified suggestions regarding capital shipscurrently the csm votes whether or not to bring specific suggestions to ccp these suggestions must have been on the forums for 7 days to allow for subscriber input and discussion if approved for escalation by vote of the csm the suggestion is assigned a proponent to make the presentation to ccp ccp is given ample notice to consider the pros and cons of the suggestion that way everyone goes to a meeting prepared to discuss it for all practical purposes the op may as well have said lets have a discussion with ccp regarding eveas far as discussion thats what the forums are for arent theywindjammer
can you stop signing you post we all know who you arealso of the csm representatives quite a few of them only really would care about two of the capital ships and know less about the others the two they would know are freighters and jump freighters because they are the only two allowed in hi sec ankh only went to low sec to cap things in faction warfare and did not kill any one so i really cant believe she would know heads from tails about dreadnoughts or carrier combat they go against jades view of the game and how it is played so he would not care if they are brought up bane knows more about them than just about anyone i know darius flies three or four of them on his accounts and has experience with them harden is in 00 so he at least has a view on how they affect the game inanna is a carebear who they do not affect and all the other members would have free discussion on their views on it all also so it would not just be the bane glorious power hour
one of the major problems with drones and their various modules issues of lack of implants and balancing is that they are used on so many ships in so many factionsthe balance issue is the main reason for the lack of drone implants modules and new drones  that dont cost 10 mil and 100 hours of farming each to find and make  by limiting what ships can use what drones the balance issue is fixed and new things can be implemented toward the use of drones without making them overpoweredif a ship is built with the use of drones in mind then is should be made so that its existance does not prevent new drones or modules from being introduced by its mere existancethey are on everythingbut you cant introduce a more powerful light drone now because all the ships with 25m3 drone space or more just got a boostyou cant make more interesting and useful drones because the ships they were not ment for can use them since their are only two factors governing drone usebandwidth and drone bay spacevanilla controls over a very dynamic weapons systemalso pairing these with weapons that cant be destroyed makes them too powerful the argument of just destroy them is wasted on the ship that doesnt use them as their primary weaponlight ecm drones are a great example of the problem they allow for 5 jaming attempts per cycle the break of the lock means a relock and they are trying to jam during this also but any ship with 25m3 space uses thembecause while drone ships have damage bonuses all ships use the other drone types the same waythat is the flawas it stands now you can not add modules or cybernetic implants or new powerful drones because they will be used on ships they were not ment to be used on and ruin the ship balance and role that ccp has been working towardthe existance of these ships prevents the addition of more drone content that is just sillyplease ccp either make a flat limit on a ships drone type use make them work less effectively on nondrone focused ships or add a new control along the lines of bandwidth that would regulate drone use by typeas it stands now drones are a dead end weapons system because they are used as secondary weapons on so many ships you cant boost or add to drone use for drone specialists because everyone would get the boostso drones stagnate or get things like the augmented versions of drones faction drones yes powerful yes but so expensive to make even 5 it is sick but using this kinda control makes them unusable and therefore a waste of time to design and emplement because of their lack of use exotic drones that never see the light of day but how much design time was wasted on thishas anyone seen them being usedmy point exaclty
it may require a major rewrite to the eve programming but i do believe this would make eve an even more enjoyable game
as sad as it sounds after reading that i agree with goumindong while its a nice idea that has to be the most horrible implementation of an idea ive ever read that entire system removes gates as choke points and if anything eve needs more chokepoints to funnel players through setup on wildly divergent paths so its hard to cover them all
while people are right in that it would certainly change eve dramatically i still thinkit might be worth some consideration afterall some aspects of it might well be implementable
heyi just had an idea for eve that will help everyone when coming to the end of their subscriptionwhy dont ccp introduce a device that after signing in it tells you how much time you have left on your account before it expiresmaybe even if it was just to work on the last 5 days of the account so that the owner can have time to sort hisher payment out without losing anytime ingame  i had important stuffs coming up  i think this would be a good idea because it allows owners of expiring accounts to fit going to the bank into their busy schedulesi for one am for this as i found out that my account expired yesterday and didnt get paid until today and kind of missed the closing time at the bank because of my busy schedule and i aint spending 200 million on a gtc so i am going to have to wait until monday so yeah there is my idea i hope people like itmehez

the csm is a fail and was even before the votingcandidates were pushing their own agendas from the beginning and havent waivered from those positions by only supporting player raised topics that align with their own viewsccp has made a career of denying and clouding issues rather than address them the csm is just a logical extension of that poor game management it would be a nice surprise if ccp canned the useless csm and hired professionals to actually do the jobno offense to the people that comprise the csm as i dont know any of you my disdain is for the process and the procedures not the players
since the mining overhaul thread is my favorite one and ccp is looking for more extensive ideas from the csm im putting it up for vote here this overhaul includes multiore asteroids including changes to mining yield mechanics survey scanners and modulated mining lasers to maintain functionalitysupport multiore asteroids removalreduction of static belts and changing them into locations that need to be scanned down within defined areas  this would also require the addition of locations that replace static belts for ratting purposes   alloy mining which is a low volume condensed mineral type of mining that requires high activity compared to the low maintenance ore mining promoting agile ships for mining that have greater survivability in lower security comets and cometmining requiring new technology for a interesting and bountiful new mining experience solar mining as an alternative to ice mining for simple isotopes more efficient but more dangerous  does not yield liquid ozone heavy water and strontium clathrates   gas cloud harvesting expansion that will add more opportunities to use the skills and equipment outside booster production yielding a wide variety of materials or new exotic substancessupport this is you want mining to be of greater variety offer more choices and be much more fun
i want the asteroids opened to all security levels in a region but have higher and lower yeilds depending on native sec status 10 gives like 10 yield arkonor and 10 gets like 510x yeild veldspari want medium and heavy mining drones and an ore specialty  or gallente heck why not   mining ship with bonus for mining drones i support that there are several more fun things mining could get
i support expanding on mining options well thought out threads this is linked to
yes
supportedwith two thumbs if i could do that
you may remember me making a post a long time ago about neutral logistics repairing wartargets without getting a combat timer  ie they can dock or jump instantly  faction warfare has escalated this to a new levelnow we can have heavilytanked wartargets in highsec that tank the faction navy with the help of neutral remoterepair ships that can jump or dock immediately and not only that but they dont get shot by the faction navy this means that hostiles can go anywhere they want in hostile space as long as they have a few neutral reppers with them on top of that because of the random spawning of the faction navy the neutral doesnt need to repair all of the wartargets  the faction navy will not attack some of them no matter how long they sit theremy proposal has expanded1   logistics should give you a combat timer  you remoterepair a war target you cant dock or jump for a while just the same as if you shot someone this was the proposal from part 12   if you remoterepair someone in a militia you flag to the enemy militia  players and npcs this means that if you repair a militia member in hostile highsec a navy detachment will spawn to attack you as well3   the faction navy should spawn per hostile after a set period of time instead of spawning for a particular number of them and generally not attacking certain people this ensures that any incursion is met with an appropriate level of force
i can agree to it and it makes sence   
make sense
actively repairing someone whos a whos got an aggression time is like aiding crimals in rl if you choose to help some one with a aggression then your actively commiting the same act as he it they should be flagged
i agree just one in a number of loopholes that need to be closed
not signedi can understand proposal 2 but not 1 and 3logistic ships and rr is used elswhere also not only in high sec by militia
if you rr someone that has a global criminal counter you will be flagged and get a gcc yourselfif you remote rep someone who is in war you will be flagged to his wartargets so everything you said should be is allready
1 is reasonable 2 is necessary but i dont like 3  i prefer the idea of putting together a big enough force for highsec raids
akiba where else would 1 be an issue really repping poss you have a giant bloody force field there right repping people in your gang youre getting shot at anyway right the only people 1 really affects is people who rely on stationtanking to keep their logistics ships alive everyone else can wait for a minute or two to dock again
from the top of my headone situation iv been in several times is when you attack a gatecamp and they lit up a cyno and drop a few carriers on you since most of the gang is tackled we stay on the gate and rr while we wait for the timer to pass so we can jumpi dont see the need for giving rr a combat timer just because some militia dudes is playing the docking game with youeditfix the docking mechanism instead thats whats broken imo
yeah 
please make it happen

humm not sure but i think someone was downplaying how much ebank actually controlsusing timecards as a reference  375mil per 60d tc   the million isk is worth about 00933 us   00933 misk  i seem to remember that ebanks most recent report put their total worth over the trillion mark  1 000 000 000 000 isk   this means they control over 93 300 us  worth of isk so currently it would probably be over 100 000 usthat article needs to remove the if not part of that statement
so no one else sees this as a useful time saving feature
sounds good to me
im not sure your categorization is the best but the current system is a total skull  you cant find anything unless you know the arcane naming convention and even then its hard id almost prefer the divisions be 135 more or less   but something to take away multipage lists of strangelynamed objects with identical pictures would be much appreciated
fact  people dont like all peoplefact  everyone is biased it only depends what to
you think everyone at the un thinks the sameyou think they all like each otheryou think they find someone form a different planet exempt from their petty differences to run itsame thingthey get together precisely because they disagreethis isnt eve vs sa or old skool vs new kids on the block it is all of eve for all of eve  good bad and ugly

i think the problem here might be that as much as i like eve there are still way too many problems in the present to be thinking much about the futureonce they have ironed out all  or at least most   of the current problems then people will start thinking about the future seems to me this lead dev seriously underestimates the importance of some of these issues to the playersjudging by my entire onlinegaming experience though fixing most current issues is wishful thinking as every gaming company seems more interested in creating new issues rather than fixing old ones
although some of you have made some nice analogies i dont see it as an eitheror thing overall i believe ccp addresses bugs and balance issues very well considering the magnitude of the game and the effects that fixes have on everyone at the same time i want to see the game grow upi raised two children my overall goal was to help them grow up into mature adults there were bugs along the way and we fixed those we could but the overall goals was to keep them growing in the right direction that is the way i see eve
i had kinda some of those thoughts in a much less blunt rude and angry fassionit seems expectations were different from this particular ccp boss it is always frustrating to be poked about items in your todo pile or have things added to it even but my initial thought to it was actually tough break mate it seems more of a priority for the community to have a working game with its current features and a few minor addons than it is to get all against the joveans or planetart veichle race in 3 to 4 years on a good note though it just means that your product is good and we like it alot
actually some of us have grand ideas many prominent industrialists and traders in the md forums have posted literally tomes of grand ideas to take the economy of this game into new areas and directions expanding it into a real sandbox allowing both the new player to experience without such high competition barriers like now and allowing the older player to scale their play so that the time invested allows larger benefitsbut for those ideas to work it requires bugs ui changes and changes in how the market worksive seen grand ideas in the cnp forums but during the discussion of those ideas inevitably someone always points out that unless a is fixed this b will never work right and will only make issues c and dsorry the game is pretty ing grand and wide it has a metric ton of content that most games can only dream of  seriously think of the scale and the number of items   but right now its time to hone down and focus on polish instead of adding content
thisactually i havent followed much the csm thingy just voted and hoped for the best some good work has been done now i read this interview and got on my nerves reallywont start on how inefficient the game industry is and ccp slowness the all so important burocratic process that grow up with company grow  aka 3 devs doing more than a staff of 300   etc but please do you think we are stupid ccp first fix and improve stuff and then we can talk about grand visions which you will say this is a no cause blabla
customers make the game more polishedccp lets add more fancy new stuff
so what happened what did ccp say when csm put this idea forward to them i understand that a meeting between csm and ccp has taken place and this was discussed  any encouragement as to the fulfillment of this
great hopefully this is what we need to make this idea reality
just like you said at the end of you original post shar thinking about the datacore pile you have waiting and the seemingly impossibly long 60 day skill finished up is a damn good reason to start playing eve again if you were previously inactive
this i will support but getting a long skill trained while the account was inactive is a great way to lure back players the change of gtc to 60 days and a little higher cost was probably partially motivated by the people training 1 month in 1 month out but much more buy the rp farming operations
you gain a storyline every 16 rd missions too for me it was way more useful than the rp point gainsif that was ever done that way it was well before the datacores i started my first rd agent in may 2006 and she gave me rp even the days i wasnt missioning for her you can have all the issues you want with people running afk with haulers but that dont make you all some people has issues with that other people think that is someone is willing to risk his stuff going afk instead of piloting a 3040 jump in high sec it is his right please use real numbers not make belive 5 top agents  all level 4 with the appropriate player science skill at 5  all level 4 0 or more quality   give out about 500 rpday datacores go for less than 300k normally so it is 3 millionsday less than 1 hour of mining veldspater
i disagreefor a player to continue to gain sp and rp is a great hook it distinguished eve from all the other gamesmy account has never stopped and i have never benefitted from this but if i had to go away for a year  say national service or lack of funds after a baby born etc   these things make eve a game i am more likely to return tolook it costs nothing it is not really an exploit in the long run it makes ccp more money and therefore keeps this game goinglet the expired accounts continue to earn something so they come backno
a thousand times this was going to reply fortunately read ahead before opening my big mouth for once  rooker says it perfectly please tell me youre kidding think about this statement really hard for a while
my personal view has always been that if you arent an active player  in this case defined as a paying player   then you shouldnt expect to gain the benefits of being a paying player  ie sp and rpi  unofficially  raised this at the recent ccpcsm meeting in passing on another subject and it was indicated to me from the ccp side that they saw this as beneficial to enticing people back into eve if they feel they need to take a break from regular play im still uncertain about it though setting a long skill to level 5 and disappearing off for that period without paying is  to me anyway   clearly gaming the system commercially though it might well be better for ccp in the longer run to permit this iz
sorry nope not in a million years i have this thing called real life and the fact that eve does not have to become a second job for me is one of the primary reasons i play the sp gain while account is inactive is relatively minor benefit  since the skill training stops once the skill is finishedthe rp gain while account is inactive is also a relatively minor thing since those accounts are reactivated to collect the rp and the benefit of iskcash is small sorry not supported everoh and since you consider using an indy with 1 miner ii to mine a large veldspar asteroid for a while lame  i can see that you obviously have no notion that eve is not a 1 priority of majority of the players  and at the same time it is beneficial to gain some resources while we do things like work and household duties and things of such nature again eve is not a second job for most of us  and those two things you mention are actually of an extreme benefit for majority of the players
your defense of your real life simply comes across quite shakespearean you doth protest too much somehow you are connecting your real life demands in connection with inactive players and blurring the lines to active customers its a false argument that youve given in entirety and one can only assume that you either have misread the idea or your evepeen is heavily invested in using inactive accounts so that you dont have to play eve like the rest of us who do not you know those of us who play the game fairly without exploiting the systemsobswaaaaaah i wanna pvp all the time damn people who try to change my eve from counterstrike onlinesobscry us a bloody river and go back to posting how you drink carebear tears must make your whine go down better nvm discussing this with someone so obviously lame is not worth any of my time in game or real life
this has been discussed long enough so im just going to close with this being an american ive seen what becomes when you set up a welfare state inactive account skillpoint gain is not that and i probably should have brought it up in a different thread entirelyinactive account research point gain is the foundation of a welfare state it is an automatic stipend that destroys an causality between reward and riskefforthowever if the so called majority is in favor who am i to fight that im just going to do all i can to poison the well entirely ill just go on and detail the exact steps to game the system so that there can be hundreds of accounts per each player gaining research points where will your real life be then when everyone is doing it shortsighted selfentitled fools no wonder you need to exploit tata now gotta go use my nonexploiting success to go open a dozen accounts
ok lets seethe quote is the lady doth protest too much methinks from hamlet however you as majority of unwashed masses misinterpret what protest means you view it as denial or disagreement when it really means at least in shakespeare to argue for to vow and to solemnly declare in other words protest is not a juxtaposing view of the subject under discussion but quite the opposite the desire to argue for the subject so elaborate so artful so full guile that it undermines the credibility of the one who argues which to further infer using the quote means that you are the one who doth protest too much methinks for your chosen subject to the point of loosing all credibility in the process you are using every tool in the forum trolls arsenal to quash down any opposing view and argue so vehemently for your proposal with flame and trolling to the point that indeed you loose all credibility in the matter it is hard to see what you are arguing for other than maximizing your personal gain you attribute intent to me for example of being a cs crybaby while i i am not a fan of the game which you would not know of course or you take the position of mysterious us thus assuming that while you have 5 supports in this thread and many more denials of your idea trying to add weight to an argument which is lost oh and just to clarify things i have two accounts one is for jb as pure combat and the other one is a 100 carebear t2 manufacturer and inventor as such again you assumed that i was relying on inactiveactive game to make isk in game again falsley if you took the time not to run headlong into a brick wall and flame and troll in your own thread you would have realized that i am arguing against your idea because it is detrimental to the majority of the players who have come to rely on that extra time when the account goes inactive to train that particular skill or the meagre rp collected while they are inactive as opposed to being tied to eve 237 that is why the developers of eve as stated by the csm representative are reluctant to change the system the benefit of retaining the players is far outweighing the small and perceived inconvenience of those who would protest too much for their idea while representing it as the common goalbest of luck to you in your next fallacy
i have highlighted some trolling and flaming 1   i am an american and i disagree with you 100 please do not use national distinctions to argue for things in a make belief universe of eve it really means that you are taking the game too seriously and need a break 2   if you refrained from trolling your own threads and creating a flamebait posts you probably would have had greater success in the matter furthermore the so called majority comment pretty much assures us of your contempt for the real majority who mostly disagreed with you in a polite manner and were repaid back by you with contempt flames and insults 3   although i might agree with you in principle that gaining rp while inactive is not the best idea and as a t2 manufacturer would probably support it in the long run the benefit of retaining a greater eve population in my opinion far outweighs the detriment of the so called stipendediti might further add that the datacores are not bough back from the players by ccp and are actually traded as a commodity between the players themselves as such do not constitute a ccp sponsored stipend in any way since it is not free isk given out each month it still requires one to buy a gtc collect the datacores haul them to whatever current beneficial market and wait for them to sell to other players
it is no more gaming the system than having that same level 5 skill training when you go to sleep they designed it this way intentionally and for a reason when i was without internet for 3 months  thx embarq morons   i almost didnt come back but then i realized a long and very nice lvl5 skill had finished so i patched the client logged back in and prompty bought a time code  that somebody else bought from ccp  
for someone that some post ago asked not to use ad hominem attacks you have a very fondness for themtry to follow your advice and speak only about the objections not about your opinion of the person who object and his reasonsso this are your true colors how you dare disagree with me i am right

not supportedfaction warfare is a stepping stone to alliance warfareif you wish to play with the new shiny ask to leave your corp for a period of time
would make sense altho if one corp within alliance joins militia it should block possibility for other corps in same alliance join opposing 2 militias  nothing wrong if corps join say amarr and caldary or minamatar and gallente militias  
ok so to help make it a stepping stone we isolate fw players in their own bubble where they cannot interact with alliance communities and set the game up so that their entire corp has to move from fw into 00 at the same time and so they cannot have experienced alliance politics or organisation before they movegenius design already supported  
i support this though am unsure on implementation
supportedits simply a matter of allowing an alliance to join only one faction with the executor corp applying for the faction naturally it will then be a matter of internal debate as to which faction should be joined
i would support this if it meant alliances had to sign off their ability to take sov half and half wouldnt cut it either dedicate to faction warfare or dedicate to 00 its gamebreaking any other way
new discussion thread here
i support the expansion of mining
mining is fine you get to do it semiafk you get to pretty much warp in on your choice of belt and get a go at it and you can do in virtually every system in eve you are still making good money even if its not the best in the gamethis needs a boost why
because its a dead eny profession right now given its the most important profession in the game  almost everything needs minerals to be made   thats quite a shame
why is it a bad thing for what an investment of roughly 56 million skill points you get a viable profession that are you practically maxed out in you can do it afk you can do it with multiple accounts you can do it out in 00 and probably rival what an npcer can get out therea mission runner in a turret bs would just need that in gunnery alone even a cruise raven would take a decent while longer to max out your skills
only if you are using a macro script otherwise you need to be there to move it to the station change roids etcyou can mission with multiple accounts as well a cleaner and a fighteri lold nowhere near it and that was when i was out there with market prices dropping its probably gotton worsei have less then 15mil sp in combined guns drones and missiles and probably less then 3 mil of my sp total dedicated to fighting and tanking skills i can solo most of the lower lvl 4s in a passive phoon you were saying something amusing about comparative skillpoints i believe
what we should be asking for is exactly the opposite of that we need a class of mining ships that are durable enough to tank a small gang of pirates until help gets there
well then you must either be doing something wrong with the way that you mine or youre in the wrong region ive done mining in a handful of 00 regions and i can tell you that there are regions out there that have either poor belts poor mineral markets andor sovereignty instability which can make mining something that you hate conversely there are regions that are golden case in point ive recently moved to a 00 region new to me and mining couldnt be better in about two or three weeks ive made around 500m in profit spending about 1 to 2 hours a day at it im gonna guess that its probably a joke because there is little risk to high sec miners im willing to bet that very few high sec miners get suicide ganked and the only risk i see in high sec mining is losing mined ore out of a jetcan  if you jetcan minemany dont  
this thread was meant to be an experiment in so called democracy  was primarily due to the fact that there is a vocal minority who always whines about t2 bpos and a challenge to them to put their money where their mouth is i did not see those whiney alts here so i officially declare an experiment a success  more people want to whine and  and moan about the t2 bpos than they really want to find the truth or have a definitive answer

a light freighter would be nice around the 250k350k range
supported i dreaded training freighter just to move around 100000m3 of stuff and for a long time i just did multiple trips if the route was short enough im sure most others had to same feelingso yes a smaller cheaper freighter would be used a lot more then ccp realise i believe
posting in support
i support this ideai would love to see a smaller freighter but nothing more then 100000 m3 after all some freighter pilots do make money hauling large amounts of freight and wouldnt want to ruin it for them especially since they did train all the way up and buy a full sized freighter
enough to carry three bs at fully fitted rigged trained for the smaller freight would suffice for me
then allow me to clarify while the csm was originally conceived as a response it was eventually decided that ccps internal affairs department would handle such situations the idea of what the csm would be evolved into what it is today an entity wholly seperated from dealing with avoidance reporting or correction of any possible internal affair at ccpthus when i say the csm was not formed because of the banned individuals revelations it is entirely true and correct the csm which exists was not formed because of those revalations and when i say ccp did institute an internal investigation process largely because of incident kug publicized but this has little or nothing to do with the csm that too is self evidently true and correctkugs revelations may have provided a catalyst to form a type of csm but they have nothing to do with the csm which was actually formedwindjammer
like most players i will never know all the details and frankly it does look like  did us all a service by providing evidencebut lets be clear he did not make ccp look stupid he simply gathered facts now i have used google to locate lots of corp and alliance outofgame conversations and reading a publiclyavailable web site forum is not exactly hackingif ccp looked stupid it was not his fault i think ccp should no only unban him but make him a special representative to the csm and empower him to act like the players investigator  we need that   but future allegations of dev or gm misconductoh and before someone thinks i am in any way affilliated with pandemic legion i have seen some sniggs in the game and was podded once by them but i am not an alt in any way and normally not be sympathetic but this makes ccp look like gangstersccp hear the players serve the players not just take the players moneyi vote unban
there are many reasons why kugs should remain banned heres just onehe broke the rules of the game if ccp unbanned him it could be seen that they therefore endorse his methods which they obviously dont otherwise they wouldnt have banned himplus you dont seriously think kugustumen has stopped operating within eve just because his current accounts got banned at that time
what rulesconsidering he admits he doesnt play yeah i think thats a safe assumption to make
i wouldnt admit to playing again if i were him even if i werereally though the lengths that ccp took initially to bury the issue and telling people to foad if they didnt like it made them very much in the wrong the could have removed the illegal bpos at the time of discovery and it would have made it a much more moot pointthere should be a whistleblower provision given to kug as it has improved the game and made ccp get serious about game integrity
marisal that i can recollect the original ban on  was stated as being for posting rl info on another player half the posters were up in arms because sirmolle had also posted s rl info on these forums but was not banned given this was at the t20 ground zero time it was not a wise move by ccp they then clarified that it was the eula workload violation a horrifically vague catchall sirmolle stills seems to be playing id go looking around for the relevant linksthreads but my internet is behaving like an asthmatic sloth at the momentsince this took me about ten minutes to do  stoopid intarweb  are you against the unbanning of  do you think he was fairly treated do you support the idea of a banning review in general but not for him apologies if youve already stated your position trying to load pages right now on my connection would make baby jesus cry  
so is this a vote yes if you are in pandemic legiongoonswarm and friends and vote no if you are bob and friendsi tried to do a bit of research but couldnt immediatly find out what corp was  inthe topic refers generally to banned players but seems like it is very specific to just this guy
ohhhh all great ideas really also how about using the elite officers faction  maybe mordus or eom   to offer a faction command recon and logistics shiprequires less skills but not as robust as the empire faction ships maybe with some slight nerf to the commandreconlogistic bonusesit might offer people a way to experiement with these skills before they commit to seven weeks training or moreside comment to the reaction to my idea about a sisters of eve faction set i did want to specialize the soe faction to be good a survival but weak on defense all ships do not have to be pvp buffsoh and to the guy who suggested an ore faction yes they could have faction version of the mining barges  not exhumers though   to give advanced  exhumerlike   abilities to miners who lack all the skills more cargo space mining bonuses a little faster and a little stronger add a faction hauler from them too maybegood ideas all hope ccp is aware of thisstill great thread thanks to fallorn for a good idea
main thing i want is an even number of ships for each space ship command skill to help with i mean its not like one it matters much since i am working on getting ever races cruiser to 5 and i already have all their weapon systems up to cruiser lvl t2 i just want caldari amarr people to have the same footing as gellente minmatar and right now they have 3 less ships
the only way i would support this is if the skill queue was limited like only allowed up to level 3 skills or something
i agree with this this is a game and people should be need to actually play it to be able to progress since skills continue training even after your account is suspended or at least did so a few months ago   one could stop playing for a year and so some really long skill training maybe 35 months and then another one equal in length straight after and with out having to play the game
yes yes yes yes ive been muttering about this since oooh when i started playing in 2003
i support i guess but i am confusedso before this counsil thing the eve community wanted a response to  said topic   and now we have a way of saying we offically want a response to  said topic  
with people in fw posting in general topics  on coad we need a place where they can post about subjects on fw this will clean up the mess a littlefay
agreed

ccp is slow
corporation alliance and organization discussions  organization can equal militia this is the corporation and alliance version of the intergalactic summit all interaction on this forum is incharacter and between corporations or alliances not individual characters seems appropiate but no one wants to post there because of the crap that is posted in there blame your fellow players for this but it provides an ooc forum to discuss thingscorporations and alliances summit  change title to corporations alliances and militias summit this forum is for the discussion of ingame politics conflicts and other matters regarding player corporations alliances and organizations in eve news and press releases may also be posted here for information andor discussion incharacter forum to be honest a lot of igs stuff should probably go here but since igs is much more active the rp in the past has been small so i suspect people rather just put stuff where the most traffic is and it wasnt here this is a good candidate to be adopted for factional warfare materialintergalactic summit  aka igs    an incharacter roleplaying area for forum members to plot scheme forge alliances or declare intentions of war this is a regular discussion for people involved in factional warfare among other things its incharacter so some of the rabble is filtered out currently much discussion about fw is happening herefactional warfare is born in roleplay just like everything technically is try it out you may like it and find it makes the game a little more than just something like a shooter so no you do not need a forum but you may want to suggest changing descriptions of current forums in the meantime just bring up topics there
who posts seriously in caod though
too bad because you just barely missed the argument as to why your entire preemptive counterargument is null and voidno a lot more players wont become miners that will go mining veldspar in highsec simply because highsec missionrunning is a lot more profitable than mining veldspar even if only taking into account the raw bounties  if you add the rest of the things like lp loot and salvage it becomes insanely more profitable   and that in the situation where veldspar might as well just be the best thing to mine in highsec and lowsec combinedif you want to go that way then you have to seriously nerf the income potential of highsec missions and i seriously doubt you want to see the feedback to that change
this is the way to go they dont belong in high sec as i argued before its the missions that really break risk reward as they are not set in the correct security for the rats they involve
good luck even trying to suggest that in the original thread the hint at negligibly nerfing highsec mission runner mineral income  not even significantly altering actual isk income   was met with utter hostility now imagine that but from half the player base  if not more   and much strongerfeel free to post something to that extent and see the reactionsfor that reason sadly if ccp is to do that its as if they would shoot their own foot
i think it would make sense to move this issue a bit higher in priority list there has been a while now since devs last acknowledged the problem
it can be done with easeall melting results in a loss somewhere somehow doesnt even have to be a lot really but just enough that it combined with the increased size of modules makes looting mods for mission runners that much less attractive and time wastinguse the gentle hand method
you forgot to check the checkbox saying check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on and heres a typical sampling of minerals you get right now out of melted loot out of a small mission set  368 mil trit 14 mil pye 044k mex 972k iso 129k nocx 14k zyd 11k megaas you can see theres a heavy excess of isogen and megacyte in refined lootand its not just that like i said even completely ignoring lp loot and salvage you still make more iskhour running l4 missions than you make mining anything in both highsec or lowsec right now and if you add all the other things too it becomes a lot less interesting to mine only an option if you do it mostly afk
i wholeheartedly agree with opperhaps insurance should be sent to the character that got ganked rather than being completely voided
not everyone is able to afford or willing to pay for a second account to scout for theminstead of providing a second solution you insult us and then tell us what we already know thanks
scouting is just one solution there are others and im not here to tell you howas for not having second acc for scouting how about your work together with other mission runners and catch on to the multi player side of the gameyou all seem to be happy with voiding insurance for suicide ganks im telling you now the people who do it properly wont be put off at all by no insurance myself includedif they void insurance and people are still getting suicide ganked ill bet my left testicle youll be back here asking for nerfschanges whatever instead of solving a simple problem with a bit of common sense which is what you should be doing now tbh
supported all the way
i agree its to easy to gank in highsec
take away the insurance payout if you get concorded and that will help balance this play style a lot
stop trying to spin this you are trying to make it sound like people are worried about accidentally shooting something and getting concorded that is not anywhere close to what they are talking aboutthis is about the current system basically it is all reward it needs to be risk vs rewardcurrently there is zero risk at all
remove the skills let new players start with higher attributes and make implants the only thing one can do to speed up skill training
i would love this to be honest and yes i am 44 on nearly all of my learnings to be honest the older players do not comprehend how much of a showstopper this is for the newer players trial accounts only last two weeks which isnt enough time to even get all the learnings done when the first thing you tell someone as they join the game is that they have to train skills so they can train skills they instantly think that the rest of the game is going to be just like that mindnumbingly boringi believe someone said that 18 million isk isnt much at all you mustve started eve a looooong time ago cause that actually is a lot of isk for a newbie taking off the weeks of training time when they first start would go a long way towards putting people in the eve experience and having fun in it rather than feeling like they have to grind  and customer retention   i have something like 800k sp in learnings and i would be more than happy to give it up to have more people play the game some of the vets have gotten so obsessed with sp that they cant stand the thought of having 12 mil less so remove learnings and pin on that permanent sp

you can keep the band give me the exotic dancers im not actually referring to the ice products there is a player source of that what i would be interested in would be items like robotics oxygen uranium and the other station maintenance items things that would have a logical industrial tail before they got to us as pilots i would like to see the ability to control that logistics tail i think that npc demand and supply of goods and services is important i do not advocate dropping all npc supply just creating a parallel system for pilots to create the same types of maintenance related items currently only created and sold in empire and npc stations now i think that there are two issues with this o first the most delicate balancing act for a massive change like this would be balancing the economic price shocks if a system like what i am talking about is ever implemented there would need to be npc supply or the economy would go absolutely berserk cattle would cost 1000000 isk each  if demanded as food stocks on stations people would run missions just looking for that precious space cattle can   and oxygen or robotics could end up costing 10x or 50x its current rate which would unbalance pos supplies and costs all over eve which effects moon minerals then reactions and t2 parts and then everything advanced o second developing then seeding the system and its associated resources both the new factories parts bpos skills and the physical resources available on orbital bodies are going to probably be a chore on par with all three of the revelations trinity expansions some remedies for this could be to make land leases available on empire and lowsec worlds  the more secure the higher the price   similar to station offices or charged as extras to offices in local npc stations maintaining npc supply would be inline with story line after all if i was ceo of the caldari navy  or insert your favorite   i would want to have someone in my faction involved in producing the fuels i need to run my stations adding a level of station demand for maintenance commodities could also be a nice way to start traders with some basics early in their careers the possibilities are immense with something like this taark
a lot of good thoughts here
i disagree on exploration complexes they are fine in how long it takes to find them i dont want the exploration profession turned into a sideshow that everyone has an alt for simply because they are everywhere and easy to find i like the idea of someone having to dedicate the sp to get exploration skills and then dedicate chunks of time into that gameplay goal to make money at it im all for normal missions or cosmos missions becoming easy to find and do for groups im not okay with exploration missions becoming easy to find for groups by their very nature they should be hard to find it wouldnt be called exploration if they were in the sort of abundance youre talking about
i used 2 characters of minebut they are on different accounts
i brought this up before and could not find it again it mainly met with approval1   jump clone vat pos array as its name suggests is a pos deployable array2   it comes in various sizes  maybe from 5 to 25 slot versions3   it will be reasonably expensive to purchase  say about 100 million isk for the smallest version4   it will require a substantial amount of cpu and power to be online5   it will consume an additional fuel to further increase logistical costs biogel6   it can be used by any corporate member  maybe alliance as well  7   in effect it will function like a capital clone vat array but fixed in one place without the need for the whole hassle of having the capital pilot onlineplease see this post here in the ideas section for more details
sure i like it but be prepared for the outcry of those who would say that it is giving too much to 00 alliances and of those who say it is giving too much to empire pos carebears anyway no pleasing all but i like the idea and it is easily implemented
video is renedered by client not server lag is excess for lezines of devs how can you reneder char portreits in game but not custom logos at ships  zomg laggorz
such a nice idea to have alliancecorp logos on ships   and all the guys that keep posting lag lag lag please read what other people have told you you wont feel a different at all
signed for corpalliance logos on shipspaintjobs is a more complex issue i would only support it if they consisted of limited themes that remained distuinguishable from t1 and t2 so caldari ships get a set of themes for their t1 ships and then each t2 npc company  like viziam carthum core complexion thukker mix etc   get a set of themes for its t2 shipsthis would therefore remove not only confusion between t1 and t2 ships and also between t2 variants of the ship but would also ensure that all the limited themes remained inside the spirit of the gamefaction ships should probably remain unchangeable in this regard
alliance logos on ships would add zero lag the logos already exist as icons in your eve install and the client must already know the alliance of a shippilot to draw the ticker in space on the overview for standings etc100 signed and theres no reason not to have itcorp logos would have to be renderedcached which might take a few milliseconds but thats no excuse not to do something
greetingsi would like to see the option of other players entering your ship lets say a carrier or other ships riding along as passengers or deployable teammembers for tactical operationsnot unlike the galaxy transportships as done in planetsidethose riding along cant do anything beside sitting either in their ship in the hangar or sitting in an capsule in the hangar and are subject to instakill if they fail to launch or exit during an attack for whatever reason that pops the carrier make carriers more carrierlike if you willwould expand the playing experience and purpose for ships like carriers and similar to have fellow corp members or other people onboard for tactical workim sure you can imagine the coolnessfactor of launching your frig from a carrier in some enemy territory in order to conduct havoc or tactical maneuverskuzya
motherships effectively provide this functionality already through the clone vat bay also please note the existence of the features and ideas discussion forum
not just on the forums but ingame there are spaces where the alliance youre in should show but are blank if your corp is in fwjust sayin
this would be handy if theyre introducing a separate fw forum tbh
the only issue here is that there is also discussion of allowing alliance members to join factional warfare the mechanics of that are being discussed so its not entirely clear how that may happen if it happens at allhowever i agree that there should be some sort of ingame indicator similar to that of the alliance indicator if there is not already
aint that the truth
agreed a million times over its like everyone in the story department copypastad the whole let us all unite idea over everythingi wonder if the pirate factions will unite against the empires

yeah we could at least then have a sticky with a list of topics already discussed that would be the easiest way to do it and check it
a stickied list would be nice
serenity steele already has the index topic which has icons for issues which are proposedvoted on it is a bit difficult to scan through to see just topics which have been discussed already but then again it is recommended that people visit that index regularlyill support the issue because its important that the csm have a strong working system
ive just ranted about this in another thread so 1   
if a player corp is in a fw corp they should not be allowed to war dec or be decced by another corp or allianceit defeats the purpose of fw completly and does not allow full immersion into pvp as ccp claimsccp has stated that alliances especially cannot join fw so they should not be allowed to war dec those already in fw also corps within fw should not be able to war dec corps or alliances at all as that also defeats the general purpose of having fwdoing this will not keep the corps in fw safe as they have each other to deal with but will even the playing field and not allow others to take advantage
massively exploitable sign up with the caldari militia keep your members out of gallente and minmatar space and you are a   immune to wardecs and b   at no risk from enemy militia factions effectively immune to everything except suicide ganks
no way thered be absolutely no threat or risk for corps this way being in your militias high sec means you pretty much safe the navy npcs will go to great strides in keeping you alive
corps in fw are just letting their corp fight for a certain faction theres no reason why they shouldnt be able to still act as an independant entity with their own decs
ccps art team should listen to tis playerbase that also works in the industry for sure we hav3e ideas for their art team and im sure they would love to hear him

first up im not a cap pilot i dont ever want to be a cap pilot and i generally dislike the entire idea of fleet ops which need cap warfare as it pertains to my playstyle i can understand how others would find them interesting and before anyone cries foul you couldnt possibly make an informed opinion on them ive never been shot either but ive taken enough physics and biology to understand the mechanics of it and know its something id rather not do and as cap discussions are something you cannot visit the forum ever and not read about id like to think between what ive read and a very healthy bs detector that i know enough about caps to make a somewhat informed opinion on them as well so lets go through the ops points1 titan overabundancei do not see the number of titans as an issue instead i see the role that titans are currently setup to employ as the issue the ddd is the second most illconceived thing ccp has put into the game right after poss being linked to sovereignty the tank on the thing is laughably out of scale for its mass when compared with any other ship class in the game and its lack of any true damage or support potential outside of the ddd simply shouldnt be allowed the amount of poor planning in how they relate to cynojammers and lag on gate in of large assault fleets is simply staggering so how to fix to be honest as long as the ddd and cynojammers exist at the same time titans will be busted recommendation nerf cyno jammers and nerf damage on the ddd at the same time give the thing a tank worth having and implement some sort of new mechanic which makes it more worthwhile to leave a titan in a fight to possibly have it go boom than it is to run and wait for ddd to recycle my recommended nerf to cyno jammers is to make the things easily destroyed by small surgical strike teams of blackops groups itll give also give blackop and scout pilots a crucial role to fill
2 carrier changes  helping find a new role for carriers that people will likemake a carrier an actual carrier change how hotdrops work you cannot hotdrop anything smaller than a capital so if you want to bring non capital support ships youre going to need a lot of carriers and carriers are going to have to be reworked to allow it give carriers a true repair yard and docking system a ship can dock with the carrier and the carrier pilot can then put a ship or two into repair status repairing inside a carrier will bring a ship back to near full status requires spare parts ships not being repaired can undock whenever the pilot of said ship feels like it ships inside repair bay cannot any ship inside the carrier when it goes also goes between managing modules cap repair bays and fighters carrier pilots should hopefully be franticly clicking nonstop if implemented right theyll become the backbone of the fleet3 hotdrops and what can be done about themsee carriers that alone should take a lot of the sting out of hotdrops since youll be unable to just willy nilly bring whatever you want to the engagement but instead must manage docking space for anything beyond capitals that you want to bring4 the divide between veterans and new playersi also dont see this as a problem new players have their place same as old i see the issue instead with current mechanics of fleet ops being completely based around gate camps and pos warfare ccps idea to bring sovereignty in line with faction warfares objective based system of system ownership should by itself go a long way toward smoothing out the current issues with this
5 the stratification between powergamers and more casual playersdont even try to solve this issue power gamers drive the game forward if you try to make the impact power gamers can have on an engagement less in the end youll only accomplish two things one giving casual players less to strive for and two dumbing the game down you simply cannot have your cake and eat it too on this point oh you can try but the game that has most got the mixture of hardcore and casual right already exists its called world of warcraft and i dont want to see eve become that the only thing ill really give you toward evening the playing field between casual players and power gamers is the new player experience sucks not just a little but sucks on the scale of galactic blackholes sucks fix it to where after finishing an expanded tutorial that casual gamers have an idea of the different roles they could possibly fill in eve and basic understanding of how they work so new players have an idea of where they want to spend their skill points and itll go a long way toward helping casual players actually make a meaningful contribution to the game the new player experience is a particular pet peive of mine old players can say its better than when they started but the amount of content and possible paths of advancement since eve started has raised at an exponential rate while tools to help players cope with all this content has largely remained stagnant its a freakn disgrace that a triple a game gives people so little in the way of tools to make informed decisions6 effects on 00 sovereignty since starbase warfare 20ccp is already looking at getting rid of it i recommend not even discussing pos warfare and how it currently stands but instead looking into ways to implement a highly modified version of factional warfare for system control that most of us can agree isnt completely bat crazy at the same time dreads need a very large look at and revision in how theyll work once poss arent of the monumental importance that they are now
7 revisiting new anticapital features and ships such as the heavy interdictordont nerf capitals at least not in the classical sense of nerf they should always have their place in standup fights instead find ways to make standup fights less important have control of sovereignty require things capitals just cannot do pilot through small openings to get to a control point and pick up an item timed events in which the mass and alignment speed of a capital just makes it near impossible for them to be able to enter and many many more capitals wont be nerfed and fleets will have to bring well balanced forces if they want to control a system at the same time do not completely get rid of the idea of standup fights they should still happen and exist for control of a system but instead they should be more of a focus event while all the other things required to flip the system take place on different grids inside the systemimbalances within capital ship classes themselves  eg underpowered minmatar capitals  this is where my knowledge of capital class ships simply leaves me as useless i understand the theory behind it all but specifics i cant help you with
you are mistaken if a csm representative makes a presentation at a csmccp meeting that representative is speaking because hisher presentation has the approval of the majority of the csm as such heshe is presenting to ccp on behalf of the csm and the csms constituencywhile the views heshe expresses during the presentaion may indeed be hisher own they are still expressed on behalf of the csm only in the discussion which follows a presentation may hisher statements be construed as hisher own and not a representation of the csms desires andor the desires of the subscriber basewindjammer
could a solution perhaps be1 remove ships innate drone bandwidth stat  for subcapital ships at any rate  2 change the drone control unit so that it can be fitted to any ship and now generates 25mbitsec  or something   of bandwithresult any ship  with a drone bay   can still field drones but as it needs to sacrifice a highslot in order to do so it becomes more of a considered loadout issue as opposed to just yeah and of course ill chuck in a few hammerhead iis on top
thats the main thing going for drones to be able to expand the tactical options in various shipsspecialized drone ships have a lot going for them what other ship weapon system gets up to a 50 bonus to damage with a single ship bonus ironically a t2 hornet launched by a ship w a drone bonus becomes the improved and more powerful drone you want
fantastic idea now apply it to reality drake oh wait i just have that utility slot 25 m3 of drones perfectdominix 5 high slots to usse 125 m3 of drones yai for 1 gunraven 2 utility 50 m3  perfectmyrmidion 4 slots for the 100 m3and so on it will help wonderfully non drone ships as they could use a utility slot to get 25 m3 of drones while it will nerf dedicated drone ships that would use 45 high slots to use the drones no wonder you will be suggesting a similar broken idea you are caldari little experience in drone ships
of course you can just make them take more bandwidth andor require more drone skills andor require a new moduleeveryone and his dog having access to the existing drones is one of the few things keeping nanoships in check but nothing stops anyone designing new alternate types of drones with different fitting requirements
drones have hit the nerf bat to many times latly leave them alone last thing i need is even less dps on my myrmidon bc you want to use up all my highslots for fricking dcus no supported not even close
im not putting this forward as a completely finished idea 25mbitsec is a number i grabbed out of the air and actual drone ships could retain a degree of innate bandwidth andor receive a bonus to control unit effectivenessyup
many topics which belong in the features and ideas discussion forum are creeping into the assembly hall forum probably because there is a misconception that developers are more likely to read content in this forum than that of the features and ideas discussion forumfood for thoughtwhat are some guidelines we can establish are these guidelines already established if so are they enoughis it necessary to change the description of these forums or make some sort of statementshould developers be more active in displaying that they watch the features and ideas discussion forumdo developers really watch that forum enoughshould the csm do something  similar to its issues index   to clean this forum of unwanted threads
i think basically yes i have crossposted from the ideas forum because there appears to be no sign that the forum is looked at and at least in this forum if the idea is good enough the csm will take it and plonk it in front of the devs might take a bit longer to get there but if youre passionate about your idea you dont mind that there is also no control in the ideas forum  the same ideas get posted over and over again as new posts quickly pushing down other potentially newer and better ideas and there seems to be much less traffic in that forum than hereso all in all the csm forum seems to me to be a far better place to post new ideas in than the ideas forumi think a forum without content moderation  this applies to both the ideas section and csm forums   is inherently the wrong way to administer this unfortunately i think the only solution is pretty heavy moderation  where an issue only has one thread and the moderator s   move all new posts pertaining to that issue into that thread therefore removing forum clutter hopefully a better brain than mine can come up with a better solution  im against heavyhanded moderation on general principles but i cant think of better solutionsthe process has not quite gone full circle yet though  maybe once the full details of the iceland meeting are public there will be a clean up of this forum and the threads looked at moved elsewhere  maybe into the now nonexistent proclamations forum   a summary given of what is being done and all new threads on the subject referred to it and locked down in herei suspect this is unlikely though
i suspect that because developers are rarely seen posting in the features and ideas discussion forum players think it is not watched the unruliness of the forum also contributes to thisthe assembly hall is getting better but i think it really comes down to people setting an example rather than forced moderation at least for nowmy personal proposal is that the csm create some sort of stronger guidelines to prevent this from happening integrate it into another function of the csm like i see ideas of rulebooks and whatnot being thrown around i just want to make sure this is a consideration also because it involves the features and ideas discussion forum it may involve action by ccp  hopefully nothing dramatic a few forum posts or a devblog on featuresideas   and therefore the csm may want to deal with ccp themselves
on the first page alone these are some topics i see that do not need to be hereidea some ships should be able to carry other playersidea paintjobs with corp and alliance logos on shipsjump clone vat pos arraylast wills and testamentsidea account timer thingy visionidea   pirate faction shipsidea small freighter idea custom paint for shipslots of these are in the commonly proposed ideas thread in features and ideas discussion
anyone else notice how many topics on the features and ideas forums are also going on the assembly hall forumswhats the point in making two forums for the same purpose of voicing opinions for change and why bother making assembly hall if theyll pay it as much attention as they have these threads
fyp
ideallybut from the looks of both pages people are just having to fight the same arguments and raise the same points twiceits bad enough that people say nerf titans or lets have wasd controls weekly but having two forums with the same repeating topics will not end wellmay just be me but id suggest that csm and ccp both pay more attention to one and get rid of the other completely then people can make their suggestions once instead of raising the same topics again and again in the hopes someone will eventually like it dont ask your mom and then ask your dad when she says no that sort of thingespecially since csm are more involved over here they can be first to say thats already been discussed and heres the link to continue whereas features and ideas is just pages and pages of the same topics nothing will get ironed out when you have to repeat the same rhetoric weekly
i agree 100 hence why i created this as an issuedont mean to steal your thunder or anything just thought id try to keep everything consolidated

after flying a typhoon with an auto cannon and cruise combo  should have gone with torps in hind sight   i must not support this with basic skills in gunnery  large obviously   you can do quite large dps there is a decent falloff and the things take no capas an exclusive auto cannon user even i can not support this
it has come to my attention that in the event of an unforseen accident or natural death  and we have player who are in the armed forces   a ceo should be able to set a minimum number of days of inactivity on hisher account and if there is no action then a will is invoked and the ceo position passes to a preselected person i realize there is an option for voting in a new ceo but i feel this would be a realistic addition to a ceos powers shares owned by the ceo would not go unused and funds split by shareholders would not go to a unused account i think a last will and testament should be available to every player if not just the ceos
interesting idea how about if all items after predetermined time were put to a contract for an executor and an evemail with the will instructions being mailed to that person if left untouched for say 2 weeks it passes to the next executor and so on this idea could be greatly expanded on however it is one way that ccp can recover excessive game isk by attrition
ill have to think about a few ways of exploiting this which i see at least two at the moment but interesting idea nonetheless
that kind of depends on how much they are representing the posting public i guess
the it in charge of the chair should not be able to move topics thats what posting would do you post in a topic it goes to the top my problem with this is that the forums that ccp uses are outdated and awful if they updated to something decent and had a voting option on it they could vote in the thread for the issue and have it public so people can see what they voted this would mean things could be done without having to have a chat meeting every week and if they did the chat meeting it could be about discussions that are not in threads or real time discussion about a topic in a thread

yeah ok i know that it is there but apart from paying for my accounts i hardly visit these forums and i dont think many people do
this is one of my first topics raised so here gos why should we include custom paintwe should include cutom paint because it could give the chance for the large corps and alliances to have a look that makes it easyer to identify them when the warp in pirate corps could use them to strike fear into there prey while large well known corps could use it in the same way a fleet does to advertise there power and respectshould corps and alliances be able to protect there custom schemeyes this is to stop players who are not a member of that corp to steal there paint job and pose as another corp to prevent annoyance when you create your own only to discover that its is aready being used a list should be avalible on what schemes are in use and who owns itshould npc paint work be avalible for useyes but under certain circumstances i propose that npc paint work should only be avalible to those who have a high enough standing with that corp eg a standing of 2 with the caldari navy grants you the right to use the paint workfor those in fw each milita should have its own paint work that is made avalible to the player upon joining that militaif you support this idea click support if there is anything that you feel could improve this idea please dont hesitate to suggest it
while a possibly interesting suggestion i think you should discuss possible negative effects  like lag   in your proposal
similar thread already underway
it wont effect lag  lag is server side  models are renedered client side
setting aside wether the cms is a failure or not id rather wait ta little longer before dismissing it completley i would like to point out that seeing as 80 of the eve population consists of empire dwelling carebears doesnt it make sense therfore that 80 of an elected democratic body representing the playerbase is carebear ive never understood why 00 pllyares are so full of themseleves that they see themselves as superior and more important than the overwhealming majority of non 00 players
because 00 is filled with narcissistic sycophants with a side order of sociopathy not all of them are bad some of them are regular joes and fun to talk to but only people with too much free time and a yin for having their opinion vilified no matter how rightminded they think it is post on forums of which were all part of that last group
to moderate the meetings the company hired agust h ingthorsson director of the research liaison office at the university of iceland and a professional moderator with experience in the halls of european power in brussels he seemed to come away impressedi have to tell you that i have been involved in eu meetings where the participants were not as prepared and professional as what weve seen here he said referring to the european union these players have approached this meeting with what seems like real understanding of their roles they are not just fighting for their particular interests but seem to be very socially responsible in wanting to represent all the players of eve perhaps some realworld politicians could learn from them

tbh anything like this would be amazing since mining has not gotten any love for a very very long time personally im a big fan of the idea that nyphur had a while back  here   but all of these are entirely different from that and are entirely new some of these ideas break away from traditional mining which is awesome a combination of nyphurs for modifying traditional mining and this for adding entirely new content would be absolutely amazing however i would like to note that i dont like the multiore asteroids idea i like being able to choose what i mine and i perfer nyphurs idea for removal of static belts over yours however you both were going in the right direction so kudos for thatalso i would like to give a big laugh at the macrominers since they would have to modify their macros in highsec to avoid the nearworthless 5 arkonor also i dont think that any mercoxit in high or low sec would be good keep it in 00in short yes
i support the expansion of mininghowever i would not like to see static belt locations done away with entirely maybe simply adding more variety to them would be more interesting  example they dont all have to be halfmooncircle shaped and at the same height    y  axis point  
definitely support more things for mining just dont take away
just wanting to point out we do have this thread here
bunch of people think the helios with an imicus hull is ugly ccp prolly wont change it back or stick somthing new on so black maybe only change they will make doesnt look so bad as a black ship
well i think it is a good start for csm lets see where it leads us
i
so i was listening to eve radio and hear you guys talking about new ideas like different 00 endgamewhere stationary 00 dwelling might be bypassed with the ability to have mobile stations of sorts im indifferent fine with me but it seems the csm people are for thisbut im now remembering the discussion about an exploration ship that can both explore as well as tank and gank the exploration sites right now you need at least 2 ships and i believe you csm people called the request lazyjeez hows about opening those big minds of yours and being considerate to the rest of eve youre for new styles of play that youre interested in but against solo exploration as a viable playstylewhats more ironic is that i believe jade used space vikings as a description for a mobile station to give the idea of a nomad space societywhat about solo explorers having to park our covops then go pick up our pilgrims  however ing many jumps away they are   and then go complete the site hows that for a tetheralls we want is a combat recon cruiser with a large cargohold and bonus to exploration probe times is that too freaking much to ask for im sure it would ruin eve
everyone has their own opinions both in game and out of game who cares if any particular board member has ingame issues with another board member or their corporation as long as they are capable and willing to look past their ingame political affluences to achieve the greater good for all of the eve players i have no issuedid you guys mention the pilgrim to the devs do they know this ship exists lolps goons suck
jade constantfail
disclaimer i do not disapprove of anyone having opinions god knows i have my own thoughts on bob i do however object to letting opinions impact the job one is supposed to dofor one i agree that this issue is a serious one for a simple reasonthe csm is supposed to benefit the whole of eve if a csm member deems it right to ignore the concerns of eve players not based on the merit of the concerns but on who they are then they are quite simply failing utterly at what theyre supposed to do and have no business in such a position  speaking personally ive got absolutely no interest answering goonie concerns or questions at this point in the process  however as this thread is quite old now and jade has actually been forced to meet goons the big question is has your opinion changed jade are you now willing to act along the lines you are supposed to or do you still think letting prejudice rule over reason is fine
thats another horrible analogy what the analogy should be isdo you think that ban kimoon  the current secretarygeneral of the un   uses his position to attempt to bring these different sides together in an attempt to help or does he use this position to ignore others and push his personal agenda whats more important is that jades chair will only exist for so long but we can keep putting goons in the csm until we all go play another game
well i think it is a good start for csm lets see where it leads us
i
i am not sure how this interview surprised anyoneall it is is validation of the attitude we already knew ccp had people have been screaming for fixes to the game for years yet we still get stuff like faction warfare shoved down our throatfrom the top down ccp has no concept of fixing whats broken from their ceo to their designers they honestly think focusing on the big picture and continuing to build on a buggy and broken foundation is going to get them a winner in the endreally when you think about it the lag issue is a microcosm of what ccp is about people have been complaining about the lag issues for a while and rather than take the straight forward approach to fixing it  rebuilding eve to have a proper network engine   they feed us grand plans about infiniband and clearing space trash they ignore the fact that none of it will matter if the very core of the networking engine isnt fixedat some point you just throw up your hands and go welp because its obvious ccp isnt listening
fixed
having experience with how to be interviewed for a large corp i must say that this was a pretty crappy interviewim disappointed the first response was wow what a stupid thing to bring up vs wow we didnt know how badly the ui bothered our player baseconsidering that it was brought up as an issue might say oh this is hosed maybe we should fix it quick because thats easy vs you dumb customers you brought up something simpleits not simple to a lot of us if you feel it is simple and dont want to work on it thats fine dont insult your player base by calling them stupid for bringing something up though
that interview with hammerhead was psyduck the obvious question of why ccp thought the csm would bring grand design to them arises  were ccp not paying attention to what the csm were doing or did they not notice that the bulk of their efforts so far are focused on fixing and balancingon the other hand it was ludicrous to see hammerhead extol the virtues of transparency in a game with little to no documentation from the makers every piece of documentation i use is playermade this game has been going for years now  whats the hold up ambulation jovians hell everyone already knows about the variety of answers you can get from different gms on the same questionwhat is so hard about planning coding and releasing a patch that fixes say the 25 most annoying things in this game  yers apart from lag   how long should that take i dont see any player whining what no new content aahhhgrhrhrhghghfsdja i buy a car i expect it to work if not i bring it back and get one that works properly to my mind the player base is far too accepting of all the niggly irritations when they should be dealt with
problem is even with all of the bugs and issues it takes a lot to make someone ragequit every one of us has had frustrations with the game working as ccp intended  tm   but not up to player expectations but this is balanced by the times when the game has worked well enough that the shiny awesome creation it can be has come through we keep on playing hoping that we will see the shiny again and it comes along often enough to keep us hookedadd into this the documented addictive nature of this kind of game  i have experienced this myself with everquest as well as seen it in others with wow   and i can understand why the developers are lazy to do anything to fix the little things simply they dont need to because saps that we are we keep on playing anywayedit  and it doesnt help when the interviewee plainly knows this and quite arrogantly says theres no need to work on the small things and helps it even less when the interviewer is such a suck up that he may as well be on ccps payroll
i always assumed that eve tv was closed because the people on it were egotistical morons who ran it like a joke
because it  abolish learning skills   is on the goonswarm wish list you can also see the trend of this wish expressed in bane gloriuss suggestion of reducing the time it takes to learn the skills for capital ships the trend is goonswarm would like to significantly reduce the training times in eve and by doing so reduce the advantage of older players over younger playersoh and incidentally make the goonswarm alliance that much more powerful that much more quicklythere are two ways an issue may be brought up for an escalation vote in a csm meeting one it can get more than 40 approval  thumbs up   posts in a thread in the assembly area of the csm forums or two it can be taken up by a member of the csm who finds it worthy regardless of how many approval posts were made or lack thereofif the majority of csm representatives vote to escalate the issue then it is assigned an owner and presented to ccp by the owner at a csmccp meeting because the minutes from csm meetings 4 and 5 have yet to be posted by ccp or serenity its difficult to see the exact method used to get this issue on the agenda for the ccp meeting however as bane is the owner of the issue it seems likely that he brought the issue to the csm meeting and asked for a vote to escalate bane has said goonswarm depends upon new players and he feels these new players he sees are turned away by having to take the time to train the learning skills further he feels its virtually a requirement to train learning skills to high levels thus he seeks to eliminate learning skillsyou can see from the posts on the topic and from speaking to other players in eve that goonswarms view is not shared by most of eve but it nevertheless made it to the ccp meeting cant wait to see those csm meeting minutes posted as well as the csmccp meeting minuteswindjammer

it is difficult for me to give emphatic support as i have never flown a combat capital of any stripe however i have chosen not to partially because of the issues with the minnie capitals particularly the nagl that i have read about and verified as best as i can through eftquickfitspreadsheets as such i certainly support a review and likely some level of boost in particular the pressing need to use fitting modules make standard fittings work should be addressedotoh from a lore perspective i think that the minmatar capitals should remain weaker overall the minmatar have only been free of the amarr for 125 years now and as such all of our ship designs are at most a couple of centuries old by contrast the other races have been working on their ship designs for millenia for example khanid hijacked an amarr titan 600 years ago almost half a millenia before we gained our freedom while our engineers may be just as good and knowledgeable we still have to catch up on refining our designsdesign principles additionally our racial trademark tactics are hitandrun rather than giant sieges this is supported ingame by the excellent smaller ships it would not be supported by having excellent massive sitandsiege ships thus i would mostly support an incremental rather than a substantial improvementin fact while it is far too late for such a drastic change i think that the existing minmatar dread is completely out of line with our war philosophy and experience i would have thought that it should be small and agile perhaps having only two turrets and no missiles it should make up for what it loses in siege damage by being far more capable at dealing with smaller ships  supplanting the moros in this primacy   with substantially better locking and align times possibly tracking bonuses and a reduced siege cycle time  with reduced strontium use per cycle so that the strontiumtime remains constant   so that they can cut and run far more easily something of that sort would make sense for the kind of war we fought against the amarr for freedom and continue to fight nowthat latter might still be an option for making the nagl more viable without changing the unenviable split bonuses and slot issues give it a 50 drop in cycle length and a proportional 50 drop in strontium use per cycle it would cost the same per unit time to siege and the cycles would remain calibrated with the rest of the fleet but it would give the nagl more of the hitandrun style while also allowing more chances to break out of siege mode to get remote repped this would alleviate some of the issues with getting called primary while being a bit in tune with the minmatar racial flavor someone might even get some mileage out of an allnagl fast strike fleet its just a thought  i dont mean to hijack the thread with too many leftfield ideas   
you bring up good points however look at the maelstrom and the hurricane we are making advances and the nag is simply a much larger typhoon whereas the phoon requires twice or arguably three times the skills required to make it as effective as other race bs the nag also requires twice the weapons training of other bs and is still subpar im going to keep saying this why is it assumed minmatar players have to train more skills to be competitive
i dont understand your gaming the system logic there are very few individual skill trainings that take much more than a month the vast majority of them take much less so in order to get the same training as an active player the inactive player must resubcribe periodically to switch out skills paying practically as much as the active player only the inactive player gets much less from the game overall they get no isk few or no material assets and no standing increases i dont really see anything wrong with that situation
im against this the thing which has kept me  and my multiple accounts   as a subscriber has been the ability to trail behind everyone else during the rough monthssure you can train up battleship v etc but so what i can understand the rp thing but sp affects only me even those who  full disclosure ive tried to do this   try and cheat the system via alt training have to go through a lot of pain to do it getting all the timing right and stuff just not worth itplayers trying to get ahead using this method are paying for more resources while using less it reminds me of the isp model under that model youd be the p2p user  i assume that because youre a trader you constantly refresh market make changes to the db query the db etc to stay ahead   while those guys are the sure ill pay for broadband then use it only for email and im eve gets to keep some players around which it otherwise wouldnt and ccp has more income for infrastructureusing this method ive trained covert ops v battleships v and maybe some learning skills to v doesnt mean i can just come back and buy a battleship or covert op doesnt mean i have any experience or skill with the ship if your proposal came to pass guys like me would be sitting at 4mil if we even hung around depressed that yesterdays dread is todays cruiser as long as resources do not accumulate the player has very few advantages so he saved a few irl dollarswho cares isnt that what power2 is anywayi suggest the following alterationdisable rp accumulationdisable all market orders
i was going on and reading and nodding and agreeing with the post made by vuxacha and then the quoted text came into view at the moment i am having an interesting sensation in my left arm i think its a heart attack
you know for each of those characters you want to farm data cores with you need 100m in skill and a lvl5 standing to the corp you want the cores from offen 2 corps if you want good data cores on all agentsand this is alot of work to setup to make good money from it so if someone whants to do this then good on em anyone can do it so since you cant afford or have the time or what ever to do it dont mean it should be nerfed
lol dont panic i was just goading shar cos he is a trader and i suspect that he must have at least 1 account he pays for with isk  something considered highly unfair in most mmos   that was gonna be my opening but after seeing how well this forum operates i guess its not nice to trolleven if some person guy is suggesting a change that would throw me out of the game as well as the hundreds of interesting adults ive met here ive never played a game with so many vets and 20yos i suspect that the light pressure for skill levelling and the single node  so you never come back to find everyone has switched serverssides   environment are the reasoni also do not like the fact that it appears the csm will be used for the purpose of people grabbing their pitch forks and going on their own vendettas or simply trying to buff their own selves up  i left some market orders up before i left last ouch remember how much trit used to cost yeh
nothis is part of eves uniqueness and something that makes the game attractive to players who may wish to quit paying yet come back laterbad idea
why should ccp support the interests of people who arent paying at the expense of those who areeliminating absentee skill training would set the stage for skill training ques something most active players would like to see if ccp were to institute a skill que under current conditions absentee players would be able to set up long ques and train without paying for months this is and would playing for freeaccumulating research points to purchase datacores while absent from eve and not paying is just nuts its like setting a mining script to run while you take off for months ccp is against scripted  afk   mining or farming so why should they continue to allow the accumulation of resources by someone who isnt even paying to be active when these resources hit the market place they impact the economy and affect active players who are payingwant to play then payregardswindjammer
hi allhere is the excuse for ccp to take down rp and sp on inactive accounts i am sure that they will take note from this nice topic that will let they earn more money but will not even try to read anything about the topic related to 30 60 and 90 days gtc since it would hurt their incomeso keep with those things to make eve a more efficient machine to earn money ccp will love u allone thing this kind of training is not an abuse its just the way it was designed its like the rules of conduct or the procedure to setup a pos in space everyone knows how to do it and accept it the bad thing comes once someone decides to change it hurting people that likes this rulei like this game and i like the offline training its is one of the reasons because of i play it why dont u use your time playing and not giving ccp excuses to earn more moneyhave fun in evecrashregisteronline
helloa few thingsdid u ever raised a topic related to this matter to take note of the common thoughts of the people before using your privileged positiondo u use your privileged position often in your rl to achieve personal enhancements or to impose your own ideasthankx
why is it mutually exclusive you could easily control the rules of the queue to prevent abuse to set up long trains to take advantage of the current situation you have to spend a bunch of time preparing some big vs  with learning and implants there arent many   it a huge pain in the neck if youre unable to afford your account every month you can do it but it doesnt do more than save a few dollars everyone else will continue to train and earn iski mentioned in my last post that people like that support the habits of the power gamers because they pay to setup their long trains and probably use almost no server resources to do so the benefits do not end there these people are spending isk  buying skillbooks etc   whilst earning almost nothing that means theyre also acting as isk sinksthis would be a change that would cause an exodus from eve how does that benefit us thered be no lag reduction because theyre already not using resources my sp wouldnt suddenly be worth more by even a measurable fraction because most trains are not big ass v trains theyre medium ass vi still agree with the removal of rp accumulation however ive already mentioned in this thread that market orders persist in addition to that share dividends continue to go outpassive progression would be so hard to stamp out meanwhile games like wow give rested status to characters a feature that earlier mmos didnt possess why because penalising people for not playing is not the same as encouraging them to play
no bad idea not supportedthis is within the game rules and theres nothing illegal about it what people do with their accounts in none of your business no one is preventing you from doing the same thing its not abuse its taking advantage of your optionsthe people who use the time during account inactivity to research stuff will off course use that to get isk or rp but thats good these people will flood the game with cheaper abundant bpos bpcs items and ships this will in turn drive prices down on stuff and maybe even somehow drive the prices down on characters and time cardsgiven the recent time card price hikes some people need every available resource at hand to be able to make enough isk every two months this is just one more way to do so me and many other people have been asking ccp for a long time now to give us an option of an extended skill queue so that we can continue training skills when we are away we ask this because we are unable to renew our subscription as often as we used to so at least we should have the option to keep training our skillsresearching stuff off course there are people who have other reasons to ask for this new option but either way this is an important issuethen you come along and ask that even our existing option to finish our skill in training after account expires be removed you gotta be jokingbut dont worry ccp wont listen to you they need people like me to keep playing the game even if i dont renew my subscription as often as i used to its still money to them even if its less money therefore im sure they will at least keep the existing options if not give us the extended queuelook man i respect you you helped me when i was a total newb and you were nice to me i will always remember that i also respect your opinion and in some small way you could be right from where you stand but please leave this issue alone consider how this would impact other people who play this game on the budget who are you to tell them they can no longer do so
i am happy to announce the great achievements that ccp has made with my subscriptions1 year ago i was a 5 accounts player 2 mains ones and 3 alters raising skills focused in capital shipsthen our friend ccp zulupark had the nice idea of nerfing the carriers because they should be used in another way well in my opinion it was just a real bad thing since as in any contract u cant sell a house with 4 rooms and 300 m2 in total and after 3 months say that the rooms are just 1 and 30 m2another nice idea of zulupark was lowering the unused explosive resistance of shields in a called unnerfing patch how ironicmy alters lost a lot of their capabilities and all the isk i spent in skills and gtc for their creation gone into a total waste of timei havent acivated those 3 accounts since dec 2007then here they are again with another great idea  i suppose from the nice mind of zulupark   letUFFFDs increase de income from the game and lower the number of connections since the game is saturated how can we do it without telling what do we want to dohere is the answer since many europeans are used to buy gtc in dolars to get the benefit from the dolar euro exchange lets change the gtc system and lets see what we get lets get global benefit raising the base price of gtc from 1495 30 days  05 centsday 3995 90 days  045 centsday to a nice 3495 60 days  05825 centsday wow great idea 30 extra income than using 90 days gtc also if people wants to try do offline training they needed 6  30 days gtc aprox each year now they will need 4  60 days aprox it means 14956 897 and now they will need 349541398 wow 50 dolars more each year ooo remember all this people using gtc to get the benefit from dolareuro exchange this change will make the price the a gtc subscription way worse than just paying directly 1 year of credit card subscriptionthey are basically forcing us to pay more for each account we have even if we use it or if we try to do offline trainingi think that the next step will be not allow offline training once your account runs out of time they will stop your trainingwell atm i am just using 1 account and it will run out tomorrow with the current price of gtc in isk i have to spent way more time now to pay my next gtc and with every move done by ccp it gets worse this is just a way for earning more money well i keep thinking that they will not answer us they will just keep laughing at our faceshave fun
err they already did answer us they said their previous explanation of why the cards were changed was really marketing bs they failed to mention that their new explanation is also marketing bs though
i dont feel confortable with any answer comming from csm atm the decission comes from ccp and csm is just a filter for problems installed by ccp if they dont want to answer anything they can just make csm answer for them without having to face the problem directly my total support to csm task in any wayi think that in the same way that happened to me with my carrier alters not being reactivated since the carrier nerf eve have suffered a reduction on its active alter account amount hurting the income of company it can be shown past months prices of gtc for isk i was allowed to buy a 90 days gtc for 325 milthe main interest of ccp is to increase the income by solve the reduction of income because of many people not training anymore their alters making euro people pay in euros making all people pay more lower the ammount of posible people online so their servers dont go obsolete so fastabout their premium comment about this game i have to say that its very good even more if u are an old player who has worked hard to achieve complex objetives but the problem here is not if the game is good or bad they must say things directly if u want to raise prices do it equal to everyone let all people pay in euros or dolars without restrictions and call the things by its name price increasei am sure that the next step is going to be the stop rp  sp once an account is deactivated since it will mean around a 50 extra income from every alter accounthave fun in evecrashregisteronline
sighnosome alliances are massive and thus would easily sway the faction warfare easilythey have 00 for thatthis is to help encourage players who have not really pvped before to try it on a small scale if they wanted to get ultrablobbed trying to pvp they would go to 00 and do it that way
just for the record blobbing is as common in fw as in 00  and why shouldnt it be as it is the easiest strategy  blobsize may be smaller with only 50100 ships   add in the numbers disparity and youll see why balance is skewed but thats a different story p
having read about the disgusting t20 affair i believe he should be allowed to return to the gameall he really did was to expose just how vile ccp really are  in spite of the fact that eve is a great game
sighssimply put it isnt going to happen fullstopif it even got past this stage of tossing varied arguments back and forth with bits of info that no one can officially verify csm would probably have fun discussing it for a long time then theres the possibility that ccp will turn around and say player punishment and revoking it is outside of the realm of the csms mandateif it ever went through the csm and ccp would then have to deal with a whole host of banned players wanting specific accounts back pretty much swamping the csm with hundreds of topics like this and the csm will have to consider each one individually otherwise theyd look like theyd expressed favouritism destroying any respect the community has for them rendering their function useless as a representative of the communityif people want to bring up the issue that other specific players should have also been banned but they werent while kug was then the issue they should be raising with the csm is why havent those players been banned
so they should ban any character that out gms if that is your policy there was an incident where a person outed a gm in public and no action was taken  should the rule also apply to that characteras to the issue stated in the forum  ccp has a process and method to get bans investigated and lifted  just because you dont like the result doesnt mean the process is brokenas long as the rules are applied equally i dont see a problem with them  when they are arbitrarily applied there is an issueits been so long i dont remember what specifically the ban was for i do remember reading that all official channels were exhausted at that time
free kugu
i for one would not support the unbanning of while initially he did a needed job whistleblowing the misconduct of certain ccp employees he followed that up by a series of essentially malicious attacks on innocent members of ccp staffregardless of the circumstances this was unwarranted and ccp have a right and duty to protect the interests of their employees and the company from the player base had  managed to keep his behaviour in check and truely been a martyred innocent this would be a very different situation as it was  attempted to start a vendetta against ccp in general far beyond what was required to whistleblowyou could argue the rights and wrongs of boths sides  ccps general mishandling kugus illegal actions etc but it basically comes down to kugus intention to harm ccp ccp have no moral or legal obligation to unban him regardless of whatever indirect positive concequences his actions may have had
and i quote from kieron  ccp dev  the devs have stated on a number of occasions the reasoning behind the decision to not introduce a skill queue system and a webbased interface for skill selection mostly it centers around this being a game we want you to play not a webbased competition centered around who can get to 100 million skill points the fastestthere are work arounds for time constraints under the existing system set a short skill for the times when you are playing a longer skill for the times when you are not availablewe are having a difficult enough time enforcing the issues caused by isk and item sellers let alone players selling characters on ebay we are not going to introduce another game mechanic that will allow character farmers an easier time with their tradeso get over it this is not going to happen set a schedule and stop being lazy
oh my god they finally got down their high horse this is the best eve related news ive read on the last 3 monthsthanks to the csm for bringing it up to ccps eyes
i support this for the more casual gamers and people with rl commitments a  short   queue would be immensely useful even a 24 hour skill queue limit would be excellent enough to set one of those 5 hour skills going in an evening and then have it switch back to your long skill afterwards
i disagree no skill queue for me its an unneeded luxury
not having to wake up to switch a skill that finishes at 3am holy smokes im game
the best compromise is to not have skill que but let the same skill continue training to the next level until it hits v once it hits v then thats itpeople will still then have to manually log in to change skills but not have to worry about loosing time with regard to a specific skill
it is likely that i will soon be in the armed forces and i dont see why my in game abilities should be nerfed cos of rl training and operations that will take me away from the game especially since ill probably still be subscribingbtw this is evidence that people exist who only think of themselves
supporti have similar situation due to nature of my work i have to leave my country every now and then for a few month and skill queue could make my life easieri think im not the only person with such way of lifework who is playing eve cause of its skill training system it is better then in other mmos but it could be even better with skill queuehm is there any 3 months skill  character farmers exist and would exist no matter if there is any skill queue or not it is a problem of every mmo they can probably be traced but looks like it takes to much timeeffort to do ittypical point of view for a person who have internet access most of time no matter at work or at home
posted 2 times by mistake sorry please remove this post
that statement was made before the idea of a dualtraininglimited skillqueue was on the drawingboard  get your facts right and we are talking about a skillqueue of one skill  not infinite queueing 
fw needs it own forums space too much idiots posting on caodi support it
yes yes fw needs it own
agreed while kovid makes some valid points about the other forumsm they are just too tainted in the eyes of many playerscaod goonbob crap most players in fw dont give a flying donkey about what the 00 people are doing to each other the other summits are rp only and while that is nice the fw topics cover a lot of non rp topics and therefore are not welcome there and the rprs are already defensive about people playing in their pooland some non rp people dont want to hear rp arguements whatever when they want to discuss game mechanics that said making corporations and alliances summit to corporations alliances and militia summit and remove the inc characterrp restriction would do it barring that fw needs its own sections
attempts to read through the entire threadbut gets a headache so just votes after avoiding repeating points over and over and over again
so named items should universaly melto to 10 trit and plain t1 should not drop from rats   
i wish i had 4 hands so i could give this thread 4 thumbs up
that would be a start but then again bounties and salvage alone and youre still better off running l4s in highsec than mining in highsec  or lowsec for that matter  you need to bring down potential highsec missionrunning income to the same level as mining in order to see any actual benefits
or increase the risk to make the reward truly level with the current growth pattern
change how sovernty worksand the mineral voucher idea has merit
missions are riskier than mining and thus by your own standards they should have higher rewards also given that there seem to be quite a lot of people willing to mine in highsec i wont say the profession is being driven out of business just yet also on a completely different note ive come up with a potential solution to lowsec mining that isnt one of these ludicrously expansive proposals to tear the game a new spacehole how about we just seed some nonty ores weve got 6 highsec ores 6 00 ores not counting mercoxit   but only 3 lowsec ores so heres 3 more all of them are 500 units to refine and 2 m3 per unit just to make the numbers simple ore 1 15000 trit 1000 mex 300 iso 100 nocx 10 mega  133 iskm3 at market prices 233 at baseore 2 3000 trit 2500 pyer 2000 mex 20 mega  143 iskm3 at market prices 254 at baseore 3 500 trit 500 pyer 500 iso 200 nocx 40 zyd  147 iskm3 at market prices 253 at basefor comparison the best highsec ore is 90 at market and 156 at base and the worst 00 ore is 130 at market and 199 at base with current lowsec ores being 60100 market and 168225 base this also puts a tiny amount of megacyte into lowsec which means that empire can actually source all seven of the minerals albeit in vanishingly small quantities for zyd and mega
well tell that to somebody who didnt lose a single ship to mission npcs in a really really long time due to the fact they cant even come close to breaking its tank  and that in a relatively cheap ship   or compare that to a miner tanking any npc spawns at a certain levelhigherlevel missions  heck even most l3 missions not just all l4s   need to become significantly more dangerous if you want to have them at a relatively fair riskvsreward balance with miningits not about them being completely out of bussiness its about ratios of people doing one thing vs the other thing when an overwhelming amount of income in highsec comes out of missionrunning you know you have a problemthat sounds like a reasonable alternative your presented approach is just a small derivate of the change ore makeup ideabut yes the idea of adding 3 lowseconly ore types is quite nice  gives a lot more play roomalthough you might want to tweak the contents a bit like say include almost as much tritanium per cubic meter in all those ores than you find in veldspar on top of traces of highends and some lowends for startersso lets say 40k 30k and 20k tritanium in ores 12 and 3 with much less midends and slightly less highends in eachore 1 will then become something akin to heavily enriched veldspar  33 more trit than veld on top of a trace of other things    automatically at least 33 more valuable than veld in actual market value plus the trace stuff  but make it so that base value is around 160 topsore 2 will be veldspar with other stuff  same amount of trit per cubic meter like veld plus a mix of others    roughly same market value as veld plus whatever comes from the added midhighends make that around 175 base valueore 3 will be lesser veldspar with some valuables  33 less trit than veld but more of the supposedly valuable stuff    make that almost 200 in base valuein actual market value  at current prices   they should be almost equally valuable even if their base value differthat plus adding a healthy serving of tritanium to spodumain and arkonor  while removing some midhighends   should do the trick quite nicelylike i say and keep saying i really dont care which approach is picked i only care about the issue being brought in the high priority queue and solved  in any way   as soon as possible
yes ill agree that competent missioners dont lose ships very often but thats because they tend to devote almost all of their mid low and rig slots to not dying and theyre careful with their aggro control and even then an inconvenient disconnect or a stupid drone that draws aggro can still get you killed its like saying lions arent dangerous in zoos  they still are weve just got very good bars in the way personally id wager that the ratios would be similar even if their expected profit was the same  missioning is just more fun for most people actually veld but better was exactly what i was trying to avoid i dont want to see any ore obsoleted and velds role as fast trit is one i dont object to also lowsec should be focused primarily on midrange ores  my ore 1 is probably too skewed to high and low for my tastes but yours are just excessive of course were quibbling at this point and i know we agree in principle on the suggestion of better lowsec ores as for high priority i still have to differ this is one of many structural issues and its not the biggest fw is the lowsec boost du jour we can hold off a couple months on the next one
most just log before concord even show up now no loss at allits pretty stellar
news flash op is not wanting high sec ganks to stop just for there to be risk in the risk vs reward part of the gamethank you and go learn to read
sorry but high sec missions completely destroy the concept of riskreward in this game
pretty much
its a good thing concord cant find safespots or anything owait
exactly just wait24hrs to be precise
i can read fine and im not debating what the op wants im simply pointing out how easy it is to counter suicide gankingalso i stand by my comments of some people being to greedy to want to try and work together to stop it because it interrupts their isk flow that or their being to lazy or stupid to work out how
no risk to the reward kill rights i risk hauling afk with kill rights on me because i know people ive killed are too gutless or stupid to come get me that and itd throw their iskhour ratio right off which is just sacrilege to these mission runners onerf is not an option there are already many effective counters
dont stop it just make it less profitableany ship destroyed by concord should only be paid pack what was paid to scc in essence a refund not full payoutany ship that is selfdestructed should have the same result as above
its almost as if you missed the sarcasm so ill spell it out concord doesnt give a hoot if you log out before they show up they will find you because you will have a 15 minute agression timer and will remain in space long enough for them to leisurely find your ewarp spot and destroy your ship logging off will not save your ship thanks for playing
there should not be a magic missile that can kill any speed tank just as there should not be a magic antiarmour or antishield missilepvei dont see a big issue here because i use drones to kill the frigs while my t1 missiles take out the big boats i dont see the point in using t2 or faction missiles in a mission situation where you are trying to make isk not spend iti do understand that there is a nice feeling of i win about using the best gear you can especially if mission running is what you do in eve and so there may be an issue here for some people however nerfing the entire minmatar speed strategy is not the answerpvpit should be remembered that the speed tank is one of the most inteligent tactics in this game it involves piloting your ship so that you are never flying directly towards a turret and the entire minmatar syrategy is built on this so if you introduce missiles that can hit any fast moving target you will nerf an entire faction any uber precision missile should have some kind of directional drawback so that a smart pilot can avoid it but a nanogank who knows nothing but orbit at 20k will soon fall foulimo there should be a correlation between the size of missile and the size of nanoshiplight precision missiles  able to kill a nanofrigheavy precision missiles  able to kill a nanocruisercruise precision missiles  able to kill a nano bsnanoships have already been nerfed so if we cant have directional missiles it may be wize to have a specific launcher for these missiles or even better read this thread for an intresting idea about giving afs a  powergrid reduction for assault launchers which would give them a specific antinano rolecsm issues about afs
youll notice that the table i listed for their changed values would be unable to hurt a vagabond at speed  they easily do 6kms if that vagabond slows down to shoot  golly gee  it will get killed by any flavor of missile this change prevents nonpimp nanohacs from completley ignoring the entire line of cruiser sized missiles believe it or not  far more ships are nanoed than just vagabonds you say yourself you want precision heavies to kill nanohacs then what exactly is the problem also what on earth are you going on about pve the only person thats brought pve up in this thread is a troll
ignore the troll i reply about pve because ccp need to think about carebears too that i win feeling from people who dont pvp or read these forums is their income anyway carebears are cudly like ewoks agreed there is an issue here my point is slightly different in that i want to see an inteligent piloting aspect rather than pure maths either in the form of directional blasts or ship choice eve chess should be more than to outrun missile x you need to do speed y otherwise people will skill up to the point where they outrun the missile regardless of how fast it goesgiving the af a  pg bonus to assault launchers would give people a choice of flying a boat that could take down a nano bs or flying a cruiser to fill another roleshould point out that i fly caldari ships a lot so see this from both sides however bringing this subject up with minmatar milita folk was err not positive
ok went in game and tested the numbers gonna support thisgiven that nowts likely to happen soon though im off to fit a cerb with assault launchers and see how long it takes me to come home in a pod have fun all
i voted jade so gooo jade your doing a good job taking on all of eve voices not just the fourm turds
yup
just institute a proper poll system with 3 options of yayobstainnay that appears at the start of the thread over the first post   and outside of itbut overall i support this idea
sound like sensible suggestions  at the very least you need more than the single yes vote we can have now
meh not signed1 alt 1 main say one on caldari and the other on gallente  or amarrminnie   and grinding standing becomes merely a matter of podding your alt to 0spgreat idea but everyone would abuse this to no end
standings would have to transferlosers lose the same standing from there faction as the winners gain from there factiondown to faction standing of 05 after which no further standing is transferedalso lp should transfer in the same manner down to 0lpfw was supposed to incourage pvp  yet most of the rewards seem to be got from carebearingalso non affiliated players should get the standing increases and lp  yarrr
well first let me say dont lose site of the bigpicture vision because you disagree with some specific example i pulled out of my ass its up to the devs to decide how exactly to get us there but this is the pointi would like to see the game mechanics push player toward frequent cooperative groupbased pve activities for making the real iskbut yes making it easy to find worthwhile exploration encounters is probably a bad idea but i still like my idea for group ratting there have to be fun grouporientied iskmaking things that people can do in 00 every time they log in  and conquerable 00 lacks missions  
resolution for more fleet missioningall the mmorpgs i played had this implemented in some waythe simplest thing is a percentage increase in the value of a kill exp points or here in eve bounty iskthe idea is something like 10 more bounty for each player in fleetso 10 players doing a mission would get a total of double the bounty split up among them  or more if the percentage is stackable bit thats down to fine tuning the idea  apply the same principle to isk and lp rewards from agents and you got a nice reason to do fleet missionsthere are problems with this idea tho1 abuse prevention so people dont invite anyone into fleet to fill the 10 persons for max bonus2 balancing the missions where this rule cant be applyed  when theres no bounty for kills  
it is long past time to right this wrongit was a huge mistake when the original 2d system map window was banished to the f11 key and lower right hand corner of our screen that map was and continues to be the most efficient tool to establish the relative direction and range between objects combined with the directional scanner and the overview it wasis the most powerful tool for any pilotpvp or not the f10 3d system view is a poor and clumsy substitute for what was a functional and critical tool not only is it time that the 2d system map be returned to its own window but ccp should also consider upgrading it a little simple things like range markers similar to those in the tactical view would greatly enhance our abilities to quickly pull distance estimates from the graphicas for the directional scanner stations really need to be added back in as a scannable result it made no sense to remove it from the directional scanner in the first place its the equivalent of removing star gates from the directional scanner we gain nothing and lose everything by removing them
yep
video is renedered by client not server lag is excess for lezines of devs how can you reneder char portreits in game but not custom logos at ships  zomg laggorzzomg supr lojik ftwkaraktr portritz ar zent by teh servr dummaz unlez u r sugestn tht evrytym u logn tht eve givs u teh pikturz now for those who have spell check andor can speak english and are over 12  if i go and create a character and then you meet me in game and you right click and get my portrait where does that info come from does your client magically know what i look like and whats in my bio or does the server have to include that information yes it does cache some of that info but it has to be loaded the first time we meet are we to suggest that ccp is going to take and premake every possible paintjob out there for every ship in every color and preload it on your client how do you get the this color goes here on this guys ship info from where does that come fromyou load on to the local grid with bob yaketyschmakety and he is in a raven and he has a custom paint job with 10 different colors on the thing where did you get his layout from was it already preloaded on your client of course not because the guy just bought the raven and painted it with the nose of it being silver the wings a bright shade of blue and he put stripes on the side how did your client know thatsure the base raven model which is standard for every raven was on your client but where did you get his custom paint job info  skin   from lets say you have a fleet of 150 ppl the load on grid with another 150 why is it laggy if everything is on your client already the lag comes from character specific into that has to be loaded from the server do we want to add more information to thatnow lets say i just created a corp i also created a logo with that corp do you have my corps specific layout already loaded on your client deadhorsealso as a note everyone who votes here and gives stipulations you are voting on an idea that was made in the first post please read the first post the idea was for custom paint jobs and logosif you say yes and then add on but only if we dont do custom paint jobs youve just voted for custom paint jobs your idea is not counted unless this guy modifies his original post you are voting on the issue as presented if you are not for everything and you vote yes then you have just agreed to everything
hey so long as the ship and pilot their riding in is still koswartarget liable to any factions the passenger is kos to or any corp the passenger has a war dec against i have no problem with this idea
wait for ambulationn to come out that might move things alongalso interbus might allready be taking care of this somedayother than that each ship does have a passengers limit stat
nobody carries me
i would like to see an option for selling multiple itemsjust like reprocessong select items click on sellthen the new window pops up with a list of selected itemsthe columns n the window should be something like1 checkbox2 item name3 sell price4 regional average  percentageand somwhere on the window the total isk price and a sell all buttoni get realy anoyed when selling the loot from a mission takes almost as long as doing the mission itself  joke but selling 30 or more diferent items takes a long time and a lot of clicking aroundi think all mission runners would agree with me on this one selling items is a pain especialy when some modules sel for 100isk or something funny like that i feel like its not worth the 2 clicks of mouse and one click of the enter key to get 100iskthe only possible problem with this idea is the server load made by people constantly checking the total value of their hangar other than that its a very simple clientonly change
and i support my own idea
i love it market pvp needs the boost
agreed cool idea
i worry a little about server lag but it all has to get looked up anyways assuming ccps techies dont veto this im all for it
yes just yes
yes of course im sure this will lead to more of those ridiculously low buy orders out there to screw people who dont pay enough attention lol

people are interested in jove because we really dont get to interact with them if all the sudden jove space opened up tomorrow and it was just another mission center hub and belt to mine no one would carebut pirate factions people will always love the idea of pirates and i for one want to see them get some love for too long theyve been delegated to the role of cannon fodder and isk faucets i want to see them fully formed with goals a plan to implement them and mixing it up with the rest of us i want to see random npc fleets jumping in on pvp fights and causing chaos because its extra targets that could possibly help or hurt either side depending on what the pirates do and what you do i want to see them salvaging wrecks in pvp battles and pve battles i want to warp in on two pirate fleets fighting each other and choosing a side to align with i want pirates to take over systems and loot stations and planetsi want pirates to act like pirates as it is now they are just the rats of every other mmo and badly misnamed because of itdiscuss
agreed
you mention hawt drops like its a bad thing i personally dont think it is but what if you had a mobile cynofield jammer for simplicity give it to a hic as like the bubble in the high slot it might work give it 249km effective area when hic deploys anticynofield bubble it cant be repped so that means friendlies must defend without repping hawt droppin support gang must be in system to kill the hic with the anticyno bubble at 250km a tower could shoot at it so you couldnt just put one outside a tower as it will get shot at or if you dont care about that give it a longer range like 2000kmbiggest problem with a hawt drop is the lag it creates for everyone on grid now if you like the 249km effective range at least they are distance away or 2000km are off grid its a ship that needs to be destroyed or defended and i think would be a nice balance between the ability to use caps whatcha thinkthis will prevent idiots from throwing caps around blatantly as they cant just cyno in 20 of their friends if they get in trouble without dealing with support gangs first if this were implimented hawt drops probably would be cut in half after the first 100 carriers would go down within a week
quote from the csm refrence
im in agreeance with this guy  great ideas however entirely to complex and huge for current game they would basically have to rewrite the entire game
signed
yeah
agreed that there is an issue of cross threading etc but where does a heavily supported issue in features and ideas discussion become and idea that the csm should be pushing forperhaps there should be some formalish way of turning a features and ideas item into a csm issuealso it appears as though the csm boards are far more heavily read  it is quite understandable that players wanting an idea implimented will want to push their ideas in a visible place where they will get player if not dev support if that isnt the intention for csm then more moderation is going to be needed to get that sorted
yes this is exactly what i expected would happen there should be set rules when you can post an issue in assembly hall
by sheer volume of traffic an idea will get more exposure in the assembly hall than it will in the features and ideas forum i agree that some things seem to pretty obviously belong in one or the other but theres also a lot of gray area and any sort of effective segregation between the forums is going to require a large effort by moderators at what point is the solution to an issue an idea and how do people move whole discussions from one forum to the other without losing their audience its silly to have two separate forums for these discussionsit seems to me that features and ideas became  unintentionally   obsolete when the assembly hall was created this is the venue through which players can voice suggestions to the devs in ways that can ultimately lead to implementation and it gets more attention than features and ideas id rather not see moderators engage in a futile effort to separate what are ideas and features from what are issues thats a needless semantic debate at this point and trying to separate it out would hinder rather than help discussion
ccp greyscale the devs look at features and ideas discussion and its up to us to manage the assembly hall can the csm create better guidelines for this forum
in theory perhaps but what actually looks to be happening is that a lot of people are just skipping the fid stage and posting their initial suggestions in assembly hall in the hopes that a csm will jump on to support it
reason for this isnt too hard to see which forum has more discussion more readers and more replies per topic this forum has become not only a place to propose ideas and receive support but also a better place to thrash out an idea than fi simply because it gets more trafficdoesnt mean i like it or support it just means it makes sense to me
agreed this forum is the one that gets the traffic i think this forum rendered features and ideas obsolete  detailed discussions are going to happen here anyway so theres no point in trying to segregate the discussions into two separate forums it would be nice to get some sort of official word from ccp on how they envision the features and ideas forum being used in light of the creation of the assembly hall
its a similar pattern to what happened when games workshop opened their own official discussion forums on their website  every armchair rule designer migrated from the various unofficial forums to the gw site the new forum became deluged with ideas from the gaming community hoping that a dev would adopt it  because the devs made the mistake of actually making the odd post and confirming they were actively reading   and incorporate their unit idea or tweak into the next ruleset or even offer them a playtester position or  in the most deluded cases   a jobof course 95 or more of the ideas posted were utterly terrible and the noise drowned out the signal to the extent where the forums shortly became useless and were closed down again after a year or so were not at that stage here right now but one can already see fid going into a slight decline as people stop posting over there and migrate to assembly hall because people are hoping a sympathetic csm will show up and fasttrack their idea to ccps attention or are using the csm forums to make posts to use as a platform for a future csm bid of their own we have three forums operating in parallel right now with all sorts of raw and halfbaked ideas popping up in both assembly hall and jpsc apparently without having been discussed elsewhere because nobody seems really sure where the remit of each particular forum begins and ends
heck even csm themselves use this forum to thrash out ideas stuff like that pretty much opened the floodgates for everyone else to use it as an idea discussion forum instead of a forum on the merits of an idea and if it should go forward to ccp
you cant have a discussion on the merits of an idea without allowing alterations to the idea to make it have more merit in the eyes of some of the people discussing it what the idea is and whether it has merit is one conversation not two if were going to have these conversations at all it should all be in the same placeccp wanted the csm to act as interlocutors and indeed they are there are obviously bad ideas that get posted in the assembly hall but not every crackpot idea makes it to ccpi see a sort of natural selection process at work here  people are migrating to the assembly hall because csm can compel the devs to answer specific questions and csms recommendations carry more weight with ccp than individuals posting in the forumsthese discussions on ideas and features and issues and merit are going to happen one way or another and it makes more sense for them all to be in one place because the distinctions between them arent obvious enough that they could be enforced by anything but heavyhanded moderating which would inhibit the conversation and take a lot of effort on the part of the moderators at the moment the assembly hall is the most logical place to have these discussions since it gets the most traffic and has a builtin process that filters out nonstarter ideas and brings popular ideas to the devs for implementation or comment
the way it should have been setup is that the features and idea discussions and game development threads carry on as per usual and the assembley hall is locked down with a account vote systemonly cms members could start a thread in assembly hall which would outline a vote proposal then players could only vote yes or no for that proposal but not postif they want to respond to it then player go back to the original thread in the features and idea discussions and game development
to follow up on this this issue did not officially make it to iceland i did however manage to tell oveur hammerhead and some other guys about various complaints about large acs in general not promising that theyll look at it but hey at least its something
supported
no way minmatar are allready way overpowerd emexp dam 20 dam no cap to fire extreme falloffye right get real they need a nerf if anything
eft dps numbers dont mean sht real world because we fight in falloff wich can be a drastic reduction in dps get a clue people
the reason it didnt make it to iceland is beacuse less than half of the posts support itjust because youre csm does not mean your ideas get to be moved to the front of the list wait in line like the rest of us
after reading this thread and getting generally annoyed on these forums i think that there should be more options around the filter it appears to be that the main issue about having the filter on the forum and not ingame is that these forums can be searched by anyone on the internet and thus no age limit this is not so ingame where you need to have an account and it has an option to disable the filter so what i propose is to have an option in the settings feature disable word filter  which would do the same thing it does ingame
posting support
removed please do not bypass the profanity filter navigator
maybe the word filter can be tweaked but i really dont think allowing it to be disabled is a good idea learn some new words to replace the filtered onesplus if the filter could be disabled more people would post with profanity and the naughty words so reading the forums with the filter active would cause some eye strain with the    words appearing everywhere imagine caod having even more naughty words laced with the trolling and the smack 
unlike the current fw outposts these can only be entered by one ship at a time from each faction so that there will be a 1 vs 1 situation the winner gains fw points and the faction with the most heros at the end of each day gets a t2 lolipoppeople could even pay to enter with the winner taking all
because i couldnt help but think ittwo ships enter one pod leaves
1  kestrel does more damage than a hawk1  assault missile launchers are so slow noone uses them on a cruiser2  give the af a  powergrid reduction for assault missile launcherssame applies for dual railblasterlasertypeshooty thingsi love frigs but try as i may i can not find a role for my hawk really i want it to be like a mini t1 cruiser which it is in every respect untill i try and shoot anything and thenwellumerall i can say is a rifter tanked my t2 rockets
the following topic is about precision missileslinkageif you cant be arsed reading the above thread it says light missiles are the only ones that can hit a nano ship and theres some whining about not being able to take out drones with cruise missilesthe above suggestion of an af with assault launchers would be the perfect antinano ship finally a role for the af editok i dont like this idea but someone else proposed an anti tackler role for the af linkageafs too heavy to intercept a tackler but too light to tank untill it reaches target imo but may as well get gome ideas into the af thread
just throwing this one out there i read the interviews about csm and the devs say that they are very transparent which may be true but it sometimes feels like the transparency is but a flickeri understand that devs are busy developing and i too would rather they do that than anything else however since we all do want updates and frequent ones would be better perhaps someone should be an active pr person who dishes out updates and communicates with us some people have talked about the flaming such a person would get well the pr  devs can ignore those people and even mute them if necessary as long as those of us who are mature can get our updates i do think that constant updates even if they come in a list form of what is being worked out what stage its at and how long till next stage  rough rough estimate   would soothe a lot of rageso what do we think a dedicated pr person or just take 5 of dev time and put it into updating us
anything involving 100000 people is gonna be murky and i dont think the game would be half as much fun if we truly knew what was going on ccp do a very good job of keeping us informed but the volume of info is such that you either have to dedicate your life to the game or live with being in the darkthe petition system is very efficent if you have a particular issue and the dev ccp wrangler seems to get the flaming on the forums  not that my alt tartan pixie would have ever done such a thing    so its all in there already 1 to ccp
last i knew dev blogs were supposed to be weekly we all see how well that works a month or two of inactivity followed by a one month dash of blogs before the newest release and slowly going toward no activity again for about a month after thatthis system seems to work though so im not gunna knock it
the current system where they talk to the players when theres something to talk about and get back to coding when there isnt is just fine by me we dont need a dedicated pr guy and itd be a waste of ccps money
i think its more than a little macabre to profit off of a rl death
im sure your ceo would be relieved to know that in the event of his real life death his pretend internet spaceship guild will be transferred to the safe hands of his pretend internet spaceship guildmatesholy crap this forum needs a psyduck emoticon so badly
rl death is natural the modern person never sees a dead body so considers this macabre but id like everything i do to go somewhere so if the 5 stealth bombers and 20 isk note ive got left can give someone pleasure then so be it butas a game mechanicnoexploits are an issue last time i went somewhere dodgy my account was inactive for months and too damn right i wanted my escapeism when i got homeif your eve mates are mates they would feel very odd taking your pimped manticore into battleposted by an alt this is an odd topic if your ceo dies in rl im sure a discrete petition could let ccp put a director into the nececary position to keep the corp running
as has been made very apparent in fw the precision heavy missile needs work currently most even vaugely nanoed ships can outrun the explosion velocity with ease other than training t2 guns  a large changes for players heavily invested in missile skills   caldarimissile using players have a few options in the wepon dept while i think that missiles  or at least the launchers   need some tweaks the only one that it glaring messed up is the precision heavy can we see about getting some help for that  no this is not an antinano whine i think the ships are fine for the most part its a missile users method of dealing with them that needs work
precision heavy thread in cms forum with nice explanations and allgo there and vote so you will get it on the first page way more efficient than starting a new thread
simply put this is an idea for a t2 ship that specializes in untackling its friends maybe this is a role for a new ship and maybe its a role for an old ship that needs one  like afs  this ship could fit two new mods a remote warp core stabilizer and a remote antiweb  maybe name it remote momentum stabilizer or something   those mods counter the effects of warp disruptorsscrams and statis webifiers on targetted shipsi think this would add a fun new role to play in group pvpit can be balanced as well some examples of how to make it balanced remote wcs dont help with bubbles or with hic warp disruptors  bubble or focused   make the ship slow heavy and unnanoable yes even the minmatar one work the cap usage out so that an interceptor can hold a point and web longer than an antitackler can use its antitackle modskeep in mind that since supercaps already cannot be affected by ewar this ship cannot benefit them
ptsm
lets see a t2 ship that specialises in breaking tacklingalready exists i give you the electronic attack frigatesimply put if you cant lock it you cant scramweb it and that thing specialises in breaking target locking cababilities
i like this idea although the ways it could affect fleet and gang warfare should be considered carefully i bet there would be a lot of sideeffects to introducing such a ship that would have to be minimizedthis would be different from an electronic attack ship in that its role is a form of support rather than attackactually could these be merely new mods that the relatively underused logistics cruisers could use rather than creating a new t2 ship class from scratch
disagreeeas ships can already fill this role what is need to make it more viable is some way for a player to flag the ship that is tackling him to to other players so they know exactly who they needs to jam or damp similar to the needs armorshields button
that was a surprisingly funny article i must say ive never seen someone be described as almost erudite before also anything that references the infield fly rule is automatically a winner

this is the inherent problem with things like the csm and other attempts at it in the past it basically becomes about what they as individuals want and ultimately they are there to represent themselves not the player base as a wholewhere it will get ugly is if the devs pay any attention to them in swg the senate became a permanent dev ass kissing club which naturally got the devs listening to them instead of the players still howling at the cataclysmic game changes that came with the deletion of 23rds of the game in the nge one example most of their servers are not just low populated they are empty literally almost completely empty the solution merge servers no one of the senators convinced them to make improved player search tools so you could more efficiently search for players who are not there all because that particular senator was a class a asskisser so they wasted time developing something that was completely pointless and will do nothing to address the fact that they still have 25 servers when they have 110th the players they used to havethis is why im against things like the csm the gaming professionals  ccp   should make the game and they should listen to players directly not use a leet club as a fluffer buffer
okay i post once in a while sometimes it has content other times it is to flame the op now i am going to say this for all of eve and the csmccp to readto all you whiners of nanogotry speed demons hot drops etc shut the  up this is a game it is not meant to be fair i think i seen someone post about getting rid of learning skills why just cause your new and want to have it your way in everyone of these posts there are people whining cause they cannot do it or they cannot catch them or cannot cyno jam blah blah blah i am honestly quite sick of it i cant fly a carrier i had a nyx hotdropped onto a station fight in low sec  thank you omen beautiful site   and i got wasted ok so i lost next i can use nano ships i had a awesome arbitrator pilot  nanod btw   who came webbed pwnd and left i win i lose such is the game my goal in the game is to not have it fair i dont want to be equal with everyone around me i want unfair ganks superior nano ships etc makes you work for your fun some of us like 12kms machariels some of us like slow moving hyperions with 1200dps tanks how the  do you catch 12kms or beat 1200dps tanks use your ing head this is a game where solo play and combined play come together you choose your style there are notices saying if you jump into this system anyone can blow your ass away with concord saving you use what is around you and adapt i personally cant deal with whiners they simply complain about something they dont want to train for 6 months to have well i had to train for 6 ing months to t2 fit my rapier i want to enjoy it not have some snotnosed brat who started yesterday be able to compete with meanyways im off to do something other than  on the forums thanks for readingsuvliana
i might not have put it that way but i agree with the sentiment wholeheartedlybest regardswindjammer
getting rid of learning skills might not be a bad idea they are a total no brainer to train its not like other skills where you train however to customise your character its a fun tax when youre just starting out which isnt very good if youre trying to show newbies a good time
 no
isnt it a bit unfair for those of use who like to use turrets either becasue of their race or weopon preferances have to wait so long to get t2 turretsthose that use missiles can just train for one class of missiles for instance cruise and not have to train anythingthing but that skill an the specialisation skill for that classwhile those that use turrets have to train all the other turret skills for instance large turrets they have to train all the skills for them to lv5 and their specilisation skill for all the different sizes of turret before them to lv4 aswell to get the t2 they wantthis makes it almost twice aslong to train for the t2 turrets than it would for someone to train for t2 nissilesshouldnt it be made more even so that it takes a equal amount of time for bothi think either make it so you dont have to train all those skills for the t2 turrets or make it so those who use missiles have to train more for their t2 missiles instead of being prejidice agasint those that use turrets or those that dont choose caldari
yeah but we only have to max 3 skills and not 6 it seems fair enough to me
the missile skill tree is longer than each gunnery one
and you get a superior weapon system anyway
harsh words veronei am a believer in the magic of timeso i can not make a final statement on the usefulness of the csm yetbest case scenario would have been different from what we are seeing currentlybut the task is not an easy one eithermaybe more practice will improve the csmas i like to say only time will tell
then your voting the wrong people i guess its not the csm that is bugging you if you need more level headed players elect them the csm is just as opinionated as the players in the game and thus that will cause conflict and conflict is one of the things that makes eve well eveso sure its messy but when they all get together in person they all cool off because they are all good people its just dont think its easy for everyone to put aside the ingame politics for the csmthats why people should vote for me p i live with a goonie fight in factional warfare and 00 space ive been playing for a long time i have an alt in eve uni for teaching new players i suicide gank people with my third alt i love every part of eve and really dont have any issue with any players in the game but im sure  point   that if i had no issues with the other csm members someone would whine about me not making conflicts and say im a ccp spy and im breaking the game and such
that was a surprisingly funny article i must say ive never seen someone be described as almost erudite before also anything that references the infield fly rule is automatically a winner
heck im european and i understand the infield fly rule    however i dont actually personally know a single other person in the uk that follows baseball
darius is from jerseynew jersians unite

i wish they would fix the niggling little ui problem with the massive lag anytime you get more than 50 players in the same system i would think even the empire people would be complaining now with the factional warfare stuff causing large gangs then that ends up in some backlog now were using scrum and agile methodology and that gets prioritizedconsider setting your network code fix to a high priority and put it into your next sprint see i can use technojargon too my guess the guy who wrote it is the same guy who wrote the billboard code and after he left nobody can figure it out
i couldnt even log in to change a skill last night
seriously what the hell
yeah why are you continuing to support this fail boat when you could run around outside naked
what is a fail boat
i actually find that term funny
