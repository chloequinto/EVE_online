you mention here that the optimum place for your aegis destroyer would be halfway between the blobs assuming this is true and it is not just as efficient to have them in your fleet this opens some interesting strategies mainly the idea of flanking and the various ways that it can be achieved this would either lead to a greater possibility of gangfleet fights involving much more tactical maneuvering or excess complexity that only serves to frustrate people another major scenario to consider is that of a stalemate essentially two groups with optimal interception run into each other suddenly neither side is doing damage and a stalemate ensuesi will say this is an interesting idea i wouldnt fully support this as is but if it can be fleshed out and it fits then it would add some very interesting gameplay if it was introduced i would rather it be a t2 variant of the new destroyer hulls coming out than a low entry t1 hull
bring back the frill my vagabond looks like a noob ship now

hold me frill me kiss me kill me
bring it back
the vagabond carries an iconic brand whether an individual capsuleer agrees with its aestheticseliminate the things that identify something iconic and they becomemundane a few examples mcdonalds without the arches or that freaky clown london without big ben china without the great wall vikings without their horned helms yes i know its not historically accurate  but its iconic look at hilmars twitter icon edit and one more thanks arydanika  jimi hendrix without his fro thukker mix you made a design choice your customers disagree with  get the design team back in gear and bring back the iconic vagabond

here for the puddjngalso black shipsoh and frillsupstarting blogger ormehullet guides and more is coming
asking for a dev or someone in the art department to address the removal of the vagabonds distinguishing featureit would be great to announce the return of the frill on july 15th after the thukk you frill me event dontcha thinkcmon guys the circumcision of the vaga was a bad idea and it needs to be fixed
alternatively buy a t3 and compete with them that way or a faction bs or a marauder
thisif you cant gank a t3 youre not doing it right
hint t3s arent invincible
sounds like a recipe for unsatisfying gameplay and mudflation eve players should be able to compete for resources directly aka war
because dreadnoughts totally wield a small amount of turret firepower and a large drone bayi think maybe carriers should be given a few turret or launcher hardpoints straight up it wouldnt improve their dps given that a capital turret has less firepower than a fighter and 1 high slot can be used for either one but it might lead to some strategic carrier fittings though i have a feeling that most carrier pilots would completely avoid putting turrets on their carriers if they could
a ship that mines much faster than a hulk but cant be used in highsec requires strategy in mining because its a lot of value to lose i think it makes a fair bit of sense and helps take the mining potential out of botterafker hands and back into player hands what do you guys think
and thats where it stopped making sense
why you think botters and afkers should be making the most mining income
no but if you create ships that can pull in more ore than now then supply will rise and make mineral prices drop and afkers and botters will still make more isk than active players because they can pull in the volume necessary to make a pretty pennybesides which people are most likely to use these types of ships because ill bet hard isk it wont be solo or small scale miners i can see mega alliances using them en mass deep in their territories where no one can reach them
please explain to us how you will prevent this ship from being used by bots if you cannot do so then it will be putting more money into the hands of botters
i thought i mentioned its a capital ship and cant be used in highsec that eliminates like 90 of botters right there if its not in highsec and the person using it is afk they can be easily attackedmy god you people are slow
1 there are bots in null sec gasp2 some nullsec is even safer for botting than highsec3 this will devalue the mineral market as such all new players will be earning pittance in their first mining ships or even in barges why do you want to nerf mining is beyond me
why exactly is that a bad thing
sorry there were more bots found in the forge then all of nullsec combined according to the fanfest 2012 security panel the follow up 12 regions were all also highsec areas hth
an interface for selling t2 bpcs sure i could get behind that why one wouldnt want to build said items with the bpc is beyond me but seeding actual t2 bpcs noi do not agree with the first statement in your second paragraph alaekessa invention already has reliable results over a sufficiently large sample ie several hundred invention runs i dont see a reasonneed to change it
i was thinking that seeding trash t2 bpcs would help mitigate people crying about not being able to afford invention slots as far as the topic of reworking invention goes the process annoys me to no end if ive already figured out the method to manufacturing t2 425s why should i need to figure it out again and again why cant i just use the same schematics ive already succeeded with to repeat the success to some varying degree
any chance this gets thrown in with the upcoming procskiff changes
thanks for illustrating another textbook example of adhominem note that your last post added nothing to the arguement except make attacks against me im beginning to think you either dont realize its your own credibility you are undermining here while also completely derailing this discussion from your proposal at hand this will be the last you hear from me on this as my contribution to the topic is done im happy to continue to battle wits with those who are unarmed but not in this forumedit the extra free slots i mention is the extra free lows that indies get to use due to your proposal of making less expanders necessary for the same cargo capacity not adding new ones as u assumed
i do not really see an issue with cargo expansion as is badgers have the smaller holds at times but they do have the benefit of leading to the best freighter
you missed the bold print theni think a more important example of the need for larger base cargoholds is battlecruisers having the same cargohold size as destroyers their ammo is larger but they dont have nearly as much room for itcurrently battlecruisers and battleships often devote nearly their entire cargohold to ammo and thus dont have enough room to carry other items unless they dont plan to be out longnow it would not be prudent to increase their base cargohold capacity without adding a stacking penalty because some of them have a lot of low slots and as i have demonstrated with the armageddon example even with the small base value at current these ships are capable of having nearindustrial size cargoholds with maximum expanders on
theres actually a reason for this dessies have 8 rapidly firing guns and can go through ammo really fast in the long run generally pve because dessies dont usually live very long otherwise a destroyer will use more ammo m3wise than a bs
incorrect small ammo takes up far less space and thus even though a destroyer fires faster it still uses up ammo space much slower a thrasher can fire 200mm autocannons for 15 hours while a maelstrom can fire 800mm autocannons for only 3 hours but with 150 more base cargohold space it would be able to hold enough ammo to fire for 75 hours
i think if ccp ever to tackle comets ice harvesting should belong there if they do implement that it could be also incorporated into scan first  mine after to prevent possible bottingabout extra slots on orcas i think that is ccp prerogative our job is to provide leads and ideas details of such ideas will be done by ccpabout belt variation i think that should be either left to gravimetric sites or implemented similarly to gravimetric sites harder to scan and not always present in the system or have a cooldown but these are details again
1there is one reason and one reason only that i support this thread boobs that is all and really if they did make it possible to have bigger boobs on females in the character creator then that would not only make the rest of the eve playerbase hap
i wouldnt at all mind if we could make them bigger if only to annoy the crap out of all those people who dislike it
nothing would make nullbears cry harder than removing local from nullspace how can they do pve if they are not 100 sure that their system is empty oh gawd they would be in harms way and while its fun ganking the living hell out of miners in highsec and telling them there is no safe place in eve its not as much fun getting ganked yourselfas a side note i really would like sleeper attacks on poses and camped wormholes on the other hand it would be equally hillarious if incursion sanshas would attack towers and sov structures in null but i am sure that the majority of the nullsec crowd would not agree with me there pas to the stabilizer its complete lunacy
why are you talking about changing whes stop it fix my pos and be done with iteverything in wormholes is fine
seriously what the hell is wrong with the people in this thread wh dwellers too what is wrong with you line up right now so i can slap some sense in you wormholes are one of the richest areas of the game currently you put in money you get out much more money and you have the ability to buy your super shiney you have always dreamed of why in the hell would anyone want to change that i can see the c2c4 residents making their claims here and actually thinking they are good that can be forgiven but your c5c6ers do you realize what you are supporting you are supporting the death of wormholes as we know it sleepers shooting posses no just no i do not want to have to haul in ammo for my pos every two weeks along with the fuel runs well i dont actually make the runs but i have in the past so i know the painsleepers podding people yes cause this makes sense lets support getting podded by sleepers that way it can take us three weeks to get back into our home what so we run sites in static even get a little bit of pew in time to pop our hole oh look our dread got caught in the static because we reached the hard limit on number of jumps think before you post sleepers attacking safespots seriously are you serious here you are going to make me fit a cloak on every single ship i have i guess this would also move sleepers to appear on the wormholes as well cause you know it fits in with this line of thinking this would mean that no calculated ganks no concerted setups that take a few minutes to get going are viable everything is all grab a kite ship and hurry sleepers will start showing up any second and i my oraclefalconrapier cant tank themone final note that was not mentioned in the op but several people are mentioning wormhole stabilizers no no no no no this will end all wormhole life as it is the major null sec groups will invade when either cfc or soco wins their little war over delve and we the wormholers will pay the price for it this is what wormholes need more noobs in my c5s and c6s its more likely than you think so i can shoot them simple as that i make plenty of money inside of wormholes and i work a full time job with only two days out of the week to make my money i rarely if ever make money on my work days and i make enough to support two toons with plexes and buy bhaalghorns black ops and other shiny ships that tickle my fancy and i get enough time to rustle enough jimmies of noobs to fill my cup with their delicious tears if you want to change anything about wormholes give us some pos upgrades no docking so that it will be a tad bit easier to not get donkey effed by a spai
not emptyquoting
hi therei have read through the proposal and i like the idea i think it gives so variation to pvp and has the posibility to create some new and varied tacticsi think the idea could work with a glass cannon concept have each class of ships cruiser battleship etc have a glass cannon varient alot like teh teir 3 bcs a fleet could have a number of these ships that would be capable of dealing high alpha strikes but would need protection from alph strikes in turn so they would naterually be matched with an ageis destroyeralso another idea and this may only work if the the destroyer negated a percentage of all damage is that the protection extends both ways ie the ship being protected also suffers a reduction in dps this would introduce timing to fleet battles for examplefleet target battleship xageis drop wall in three two  one markfire all weaponsraise wall repeat raise wallmeanwhile when the opposing team sees a strike happening they have a few seconds to drop their own wall and conterstrike before the ageis cruisers raise the protection again assuming they are paying attention and have targets setthis could also lead to tactics like firing through your shield in the hope of tricking the opposing side to lower their shields for an ineffectual counter strikejust some random thoughtsdafydd
i like this idea i am not familiar enough with eve to really say what all needs to be polished about it but it is a cool idea i made a caldari after going through a battlestar galactica binge and a small flak package on my ship would complete my own battlestar d

in an effort to keep our battle in the eyes and minds of those who visit the assembly hall i post againterror is the heart of the vagabond terror and the ability to complement that with pain the vagabond of inferno 11 still delivers the pain but without the terror it is but a shadow a wannabe thorax at 20x the priceif all sailswings were removed from minmatar ships i would be less affronted by the effort to streamline the fleet but there are still wings there are still sails minmatar still hold in rust we trust as the motto even if the rust is now relegated to the interior corners of the cargo baythe frill is gone the frill is gone away the frill is gone baby the frill is gone away you know you done me wrong ccp and youll be sorry someday the frill is gone its gone away from me the frill is gone ccp the frill is gone away from me although ill still live on but so lonely ill be the frill is gone its gone away for good oh the frill is gone ccp ccp its gone away for good someday i know ill be over it all ccp just like i know a man should you know im free free now ccp im free from your spell im free free now im free from your spell and now that its over all i can do is wish you well
and still dont forget the tempest fleet issues retangular wingy bits either
please to have dev response to thukker mixs frakup removing the vagas frill bring it backthukkyoufrillme
free the frill
the frill must be returned
im simply frilled at the existence of this threadsigned
i agree my precious err the frills must be returned
yes please give me back the frill i also liked the spiky ramming bit on the front too but can live without thatfirst they came for the navy cometsand i didnt speak out because i wasnt a comet pilotthen they came for the ah you know where this is going
i support this bring back the frilli dont fly minmatar ships but i support the frill movement
the frill was what made the vaga special please bring it backi do not want to see protestring fans at fanfest dancing friller to make a pointme shudders at the thoughtmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
oh i do im so up for making that happen itd be a fantastic warmup act for ccp soundwaves version of shatners rocket man that he failed to deliver this year
alsothe character gains x amount of isk would preent people from making a trial just to get by the bannage thing
stop fking with newbies thats the reason why this change came about because you couldnt leae the newbies alone you griefers brought this change onsummary of ees last four expansions
pretty much this remember that we were all noobs once and most of us would hae quit the game had we been the target of some of the behaior people seek to defend hereit doesnt help that ccp has ague rules on who is and who is not fair game theye resorted to restricting player behaior in a dozen systems in a list that is not directly proided ingame were expected to abide by arbitrary rules that are judged on a percase basis to the point that no one really knows where the line is drawn with all the effort that is apparently being put into crimewatch and making sure players understand exactly whats going on i sincerely hope this isnt forgotten and people know whether they are clear to respond to the theft of their property regardless of the system theyre in
a fancy meerschaum pipe would be nice tooit would work well with the tobacco already on the market or you can bring out more brands of tobacco as aurum items too

great idea
reading comprehension failure
carriers were wonderful ships at least when they were first introduced to the eve sandboxin fact carriers were so wonderful that they had to be nerfedso lets give the carrier class back some of its love lostproposal give our carriers some effective fighters once again after all it does seem that we should have discovered tech 3 fighters by now doesnt it
he is literally the worst commentator in the history of the at seriously even that chick from at8 was better he does not know game mechanics at all and tries to pass his lack of knowledge off on the other commentators by saying things like what do you think about this setup etc the fact that in one of the matches he said that the bhaalgorn was a flagship shows how ignorant to the tournament format he actually is being that flagships cannot even be fielded in the prequalifiers his jokes and puns are really terrible and every time he speaks i want to kill myself with a rusty machete i was really hoping that he would have dramatically improved from last year but unfortunately he has notcan we please replace him with someone that actually knows the game and can speak coherently about it it is making the tournament completely unwatchable for a number of people some of these teams have spent months preparing for this event and are having it ruined by this crappy commentary
i dont even know who this guy is but they should have michael jordan instead
whats the quickest way to bring attention to the picture of shadoo i have hanging on the back of my wall oh i know ill comment on zastrows posters and subtly steer the conversationterrible 
supportedi mute the stream when hes talking
is michael bolton that guy from game of thrones
supporting all he does is call things wrong and talk about something unrelated during the matches
i support this the michael boltoniii is the worst out of the lot of miserable commentators that somehow got picked to shoot their mouths off and bullshiti have to wonder how bad they are when they cant follow the shieldsarmorstructure or the names of the ships honestly its not like theyre watching it in  360p or with the laggy streamreplace them with someone decent if anything and i regret this get ccp soundwave to commentate at least it wont sound like hes overly excited about every little thing
why doesnt hilmar commentate
hes mixing the wub wub mate
lool
id say he was the johnathon legard of eve commentary but hes much much worse than that totally useless and offers nothing but worthless observations while he points out the things you are yourself seeing
in 30 seconds in our match mb3 revealed he has paid exactly 0 attention to the rules or anything surrounding the tournament by pointing out how we were fielding our bhaalgorn flagship in the prelim match however our flagship is a vindicator well perhaps our vindicator murdered an armageddon and wore its skin it certainly is bloody enough and you cant even field a flagship in prelimsevery match he commentates on i have to mute which is annoying as sometimes i want to hear some commentary that isnt my corpmates gorion talks way too much and i actually like laz but mb3 just ruins everything and makes me want to stab my eardrums
lets not overlook the fact that the team who fielded said bhaalgorn doesnt even have a bhaalgorn listed as their flagship lets be fair his partner hasnt been brilliant either hurr if theyre ham drakes theyll hit out to 35 except that hams barely scratch 20on a drake but hes at least talking about the matches and whats going on in them rather than his molesterstache his performance is forced at best at worst a mockery he was bad last year but is just cringeworthy this year as sometime between now and then hes decided he needs to be an evecelebrity and let it go to his head
michael boltons commentary makes wanna kill myself irl
this actually makes me a bit sad i thought mbiii was kinda  last year but cute and likable in his own way i think he took that qworkyness and saw that some people liked it and decided to go full  we all know how full  goes i know its ccps way or no way but  man this is really terrible
those are some nice clothes space captain amantus also please get rid of mb3 and get someone who knows basic game mechanics and how things work in evewe dont even have shadoo this hear to give mb3 the shut your mouth you idiot look
the commentators have all been abysmal so far the woman from at8 was hilarious in her terribleness at least replace all commentators with her so we can have a lolfest tournamentand on a related note is the thing that switches cameras between the two commentators a god damn random number generator its so erratic and poorly timed
not agreed we dont know what the commentators are seeing on their end these current qualifiers they are streaming from their home as for the comment about the brianna from at8 being better no way bolton may not have that energetic voice that brings excitement he still has clear articulation which is just as important
so it is ok to talk out of your ass as long as its well articulatedsweet next year we should have celebrity guest commentators like barak obama and mitt romney since the only thing that matter is how well you can speak not what you actually say honestly though i think that comment is unfair to the politicians because at least they do some minimal amount of research before they speak which is a lot more than i can say for mb3
counterproposal hit the mute button if you dont like someone talkingak
i support this petition  mb3 was all over the place and i really wanted to mute but was interested in what the other commentator was doing i really really really dont want to watch someone talk about themselves in my free time
countercounterpoint the other commentator is fine so manually editing him out of the stream would also involve mashing the mute button and sticking a postit note over his ridiculous face this situation is far from ideal and i think the most sensible way to resolve it it to go back in time and feed mb3s mother ginrr
implying that this hasnt happened alreadyhonestly ccp we understand that the alliance tournament is more to do with bringing in new or lapsed players than giving a couple of alliances annual epeen bragging rights but mb3s commentary has been flatout painful and does a disservice to both at audiences and the game itselfwe all deserve better than michael bolton iii i cant believe that there wasnt another person who applied to be a commentator who wouldnt be leagues better than what were getting from this guy
the ham drake comment was incorrect when i mentioned the hams i had the ham range of tengus in my head which is actually 305km with max skills  i looked it up after the tourney was over but yeah i am open to any criticism this is my first year as a commentator and i want to give you guys the best i can give by the time the 12mans start up so i really want to get the kinks worked out in the prelimsbut overall so far i havent heard very many bad things about my commentating and again criticism is expectedwelcomed
the unspoken subtext here is that you completely agree mb3 should be off the commentary teamthankyou for your support
mbolt 3i know youre reading this collectively fearlessdot have found themselves in a pickle weve spent our entire at fund already and cant afford spaceships for the second weekend for 10 billion isk i can guarantee fearlessdots unflinching support of your quirky commentary including the editing of posts in this thread which may previously have contained negative sentiment to appropriately reflect the amount of goodwill such a gift would inspire a meagre sum to help secure your holiday to icelandthink about it meight isk to ry ry
at least your commentary is pertaining to the matches and the action which is going on mb3 is constantly making mistakes or not paying attention to what is going on and seems more interested in sounding like hes actually relevant when we just want to hear someone who can comment constructively on the match and what is actually occurring
joke commentator for a joke tournament what is wrong with that
1if mb3 continues in his present capacity for the rest of atx then im out i dont want to hear his voice and i dont want to see his face he is negatively affecting the tournament both in form and substance there is no possible tournament matchup tha
meh i dont see what all the rage is about he might not be a stellar orator but he doesnt really seem that bada couple things to point out first off those so what do you think about their setup comments dont seem to be a lack of knowledge they seem to be attempting to generate interesting dialog while the ships on the field are busy just grinding each other down its kinda boring to just say well the match is over really now its just mopup and then sit there silently watching them take out one ship after another for 5 min second not knowing that flagships werent allowed in prelims isnt that surprising iirc they havent broadcast prelims yet so its not surprising that the commentators dont have every rule minimized seeing a bhal on field and guessing that it might be the flagship isnt a bad guess especially when about 45 of the flagships seem to be bhals however once he was notified that he was wrong he corrected himself commentators arent perfect everyone makes mistakes at timesim more or less indifferent on the matter i dont know the guy at all but commenting on something like this is much harder than people give these guys credit for i doubt that 90 of the naysayers could do any better trying to keep up a constant stream of dialog on camera for thousands of people at once and have everything come out perfect is impossible so why not cut the commentators some slack and be a bit understanding
youre right its not surprising that he didnt read the rules its not like hes supposed to be doing commentary for the match or anything go watch sports on tv the commentators for that have at least a general idea of the rules
um  last i checked a general idea of the rules and knowing every single in and out of the rules arent the same thing missing one detail of one section of the rules something that the commentators didnt have to worry about last year since there was no commentating on the prequalifying rounds really isnt as big a deal as you make it out to be
id have gotten a clearer version of commentary if mb3 wasnt constantly adding something when the other commentator starts talking
knowing what ships can be fielded when is a pretty general idea of the rules
i would encourage any player who would like to give commentating a shot to do so there are several groups running alternative commentary and several people doing their own commentary of matches that are up on youtube there are many excellent tools to do a simultaneous broadcast either thru own3dtv or thru a shoutcast style radio stream the more the community is involved the better the overall tournament will be for all involved if people are interested in the details for setting it up feel free to evemail me and i can help you get everything you need workingas for my performance on sunday i was similarly displeased with my cast although i might not have used some of the harsher terms that some have used in this thread the cast from home was significantly more difficult than i had predicted i had several technical difficulties and all of my practice for the tournament and experience from other games involved me casting with my cocasters next to me and someone else operating the camera for a more detailed description i would point people to my post on the at forum which i will shamelessly cp here for your conveniencein the past if a caster has proved to be consistently less skilled than expected they are benched from commentary during at least the finals weekend and only utilized in the couch segments i hope that this does not happen to myself or any of the other commentators but we all want to see the tournament be the best possible production it can be we are still getting the hang of this home casting setup and the feel of the 6man matches also we are using the qualifiers as a good opportunity to test out the proper ratio of color vs commentary and how polarized each of the commentators should be in their specialties i hope that we can provide the viewers with the best show possible as we all get back into tournament mode but if you have constructive criticism for us i am fairly certain that all of us would appreciate it
obama commentary for atxi would probably be a good thing i am not saying bolton is a commentator i pay attention to but the aforementioned gal did make the other commentators seem alot better for the comment of giving commentary a shot i fully intend to i applied and got interviewed this year but a brain short i had threw me off in begining i think cost me alot next year i will reapply and be even betterconstructive commentary for bolton just try to inject more energy into your commentary the only real complaint i ever have and hear most often on the forums is that when the match gets going you fall into a sort of single tone sometimesenergy man get psyched about the fightclear any preconceived notions about who wins and always be on preparation for that unusual turn of events or imagine it even if it doesnt happen having that adrenalin prepped up expecting some interesting fight will show to the audience
supporting
got to agreei know commentators can make mistakes and we can forgive that but this guy does not have a clue get rid of him
place a bot into this in deep nullsec with scouts around ship safes up and cloaks if a red gets close just like bots do these days anyway
i think the game economy speaks for itself you can claim that nullsec could be botted all you want or spread rumors about the large number of bots out there but a trip out there will tell you a lot more mining anywhere in nullsec requires a pretty decent amount of protection for one thing you cant just safe up every time a nonblue enters the system in many places at least because there will be constant nonblue traffic through the system all day if it doesnt have an active gate camp also if a covetor or hulk cannot always enter warp faster than an interceptor can enter system and point them what makes you think a capital ship canallinall its just way more productive to botmine veldspar in highsec than the expensive ores in nullsec
adding highlevel ships that will increase yieldpercharacter for botters is a bad thing
you obviously never saw the drone space ratting bots in action if you think botting in null requires intensive securityedit if the yield were significant enough it would be feasible to park the miner well away from the warpin point for the belt and simply have it stop mining and cloak when a nonblue enters the system
one thing often missing from null sec production chains is the basic ore unless its imported from jita through a complicated nonsensical process of building the base ore into stuff transporting the stuff to null and then recycling the stuff in null sec back into tritanium etcwhy do i mention this need for low ends in null sec particularly for the stupidly expensive supercaps because the capital mining ship could be limited to fast and efficient mining of these scarce low end ores focusing the mining capital ship on low ends in null sec would help to meet an established need possibly reduce the need for a kind of stupid workaround and also save the high ends for more conventional miners and ships
theres no attempt in my proposal to give incentive to those that adamantly dont want local chat intel removed to jump on board as theres no reasonable compromise that could be made with them the position of afk cloaking whiners and players that want their pve immune from pvp is so unreasonable that theres no point even having dialogue with themnow thats not to put everyone that objects to local chat changes in that above camp theres legitimate concerns as well some of which are found in this thread however the impact that a badly designed chat window inadvertently has on gameplay in eve is huge and as a result this issue is not going away until ccp directly addresses the problem
what exactly are your ideas for dscan assuming local chat lost its intel function
very simply no we have already perfected the pvp manuever called run away and dont want to use it all the time in our sandboxbesides ccp has already implemented this feature just for you go live in a wormhole and enjoy it
i think apart from a pos update wspace is working as intended
1 to this easy blob mechanics are killing eve
anyone who suggests increased mass or extended time on wormholes can  off theyre either completely ignorant of wormhole space or desperate to bend it to their own advantagejust sort the pos systems out and wormholes would be perfect
perhaps some remote td making target hard to hit or a reverse target painter lowering sig of target with stacking penalties ofcyou could have the new destroyers supporting larger ships by reducing incoming fire and the modules would essentially just be remote versions of stuff that already exists you can call the modules aa and make them run on ammo with suitable puffpuff animations if you wish p 
1 bring back the frills
im appalled that thukker mix would remove the wingy bits from the vagabond bring back the frill returning to the game to see my vagabond defrilled was wellnot thrilling
wtf what the frillpoor vagai fully support this proposal
although i will not be at fanfest this coming year a flash mob dancing friller behind the camera during the interviews would definitely get our point across if necessary the frill is available for costuming effect as well
i had a frill and i liked it bring it back
it is known
agreed the frill is an essential part of the vagabond can you imagine the tempest without the wingy bits
a vagabond without frills is like a lizard without a tail except they are at the other end and there are two of them anderrrr  just bring back those frills
point proven instead of responding to the points people raise you just repeat troll
hahahhahahahahhahahahahaaaaaatold you we would see hard coded changes if players did not change their waysbravo ccp bravo i love the direction of the mining ship changes and have had people who are teetering on quitting eve alltogether make comments like we might even start mining again with those new ships i applaud the highsec players who have stood up to the nullsec  pvp crowd and sent the unambiguous message to ccp that highsec social players desreve content improvements too ccp have heard it and are delivering beautifully considered changes to mining ships to all those who say if you dont like it leave ccp has just shown it does not want players to leave they are radically changing an entire class of ships for the better to support a gentle playstyle if that is not sufficient to retain that customer group more changes will be likely
next thing we gonna hear will be miners complaining the procurer has only 1 high slot outputs 13rd of the hulk bla bla bla

victory for highsec playersin the thread greifers vs ccp i prediceted hard coded changes if players did not change their ways over hulkageddon players did not and ccp has now confirmed it is acting with the new mining ship rebalancingbravo ccp bravo i love the direction of the mining ship changes and have had people who are teetering on quitting eve alltogether make comments like we might even start mining again with those new shipsi applaud the highsec players who have stood up to the nullsec  pvp crowd and sent the unambiguous message to ccp that highsec social players desreve content improvements too ccp have heard it and are delivering beautifully considered changes to mining shipsto all those who say if you dont like it leave ccp has just shown it does not want players to leave they are radically changing an entire class of ships for the better to support a gentle playstyle if that is not sufficient to retain that customer group more changes will be likely we do not need a new corporation for advocating for highsec players all we need to do is to post considered detailed points  and to have the courage to stand up to the trolls and flames of the pvpers who simply say things like if you dont like it quit this game needs it paying customers to stay not to quit so we need to stand up to that attitude and to advocate for harsher punishments for greifers  scammers security and bounty system fixes etc that protect the trader citizens of eve
yes lets waste manhours on lulzsec content that no one will care about we already have lowsec incursions once you use it you get to have more until then no soup for you
lowsec incursions were run just the same as high sec incursions with the difference that u had 4 or 5 entities fighting over the 1 incursion testgoons fearless balex team liquid off the top of my head they werent run 237 like the high sec ones bc of the pvp honestly lowsec needs a 2nd incursion and to be completly reverted to the old way of incursions bc the way they are now the risk is way too high to run sites with the random spawn mechanic
all this would do is create yet another barrier between highsec and lowsec  nullsec  w spaceimagine you have a highsec corp  alliance whatever that wants to go into lowsec and set up some pocos or get some r16 moon goo or just mine some hemorphitenow living in highsec they only have access to things that exist in highsec no drugs no cap ships and now no t3s also their only combat experience is with wardecksso they get their little fleet together load some customs office gantries in their cargo holds listen to that speech from brave heart and jump into the first lowsec system they come across and on the other end of the gate they are greeted by a bunch of 100nm ab tengus all hopped up on blue pills with triage carrier support and blap dreads its these barriers to entry that prevent people from exploring any sort of existence outside of highsec if anything we should remove some restrictions from highsec or make the difference between highsec and lowsec more of a gradual progression rather than distinct barrieri honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
supported if mb3s performance next weekend is as bad as the first
yo next weekend is going to own the commentary team worked out the kinks on this first weekend and now were in the zone if the tournament is a pretty lady were going to be running a train on her this weekend
just posting to say that gorion wassenar should have totally been picked insteadentertaining color commentary combined with indepth knowledge of the game and a willingness to make bold and informed predictions yes pleasei dont mean to begrudge mb3 or any other commentators but youre getting an opportunity a lot of us would kill for  dont halfass it or try to be cute be professional be knowledgable and occaisionally lighten the mood imo
please send my 50 to amantus
find your own gay magician to extort scabmbolton 3rd  whilst i enjoyed the hubris of your response if you think you can do better why dont you  off and do your own commentary nerds you have not outlined which areas of your commentary you felt were lacking and were working on if you could briefly list what you felt were your major failings then we can point out any youve missed xxx
never not no mb3s
i like mb3 i dont care if he doesnt know  i like his humor same goes for zastrowi enjoy that they both mix things upas much as i appreciate raivi and his knowledge a constant straight face fact casting would get boring within 2 matches
shut it bolton
hi i am now mb3s altsnipthis post has been edited for violations of rule 7  trolling is prohibited rule 20  post constructively etcisd tyrozanensigncommunity communications liaisonsinterstellar services department
what a delightful thought you dear sweet fragile little thing
reported impersonating a member of the commentary teamchin up m8 ive also reported michel boltoniii for the same thing
butbutbut i was just trying to satisfy you  so no puppys for me then hu
let me tell you about satisfying ry ryit aint got much to do with puppies m8
rofl at the last part 1 yup i support the ops proposal
being a few seconds behind what is happening and misspeaking sometimes would be one thing how ever mbiii it is painfully obvious that you have no clue how the game works at this scale your lack of experience and insight is what makes the terrible personality and mistakes that much more obvious
supporting obama
i didnt know who this guy was until i started watching the tournament this year i love eve online and think the tournament is one of the coolest events in any game ive ever played but i have to say this michealboltoniii is making the whole thing unwatchable for me as a reporter or commentator one of the first rules is to not insert yourself into the story you are covrering the story is not about you know one cares about who you are or what you think about unrelated topics you have the opportunity of a lifetime to commentate in this event and make it enjoyable for everyone you are completely throwing it away and making a total ass out of yourself here are some very very basic things you could have done to prepare that you obviously overlooked because you are more concerned about your stupid image than being good at the job you were givenresearch the teams see what setups they had in previous tourneys are the same players backknow how to identify modules weapons drones tanks visually on ships before they take damage we know something is armor tanked when it shields get one shot try giving more insight that the viewer doesnt already have stop cheering for people stop making a big deal when a ship pops you act like a little fanboy who is watching his first kill in eve act like youve seen it before pay attention to the stream you spend too much time talking about yourself and unrelated crap and let details slip through the cracks that are obvious to the viewer if i know more about whats going on in the fight than the commentator there is something wrong you seem very concerned with what people think of you and your stupid image if you want people to respect you try doing your homework and come to the next round of matches with some insight your performance thus far has been pathetic and i feel bad for everyone at ccp and all the alliances making this happen when you come in and make a mockery of the whole event chuxup
bolton is terrible he gives me the ear cancer
the reason this thread was created was because my proposal is significantly different from the other thread here on the same subjecti like many others in eve online hate seeing caps or supercaps sding and depriving us of our delicious killmails so here is my proposal for the changes to sd mechanics 1 killmails or loss mails are always generated this means that anyone who sds their cap inside of a force field will receive a loss mail it also means that the main reason to self destruct will be taken away and most of the people who sd will no longer be using this cheap tactic as a means of denying killmails 2 self destruct will not work if you have a ship in your sma of your this applies to everything if you have an orca carrier rorq or any other ship with an sma you can not initate self destruct until you jetison these ships in to space 3 you can not eject from a ship or board another ship that has had its self destuct mechanism initiated i have personally seen someone initiate self destruct on his ship then eject from his ship and initiate self destruct on several other ships that were ejected 4optional insurance will no longer payout for a self destructed ship lets face it there is not a single company out there that will pay out on a purposefully breached contract ie life insurance doesnt pay out if you commit suicide car insurance doesnt pay out if you blow up your own car and get caught so you should not get money for destroying your own ship 5 optional all offensive modules turn off and your ship stops moving when you initiate self destruct on your ship going down like a coward should not entail you the ability to get more kills or the ability to run away well there it is in a very convoluted nutshell almost everyone who has seen a ship explode in10 percent structure only to realize that no killmail was generated can and will agree with me here self destruct mechanics as they are are broken i understand the need for this to happen ie so that you dont get griefed for 4 hours as you wait for someone to destroy your ship but there should be penalties for taking this route as well
id say treat it like concord if youre selfdestructing and someone else has any form of aggression on you they get on the killmaili completely disagree here sd should primarily be a means of denying loot you shouldnt have to eject an expensive ship from your carrier while selfdestructing to deny pirates the modules fitted on that carrier it should destroy all ships cargo and fittings i see no point in this rule if you self destruct in combat you obviously expected to lose the ship anyway id say insurance should treat it as if you lost it in combatafter all with the killmail being generated the only reason to sd is to screw pirates out of the loot this would mean that in order to get payment for a selfdestructed ship you would also have to generate a lossmail that would turn up on an apiverified killboard presto balance its not going down like a coward to deny loot just fix the killmail system and most of this behavior goes away
i like the idea of self destructing to destroy loot rather than just a way to get out of lossmails i dont know if self destructing should destroy all the loot but it should destroy more than just blowing up naturallyi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
if you believe that i have a bridge to sell you mint condition
isnt it obvious alliance like yours bots dont count as bots semiafk highsec miners count as botssince drone alloy nerf hardly affected minerial prices at all its all the more proof there are fewer bots there than in highsec right
kahn soomer wroteone thing often missing from null sec production chains is the basic ore unless its imported from jita through a complicated nonsensical process of building the base ore into stuff transporting the stuff to null and then recycling the stuff in null sec back into tritanium etcwhy do i mention this need for low ends in null sec particularly for the stupidly expensive supercaps because the capital mining ship could be limited to fast and efficient mining of these scarce low end ores focusing the mining capital ship on low ends in null sec would help to meet an established need possibly reduce the need for a kind of stupid workaround and also save the high ends for more conventional miners and shipsi completely agree with this consider the effects it would have if you have too little understanding of macroeconomics to get what im saying please save us all the trouble and just dont commentmegacyte and zydrine costs in nullsec would go down substantially and if the capital mining ship were able to mine all ores equally then nullsec production workers could make stuff much more easily and avoid the horrendous logistical nightmare of transporting ore from highsechighsec mineral prices might go down simply because nullsec wont be purchasing from highsec it wont have anything to do with nullsec selling to highseclet me make this implicitly clearnullsec does not want your isk they dont have any use for it if they dont have to buy anything from you
affirmative conclusion from a negative premisethree times in two sentences wow
i think the reason removing drone minerals and tech 1 modules didnt affect mineral prices much is because people generally didnt bother scooping up that crap since it didnt sell very well anyway im sure there were people who ratted in the drone regions and scooped it all up but ratting bounty npcs has always been more popularhowever if mineral prices had gone up high enough and gunmining had been left in it would have become profitable and would have prevented the value of minerals from rising as far as they could rise
drones didnt give bounties prenerf  the only reward generated was by the drone compound drops in their wrecks which when reprocessed gave the equivalent value of a bounty in minerals this had vast implications on the economy of eve because no matter how much pure currency isk was generated from ratting and injected into the game the supply of goods being created would still be capped by the amount of minerals available and that was capped by by the max yield of a bonused hulk in other words even if you had trillions of isk you couldnt just buy a titan fleet instantly and steamroll space  people had to sit in hulks and mine for xthousand of manhours to make it possible you couldnt just pour your raw isk into a csaa the end effect was a semblance of balance between isk generation and commodity generation too much isk floating around and mudflation would make it more worthwhile to mine instead what gunmining did was remove that cap  the system was balanced around the idea that gunmining in a moderately expensive ratting ship would match the same output as a hulk this system was broken when people started gunmining in faction ships marauders and carriers it became obliterated when the drone compound minerals were reinvested into supercarriers and titans that in turn singlehandedly dwarfed mining fleets in yield yield to create more gunmining supercaps and titans not bots the end losers in this scenario were miners everywhere else as resource generation in this manner crushed all other forms of mineral creation as well as nullsec as the drone regions mineral output introduced a supercaps arms race that otherwise would not be possible simply due to lack of available resoures
anyways a lowend capital mining ship is a good idea as at the moment there is no incentive to mine lowends in 00 over highsec and there really should be
well if gunmining really did have that much impact then why didnt it affect the mineral costs much is it because highsec wasnt strongly affected by gunmining
large scale market speculation already sent the price of mins shooting upward since the change was known months beforehand and was preceded by sreegs massive bot purge which set off mineral hoarding itself for a while morphite was worth 16k a unit after all
that makes sense actually it explains why the other minor updates appeared to have such a big impact on minerals it was really that
actually a while ago i kind of posted the same idea with a bit more detail
i figure what youre doing is the following which needed some background tothe blueprints are not a literal set of instructions theyre a cartridge yes blow on your bpo before you insert it that you insert into the control station of the manufacturing arraysthe ability to copy it is written into the software that controls the cartridge which is both hardware and software self wiping if tampered withcopies are onto blank cartridges 1 isk is a lot so assume you get a lot for them and you can reuse them these are less well securedthe invention process is breaking into the software and making changes without the hardware detecting it and purging everythinga failed runalso explains why copies are run limited now ccp make this a chronicle
it is a little disappointing to hear so little of countering arguements for the wardec fix i would really like to know the rationalization the the attacker pays less than the defender side for allies is the idea to keep the defender in a war on the defenselets go over why people go to wardisruption of highsec supply chain of enemygriefing carebear highsec corpsbragging rights and settling disputes between mutual participants besides the last one there really is little upside potential for warring from a defenders perspective why bother fighting when you can just drop corp or dock up for a weekand if you do so attacker wins if his goal was 1 why not make the defender gain part of the wardec fee from the attacker if the attacker is forced to surrenderin a mutual war where the defender has unfair ally costs they should be given unfair gains if they force the attacker to surrender
1 for bigger1 for bounce
why is the frill gonebring it back
remove local completely from null sec and only show people that write in local for low secwould make life a lot harder for macro miners and bots while making pvp much more interesting imo
then you will be quite properly able to explain to people that mining is not meant to be risk free and that they need to tank thier ships however with the new balancing that will actually be possible  you wont be able to kill a 300 million isk ship with 3 cheap fit destroyers if you want to spend 10 billion to gank people with you can and will kill nearly anything anywhere what has been completely off is the balance  they added cheap high dps ships to the game but didnt rebalance the mining ships now they are remedying that oversight they ought to have done it a long time ago but they are doing it now so bravo better late than never
clearly did not read the devblog properly covetorhulks wont be seeing much change its the procurers and retrievers with their t2 variants
yay lets see how inflated we can make the eve economy by making hi sec a safe place osuicide ganking is fantastic for the smart miners keeping ore prices up and bad for those that just afk mine in hi sec just like it should bemaking hi sec safe would also destroy the thing that most people find attractive about eve the sandbox
currently in eve we have long range scanners probing local directional scanner and the overview all cluttered and if you want all the functionality of them taking up most of the usable screen real estate ccp has been spending a lot of resources fixing ships so they look beautiful which would be great if they werent hiding behind a bunch of windows and tabs so i sat down and thought about how one could go about completely overhauling the sensory experience of the eve playergoalscondense all scanningsensoroverview data into one easily usable compact and highly functional toolremove local as an intel toolgenerally make the sensor information gameplay more varied and interestingopen the door to new and interesting ships modules and tactics that fit within the eve universewhat i wanted to avoidnerfing current gameplaymaking anything more convoluted then it is nowwith that in mind i got started redesigning the sensor suites that players can use the end result of this process is a tool that i believe allows for a great deal of depth interesting gameplay and customizationstep one remove local as an intel tool completely it is unneeded yes there should be an intel tool that is roughly equivalent to local but local itself is a chat channel and should be divorced completely from the intel gathering process step tworedesign the directional scanner to be more intuitive and useful as an intel tool with that in mind it is combined with the probing scanner interface into one window because there really is no reason not to have them as one window it is also made to be automated and its cycle time range and precision are now dictated by skills you can also now see the cone of area that you are scanning with it in the solar system window allowing you to quickly and easily scan around passivelythis system becomes known as the passive scanner system it provides you with limited information on a ship just basic things such as ship size and if skilled up sufficiently class in order to tell more about a ship you need to actively scan it you can use your ships onboard scanner or a new module that could be added to improve itto explain in general a ship in space flying along not trying to hide itself will produce a certain amount of a signature the spaceship equivalent of cavitation noises a normal passive scanner system will be able to tell hull size and a skilled pilot ship class but thats all when you need more information you need to launch an active scan of course active scanning makes a lot of noise the ship you are scanning will very likely be able to tell its being scanned unless the scanning pilot is fit very carefully for stealth an active scan will provide you with the pilots show info the specific ship class and its current velocity and energy output its energy output is a factor of how much noise the ship is making from modules running sensors active engines on and that sort of thing now it is impossible to hide from an active scan once youre active scanned youve been found however active scanning is useless if the passive doesnt pick you up in the first place and herein lies cloaking and a new mechanic known as running silent a given ship can in an emergency power itself completely down so that it produces no energy output since energy output is what the passive scanner is looking at when you go silent if you have the skills the ship is possible to make quiet the passive stealth system that ccp has in the database would fit nicely in here and the opponent isnt fit for finding you you could go silent and be invisible to the passive scan scan probes and active scans would of course still detect you step threecombine in the overview into this system as short range sensors these incorporate all the existing functionality of the current overview into one window that could be combined with the long range sensor window if the player wished it the sensor buttons pop up in the selected items area when you click an item that has the sensor options instead of the close range overview optionsthis plan is still very much a work in progress but the basic goal is to put all the sensor suites and options and in system intel tools into one easily usable system that allows maximum customization and also opens the door to interesting new gameplay options and to sort of make scanning a full time profession in a fleet where it would be useful to have a dedicated aegis type ship adding an interesting new role and new gameplay sort of sonar games cat and mouse type stuffsome ideas for things that could be added with these changesships specifically set up as huge powerful scanning suitesmodules designed to improve passive and active scanstealth systems designed to help reflecthide from scanslong range not on grid detection from cloaked shipsso thats the idea im open to changing it and overhauling it to get it up to be something where the devs would actually take an interest in it
if you werent terrible at eve you wouldnt be whining to remove a perfectly legitimate game mechanicprotip figure out how to solve your problem instead of whining on the forums about it
this would hurt the economy of marketing the t3s how did you come up with this proposal without thinking it all thru
first i searched but didnt find a topic quite like this most of them are about removing insurance period so i apologize if this is a repostshort and sweeti propose the removal of default 40 payout no purchased plan insurance for all ships except t1 frigates destroyers cruisers and battlecruisers this insurance is in place to assure that no single loss is catastrophic and leaves a player with no money something that should only be a concern for younger players in these smaller ship classes additionally the idea of an insurance payout without purchase of an actual insurance plan is absurdim proposing a limited removal of default insurance because this should be far less controversial than more sweeping changes to the insurance system we all understand that it is a problematic isk faucet but the more significant changes that have been proposed resulted in much wailing and gnashing of teethi feel that this is a step in the right direction that pretty much everyone can agree withill edit the op or reply as necessary
so basically remove the default insurance for battleships because calling t2t3 insurance an isk faucet when you get the t1 value of the ship has to be a jokewhy not just say no insurance on capitals at all
battleships and capitals throw in t2s and t3s because why notid agree with the removal of insurance on capitals period but the entire point of this proposal is to be a smaller step that garners more significant support
why ever since the change in the insurance formula insurance isnt a big isk faucet at all and the default insurance has never been an issue to begin with you say we all understand that it is a problematic isk faucet but as far as i can see it really isnt at all please provide substantial proof that there is indeed an issue otherwise its just your opinion not actual fact unless you can actually show that there is an actual issue not just that you feel it should change the answer is flat out no not supported
supported i agree with everything chuxup said
probly very few that use defenders but i for 1 liked how it was most of the launchers no longer use defenders and only the heavy launcher can use the hvy defender i use defenders semi regularly but since the changes im not comfortable with out them where i want them if i could get the change reverted back to only 1 type of defender and allowed in all the launcher id be a happier player
as said in the german threadi think faster targets would be better
my reason for writing this is to point your attention to how unpackaged ships are not displayed in the  thus im required to double click the ship hangar inventory to open a separate icon window in order to know if i have unpackaged ships in my hangar this defeats the purpose of the ui as it makes me dependent on the older style of icon windowmultiple windows open to navigate through my assets i hope this can be resolved soon thank you for your time
1id also like some sexy undies too if were going to get a jiggle what is with the prison grey undies right now its ughalso is walking in stations going to get trampolines too
lots of things go up and downthe stock marketthermometershemlinesspiritsso ccp please fix thisup and down its not hard its only naturalof course you could make it hard if you try but thats not the point
bring the frill back pretty please
bring the frill back
i have beef with this defrilling bring it back
frill me plz i miss it so much the frill for me at least is part of the reason i fear the vaga so much
i dont always fly my vagabond but when i do its to slake my frill lustbring it back or i will be forced to wear my wifes frilly underwearactually i might wear that cute thong anyway
i think you need to threaten ccp with sending them large numbers of pictures of you wearing said underwear until they agree to put the frills back on the vagabond
i sure as  hope nobody nobody forgets about the tempest fleet issues square wingy bits eithertfi
you dont want local  go to wh
im sure you and the 2 other people spamming dscan while the solo scary afk guy sits in system wont cause appreciable degredation of system performance if were safe in a wormhole with 20 people spamming dscan with no local when there could be dozens of afk cloakers without us knowing while running ops im sure youll be safe if one guy in a cloaked ship is enough to scare you out of mining i say 2 people because why else would you be running for the hills when one lone person shows up in local in a cloaky ship
big lag generatorlmao where do you guys get these things
its from that post that all those alts keep linking too whenever anyone mentions wormholes apparently one time ccp said they added the 2sec dscan spam delay to improve server performance therefore dscan  big lag generatoredit its like saying the government requires hunting licenses to reduce the damage to local wildlife therefore deers were going extinct
hey troll ccp atlas there is a new 2 second delay in using the directional scanner this has been done for server performance reasons
im sure you and everyone will be spamming dscan within 2 seconds if you not see the local anymore but need intel from probbes ships etcso stop your snipplease no personal attacks isd tyrozan
we live in wormholes we have no local and always spam dscan every 2 seconds and with all this we dont experience magical big lag generators that was the contents of my post and dont call me stupid just because you dont understand the english language enough to read my post properly
this  dscan is a big lag generator read my second to last post for analogy
so here is the idea ded and concord are being swamped trying to take care of all the highsec suicide ganking and lowsec piracy therefore they form the dedva program through the program pilots with high enough sec status can sign up with a ded agent once signed up they will become immune to concord attacks provided they continue to operate within dedva guidelines and regulations so how it will work is that each dedva agent will be given a special white  next to their name dedva agents will be able to attack targets in high and lowsec without a concord response or a sec hit as long as they only go after ded targets a pilot is marked as a ded target by doing any number of things the first is suicide ganks in highsec that is actually attacking someone in highsec and succeeding in blowing them up before concord shows up regardless of sec standing will earn them a ded flag allowing dedva pilots to attack them for a time period determined by the number of suicide ganks theyve performed this increases exponentially so each offense results in a longer flag the second way to earn ded flags is piracy again regardless of sec status the higher the security the system the more long lasting the flag and the fewer ships needed to produce a flag however piracy flags are not exponential meaning that pirates can still be pirates the third method is to attack a dedva warship this results in a immediate flagthe last way is to have a 8 or more sec statusnow a dedva flag and a concordokken flag are not the same a ded flag wont go away after your ship explodes it wont go away after your pod explodes either itll go away when the timer is up if your a criminal they can come after younow of course being a ded agent is not without its limits and failing to operate within the acceptable ded guidelines will result in being thrown out of ded and possibly a sec hit depending on the severity of the crimeded agents are not allowed to attack non flagged targets the first offense will result in a one week suspension the second will result in a 5 sec hit a dedva flag and a permanent ban from rejoining without going through a costly appeals processded agents are not allowed to mine ore in highsec and agents wont give them missions this is explained rp wise to make sure the ded agents arent sidelining for a shady customer the real reason is so miners and carebears cant hide under the umbrella of dedva they have to actually do somethingalliance members cant join dedva unless all of their corps are marked as ded friendly corps to be marked as ded friendly a corp cannot declare war it cannot hold territory in 00 half the members need to be dedva agents and none of its members can have a negative sec status if a ded friendly corp is wardecced they can pay to have the wardec lifted or the members will have their ded status pulled for the duration of the warthere are of course benefits to working for the ded you gain access to a concord lp store in yulai in order to earn lp points you have to defeat multiple pilots and the points you get from them are dependent on how dangerous they are how valuable their ships are and how many times theyve been flagged its scaled so that killing the same pilot over and over again or killing novice pirates over and over again will give almost no lp while killing a 10 gankathron worth 250 million isk will get you a large amount this means that you cant make an alt and farm kill them for lp pointsalso scattered throughout space will be ded support agents any dedva member can go to this agent and request a target the agent will randomly select a pilot flagged against the dedva in the current region and give you their locationits basically a concord militia specifically set up to go after flashy types adding this in would then open the door to starting up a piracysmuggling expansion and adding pirate militias too
while this is and has always been a great idea i vaguely remember it was mentioned back in the day when that skill was first introduced and im remembering the usual response adding the pos gunner is wonderful but they said it had the drawback that a pos gunner cant get killmails because it simply cant be done it would take too much time to program etc same response as given when discussing the proposal to add a timercap usage limits on the covert ops cloaking devices to prevent 247 afk hostile campinggriefheres hoping the proposed revamp will help get this improvement accomplishedpos gunners deserve some love
the ability for neutrals to remote repair war targets in high sec is undoubtedly a game mechanic that is constantly exploited by greifer corps allowing them to utilize neutral alts or allies to repair them when engaged in combat and gain a very very unfair advantageit seems to me and i know many people who agree that the use of this is a game exploit that is parallel to cheating and makes no sense when seriously thought aboutwhen in war concord allows enemies to fight eachother but does not have any mechanic that eliminates neutrals from aiding these enemies when by effect the war dec system and the isk involved in declaring war allows combat to occur the concord assembly has plenty of conventions that stipulate the various terms of engagement and yet does not have no balancing factor pertaining to sfor instance a neutral can repair a war target and then when targeted just dock  because they do not get aggression this allows then to work completely unassailable and causes pilots to lose more ships than is necessary this is completely unfairconcord being as they are the police would not allow neutrals to fight without being paid to allow so as is done using the war declaration system the use of neutrals makes combatants aiding war targets avoid such isk penalties or the prolonged exposure to kill rights in doing so this allows them to work alongside griefers many being alts of the greifers themselves and ruins the consistency of the war dec and concord system while making the griefing corps able to rack up kills without much chance of losingmy opinion is that the neutrals should become unable to dock as the war targets are once they use their reps and that they should be concorded or forced to declare war immediately themselves as a result of the first action of repairing this would both eliminate the s capability of being unassailable and would also provide concord with the isk from these neutrals by forcing them to wardec or die to concord
just bring alpha to kill the logis failing that have a mwd mach or cynabal bump them really far awaythere are tactics available to you use them
with all due respectplease read this post
i have a pos gunner idea on this one 
just quoting to agree that a carrier with 20 drones on the field and 10 large turret slots would be weak in any way shape or form
actually that chart doesnt really show much of an issue at all those numbers show 58b generated via insurance 125b paid out minus 67b spent insuring ships which is actually down 11b from the 689b generated in 2010 shown on that page in the grand scheme of things that 58b generated really isnt much at all and then when you think about whose hands that money is actually going through it can even be considered a good thing that insurance money is going to people who go out there and fight and lose ships those people are more likely to put the money straight back into the economy by buying another ship to fight in yes it is generating a bit of isk into the economy but that isk has a high velocity which is a very good thinghowever you talk about only removing the default insurance from bs ships so this would reduce the insurance payouts of pilots of bs and capital ships who lose their ship without bothering to insure them at all the only time when a bs or capital is in any real danger is when it is used in pvp and any sensible pilot is going to insure their expensive ship if they are going into a fight i highly doubt that there are more than a halfdozen uninsured bs ships lost on the average day in eve so your whole proposal would probably amount to removing about 115b in isk generated per day not really worth the developer time to change it a realworld analogy would probably be something like taking a rock away from a kid and claiming youre deweaponizing a country yes there is one less weapon but it really isnt a factor at all
also calling it an isk faucet in the same way as other ones isnt quite honest this is because like was said there are costs to place insurance on ships beyond the standard 40 costs on insurance 40 is included in that graph btw and the financial cost to generate a ship is spent in another faucet minerals and such that are always being generated youre removing those minerals and such in exchange for a lesser amount of isk especially when talking about t2t3 hulls which give t1 payouts therefore mitigating the economic impact of these particular isk faucets
not a single monocle in this thread all opinions irrelevantmb3 king of my heart that unrequited love down with mb3 him and his silky smooth commentary can  right off
this 1000 times this especially the bolded parts
would be nice to get some of the csm members to show support for this proposaldmc
you would think after 11 pages of comments and posts on this thread people would take notice and see a need
one would think thati am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
excellent ideasupported however im afraid this could be slightly strong in numbers depending on the mechanic no need falcons v2
they would essentially be equals of logistics except preventing the damage upfront instead of healing it after in addition destroyer hulls are much more easy to alpha than cruisersyou could also have them mount defender missiles but instead of shooting down the missiles of their target they defend their target from incoming hostile missile fire
thats the general idea defender missiles would be the antimissile portionthese things would be vulnerable to ewar like anything else so you would want a few falcons around to attempt to jam the defending destroyers they cant run ciws if they lose target lock on the friendly i guess the midslots on these destroyers would have to fit eccmgood feedback keep it coming
your analogy is crap from laggeneratorjust few eve players live in wormholes continuoslyi realy like when an idiot know everything better than ccprepeat ccp atlas there is a new 2 second delay in using the directional scanner this has been done for server performance reasonsthat was when just few pvp players spammed dscan when enemy appeared on localthat was when just 15k players played with eve and not 40k50kbut now with your idiot ideathe whole playerbase would be needed with this steadily to dealthe whole playerbase must be spamming dscan continously because they wont see the local anymore  continuos 50000 new requests2 seconds bravo you created the new flood button to eve server

im not proposing that they remove local in nullsec but i am arguing that it is a massive lag generator the difference in lag between no delay on dscan and a 2second delay is infinite almost literally the change was made because people could spam dscan faster than it was readable many many times per second by reducing the delay to two seconds it significantly reduced the impact of that lag to a point where it is all but unnoticeable todayi was also pointing out that lag from dscan wouldnt hurt you in your extremely small groups of miners that are scared of a single covops ship as there wouldnt be enough of you to cause that lag in your own words and server lag is generated on a nodebynode basis it doesnt matter that there are now 40k50k people playing eve when most of those are in highsec and even if they were all spamming dscan there it wouldnt impact your nullbearingalso just a few eve players live in wormholes continuously but that number is more significant than you think im sure of that
lol more significaly wh players p you are a joke few hundred players not count thats not number for dscanbut 50k player is countthe difference in lag between no delay on dscan and a 2second delay is infinite almost literallyoh man you are a literaly gthe dscan spamming numbers generating the lag that was in the past few hundredssecond when ccp changed and after your idiot idea would be ten thousandssecond because the players not clicking to scan button in same time but they would be ust to use everywhere from 00 to high sec check probes  enemies wartargets etcthis is another idiot request for iwin button from a coward cloaker snip and this idea has technicaly difficulties for server which would be generate massive server requests to server which is generating laggo to wh and enjoy your no local area and enjoy your cloak there little coward and dont want to create a ping of death buttonpost has been edited for attempts to bypass the filters please address the topic instead of attacking the posterisd tyrozan
just as a parting note before i finally leave this thread that has grown beyond ridiculous there are at least a thousand characters living in wormhole space at any given time and you keep mentioning that high sec players spamming dscan would ruin your nullsec experience these statements as well as your general lack of the english language and veiled insults makes it obvious that it isnt worth talking or listening to you this makes me feel safe that there will be no impact as a result of your calling every one a cloaky  whenever they argue with you or use any covops ship
man u counting your wh roaming fleets  pyour argument its a joke the wh is the smallest part of eve population smaller than low sec
wow should i resist you linking a picture that proves me right i said there are at least a thousand people in wormhole space you linked a picture which at the least showed 4 of eve in wh space and you also said 50000 people in eve that is equal to over 2000 people in wormhole space i no longer feel bad about leaving this thread solely to you and your alts after that astounding display of math and lack of server mechanic understanding
again you are know better the things than ccp bravoand god sakeover 400000 subscriber in eve and 4050k active players log on to server daily thats 25 of all subscribersso how much active wh players log in every day  500  wow thats big numbers1 of active playersthose dscan button spamming from 1 of players is nothinga smart man is understand this if useing his brain but you dontyou want just the iwin button for cloakers but dont understand you want create a massive lag generator on server with this idiot ideaso i asking again you next great idea will be remove scanner probes from dscanner for easy catch because your experiences is weak to catch something
um most players online at any given time are in high sec even during a null battle there are a lot in hs so dscan numbers still wouldnt be all the playersalso server performance can mean many things not just lagbtw the lag from the dscan was on an individual basis you could click faster than it would show results so you would get delayed results it would not cause lag for a person who wasnt doing it and the only thing that lagged for the person spamming dscan was the dscan resultsso it is not an issue the lag i mean
just no to everythingwhen i started playing i was told dont auto pilot when hauling i did it with around 300 mil of noxcium on board while watching tv i paid the price i got blown up but i learned my lesson now if i haul anything expensive i will use a cloak through the gate align cloak and warp sometimes i may even have a scout ahead and check the gates for industrial ships sat around at gates with other ships then reroute if i have toi can mine all day in my retriever and not get blown up i have jet canned for months and only had it flipped once if you want to use a hulk pay attention to what ccp says it is for group operations if you want to use it then use it in a group if you have a couple of battle cruisers sat with them or a bs sat in the belt do you think you would still get poppedinstead all i read are 100s of kill mails 1 hulk sat in a belt in 05 set up for max yield going boom learn something from your mistakes if you want to solo mine do it in a retriever
yeah yeah  killmails for everyone  what struck me reading that plea was we successfully pointed their carrier and destroyed it and 8 billion isk killmailholy hell who in their right mind fits modules on a larger ship worth more than 10x the hull value second the motion that nothing should be done until pos replacement is up and running if they really are going with a modular type of thing then gunnersguns may well be on designated platformsmodules and can thus be handled like regular ships making the whole thing easypeasy to code
opi cant see what problem youre trying to solve because it seems theres noneso after t3s it will be what faction ships ammo and moduleswhat about moving from there if that bothers you so much there are plenty of lokisproteustengus to kill in
says the risk averse self proclaimed high sec pv cough carebear hiding behind concord safety omagad
huh its been awhile since this complaint came up its actually quite refreshingto counter an enemy logi even a neutral one you can blob it with ecm drones have everyone in gang have at least one mediumheavy neutralizer fitted and use it on the logi while focusing dps on the target i highly recommend this alpha it with munninstornadosmaelstroms bring more dps stop playing station games
its not an exploit and while it may feel unfair you can do it too so it is fair i will concede its moderately unsportsmanlike also are you aware they are changing crimewatch this is the system that handles all the flags on who you can and cant shoot in highsec there are several changes coming with the new crimewatch system that remove most of the problems associated with neutral rr 1 rring an aggressed player will give you an aggression timer equal to their current timer so you wont have neutral rr gatestation hugging as if they rr your target you can shoot them down before they can redock assuming you have the firepower to do so 2 they might give neutrals assisting in a war a suspect flag this would allow everyone to shoot them ccp is well aware of the nuetral rr issues and they are making steps to balance them
bumping them is so that you can attack them and kill them without them being able to dockyou have solutions use them otherwise its your own faultthough i do think them not getting a docking timer of 1 minutes is a little annoying
thank you very much i was not aware of the changes comming thought if i ecm them or blow them they can still dock up and switch ship there is no way for me to solo kill a war target that is alone with all due respectif i bump them away  and blow them they can still come back with in a minute switch for pvp ship and come blow me i will no longer be facing 1 person but actually 2 and usually that is not something that you can survive
the best way to get rid of alts is to move away from high sechigh sec is the worst place to be if you dont want meta game encouraged and reinforced mechanics from ccpseems quite logical to everyone neutrals should simply get konkorden if npc alts or get aggression timers automatic concord fees for getting involved in the war leading to characters negawallet if mechanic abused to get free wars for the war time duration once involved but no actually its just considered as valid mechanic and elite pvp just move away from that trash that is high sec pvp or stay in npc corp move to low secnull sec over there its simple like clear water you want some you get some theres no place for pawns
helloi heard rumors of station trading bots as im trying to station trade i have experienced some suspicious 01 cuts on semipopular items i put something up to sell for the cheapest price then recheck from my orders page after approx 20 sec and there are already 4 sell orders beneath mine so my point is ccp should sweep the station trader bots too so flesh type bots like me could operate on the market of semipopular and popular items tooin the meantime we keep satiate buy orders and fatten bot walletsi have a feeling that there is a topic for this somewhere on the forum already imagine a potato in exchange for the inconvinience
10
1 nooo bots
ccp does ban trading bots theyre just less effective at it currently they definitely banned a few dozen during the last great purge you can also report characters as a bot by right clicking their character info and pressing report bot
main problem with this that the market bot names are hidden on the market so you dont know who you need to report even if you suspect an order in miningratting the report system works well but this is a harder nut
yes we should be able to see seller names and would give players several more options be it for reports or meta gaming any way this would be good for the gameyou can be sure id always look the char info before buying whatever dont care about  or  2 mills random number for example but do care about my available options to negate isk to someone
i gave up the trade profession because i just could not keep up with the  how can i how can any real person keep up with a bot running 247summary of eves last four expansions
yeah getting is much harder than others they use less resources to run as well so it isnt as easy to catchand they are very annoying
confirming that this new carrier type would also be able to fit warp interdictor bubble  new 1000mn microwarp mini jump drive
but can it make me a cup of tea
costs are a sink which is why im proposing only the removal of default insurance also ships blowing up removes no isk from the economy
no i agree no isk is removed from the economy but it is a matter of one created currency being created and exchanged for another with minerals minerals are a currency used in the creation of ships and then exchanged for isk via the market just because it doesnt show up in your wallet doesnt mean it isnt a currency and with the way default insurance works the loss of one currency greatly outweighs the creation of the other in terms of relative value and yes minerals dont create isk but thats also not what im saying either
noif you want ccp to remove isk from the game ask them to increase market trading taxes and get rid of those trading skill scamthis single fix would make eve economy get rid of trillions every day instead of being the most powerful isk piUFFFData of all new eden
not only should destroy all the loot but also generate some wave of dmg surrounding the ship sdingim actually more for the idea that if you cant kill something you shouldnt cry about it on forums but man up and move on
so all high sec ores doubling in price from this time last year is not being affectedit may seem the market went relatively unaffected but that is only because most of the increase was seen well before brought on by well informed market speculation the actual update only solidified that speculative price and prices are still far from stableif the removal of drone alloys and meta 1 loot drops truly had no effect on mineral prices than trit would have dropped back down to 33 iskunit by now not be over 6 iskunit and still climbing the average price of pretty much all minerals has at least doubled since this time last year mining is still the lowest income activity as it should be but is now much closer to missioning and ratting than it was a year ago i would say mission accomplished
yes this would be very helpful if limited to player owned stations or with higher values on player owned stations but also change that ridiculous player owned station refining model would be a great improvement for null sec industryisnt this game supposed to be player driven content this needs balance

eyebleedingly bad as the op appears to be i also have to wonder why exactly they nerfed defenders like this
before any boobie physics need to be implemented characters need to be able to walk faster than a casual stroll through the park maybe a little bit of speed and intensity will get them jugs moving
so can we haz now
let chribba name it xd
look what youve done ccp youve made khalia cry
as it stands i feel that the margin between subcaps and capital ships is not large enough i believe that the material costs of capital ships should be increased let me show a simple chart to demonstratevalues are roundedbrawler frigate500k isk1m kgheavy combat cruiser10m isk 20x increase10m kg 10x increasetier 3 battleship200m isk 20x increase100m kg 10x increasedreadnought24b isk 12x increase1b kg 10x increasewith each 10x increase in ship size there is approximately a 20x increase in material costs but there is a much larger gap in combat effectiveness between battle ships and carriersdreadnoughts than there is between cruisers and battleships or between frigates and cruisersyet carriers and dreadnoughts are no more than 12x the cost of battleshipson the small end of the scaletackler frigate100k isk1m kglogistics cruiser5m isk 50x increase10m kg 10x increasetier 1 battleship100m isk 20x increase100m kg 10x increasecarrier12b isk 12x increase1b kg 10x increase
i dont think you understand how markets workbut its build costs are not based around the weight of the ship that is what is normally called a consequence
if i took the time to explain that i already knew you would wrongfully jump to that conclusion along with all the other conclusions that idiots will jump in and claim the post would be all about wrongful conclusions and it wouldnt have much actual contentperhaps you could do me a favor and consider making a tiny leap of logic the approximated values shown here are to show a general trend i couldnt show that trend in numbers of combat value because they dont exist but if they did it would look something more like thisfrigate 1cruiser 07battleship 3carrier 15dreadnought 20
you are wrong thats would an issue
no it wouldntits only an issue for the moron clicking it every second thinking that will give them a better ie more immediate result and since ccp limited it to 2 seconds there is no lag at all from itthere would be no system lag even if ccp left it the way it was the only lag would be on per user basis and only for the person spamming the button and only for their dscan resultsthis is not an issue if someone does something stupid that only effects them then its their problem
fun fact riboka and untouchable heart have lost all credibility in this forum so now the poster turns to his 3rd alt travelbuoy read early posts to convince yourself the tell tale bad english grammar poster is not english speaker gives him away this has been a public service announcement
nothe too much data requests generate lag not the 3 click on dscanthis is same when 30 fleet traveling and the pilots spam the jump button at gates with small pilot numbers the created lag is minimalbut what happen when four full fleet trying to jump with 1024 pilots  the too much data requests in same time generate massive lagatm 00005 players use dscan button same time but if the local would dissapear the all pilots must to use the dscan button continously thats would increasing the dscan requests from servers at least fifty times more than now
i agree with this chart my nullbear main gets bored and lonely because the vast reaches of our blue space isnt always as kosher safe as i want it to be it often is though so ill either go on a lowsec roam from time to time pretty often really or temporarily house inside a wormhole just to make some extra cash i also keep three poorlyskilled highsec alts for purposes of cynoing market work or just to get places fasteri am a nullbear and my toon spread closely matches this chart
you still making ad hominem attacks on people and claiming they are making ad hominem attacks on you
that is a ccp officialy chart from 2012 fanfest ccp dreyjogs state of the economy presentation
i hope you got my point just because most of the characters by number are in highsec does not mean that the majority of players are putting most of their time into highsec i think highsec is the largest focus point by a good margin but not as much as the chart shows i believe it is too far offset by lowvalue alts of which the user does not wish to expend the effort to move them out of highsec while that users main character may likely be living out in lawless space somewhere
right approximately thats true i know this demographical charts just a representative data and we dont know the ccp how counted this data from active players or they are just checked the subscribers where at they at the moments or they checked a longer period the low sec numbers is another question the most of low sec players playing in fw while the other low sec system dieing and too much systems is empty im sure just the lot of fw players generate that 81
still finding it hilarious how he calls people who live in wormholes cowards yet hes spent fourteen pages crying his eyes out desperate for ccp to do something about the away from keyboard players who scare him so badly that he instantly warps to a posstation and refuses to come out
i realy like when i see how you trying with your 4 alts to cry and trying to save your poor coward cloaker advantages while you never wrote a rational argument
your wrong the data requests for dscan results when there was no limit was so small the lag was not even noticeable except with the return of results with the 2 second limit there would be no lag even if everyone was using it all the time which they wont because rarely do hs folks bother
hahaha this is perfect claiming others are using a boatload of alts and not making rational arguments hahahaha go away rib
no you are wrong and talkin bullsht the ccp guys give to us good argumenst for thisthe 2 second delay dont count because not all players hit the dscan button in same time
taking advantage of a poorly designed game mechanic to exploit players with almost no effort or danger on your part is not only cowardly it is borderline game exploit its not cowardly at all to take steps to stay safei think there should be a way to find cloakers not easy obviously but possible anyone who cloaks and walks away from their computer should be facing danger tooand please guys can you clip your gigantic quotenoughts
please read the reason for the change was not overall lag there was lag between the time you would hit the dscan button and the time you would get the results because you were spamming the button this only effected you say you were spamming the button and cause lag for yourself i go and hit dscan and i get my results near instantly because your lag in this case does not effect mine it is a communication with the individual client issueso even if 50k people all hit dscan at the same time there would be no issue at all
one of my hulks is tanked over 80 resists acrossed the board it is dead space and faction fit had a group of five destroyers and a hauler try and gank it they got me to 80 structure before they all popped was funny the hauler cleared up thier own ships and left the belt as i warped back to station can be survivedbut not by new players i have alot of tank skills i learned from missioning and incursionsrealy the issue is about new players and how the games culture affects subscriptions for ccp which in turn affects all playersmy response earlier was not whether ganking should happen its just how easy it is you talk about risk for miners well maybe thier wasnt enough risk for gankers they should pay more to do it maybe idki think its just stupidthe new mining rebalance will probably end ganking miners by noob alts as a profession except in the contracted hitman type encounterccp wants to survive in the gaming world and develope new players too not just have a diminishing group of old nerds dominate just because they like it that way what are you established players scared of change afraid of new up and coming players that might knock you off your mountain take your own advice adapt to ccps policy of sufferage to new subs find new ways to protect your interests or rage and quit eveeveryones arguments contain self interest in it i welcome the mining rebalanceUFFFDyou see in this world theres two kinds of people my friend those with loaded guns and those who dig i digUFFFD  clint eastwood misquote
fyi im an industrialist ive never done ganking wardecced people or griefed well beyond maybe a few people that genuinely deserved a little grief the player received a warning that in taking his ore he would be able to be attacked by taking it he accepted it and was attacked this is a basic of how eve workssucessful ingame players who pay for their accounts with plex do not pay for eve players who buy plex with real money domoot point if there were no players out there buying plex then there would be zero demand thus the people selling them wouldnt be buying plex from ccp a plex subscriber is just as valuable to ccp as a person that pays with their credit cardthe different zones of space are intended to have a riskreward axis from safer from pvp but poor mission rewardlow quality minerals to high risk  high rewardsyoure right and if you hadnt taken from his can he wouldnt have been able to blow up your ship without facing those concequencesthat design has been totally undermined by new ships modules and rigs over the years the gap between rich vet and poor new player is a problemthe difference isnt age of playing its smarts a new smart player can make millions in a day billions in a month a dumb player with common sense could create a mackenaw mining fleet with 7 accounts paid for by plex and make billions a month there are people that have been playing for 5 years and struggle to replace their lost battleshipsplayers like myself who were going to buy plex have chosen not to due directly to hulkageddon i was going to buy plex to get an orca more plex to have a hulkready toon moved to a new account but now its a bad risk i know others who were going to buy plex to pay for bpos but they cant mine the minerals now to use the bpos so no plex neededyou just implied above that plex subscribers are less valuable to ccp and now youre saying you wanted to be one of them if we agree with your above statement we dont care if you leave because you werent willing to pay for eve anyway so no loss to the businessplayers like myself who were going to buy plex have chosen not to due directly to hulkageddon i was going to buy plex to get an orca more plex to have a hulkready toon moved to a new account but now its a bad risk i know others who were going to buy plex to pay for bpos but they cant mine the minerals now to use the bpos so no plex neededthese events only last for so long everyone is once again back to normalcan a miner through hard work and industry make thier on mining ship no they cannot the moon goo debacle is making some corpsallainces super rich and has destroyed the basic concept of eve that you can get there if you work hard enough t2 moon goo market has in effect failed which ccp has now tacitly acknowledged by adding t3 ships which take different things to makeyes they can why else are there miners out there and hundreds of covetors macks hulks orcas rorquals selling on the market every weekyour entire complaint up until now is about gankers why on earth does a cargo capacity change any of your arguements as to why youre going to quit they are meant to be that easily killable because you dont like it doesnt mean its brokenthey are called npc corporations
its called planetary interaction additionally i have in the past made billions from doing reactions and t2 inventionmanufacturing without owning a single moon myself if every single player like youre suggesting could farm technetium it would be worth 3isk per unit and you have now destroyed alliance warfare since half the alliances have lost a major reason to fight eachother nowbeyond being a newplayer stepping stone tech 1 ships are still used daily maybe you dont see as many cruiser gangs as hac gangs but they still all have their purposeas someone with 18m sp in drones im not generally one to say no to more but theres meant to be risk you are never meant to be 100 safe in eve unless youre docked inside a space stationeve is a unique game scamming is supported you also have no idea of how business works youre basically asking for a game master to investigate every single scam to verify if its a real scam or not review chat logs contracts trades forum posts etc do you have any idea how much a game master costsa pay for 50 more game mastersb loose 100 players who quit due to being scammedwhich do you think costs ccp more money
the whole point is its not meant to be a solo game you can easily have people defending your fragile ships its actually safer to mine in 00 where you know whenwhere the bad people are coming from for the most part mining is 0 risk theres that tiny little risk a ganker might come along thats better than no risk at all as a industrialist im glad people go out and gank my competition and the macro farmers makes the market better for my sales having 6 accounts isnt something reserved to 7 year vets a brand new player can have 7 accounts he can have all of them mining insidie of 7 days good miners in 21 days great miners in 40 at which point you can pay for every single one with a plex doesnt require a 90m sp main to do either err no whilst thats what some people use it for many use it for hauling transporting ships boosting straight out corporate mining gangs hauling in 00 to a rorqual for compression until someone brings out something to compete with eve which hasnt happened so far in 9 years its subscriber base will likely continue to grow since they always keep the graphics engine uptodate the game never looks old and tired to new people discovering it maybe some players left for the right reason this game isnt for them world of warcraft is hugely successful 100x more than eve but some people quit the game does that mean blizzard should change the core functionality of their game for that small portion of players that didnt like how it plays  nowow has its market eve has its market maybe you should simply accept that eve isnt the game for you even if some of its feature really appeal to you
youre acting like this is some recent change the game has been like this for 9 years they know full well the impact of their game design choices such as scamming its not suddenly going to jump out of some subscription chart tomorrow and make them scream to change it freighters are not gank proof orcas are not gank proof remotely there are plenty of people out there that spend weeks stalking some npc corp freighter pilot know when hes got billions of isk of materials and afk autopiloting 30 jumps and they will gank him with a battleship fleet for profitone alliance has also done similar simply for fun and to proove the point no where in eve is 100 safe outside of sitting in a space station warp to 0 was added because crafty players worked out how to do it with bookmarks already which meant players had to do horribly tedious bookmark creation and then would have an unfair advantage the mechanic was changed to actually make things more fair for everyone even pvpersall mmos have griefers they play to grief thats their profession take away can flipping theyll find the next thing to do take away scamming theyll find the next thing to do happens in every online game for that matteragain im a carebear industrialist i think for the most part the mechanics are fine and youre simply whining because this game doesnt work the way you want it too i dont think eve is perfect theres a million things they could change i just dont remotely agree with any of your suggestions
you realise if t2 ships paid out good insurance youll simply start getting ganked in t2 ships too right even easier for a hac to gank you nowthis is probably the most stupid comment of yours ive seen so far if theres 10000 plex on the market that means theres 10000 months of subscription already paid to ccp they actually got the money in advanceand now even cooler 100 of those plex could get blow up by gankers then ccp never even has to honor those 100 months of gametime saves them expenses on bandwidthplex  money plain and simplemajordumb if someone wants to sb miners the very first thing they do is enter the belt in a stealth bomber and bookmark then the sb battleship will appear out of nowhere and land ontop of you just as the guy you quoted said he would kill youyou know the hulk is staying exactly as fragile as it is right now in final summary
actually those plexes cost more than even the most expensive monthly subscription option
blood raiders are just a bunch of leftwing barbarians who are fed up with their extreme rightwing relatives a few jumps over and for that matter angel cartel are just minmatar who have a very reasonable fear of too much government guristas can barely organize a fleet formation i dont think their skirmishes will ever erupt into something worthy of being called a war and serpentis are just on a really long and crazy drug tripno the only real pirate threat out there is sansha kuvakei the mad genius bent on taking over the galaxy one horrifying step at a time
interesting idea i have a few responses but ill make separate posts for each i would be more specific about how and say the following null sec gets the same kind of local as worm holes hi sec remains as it is local is generated by concord low sec gets a two minute delay local is generated by concord there also but they are a bit more lax with their data propagation wormholes remain asis lore reasoninghi sec is nannyspace it makes sense that concord or local empire machinery grabs and propagates local based on stargate entry and exit low sec still has some vestiges of empire control thats why there are gate guns and the like but we can assume that they dont maintain as high a quality of ftl comms for local propagation null space has no machinery to propagate the information so its up to your ship to keep track of who squawked on localgameplay reasoninghi sec being for noobs noobs get local for a whoseinthissystem this is important for several reasons first a new player really does need to see that there are other players coming in and out of the system theyre in seeing that there are several members of their own npc corp tooling around near them makes it that much easier to reach out and make friends also there are times when asking for help or asking for an explanation in local provides a far better experience then asking on the noob channel because of the sheer volume of chatter on the new player chat channelslow sec should still get some warning that hostiles have entered but there should be enough of a gap in that time that a determined foe could cause problems for the unwary i think low sec still needs a measure of whos in system in part this is because low sec players cant really have sovereignty they lack the same means and in many cases the same underlying reasons for knowing whos in their space a delayed local adds a bit of risk but not an insurmountable oneas far as vigilance goes null and wormhole life is similar though every last pilot in a wh has to be on all the time in a wh and this is actually less true for null secmore to come and see my sig re aegis ships 
im sorry but after what happened with the inventory i would prefer ccp not to touch the other stuff just yet
thats fairhowever not all logis are ready made combat pilotsalso if you pop em far enough off station they have to warp away or slow boat it lol and to a station that has a useful combat ship just to be able to join the battleand you were facing two anyway with the repper just one wasnt shooting so its at least the same odds of winningthere are ways to deal with snow as a vulture i would love logis to get docking timers then they woudl die and i would get more loot though since ccp let war deck evasion slide pew pew has been dropping and the new mechanics havent helped much but this isnt about what i would like rather about what is needed and as it stands there are ways to deal with logis that doesnt require any dev timeedit noticed another poster mentioned the possible crimewatch changes if ccp wants to change this i wouldnt argue at all their choice and means more loot 
i thought they fixed this if someone reps anyone in combat or flagged for combat in any way the repper is supposed to get aggression along with the usual docking and gate jump denial if this is not happening submit a bug report i havent noticed it to be functioning incorrectly
manually ban bots is unworkable there are too many of them to identify and bando away with 001 isking implement minimum increment on price changes much like auctions even if its a very small amount on high priced items like 1000 isk on 1 mil isk items bots would quickly bid themselves out of business
that would eventually demolish the markets making it chaotic and impossible to use ccp should fix the core problem and either make the bots visible in the markets in someway or make the system bulletproof with an advanced survey programany solutions are welcome
what if instead of isk the insurance payout was a coupon for a ship of the same type with reduced material cost if you had to pay isk to raise the insurance level insurance would become a giant isk sink instead of a giant isk faucet
considering insurance costs you the same amount if you dont collect as you get if you do collect it isnt worth purchasing unless youve got above a 50 chance of losing the ship within 12 weeks even with my horrible killboard history i still tend to keep my ships intact especially the big ones i fly safely and therefore i usually feel insurance is a waste of money so when i do lose a ship its generally uninsured
im on the fence with this at this point int he game i dont care about insurance even if i lose a ship i can afford to replace ithowever when i lost my first cruiser it hurt a little financially i could replace it but not comfortably the insurance helped
mb3 has been forgiven by mefor now
i have heard your cries and i shall offer my services as a professional mouth i literally dont know anything about toruny rules but could prolly read them and learn them or i could offer roslyn aka kelly to handle this she could wear something particularly exciting
self destructing on the jita undock would be a lot more funits not a matter of not being able to kill something its a matter of not being able to destroy it before an arbitrary timer runs outat which point you do not get credit for the kill even though the ship was destroyed as a direct result of your aggression if you cant kill it why is it self destructingwhen they added implants to pod killmails several members of ccp made statements on the importance of killmails in the culture of eve theyre used to determine the outcome of war theyre used to evaluated potential mercenaries and theyre used for plain old bragging rights the stated intent was to make the killmail system reflect monetary damages more accurately the ability to prevent a killmail being generated just by surviving for 120 seconds doesnt fit with all that
op you might as well be removing self destructingyou mentioned capital ships specifically maybe the destruct timer is simply too short for capital ships and makes it too easy to destruct them before an attack finishes them on that note it is perhaps too long for frigates as a dying frigate even a slowly dying frigate almost never has a chance to self destructso howabout self destruct timer be based on size of ship and leave everything else about them the same i think that using self destruct to deny a killmail should be possible as long as the person who self destructs is denied insurance and the gankers have a reasonable amount of time to finish off the ship
that was described to me right below the post you quotedi agree mission accomplished
repeat you are wrong the difference would be increasing 500 data requests to 50000 data requests within same time period500 ping not decreasing the server performance painfuly but 50000 yes and this is a two directional data flow and high amount of data exchangeyou want create a continously higher server load with remove localand no not just effected on your game client lol this is effect on server man so dont talk stupid thingsdoes not matter whether you want it or no a server need to send 100000sec data to clients or 125000s thats 25 difference and dont forget this means plus inward data processes for the server toothese remote procedure calls on server would be decreasing and impact game performance as a wholeread again and see itccp atlas there is a new 2 second delay in using the directional scanner this has been done for server performance reasonsnot client reasons what you trying to talk bullht but server reasons what the ccp developers told
how is it exploiting or taking advantage of other players when i am not even at the computer even if it was blatant manipulation of other players since when is that a borderline game exploit this is eve online last time i checked the metagame threats lies backstabbing etc is the bread and butter of this game youre playing the wrong game if you cant deal with thatas for anyone who cloaks and walks away from their computer should be facing danger too why they are absolutely incapable of doing anything so why should you be able to kill them should people who pos up and go afk for an hour be facing danger too what about people who dock and go afkthere are dudez in ur system they may be out for you or they may be walking their dog deal with it
there are never 50k folks in null there are barely 50k people online in all of eve right nowthat number would maybe be 1520k spread out across two seconds that means the potential ping increase would be about 10 big whoop a 10ms increase in the time it takes for the server to communicate to the clients that sure is the end of the world and thats only if all of them are undocked and doing activities that requires them to use dscan if they even careand server lag in speaking to an individual client is still a server issue just one that doesnt effect anyone else
wow another smart guy who know everything better than ccp developers
where did i even claim to know anything about developmentall i have been saying is that little quote doesnt tell the whole story or even a bit of the story other than there were issues with performance when people would spam dscan which is as vague as saying there was an issue with my car when i drive itsomething similar happens when you spam warp it doesnt respond very reliably
why is this posting faggotry still herei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
let there be sandbox not retardocity let there be liberty or death
i like the idea of more diversity in the mining shipshaving said that inb4 miners crying a  ocean of tears because they cant have max tank and max yield in one ship
makes sense to me  anyone aiding in a war that does not concern them from a concord perspective should either aggress or be nailed by concordif these reps want to participate without consequence they should be forced to pay for a war along with everyone else highsec warfare would actually be entertaining if there werenUFFFDt so many alt cowards hanging off stations spamming dock buttonsnullsec for the win
specially because this neutral exploit attitude doesnt lead to more ship kills but makes less people willing to undock for fights because they are sure 90 if not 100 time this will happen witch leads smaller corps to avoid fights as much as possible thus less pvps should just trigger 1 of my proposalsconcord response global aggression timer for 15min and ship destroyedorconcord automatic assignment the current neutral actor is immediately transferred by concord to the corporation he chose to helphas consequence of hes choice hes immediately charged for 25m isk and insurance contract revoked wallet charged no matter if positive or negative and stuck in said corporation as long as said corporation has wars are in the run with no possibility to get kicked or leave said corporation until corporation is free of all warsstop the account or transfer the character from one account to another maintains the character in current war until its endi think this would be fair enough right
i havent encountered this yet but as told in other posts seems like there are some valid tactics to counter thathowever its true that sometimes people with alts make me unhappy sometimes seems like the best way to play eve is to pay for 2 or more accounts in order to have an advantage over those who canwant pay only a single account like me
while there tactics to counter this issue as you rightly point out the issue is in my mind anyway it allows people to gain access to a free warUFFFD it is also very frustrating if you donUFFFDt have the blobs but even if you do because the reps donUFFFDt aggress they can simply dock and be out of danger you are participating in a war that you yourself are not part ofi have no issues with logi in highsec but they must be forced to grow balls and partake in the dec itself highsec war as it stands is simply frustrating and not worth the effort i think making minor changes to neutral intervention would greatly increase the funfactor of warfare in empire regions of course the only people who are going to have any complaints about this are those who utilize the rep and doc tactics
wasnt the wardec revamp supposed to fix thissummary of eves last four expansions
well we were supposed to have an inventory functioning properly and without lag too you wee what i did here
put a captcha in the create and modify order boxes
double facepalmthis is a bad idea and you should feel badcaptchas achieve only one thing annoying legit players bots can do them faster and better than humans
if you buy something fromsell something to that player you can find their name if someone is that obvious that youre pretty certain theyre a bot this should work for a relatively low cost anywhere except jita at busy times im not sure i support listing seller names as it would make it entirely too easy to compile a list of rich manufacturersoverall i obviously support taking more action against  i just dont really see this as a proposal as nothing concrete has been proposed by the op and its something ccp is already aware of
hi all ive been trying to get corp members to read bulletins as a way for me to inform them to corp eventspolicy changes the problem is i have to tell them theres a new bulletin to read lol defeating the objective wouldnt it be nice if the corp icon flashed when i posted a bulletin and then upon clicking the icon theyre taken to the bulletins pagei know that i could just send corp mails but i like the idea of this better as i could keep policies here until i make changes to themwhat does everyone else think
i agree with this idea you should only get insurance if you paid for the insurance planif you didnt buy an insurance plan you should not receive any money whatsoever
you should reread my proposal i dont want to change anything for cruisers
thats fair i wasnt paying enough attention therethough im an oddball in that i didnt even train for a bs until a year so i knew how not to lose a ship a bs loss for a 1 month old hurts unless funded by someone
we need to keep this thing going so that the devs know that we seriously want thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
yup awsome idea i think it should be slightly more maybe 5 ships in there so people can move all their ships in one go but reguardless 1
couldnt you eve mail this thread to members of the csm to try and raise awareness of it ccp falcon
why was nothing done about this between sisi and tq release is ccp planning a big surprise new vag model for winter expansion doesnt make sense for devs to keep hushed on their ultimate plans for the frills
oh dear i have never thought of it this way before
find me a post where the ccp developers have said dscan would be giant lag generator hint you cant the only post in which theyve mentioned it was when the directional scan was instant and even that only references a very vague performance issue  which is not necessarily servercrippling lag it could and probably was in that specific case client side issues
correction the bread and butter of eve is the metagame that you work forthey might not face danger for an hour but the pos theyre in faces danger and people who dock can be camped thus not allowing them to leave
the amount of effort metagaming takes is irrelevant it still isnt an exploit never has been never will beoh please you can sit in a pos perfectly safe for well over 24 hours with absolutely no threat to yourself at all where are your cries for the ability to kill people in pos shieldsand camping a station hah thats hardly comparable to being able to outright kill players who are afk since well you know you cant kill them while theyre afk they have to come back and start playingand if you can camp a station why cant you properly shut down a system and preventcatch cloakies get yourself some friends and sit on and bubble gates face it bro you cant just have an iwin button against cloakers ccp will never give you one dry your tears and move on
well when someone says the most important sideshow what is the first thing that gets on your mind i am sure that in the world the sentence is bound to soccer but generally it is about sports billions of people every weekend head towards stadiums arenas or just tv to follow their teams heroes in europe and africa it is soccer in usa its american football or baseball in australia is rugby and in asia well being so big its all kind of sportsso why not make an universe eve universe popular sport well guys i got an idea which with a bit of hard work can get live easily imagine every week being able to follow your teams discuss of the past or incoming games cheering laughingcursing or being desperate or or or participating in that league to be a star to be loved and hatedimagine what possibilities what potential it could bring to eve professional sport corps training corps some more of shady affairs new sources of income like sponsors winning prices betting and everything else your mind can come up withoke you will now ask what sport can it bewell in eve fashion what else would be than fireworks ships exploding all aroundguys i present you fml as frigate mania leaguewhat is it aboutit is about teams consisted of t1 frigates trying to beat each other just like on the alliance tournamentwe would have a league which would be led by an alliance and consisted of corpteams which would every weekend compete against each other the winner would be ofc the one that gets the most points at the end of the season 3 for a win 1 for a draw and 0 for a lossit surely would bring something new to the game and it would be driven mostly by players organisation control commentators foundingit would be some kind of not instanced battlegroundsbut being a ccp game organizer of frigate mania league would of course work a lot with developers so we could deliver the ultimate experience to the community the help from ccp would be mostly technicalthe idea is to field t1 frigates with only t2 modules and t2 or faction ammunition implants except the on for attributes and boosters would not be allowed it would be 5v5 matches this would be for the first season if we would feel the need to be expanded to 10v10 and t2 frigates also it would be very easy but for the beginning it is supposed to be 5v5 and t1 frigates why easier to organize almost no cost at all for competitors every ship will be brought by teams them selves low margins to enter and participate in the league new ppl would have easy time to join the competition frigate gang pvp is always funhow the league would workthere would be an alliance named frigate mania league that will run the show with the surveillance of ccp of courseteams that would participate will exist as a corp in that alliance people working for the alliance management would runorganize the whole show on the corp back would rest the finances to keep alive the teams to compete every weekend and ofc to follow the rules of the league itselffor each season corpsteams will have to pay a fee to compete and to prove that they can survive it pay their bills d there would be 1 season per one year it wont be lots of isk to invest of course the more wins or successful a team is it will return that isk and earn lots moreevery corp should be made of the management which will earn money by industry trading ratting or whatever other way and the team part who would have contracts and get paid each month for their competing managementteam can be an only body also the prices for winning games and league would go to corp its left to the corp and team to arrange how that money will be spentthese are examples of how finances in this sport would workteams to be properly registered will need minimum 7 players 5 players to compete and 2 to sit on the bench so they can be changed between matches because to win a match will be needed to win 2 of 3 the maximum number of players that can be registered for a season in one team will be 10as a sport we will try to keep it as much fair as it can be alts wont be allowed because it could end up tweaking the games the alliance mania league will have a tribunal who will constantly be trying to spot iregularities so they can be punishedpunishments will be like large fees and expulsion of players and teamscorps for 12 or forever yearshow the match will workthere will be 2 teams opposing each other it will be a 5v5 match teams can bring 2 more players to sit on the bench and change em between the games for whatever reason they think is ok for more experience or more skills in certain way of flying a frigate it should look like exactly as it is on the alliance tournament with some minor changes a game will take place in the arena where if u leave it u get insta popped a game will have its duration limit a game ends when the time elapses or 1 team kills all ships of the opposite team frigates wont have points assigned so if 3 games finish with both teams having destroyed exact number of ships the match will end as a draw it wont be possible to field 2 same types of ship example 2 rifters but u ll be able to field 2 frigates that are focused on damage like a rifter and a punisher won match gives 3 points a draw 1 point and the loss gives nothing after every match won the winning team will get an amount of isk if its finished as a draw both teams will split the winning potmy taught is to have an asteroid made exactly for this sport and put in middle of the arena we might see some not skilled players bump on the asteroids and so lose an advantage gained before but with this idea we would be more dependent on technical part of this project which i want to take it to the minimum
cash flowthe finance aspect of this project would be simple the frigate mania league would need to earn some isk first than to share that isk to its employees and after to the teamshow the alliance would earn corps that would participate in a season would pay a joining fee sponsorship trough punishment fees the alliance would make an industry corp and with the earned money trough investments would try to earn some more cash hiring out the battle arenas there are technical issues with this idea donationshow the corpsteams would earn winning weakly game winning overall league sponsorship fan donations finding out producing talented pilots and selling them to other teams transfers and all other possible ways that eve offers drug manufacturing and selling is prohibitedpunishment fees contracts and transferswhen corpteams will be joining the new season except the joining fee they ll be asked to give a bit larger amount of isk as some kind of a pawn if everything is order after the season finishes that isk would be returned but if corps do not follow the league rules cheat in some way they would be kicked out of the league and that isk will stay within the league and be shared to the winners of the competitionas for contractsthere will be a minimum sum of isk that corps will have to pay to the competitors contracts of all players will be evidenced on the league site so people can follow it corp and players can ofc make a deal and not actually pay off those contracts but those players that want it they will have to be payed neglecting the payment to those that want to be payed will result in some punishment fee after each season corps and players can make new contracts will be fun to follow the sums of contract that will rise for the best players on every contract some  will go to the leagueevery transfer will have its minimum cost let say it is 1 billion after each season corps that want to get other players will have to pay at least the minimum transfer fee after each season players performances will be evaluated and will be given a multiplayer the better the performance of a player was the bigger will be the multiplayer so let say the best player gets 23 multiplayer his cost would be 23 billions after every transfer paid again some  will go to leagueall numbers about payment and fees will be made so that the league would have some substantial amount of isk to make for the teams and players worth competing in corps will have a big word about it if they feel we ask to much from themwe can call alliance tournament a sport but i d rather call it an event or a tradition in eve the frigate mania league is tough a bit different it will last lot lot longer eve community will be able to constantly follow it discuss it or participate in it during a 6 month period it involve the community much more than the alliance tournament even after the competition period is over we ll be able to follow the changes in players contracts the transfers rising and falling of teamsand after the league season is finished we would have the alliance tournament as a chary on the cake the aim was exactly to build the league on the foundations of alliance tournament we would just tweak it a bit expand and upgrade itthe showhow everything will look like well there will be quite a few people that will run the show i had in mind 2 well known persons to run the frigate mania league alliance with me so it gets some importance and trust from the community well dont want to mention any names because i dont know if this project will be accepted nor i spoke with those people yetwe would have a website maybe even that of alliance tournament but about that ccp and people that run that site need to agreewe would have commentators who d stream comment and make a show of the matches from their homeswe would have a wednesday night show where people would comment the previous matchday and announce the next one about this i thought to make a pertnership with eve tv we could make some evenews24 show also or to broadcast some eve university tutorials for new ppl but this with eve tv is a whole new idea and projectall people that would work for frigate mania league alliance would be payed monthly they would get a paycheck in isk or maybe even 1 plex or more monthlythat was it about frigate mania league if u think something better can be done or u think something else could be added feel free to post or ask questions concernswell my biggest concerns are about technical support mostly about getting that arena that ccp used in alliance tournamentanother concerns are the probable wardecs because the matches would take place in highsecgetting hooked with eve tv so we can stream the matches and the wednesday showonly t1 frigates would have limited tactics and so being boring to watch but about this one i guess we d have to do at least 1 season and see it is easier after to change a bit rules make also t2 frigates viable if it ever will be needed

why eve is already a game why try to put a game inside it also almost all of the stuff youre saying this would add to the game is already in the game professional sport corpssovholding alliances training corpsthere are already training corps in the game some more of shady affairsthis is eve shady affairs are already everywhere in the game new sources of income like sponsors winning prices bettingyou can already get people to sponsor or bet on nullsec sovwar if you really want to and the prizes for winning are pride and the other alliances space
well even better if it is already everything in the game will be easier to deliver than but it is not everything we d need the arenas smth like the alliance tournament has an eve universe wide sport will add lot more content for ppl to participate or to follow and build interesting events around it
no to arenas you want an arena make one your ing self with a few anchored cans and some lookoutsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
you dont need ccp for this set up the rules and sponsor it yourself offer prizes and try to get some notable people involved you can even do it in high sec if you know what youre doing
eve is about balance how easy it is to kill a hulk now is not balanced i dont agree with most of the ops suggestions but giving the solo hulk means of defence against 3 or 4 destroyers is a good idea imho let the stupid miners that dont fit tank die give the clever miners a chance against most ganks
this is literally how it is today apparently people are so bad at fitting their ships that ccp have to make changes to force them to fit their ship properly vov
this proposal has garnered steady support i am hopeful ccp will do the right thing and implement this overdue change when they rework the pos
when you dont have supercaps what else are you to do but load up your regular capitals with highend gear points at relaxs relatively recent exchimmy in c5 space
if they use neutral logi bring a falcon fitted to jam them one falcon can easily shut down two logis if they give up their tank for eccm a pair of tornadoes will demolish them nicely the best part is falcons and sniper tornadoes will continue to be useful even after the logi have docked up or been destroyedccp need to fix logi agression transfer that would solve this problem entirely but theyve wrapped that into crimewatch which appears to now be scheduled for soon tm so youd best learn how to deal with it
again the problem youre failing to understand is that not all small corporations have logisticsecm pilots available and the fact you can use secmboosts just remove a lot of small scale high sec pvp because people will not even bother to undock just set a long que skill and play something more amusing witch is not really difficult to find in these circumstances
if they have nuetral rr they are not alone so the real issue is not neutral rr especially when crimewatch is fixed and they gain aggression timers the real issue is that its very hard to identify battlechanging notreallynuetral rrers from the harmless neutrals in a system what you need is a method to identify them i imagine this would take a few components something like battle reports that list the logistics pilots involved so your intel gatherers can create a list of associates checkanda better contact system that allows you to associate rogue ooc pilots with a corpalliance create a new icon that makes identifying these pilts as easy as looking for a skull on the intel window and a longerterm consequence associated with nuetral rr like if you give assistance to a war target you become a war target for a week or two
does it also shine shoes and get the door for mei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
bulletins are probably best used for longterm information for information sharing use evemailthat said i see no reason not to flash the corp icon in the event of certain changes
i have already done so and only got one reply now on the other hand if all of the supporters of this thread were to start evemailing the csm to show their support that would be fantastic i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 fix the pos nightmare and if they manage to get it right give us lead way to wh trade via ice then leave it in the working state it is in
i remember when dreads cost 800mil for the hullthis is a really bad proposal
making caps require more minerals will just drive up the price of minerals and everything made from them because the alliances that have their own supply lines will be putting less on the market for general consumption
heres a thought i dont know how feasable or even if it would be practical for ccp to implementsince ccp is going to introduce ring mining why not tie in moon minerals into the production materials required for capsthey wouldnt have to be high end moon minerals it could be low end moon minerals either way it would encourage ring mining since corps  alliances love their caps  the market rewards of such mining would go directly to individuals rather than the corps or alliances although i suspect at some point they maybe able to tax it it would also fit perfectly into the theme of risk vs reward since no doubt some may take advantage of pvp opportunities that might subsequently open up due those deciding to take up ring mining if the end result of such a idea was to push up the cost of caps well so be it it may help counter the high number of caps in the game over all now waits for wall of flame
tis true for you boss of internet spaceships has decreed it so thus no deviation is allowedtheres a much larger gap in tastiness between apples and oranges than there is between oranges and bananas for you most supple of fruit lovers has objectively concluded it so
i fail to follow your logic glitter calling someone an idiot is adhominiempointing out that someone is using alts to post isnt pointing out that you also have a personal bone to pick with me because i chastised your aggressive posting in another thread also isnt adhominem arguement i think you seem reasonable so hear me when i say i dont make anything personal i just dont like to to see aggressive posters go unfettered
pointing out that someone is using alts to post isntposted by a geek alt like you rotfl
in before constructive posts only please
nah it cant be done without people messing with matches there would be lot of interference knowing eve online players and our habit to screw other ppl over thats why i d need the alliance tournament mechanism for isolating the competitors from the publicccp needs to have their hand in it it will be a lot of content provided to us like when ccp intruduced incursions it added lot of fun stuff for players this will be simillar just lot more player driven
host the matches in an empty backwater system and dont announce the location until you start broadcasting i sincerely doubt a 5v5 t1 frigate brawl is going to last long enough for someone to scan down the match and warp in with a ship suitable to wreck the matchand if that really isnt enough there are still plenty of options for mitigating the probability of interference
yep it is an option a good one and i d say the only one but the game will be to win 2 matches of 3 u need preparations for each match and each match will last 10 mins so plenty of time to mess with it but it is an option and those numbers can be modified like to win 1 match which will last tops 10 mins but yeah taken in accountmy intention is to have live streams commenteries spectators etc make it a real laid back show for ppl to follow it and watch it or participate in it make it a real sport where 20 teams will compete with each other every season and with that mechanism it will be lot easier and fluent to organizeccp sais that it provides us the tools so we can make our game that tool is already in the game used for alliance tournaments with a bit of tweaking it can be adapted for usage by players also
providing regular players the powers required to start a tourney match would be disastrous and i think we all know that ccp doesnt want to get involved in managing a leaguestyle sport that would require regular effort on the part of their staffthe sandbox is there with all the tools to make your idea happen youre just opting to not use them because it would be hard
it isnt broken to the point it needs to be fixedso leave it the  alone unless you want the scanning window ending up like the inventoryi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

heads up npc posting alt talking about danger
mission load balancing was introduced in dominion decenber 2009 as part of ccps effort to reduce eves pve lagedit for the uninitiated what do mission load balancing dobefore it was the time when mission agents have quality rating attached where the higher the quality the better the rewards lp and npc bounties high quality agents were few and far naturally players flocked to them and thus system lag is very normaljita was born this wayccp introduced the bandaid solution then to combat the lag in an attempt to disperse players to complete missions in neighbouring systems instead of everyone in the same system where their agent issince then ccp have made lots of improvements to combat lags notably1 various codes improvements2 the missiles coding changes
1 bumping for awareness
1 it would mean ceptors could actually intercept things before they land which is kind of the idea
sodrop the acceldecel times by 75 25 seconds to max warp speed 5 seconds to drop out of warp nevermind scaling warp speeds and all that just let everyone spend longer at max speed and it all works out

1 theyre in a logi generally either sitting somewhere away from the undock or at a nearby safespot theyll almost certainly appear on dscan2 once theyre used once theyre instantly burned good logi take months to train so its not like they have disposable logi alts that trick will only work once and then you know who they arereal logi pilots have been begging for this mind you if this happens there will be more logis out there repping their way into fights to get onto killmails after all they could even rep both sidesmore granularity in contact standings and the ability to assign associations in contacts would be nicepeople keep suggesting this and i keep wondering why no one thinks it through if i rep your war target and become a war target for a week then it works one of two ways1 youre extending the current aggression mechanic to a full week giving you shooting rights on me without me being able to preemptively engage you all because i repped a friend in an incursion while he was at war with you that is a phenomenally bad plan as it would make it impossible for me to know who is a danger to me in a given system2 we would become mutual war targets for the duration of that week in which case i could rep your enemy and then engage you imagine the chaos of that mess where corp membership doesnt matter and i can simply rep my way into whatever war i choose i could just live in an npc corp and join into whatever war i pleased
the check comment was to point out ccps already adding logistics to the kill reports also the unsaid point of the comment getting intel on your opponents should include getting info on who their ooc alts are and how they are used eyes boosting rr etc finally assuming ccp fixes crimewatch to give rr agression timers creating more logi pilots is not a bad thing 2 addressing number two first a it can not be mutual if it is mutual youre essentially giving a loophole to create unlimited numbers of free allies as you pointed out b it should not be mutual the nuetral rrer are bypassing the concord fees and essentially joining in the war in a clandestine manner those pilots typically know the players within the war they are joining and they know who the enemies are i would highly suggesting an interface improvement that helps players identify threats ie on your character sheet a page that says  you are a legitmate target to player a until date xxyy for suicide ganking their hulk killrights  you are a legitimate target to corpalliance b due to a concordsanctioned war  you are a legit target for corp c until date xxyy for aiding their enemies of war in battle etcpeople already set players and corps red and watch local to identify threats this is not something new or u 1 your incursion counterexample is completely unfounded serious incursion runners already ban people in wars from joining their incursion fleets and when a wardecced pilot does sneak into an incursion fleet most smart logi pilots already withhold reps on that fleet member and let them die rather than put their logi ship at risk in general this would have no effect on incursion fleets i will admit that there are some atypical cases where people do risk repping a war target and this will give them second thought however in general this will not effect many beyond the neutral rr in highsec wardec scenarios  final thought this could be used as a way to get free wardecs on new andor oblivious eve players but theyll adapt or die this will have much less harm to them than can flippingbaiting so i hardly see an issue please point out any loopholes or problems im missing the only problem i see with this is it effectively nerfs using nuetral alts in wars while you could still use them for the initial punch effect these nontrivially skilled alts then lose most their utility they can no longer freely travel under concord protection when between battles and even worse they cant even shoot first thereafter when they effectively become a party in the war with such a diminished utility their usage becomes almost not worth it
i would like to propose a system for better and more intuitive module deactivationthe problem is there are some instances in which you dont want your module to cycle for as long if youre using dual propulsion on your frigate for instance you might like to be able to swap between afterburner and microwarp drive a little quicker as opposed to having to wait for the full cycle time on one of them to complete before its deactivated it becomes a little silly especially when you consider skills like afterburner 4 and afterburner 5 having longer cycle times does mean that you use less capacitor but it also means that youre forced to have your afterburner active 10 longer than you might want it to be because you cant shut it off early its a bit strange when situations arise that training a skill might actually be seen as detrimental and of course is also irreversablemy proposal is a better and more intuitive method of deactivating certain modules if you click your microwarp drive once when it was only half way through its cycle youd have to wait for the rest of the cycle to complete before it shuts off this system could be kept but perhaps clicking a module that is reddeactivated might turn it grey thus shutting off the effect right away as though it had completed its cycle time this change should only apply to specific modules for instance it wouldnt be fair for it to apply to weapons or ecm or other such oneshot modules that then require a cooldown period before they can be used againthis sort of change could be useful for both pve oriented players as well as pvp ones in pve you would no longer overshoot that can or wreck you were trying to loot due to your ridiculous microwarp velocity thus requiring you to fly back to it once again bu from the opposite direction i dont know how many times this has happened to me in the past in pvp you would more easily be able to swap between afterburner and microwarp drive propulsion methods for a more interesting and intuitive combat experience or in the very least just have better control over how your ship manuevers which is always a great thing
if i may add perhaps have the modules effect deactivate once it turns grey but the cycle still needs to complete before it can be reactivated
im pretty sure this is working as intended for instance being able to do this with mwds would totally bork the sig radius penalty
thisit was intended for most modules to continue applying their effects throughout the cycleotherwise it would lead to many abuses especially the mwd
frills and sails and rust make the minmatar what we are give back our heritage i mean come on it looks goofy without the frill anyway

for balance of cost why are you looking at isk build cost rather then mineral build cost the market changes prices of minerals fairly regurlary but the build mineral requirements dont change that often dreads and carriers just got a mineral requirement change and so the isk costs reflect that coupled with a change in how minerals are introduced into the game and you get wider disparity in isk coststake a look at the mineral costs of building the ships the skills and skill cost and use that as your multipliers
well i dont see anything disastrous in it it will give new content to the community will be fun to participate and to watch and it d be 90 player driven at beginning and after 9999 it also could attract new players to the game because it d weekly streamed on own 3d and skilling up for a frigate practicing with em loosing em is not much of a deal all tools aint there thats why we have the assembly hall to propose some ideas new features etc and it doesnt even demand massive effort because the tool that is needed for this project is already in the game just not available to playersand believe me i did lot of brainstorming on this and without the arena like alliance tournament has cant be done without oversimplifying it and making it dull
yes it can do it in a cynojammed deadend system your alliance holds and dont allow anybody other than the competitors to enter
hehehe yeah close enoughbut unfortunately u cannot keep a system closed 24h a day ppl will be able to grief if they want cloaky bombers can pass easily gate camps or ppl can log off their alts and w8 for macthes to begin and also the spectator mode wldnt be possiblebut yeah good one it goes in line what milton said so if i had to make the league working at any cost lot simplified that d be the measurements i d take it wldnt be streamed also but recorded and than put on you tube so ppl wldnt know the exact time when the matches will begin but still compeeting teams can whisper to some griefers when the matches of their closest rivals wld start
the easiest way i can think of to run a system like this would be to use whs give the participants a system to meet in and a short warning then find a wh within 10j of that system and have people go into the wh for the match then you can either just run the match quick or chaincollapse the wh and find a new exit after the match if you accidentally end up in an occupied wh and the occupants take offense well you have two pvp fleets with you already this would be relatively simple to run and wouldnt require sov or cynojammers or anything like that it would be relatively secure too someone could crash the party if they really wanted too but itd be just about impossible without a participant giving away the location which would immediately disqualify them and give them whatever bad rep you can dream upit is possible to run a tournament with the current mechanics and to mitigate the risks of someone crashing the party you just have to think a bit outside the box

i and some others are curious about whether or not the crimewatch mechanics change is being worked on and if it is slated for the winter expansion or if its current status is something along the lines of indefinitely delayed  im not asking for a devblog or anything impossible like that just an update on ccps actual plans
im hoping its doa and theyll roll out the neutral logi fix separately asapnot likely though
something ive seen lacking ingame is the ability for low skilled or newer characters group up with random people in fleets to take on missions or complexes with incursions i do love the system reports and the dedicated incursion channel for people looking for fleets problem is incursions are pretty tough for low sp characters and shipsi propose something like a constellation wide incursion by a pirate faction that concord needs capsuleers to assist however make the beacons lead to jumpgates that accept frigatedestroyercruiser hulls no t2 ships with emphasis on small hulls the difficulty is set to where youll need at least 3 t2 moduled ships to run and survive enemy npc may not be instapop dps but theyll have dagan sized tanks where primaries need to be addressedsuch a proposal could be a sleeper attack where sleepers have gone on the offensive but with smaller ships and scoutlike vessels theyve set up bases in pockets of deadspace that only allow small ship hulls to use at the last room could be a battleship sized boss course a single frigate cant break the tank thus creates the need for a fleet of frigates
i 100 agree with this suggestion it would be a huge change to the way pvp works atmoh also i wouldnt mind a slingshot warp where ships accelerate insanely fast into warp almost like a bullet from a gun giving a star trek look to the warp and same thing with the landing from warp psupercap nerf  change ewar immunity
so make the rig decrease the amount of time spent on accelerating and decelerating in warp instead of increase the warpspeed or even make an extra rig that decreases acceldecel time

more ways to engage a combat  better game so interceptors should be excellent in that area and they are missing exactly this one
this on paper the interceptor looks like its designed to outrun fleeing ships not just on grid but in warp as well as it stands most pursuits the interceptor will have to rely solely on a faster align time because the warp speed as demonstrated in the op is only relevant in longer warps
1good work documenting this i was surprised to see how little difference there is on shorter warps
1 i would like to see this happeni would also like for warp paths to take into account orbital mechanics and the proximity of solar bodies  ie warping towards a gas giant or sun will make the ship travel faster
i would even be happy with only the intercepter getting a faster warp acceleration to begin with it is clearly intended for such an abilityso that said add a a extra ship bonus to the intercepters of 20 faster warp speed acceleration per level perhaps only on the ceptors that have tackling range bonus or both supercap nerf  change ewar immunity

why have scripts as separate objects when they are completely useless on their own they only add to clutter in the inventory and more clicks to the process of buying and outfitting a shipi say remove them and let the modules that currently use scripts come with all scripts builtin by defaultsorry manufacturers and sellers of scripts
is it really that big a deal ive never heard of anyone ever having significant issues with this
noits one of those small changes that just makes the game better like the descriptive implant names
it would certainly simplify fitting ships and inventory management thats a few less things to clutter up the hangarcargo bay1 because i dont see a reason to oppose it
first lets identify the problem an active tank in subcapital ships in pvp is rare because as the number of targets shooting you increases it quickly stops offering protection youll explode before being able to convert a meaningful amount of your capacitor into shieldarmor i cringe when looking at these new ancillary shield boosters that were obviously intended to provide high shield boosting for short periods of time because frankly its a  terrible way to approach the problem now that i got this off my chest let me present what i think would be a good solution at least conceptuallya series of scripts for shield boosters and armor repairers that greatly increase their output at an even greater cost in efficiency they allow a ship to tank large amounts of damage but only for short amounts of time why scripts though and not new modules because they provide the flexibility thats neededheres an example2x output script 50 cycle time 100 activation cost doubles output and cap cost4x output script 75 cycle time 300 activation cost quadruples output and cap costthis only serves to illustrate the concept i do not claim that these numbers are balanced or right i do claim however that this is the correct way to approach the problem

ahm wh are an option yes i thought about it but the selection of random whs is just not possible for the league to function fluently what i was thinking is to make an agreement with some strong wh corpsalliances that have settled strongholds to allow us for 1 day to execute scheduled matches every week i d choose different hoststhis would be benefitial for both the hosts would get some nice promotion of their alliancescorps and maybe even some iskies
current incursion stagingscout site provide some of what you might be interested in the rewards are slim but overcoming the challenge is reward enough once or twice of course i would not argue if ccp was to boost scout sites a little to the point that they were competitive with l3 missions
what exactly is stopping you from grouping with random people in fleets to take on missions or complexes
why do you want to group with random peoplejoin a corp do stuff with nonrandom people make friends and get socially invested
because u can do them alone or if not u need 23 chars with some t3 ships well the guy has a nice point it will add lot more interesting stuff for fresh chars if there d be some content missions plexes incursions or whateva that allow only up to cruiser t1 hull that will help a lot newcomers into new eden
working just as it was intended towah my easy isk generation with limited risk isnt big enough wah

warning verbosetldr versionccp please remove ship based penalties from t2 missile ammunition it creates an imbalance especially among frigates and cruisers in that missile ships most often have to choose faction ammo for pvp or worry about signature bloom or reduced velocitythese are concerns turret ships do not have it creates an imbalance and needs looking intoextended versionas a result of the not so recent t2 ammo rehaul ccp chronotis removed all ship based penalties from t2 turret ammo the same penalties that either reduce a ships velocity or increase its signature radius when t2 ammo is loaded was unchanged with respect to missiles onlyat that time i made several post in that thread and others decrying the imbalance this would create and most of those complaints went unheardi finally got ccp chronotis to respond to my question of why the penalties were not removed from missiles the same way the had been with respect to turret ammo following is his response source post 101
this thread at least deserves a ccp reply on whether the idea is workable from a technology point of viewwarp vectors accounting for celestial bodies and slingshotting ships around planets and stars rather than just passing through them would be stupendously awesome
also insanely demanding of the server and insanely difficult to add since there isnt even the basis of orbital relationshipsalso when warping we are not completely part of this dimension or some such orbital bodies have no effect on us
no
that would totally break the game no
as another point make said modules require more materials to build as the scripts would be included allow for capability of switching scripts on the fly as well which would require a new skill called either coding or programmingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

any recommendations for ship names the name aegis itself would seem to fit gallente they have myrmidons ares keres etc though calling the gallente ship an athenaclass destroyer just sounds better so lets start there gallente athena class minmatar mattock class fits with the weapon naming as opposed to weather dogs or the occa amarr penitent class religious theme caldari djinn class mythical creature like the basilisk
has anyone in eve ever actually used defender missiles
i personally havent i dont even think i can use them one question i do have about them is is there a difference in effectiveness between grouped and ungrouped launchers i ask this because when you group your missile launchers the server considers them as one big missile for movement and i think damage
to counter the invincibly fleet issue you are suggestingall mods are targeted and have to be active before the shot is fired this means that it can only be active on one target this means that the agis destroyer can only protect one ship per mod fitted if the ad is projecting defense logistics to multiple targets then their effect is going to be greatly diminished

hello everyonesince the last patch fw has gained a whole new dimension and new lp mechanics are rather attractivehowever i think  i believe im far of being the only one to  that in the current state complexes rewards are broken not that they give too much lp but this lp is too easy to obtain methods on how to make 300m isk per hour with dayold alts flourish and this is where the thing seems broken the isk payout maybe but mainly the whole dont fire a round and get away with thousands of lpdont get me wrong i have somehow jumped on the bandwagon too im far from being a game designer but as a mildly old eve player i believe there is a problem so here is my proposal to spice things up do not get the changes as something to implement as it is especially the numbers stated its rather like a general direction that could be taken in order to balance things up keep rewards as they are multiply by 3 the time to complete a plex timer becomes a capture point gauge or something that fills 3x slower when you orbit the button every npc kill adds up some points to this gauge which therefore fills faster if you kill npcs balancing should be made in order to rewards offensive plexers in a way that good combat fits piloted by decent individuals can fill the capture point gauge horrible name i know a bit faster than precedentlyto sum up a day old gunless incursus in a minor plex would take 30 min to clear the site whereas a skilled dramiel would clear the same plex in 69 minsfeel free to comment or tell your own experience

i dont doubt that this kind of physics calculation would be very expensive  but isnt it wonderful that we now have gpgpu servers that are well suited for crunching these kinds of numbers i would assume if ccp had an interest in doing this it would include a general upgrade of the destiny physics engine to run on this specific hardware and not on general purpose cpusanyhow from the gameplay perspectiveit would increase tactical options available to players  in the case of an entire fleet warping the timing and vectors would be criticalit would give space a sense of variation  terrain is something ive felt eve really lacks right now because other than using planets and celestials as glorified bookmarks well and pi and the eventual dust 514 link they have little gameplay value sitting next to a planet or warping to one is exactly the same as warping to a bookmark in deep space having them effect warping would make fleet maneuvers and chases more varied i dont see how it could possibly be a bad thingthe best part its a serverside physics implementation so nobody would need a fancy computer in order to benefit also i do also want to see tessellation shield strike effects and damage skins on shipssure its pie in the sky but would be fantastic

thats correct although an aegis destroyer should be able to fit several of these defensive modules each module is also only effective for one kind of incoming fire that does a couple of things to limit their powersudden attacksin the hisec gank protection detail scenario youd fit the ships such that they had at least one of each kind of module possibly two of each kind if we assume all 8 high slots this means that the defenders are ready for any kind of damage that may show up but they need to be on the ball to use the correct defensive measure for the attackers who show up they could spam all 8 modules on the intended friendly but the ganker simply needs to wait for them to cap outthe appropriate response if the attacker doesnt immediately fire is for the athena pilot for example to examine the attackers to see what weapons theyre actually using defense is by weapon type as opposed to hardened by damage type this means a visual examination of the attacker or fitting a combat scanner would do the trick the athena pilot activates all modules at first then figures they only need the antiprojectile modules onthe gank could still be possible by a crew bringing a mixed bag of weapon types to the partyskirmish with intelscouts report on the enemy fleet composition or spies do and notify your fleet that the enemy is running a hellcat fleet you order your djinn pilots to be ready with their coherence disruptors antilaser what you dont know is that an enemy reserve fleet is bringing gallente ships running blasters for pointblank attack which is very difficult for aegis destroyers to handle given the range and interposition requirementspreparation gives the defender the advantage operational security and surprise levels the playing fieldto sum up there are lots of ways given the suggested mechanics that aegis destroyers are prevented from becoming overpowered new fitting intel and piloting doctrines would be needed aegis hunting with interceptors new blasterboat doctrine maneuver tactics cap and ecm warfare against aegis destroyers logistics and active defense boosting better most of these activities should be accessible within the first few months of training for new charactersfor pve content bring the sanshasleeper ai to l4 missions they would still be in hisec but they could be tougher to solo take your tanked battleship but bring or hire two buddies flying mattocks or penitents youre going to need them

as a cap builder i have to disagree with your ideanot because it would solve the cap blob cuz it wontnot because it would make you feel relevant cuz it wontnot because expensive caps would make the world a better place because it wontbut because i think capitals are way too expensive for what they are as is give me a carrier hull that can easily tank 30 battleships without triage and i might be inclined to entertain the notion of such a crappy idea give me expanded hull ranges for each class while your at it but dont up the prices in exchange for nothing
this has been proposed countless times before and shot down each timeincreasing the price wont stop the massive sov space alliances making them to wage war in massive capital fleets what it will do is hit the small corps lowsec pirates and all the people who need all the help they can get as it stands the problem with capital ships is that they are not killed often enough which is why there is so many of them making them more expensive to build wont change anything all it will do is make people more careful with them and so the rate at which cap ships will build up will stay the same except that those ships will belong to all the massive sov space alliances will be the ones hording them if you want the game to stagnate and for the big alliances to stay big and the small alliances stay small then get this idea pushed through if like me you dont want any of the above then show displeasure at this idea creeping up into the assembly hall again
eh just make them easier to gank those running them no becons 60km away from warp in make it easy to catch complaisant fw runners
well plenty of plexers get caught everyday the only sites where you can really have hard times catching people are minors since cloakies cannot enter the plex dscan will always reveal a potential threatthe issue is rather about 1m sp characters racking more money than 1b ships in incursions not about plexers being too hard to catch imo
there is problem with the station in akhmoh solar systemim always stucking when trying to warp somewhere after undocking including the stargate even with a battlecruiserscreenshotive heard that this is the old problem so why not fix it im teaching my buddy and this is a good station for our current deeds it has iii and iv agents but now i see why its not so popularsure i can wait 10 seconds after undock but why
amarr stations are just like that its the way theyre structuredif it really annoys you use an instaundock bookmark problem solved
not solved because i will have to warp one more time its more annoying than to wait 10 seconds
live with it you life wont end by waiting 5 or so seconds
but it the amarr stations i might understand if itll be some matari station
i dont recall ever getting hung up on a minmatar or caldari stations undock amarr stations are the typical culprits for such snags isnt bouncing around the undock at amarr efa fun while some of the gallente stations have issues in this regard too
during last fanfest they mentioned a complete rework of how crimewatch worksthis should fix this in its entirety
also gatestation games arent a neutral rr problem theyre an rr has no aggression timers problem the crimewatch rework should fix this as they are planning to add support for inherited aggression timers which stops the station games while allowing logisticsbased gangs to deaggress the same way a locally tanked gang would

well the simple way that could work perpahs a tech 2 destroyer with special ability of 99 cpu use for an aegis module 4 types of aegis modules depending on weapon types  optical distortion for laser fire  magnetic distortion for particle accelerators  gravitational distortion for projectile fire  antimissile system based on either projectiles beams or missiles or whatever else aegis module is activated on a friendlie adds negation to incoming damage based on a formula  damagetaken  damagegiven  1  base  skillmodifier  rangemodifier  skillmodifier is calculated based on relevant skills and is something like 1  skillbonus  skilllevel  rangemodifier is 1 for anything within the optimal range and 1  falloff between optimal range and falloff range  if there are several modules activated on a friendly ship the best protection applies others are ignored since if the best one cant intercept the projectilemissilewhateve others cannot as well if this is not optimal it can be chancebased instead of damage reductionbased then  chancetodeflect  base  skillmodifier  rangemodifier in fact both based and chancebased modules can be made available modules use ammo when protected target receives fire no calculations of 3d positioning are ever made modules are extremely short range like in 5km range 10km falloff modules occupy high slots under no circumstance can they deflect more than 33 damage or with a chance higher than 50 chancebased reduce more total dps but doesnt protect against alpha that well numbers taken from the sky  could be any other cap value rigs or subsystems are used heavily to make modules effective and rigs support only one type of projectile protection meaning you cant have omniprotection on one dessie modules that are not supported by rigssubsystems are almost ineffective  say 5 dps reduction modules have a certain projectilebeamwhatever else class size they are optimized against and are half as effecient against 1 size difference and ineffective against more than 1 size difference destroyers are immobilewith significantly reduced speed when modules are activeso what actually happens in battle dessies are deployed near key targets and are unable to move as fast as their targets fleet is better protected but immobile and flankable dessies themselves are still vulnerable to high alpha bs cannonsmissile strikes because they have no speed bonus either enemy tries to overwhelm the wall tries to flank or requests reinforcements with a different damage type or just continues to hammer till dessies run out of ammo for aegis modules for example aegis module designed against bs hybrids and supported by necessary rigsubsystem works full force against large hybrids half force against cruiser hybrids and is useless against frig hybrids as well as against any other weapons that is missiles cannons lasers of any sizehow calculations workship a fires at ship bship b is protected by aegis module standard damage is calculateddamage reduction or chance of deflection is knowndamage is reduced if a  modifier applies or deflected if there is a chance and rnd gives appropriate resultswhatever is left of damage is applied normallydefending dessie expends some ammoalmost no extra load on the server especially considering that in case of grouped weapons they still are calculated separately as far as i knowanother edit  about the idea of making it harder for the protected ship to fire properly since the protection module has a certain ammo it is designed to intercept it will give a penalty to damage from protected ship based on its type and the penalty is half of its interception power  lore can be adjusted to since its hard to differentiate between friendly and enemy projectiles when they are fired in such a short time as to be able to react to them modules degrade performance of friendly guns as well now obviously an antilaser aegis module will not affect any nonlaser guns on the protected target as well this will actually encourage the use of different weapon types between warring parties since it gives penalties it has to be used only on fleet members lore could justify it saying that you need input from the protected ship to know whom to protect against and this info is not shared outside the fleet this will prevent aegis modules from being used for harassment of neutrals and purposeful dps reduction of the firing ship of choice
i would also like to see the warp mechanics changed to at least reduce the time it takes to accelerate to full warp speed inwarp and to decelerate for exiting warp a change like this would make fast warp speed ships considerably more effective than they currently are

i definitely support and endorse this product or servicei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
the dobbel click in eve gives a new direction and sometimes acceleration to a higher velocity but the hud shows only the actual velocity for the purposes of pvp and some work at a pos i want to make a proposal for the hud when you have switched on the tactical overview add a vector like an arrow at the center of the ship that shows the actual direction add a vector like an arrow at the center of the ship that shows the desired direction given by the dobbel click or the align cmd add a value for the actual speed to the vector for the actual direction by a colored bar or so but dont use the length because at lower speed the arrow will be to short all the information should be already in the client so there will be no additional server load
but why dont they fix it somehow
this is a playability issue really sure older players realize they can have problems and work out ways around it but newer players will just get frustrated with it better that its sortedspeaking of which you may want to start proposing ideas for how to fix it because remodeling the station is probably out of the question and moving the point you appear outside the station really isnt a good idea you could move the station locations i suppose
yes there should be a proper fix models are fine actually this amarr station is quite beatifulthere is a several ways that i see1 undocking at higher speed on those stations2 make station models bigger hey its a nice idea even without this issue how else they can take hundreds of freighters in3 not as cool as number 2 but just dont bumb station for some time while undocking its already done for ships which can undock inside each other and theyre just warp through the stations anyway

first thank you very much for your post a lot of good stuff in there some more replies to the numbers a bit lateri have to disagree to the restrictions and penalties described ill outline why from both a lore and game play perspectivelorethe aegis destroyer has advanced sensor suites as well as the ability to use sensor links to coordinate the defense with the intended friendly this allows it to distinguish between outgoing and incoming fire besides the ciws system would have to be aimed in the opposite direction to suppress outgoing fireregarding the requirement that protected friendlies be fleet members only remember this is partly intended to boost the mercenary trade as such there will be mining operations where several of these destroyers will be hired to run an initial screen against gankers with a reserve force waiting until shots have been fired as is often the case operational security may dictate that the protecting destroyers although on contract are not trusted to be fleet members their services are still useful howevergameplayif an opponent wants the benefit of an aegis destroyer they should have to field their own if defensive advantage is positional the fleet is already penalized because they have to hold position relative to the attacker and the protector in some cases this may actually mean holding still that provides a decided advantage to the attacker in those cases where they are more mobile than the defending forces or when the attacker can fight under the wall at whitesoftheireyes range i always prefer tactical tradeoffs to calculated penalties besides the friendly being attacked has enough to worry about theyre being shot at they shouldnt also have to worry about shooting through the pillows that are smothering themif there are no artificial penalties to the defended friendly then there is no need to impose an infleet restriction if im flying an athena i should be able to turn my ciws modules on for any target i wishthere are sufficient tactical counters to aegis destroyers i think that imposing penalties on the defended targets is an undesirable complication
well actually the whole fleet restriction was there to accomodate for inclusion of penalties if no penalties are needed then away goes the restriction however using aegis modules in hisec should flag the defending destroyer the instant it attempts to intercept incoming fire making it a valid target for the attacker battleship alice is defended by destroyer bob bobs aegis module activated on alice and idle enemy battleship chris appears it has a wardec on alice but not bob chris targets alice nothing happens chris fires at alice aegis module on bob is triggered because alice is under fire attempting to deflect the attack from chris whether any real damage reduction happens or not bob is now flagged towards chris and can be attacked legallyhovever this in no way prevents concord coming for chris should he do something like that without a wardec on aliceas for tactical maneuvering since destroyers have very slow speed when modules are activated you cant effectively defend all the ships in your fleet unless you have as many aegis destroyers as needed to cover all other ships in your fleet which is quite a lot considering you wont fit more than 3 aegis modules on one destroyer and even that sacrificing all tank so if you cover those ships that are facing the opponent he might have the option to try to flank the front tankers and attack the rear snipers which are now unprotectedin any case the main use i see for such ships is protection against alpha and shortduration incoming dps reduction to key targets in small to medium scenarios they are certainly not meant for sustained protection maybe some larger vessel could be used in bigger fleet fights because frankly no matter what number you place next to tech a t2 or t3 destroyer is still a destroyer and with modules active its not even speedtanked means it will live only as long as the locking time on that enemy sniper goesanother edityour idea that going up close and personal is a way to negate aegis defence has merit but imo it creates a loophole  blaster boats are already very strong at close range seen examples when blaster cruiser almost killed a heavily tanked bc so while according to earth lore tm it is logical in eve it could create another imbalance towards close range pvp which as you can guess means no formations againstill its your thread and your original idea so i wont fight over it the thing that troubles me with all this is the fact that in large fleets when primaries are called aegis boats are going to be first concentrated alpha targets and wont last long now there is nothing wrong with the idea of cheap expendable ships but when it comes to the sentiment that new players would wish to contribute to fleet warfare by flying this more eagerly rather than tackle rifters or some other cliche throwaways id think it makes no difference to a new player after all flying something that is destined to die first is no fun especially when you dont have any reasonable chance of getting a km yourself on the other hand if you let them withstand sustained damage from a large fleet it means giving them a tank more befitting a dread rather than a dessie so it doesnt quite work so the problem i see is with scaling  adding more aegis boats at some point stops giving any more benefits while adding damage boats generally scales quite well therefore at a certain size of fleets aegis boats would be owerwhelmed to a point when having them is less useful than just fielding more plain dps and they are too frail to last long which again reduces their usefulness in large scale combat even moreif we find a solution to that we will get a thoughout game mechanic that can be proposed to ccp if not aegis boats remain useful only in preemptive asset protection such as hisec mining ops or cargo runs which could be nice for every miner or hauler but that is not something most eve players would want to fly more likely just put an alt and press a couple buttons then alttab i think
im not sold that the boats should actually be slowed by modules rather i think they should have the general speed of destroyers the faster you go the harder it is to keep them in the proper position so they have a tactical tradeoff to keep them slow not to mention that the athena and the penitent would be armor tankers and probably fit platesaegis destroyers may protect each other first and second may have logistics and command as back uppart of the entire point of aegis destroyers is that you must activate your module before the opposing party fires because this is an action on a friendly not only should you not get flagged for it you shouldnt get flagged at all unless you take an overt action toward the attacking ship you mention that this pure defensive action should flag for aggression and you give an example of how it would work but you dont say why it ought to work that wayi held it to tech level 1 so that only destroyers iv would be required in addition to the requisite ciws skills mentioned keeping the hull cheap means ship replacement is easier to manage so new players arent afraid to lose it its also gets them used to blowing up which if you are overly afraid to be blown up you end up staying away from 85 of the game play in evewith regard to a blasterboat loophole i think that blasters would make it harder to defend but at the same time the blaster boats are likely without protection and make nice juicy targets if you prepare for them this is also one reason why i dont think we should prenerf the speed too much
about how those modules could work according to loreim thinking more in line with russian plasma tech that is used to deflect a flying round by altering air friction within atmosphere rather than something that is designed to destroy it makes little sense to try to hit something as small as a shell at extreme speeds to me while creating something with area effect in its path is much simplerso in space you could use ammo that creates a temporary field area whatever else in the way of incoming shot with something that acts like resistance differential does in atmosphere for instance gravitational pull that provides the shot with acceleration sideways thus making this shot move somewhat offtarget for example a microsecond lifetime gravitational field could be formed next to the path of a minmatar shell which is in a state of matter and the shell receives acceleration towards that grav field while passing by altering its course em field could be used against charged projectiles like hybrid shots laser beam is countered by deploying some form of chaff cheap and effective minmatar style and missiles well this is one case when point defence lasers have valid applicationaccording to lore makes perfect sense that both caldari and gallente would think about hybrids first and also knowing that espionage is rampant in new eden there is no reason why gallente couldnt steal some laser tech from amarr they might not even need to steal anything as mining lasers are common and ore is gallentean to defend against caldari missiles amarrwould naturally adapt lasers against minmatar missiles and perhaps order some grav research in caldari to deal with shells minmatar of course are concerned with laser fire and as always the cheaper it is to make and maintain the simpler the principles the better so chaff comes to life againcharges contain the means to deploy these miniature obstacles for the incoming shells naturally no real fields are launched in game its just a visual effect on the client calculations are performed as shown in my post above and charges are expendednow one thing i could imagine as useful in large scale battle is using aegis platforms in antidrone warfare while some people said here that drones should be excluded i think that good old flak screen is quite viable against those pesky fighters and fighterbombers making carriers a bit less op  youd have to actually remove enemys sam capability before having a go at bombing them plus this could be an aoe effect with modules dealing automatic damage to anything within range smartbomb style with a chance to hit based on drone signature and speed and working only on drones again short duration due to loads of ammo expended while operatingthis would provide two distinct roles to aegis boats  in shortmedium warfare you have your antialpha and damage reduction boat while in large scale pvp you have a mobile antidrone platform that can cover areas around key targets and needs to go boom before fighters or fighterbombers can be deployed in that case it is even closer to its real life counterpart as a versatile protection platform that is still very vulnerable to direct attacks but is good at guarding others
so how do you prevent all your aegis destroyers from being wiped out in a preliminary alpha round you properly buffer tank them have them provide protection for each other have them boosted by command ships and have reps on them from logistics cruisers yes theyre vulnerable to frigates but you have frigates of your own right also the new target lock breaker seems like a nobrainer for one of these shipsyoure right though there is a scaling issue but im of the opinion that overwhelming force should actually be overwhelming only now the bar would be set a fair bit higher for all the while the opposing fleet is chewing through destroyers your fleet isnt going to sit back and watch perhaps tech 2 for better resistances for  12k ehp when maxtanked lets say might make more senseagain i dont think we have to ask ccp build me exactly this rather we ought to say build me something that lets me play this waythank you again for the feedback keep it comping
i like that idea a sort of drone disruption smart bomb how about it having a small chance to disconnect the drone
the flagging  i think it is needed to make sure no neutral can protect someone else without becoming a valid target else wardec mechanics do not work properly  you have someone protecting you who cant be attacked without concord intervention the moment it interferes it is legal game but until then its perfectly safegetting blown up is not the problem ive played other mmos not wow thankfully  and ive seen a problem there with certain classes if the class is a critical pita for the opponent it is destined to die within first seconds of any encounter and that is not something interesting even tacklers would live longer imo granted there are no classes in eve but you do expect the newbie to get a few months worth of skills before he moves to some other role and even then if these boats are to be useful someone will have to fly them constantly and it wouldnt really make sense to add something to the game that is going to be flown by yet another altas for close range make falloff range mechanics work twofold  you have minimal range optimal range and falloff range anything shorter than mininal doesnt get intercepted at all  you just physically have no way to deploy the antiweapon before the enemy shot passes by
first youre perfectly welcome it is one of those few suggestion threads worth spending time on i thinksecond about the scaling its not that the overwhelming fleet is going to wipe the nearest moon with aegis boats that worries me but the fact that at certain fleet size on both sides using aegis boats becomes ineffecient as it all comes down to blob alphaing primaries and no damage interception will save against that while having more alpha of your own instead makes perfect sense thats why i think having flak boats does make sense because this is one functionality that would scale incredibly well with fleet size making these boats useful even in large scale pvp plus bs wont be easy pickings to carrier gangs and having a strong frigate fleet to remove aegis boats will be a mustactually it could even give some role for your ordinary tech 1 dessies  to trap and kill incoming frigates before they get to aegis boats which in turn means the enemy needs cruisers to deal with your t1 dessiesi do think that if we provide ccp with a solution on a platter and one that players consider balanced there is a chance it gets implemented right from the start rather than within next few expansions there will still be balancing issues of course but the core mechanics do need to be polished here thats why i think we should get the details as fine as possible because most of these threads never go beyond make this so that i can do that and nobody will bother thinking how its supposed to work we need to present a solution for implementation not just an idea thats the way you prepare projects in business
like i said its your thread so all the power is yours here i certainly would not wish for any obscene ugliness that is smartbomb animation in use here what i meant was smartbomb mechanics meaning area of effect objects within it receive damage per module cycle only this time based on chance and their speedsig nothing new to eve and simple to calculate and the dessie spends as many ammo rounds as there are targets within aoe looks like classic flak fire on the client with explosions around drones adjusted to airless environment different ammo could have different effects  there could be certainly link disruption ammo that could have temporary or chancebased disconnection for drones or even a chance of disabling them there could even be target disruption ammo which would make drone target acquisition systems ineffective thus reducing their dps but that would require some serverbased computations that are beyond existing mechanics while the classic flak screen is pretty simple  you are a drone you get fired upon you get hit you take damage you pull out before its too late or go boomand since an aegis dessie could be used against one damage type and against drones at the same time it would be versatile without becoming universal you still would need 4 dessies at least to have protection against all four weapon types while at the same time having four flak screen sources means drones die four times as fasthere is an extremely rough sketch of what caldari aegis boat could look like  at least the way i see it it is a heavily modified cormorant chassis adapted to house heavy aegis equipment it has 2 x2 standard gun hardpoints green on the drawing 2x2 aegis module hardpoints blue and 1 x2 flak cannon hardpoint pinkish dont be too strict i dont have a wacom tablet at work neither do i have too much time so had to use the mouse and make it quick

your idea has merit this is one thing about fw that really bothers me its so easy too i know that i have exploited it many times and generally dont even fit guns on my frigates having the timer drop with every npc i kill would be good motivation to actually pay attention to what i was doing instead of multiboxing with my miner for the record i havent lost a barge or a plexing ship while multiboxingi would also like to see the benifits for fleets increase as well if more people are on the button the time decreases faster up to 2x the speed with 5 people on the buttonfw needs to be about promoting teamwork and not exploiting poorly thought out mechanics you have my full supportgerrick
yeah i understand you point but i was in whs for some time and especially those with highsec entrancesexits have lots of transitients and also quite few ppl that are after easy preys and this is not about getting in have a fight and getting out my intention is to have a league of 20 teams so that is 10 matches every sunday it really cant be done on the go it wouldnt be fun for the participants nor for the spectators
i heard a rumour that when ccp finally dare to approach the walking in stations thing again 2015 is the current estimate of when theyll be confident enough to touch it again that the first thing theyre going to do is add giant gladiatorial arenas in the amarr stations
the only thing worth using t3s for in hisec are missions and hisec warsa t2 ishtar can clear lvl 4s faster than a t3 and hisec wars nullify your complaint because nothing says the otherside cant use them too
he cant use them too because of risk aversion oh noez sp and isk goes pop a nerf to people who are not riskaverse is a buff to himself
take a bunch of week old characters in crap skilledfit t1 dps and logi cruisers into level 4sproblem solvednow that i think of it would love to see a small fleet of 34 week olds in t1 cruisers trying to clear worlds collide or blockadeedit theres always wormholes gather your little nub friends and take a fleet into a c1c2 you might not just get loot you might get a gank out of it as well and if you get ganked in return eff it cheap t1 cruisers with cheap meta14 mods
yeah but they only pay out 50000 so its a comical waste of timeid make scout sites designed to be run by 24 people in battlecruisers and pay out 5 mil or so then theyd be something that a handful friends could get together and run for a bit of isk and it might be enjoyable to run rather than getting into a macharael fleet and listening to some neckbeard bark out orders in a vanguard sitei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
ccp stopped lowsec lvl5 agents giving highsec missions yet highsec lvl4 agents still give lowsec missions
if you want to penalize using t2 over faction make unit sizes larger and more expensive than factionor rather than have penalties that stack without any stacking penalties im looking at you ccp per hardpoint just have an across the board penalty thats the same whether its 1 turretlauncher loaded or 8

i thought i posted this in the previous thread but i guess it got eatenthis change as you propose it would change minmatar stations from most popular in new eden by an order of magnitude to only ever used for scrapmetal reprocessing and mineral compression not that this is necessarily a bad thing but it would also make basically all of the refinery upgrades to all of the stations useless35 gives you perfect refine with perfect skills and the 4 implant40 means you dont need either the specialization skill to 5 or you dont need the implant for perfect refinewhat i would propose would be a 20 base to basic refinery arrays and a 30 base to intensive arrays this means that you could get 8188 yield out of a basic refinery array with perfect skills 8588 with the implantintensive arrays would give a yield of 9188 9588 with the implant these numbers would still basically make all refinery upgrades to stations except minmatar ones obsolete but matari stations would still be better because it is what theyre specialized ini just dont think you should be able to get 100 refine without a station
outposts offer far more convenience than a pos 100 refining at a pos that still takes half an hour is hardly convenient
not true remember that in an outpost you get instant refine of all types of stuff at a pos its going to take a you 15 30 or 60 minutes  for each type of ore you want to refine  and you can only refine ore in limited quantities nothing elsewith enough ore it could potentially take you up to 8 hours or more to refine it all unless you have no other choice players will still use a stationgiven the time it takes to refine any sizeable amount of a single ore type you should be able to get 100 refine  edited out if you use the implant  no longer feel its necessary  at a pos ill update the original post to use a 35 base refine rateagain this will have no direct impact on stations as the instant refine will always win over the time it takes to grind through a ton of orealso alliances that want to dictate that these arrays are not allowed are certainly free to do so which would further lessen any potential impact to stationshrolt ceo live free die proud

in case u sirius if u compaare price t3 is near to faction bs or marauder which are much more difficult to f1 up l2p maybe
i guess i can agree on the annoyance of having to wait for your refining to be done living in a wormhole for a few months will teach you how annoying that isthat being said i do question the other numbers you put out there the question i have is why would anyone use the medium intensive refining array when they could just use two refining arrays and get more ore processed faster with more granulation for the same cpupg costthe same goes for the intensive refining arrayeither the efficiency should suffer or it should take more time or something
a couple of points1 you are asking for some fairly major changes here having refining arrays take skills into account is hard because they arent really tied to a single person2 you are asking for changes in an area that ccp has said will be rewritten so any changes would probably be thrown outif you an get a bunch more support in here we can bring it up but i suspect most people would rather ccp spend their time on the pos overhaul instead of changes to pos refineries that few people use yes partly because they suckcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
suggestions then on numbers pleasethe rough idea i had was to scale but you are correct that i didnt anticipate multiple arrays being in use  and i should have expected thiscapacity  i dont think this should change much or should just scale on size eg s m l the idea here is to be able to refine a reasonable amount of ore that is being mined by a decent sized group or to be able to save it up  refine latercpu  pg  i deliberatly scaled these sure you can put multiple intensive arrays on a tower but youll end up with no cpupg for defenses so it would be a tradeoffefficiency  addressed belowyes these could be viewed as large changes i think that when you consider the usage of these structures this might be all that is needed to bring them back into the realm of the usedthe arrays do take your skills into account  its just that with perfect or close to perfect refining skills the array is capped at a 75 yield so yes somewhere in the equations skills are used if you capped it at say 90 pr 95 with no skills needed then it would just be abused by day old toonsi know its possibly a doa subject given that a complete pos update is coming however ccp did make the change to allow us to rename all the pos modules  granted that was because of the crazy ui implementation  but it can be doneas long as these changes can be kept to just adjusting the numbers eg capacity  cpu  pg  refining  cap and not functionality changes requiring a huge time investment then they really are 15 minutes stat updates once the updated numbers have been decided uponto address the efficiency issue from above with the skills  if you were to just give the arrays a 100 cap  then your skills would truely decide the output and you wouldnt have to touch the forumula eg  output  array cap  reprocessing formula outputthanks for the input im adjusting the op for refining yield assuming the formula really is skill basedhrolt ceo live free die proud
sort of agree with two step here those are deceptively large changes to a feature which will begin a complete rewritte in less than a year i dont see a pressing crisis caused by smaller mining arrays being underutilized compared to the largest model that would warrent ccp taking dev time out of existing projects including said pos revamp
iirc the formula is 0375  1  refining  002  1  refineryefficiency  004  1  processingspecialization  005  refinerybaseso with perfect skills youd get a 61875 yield with a 0 refinerybut the op is correct refineries already do take into account your skills so that isnt much of a changei also understand that ccp is already rewriting poss and the change will be out soontm but this would take next to 0 time as it would just be changing two variables that being said i figured aharm would be all about wanting a better refinery out in wh space
yes the formula is correct i should have posted it sooner   thanksin the short term this would be a bigger benefit to wh dwellers  at a minimum it would certainly cut down on logistics and yes i have been a part of those lets help move multiple cap ship quantities of ore into the wh to build with fleets very time consumingthe problem with starting the complete rewrite in less than a year is that any potentially finished product is at least a year away with decent testing  and weve already been pulling the dead horse along for a very long timethat said this is a simple update with a high return and near zero effort like renaming the pos structures while it is industrialbased it is thowing a bone to the pos owners and in effect saying we feel your pain heres an update that we can help you out with now as we integrate this into the new systemall that needs to be agreed upon are the numbers  then hrolt  aharm can anchor a few more of these hrolt ceo live free die proud
ccp raise that limit to 30k  13k is not enough or give me something to quick remove and add packs of bms beside delete year 2012 and we have a bookmark limit feels like 1900
how about this adding an archive functionality to bookmarks that would allow you to archive bookmark groups this would remove them from your bm list and from the primary bookmark database but saves them in such a way they can be retrieved easily if theyre needed technical limitations would probably require there to be a delay in storage and retrieval but that would just be part of the archiving process that way you could do things like have groups from each region and when you know youre going to be moving a long distance you can start by archiving the bms you wont need and retrieving the ones you will ten minutes later or whatever those are loaded up and youre good to goi briefly thought about the idea of exporting to xml but that would be hugely abused from day 1

well i have been playing eve for some time now and have always been troubled by skills that i wished i havent learned and spent the time learning so why not unlearn the skill and spend them elsewhere i was thinking of something like a once a year refocusing button very similar to the neural remap already available in the game i dont see anybody disenfranchised by this move older players get to refocus newer ones get to spend the skill points accordingly so what do you think eveo
ok to clear things uphow does it work this refocus button will allow players to unlearn a portion of their skills to reapply to different skills this unlearning will risk you loosing the skill books you spent isk on you will have to re inject the skills and relearn it through applying your skills this will be available only when you reach your first year of subscription very similar to the neural remap but only iven once you will not be losing or gaining any skills during this process the skill points you trained will be the only one available for reapplication where is the balance as this is just a refocusing older players with very high skill points or newer players with very low skill points will have the same refocus button both older and newer players will have the chance to refocus their skills nothing will be gained or lost during the processwhy the need to refocus well i believe that players that have payed for subscription for a considerable amount of time should have more flexibility in the skill points they earned a newer player enticed by mining because he read the haladas guide to mining and how beautiful colorful and you will be swimming in isk when you mine and realize in the end its not what it seems should be able to use the time they spent training in game into something that they want to do they paid for the time to train the skills and have realized this is not for me should be able to get what they paid for and refocus the skills its funny to see exhumers v on a pvp pilot it is important for people to realize that we as newer players with very limited knowledge to the game train different stuff and have no idea about what to focus on questions like what skills do i train what should i be stuck with what makes isk since the learning cliff is so high we were making mistakes about skills at first when i started the game and did the tutorial it forced me to be multifocus which i hated in the long run cmon i need to haul mine and shoot stuff for these agents and i didnt know that was not the end all and be all of the game this toon i am posting on right now is my 4th and i have sent 3 toons to the recycling bin because i was new and had no idea what i was doingnow to address the issues abuse i dont really see people abusing this feature of the game if they refocus into something they are stuck with the refocus for their entire eve experience which is also a decisionconsequence factor of doing so 1 day old player or really new players will not get a refocus button they will get it after their first year of subscription and they will never get this feature ever again i feel that this cushion is fair since the confusion and the learning curve of the newer player will force him to make mistakes once he learns the rope and understands the game better then a refocus will help him towards that path consequences its funny how people are so elitist or leetists when it comes to eve they are never new player friendly this game is awesome no need for your monkey business this game is for adults we pirate we kill we grief and grow up kid since when was eve like that since when when i was new i was welcomed by helpful players willing to show me the ropes of the game and they made my eve experience better no thanks to the leetists that feel like they own eve first of all a single refocus will not erase all the bad decisions you made including the investments and materials you acquired sorry you are stuck with that all the players will still have the same consequences they have to face inside the game skill wise as well as this is a one time deal within your entire eve career btw if you really want a game that revolves on consequence then lets not have hisec and allow all griefing in tutorial zones and lets make choosing a faction have a consequence as well minmatar cant go into amarr or amarr cant go into minmatar hows that for consequence not yet hardcore enough for you i will be shooting down arguments against this proposal 
i think it has to do with choices having consequencesi really dont care one way or the other on this so no support but no resistance either from me
this has been brought up in other forum posts but in essence is all about a skill remapi personally wouldnt mind removing a useless skill or two but there is also potential for abuse or everyone creating foty toons  which would end up making eve a boring placeeg max out remap of perc  will once a year unlearn those skills and dump them into areas that require say charisma  inteli would like to see something like this but i neither agree or disagree as long as its properly implementedhrolt ceo live free die proud

okay keeping in mind that the designs being posted here are very rough as they are made with paint you can find the new design for the bedouinclass envoy herei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this is turning into a cult topic
eve already does this that is why when you have an angular velocity you get less damage than if you are sitting still so as i said with angular and radial velocitys already calculated the calculation for this while it would add a bit of server side lag should not be too difficult
or you just utilize tactics that have been in the game for over two years and move your damage dealers around the battlefield
endorsing this frill
a vagas bond is its frill ccp youve killed the looks of this ship  literally dealt them a mortal blowthe moa still roams the spacelanes untouched and yet the vaga has had her wings clipped why oh why ccp what on earth did we do to deserve this
i hate this idea always have always will1 choices have consiquenses in eve2 most probably you used thos skills at one time in your eve life so you already benefitted from them3 if it was an accident that you chose a skill then live with it and why a full remap then4 if it was an accident that you chose many skills that you no longer want be more careful5 character bazaar will kill the game for anyone who does not want to buy a character or have the  to convert to plex  iskplease just live with the game choices you made and stop suggesting this ideajint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
this also please learn what the word search means you would have seen that this horrible stupid idea has been suggested many times over and over again by ignorant fools such as yourself it is always shot down because it would totally defeat the purpose of eves skill system that actions have longterm consequences is one of the core features of eve  deal with it
no
for new race ships maybe new combine factions ships
from memoryceve had an anniversary race type thing where gms made a race course with large t2 bubbles and various obstacles think belts players would then enter the track for duels or as teams  once scrambled by bubbles there were no rules other than whatever limits were announced regarding mods and suchwas a grainy video once upon a time but ill be damned if i can find it that was made from what they had on hand if done with dev support the sky is the limit when it comes to how elaborate it can be made also allows it to be made into a semi permanent featurestraight up duelling or arena type fighting akin to the ccp giftshop for nullbears tournament is lame beyond comprehension and would be abusedbrokenexploited after a week when ccps adhd kicks in again besides we can flip cans or make arranged fights whenever and where ever we want ex rvb is basically just a massive ongoing prearranged fightclub complete with rules and regulationsnot so much gladiatorial arenas as feeding pitsareas for the slaver hounds

i like the recent change to the overview but think this small tweek may improve the curent system my suggestion is append the suffix gate after the system name in the name column on the overview for examplecurrentnameodinkamelaproposednameodin gatekamela gate i believe this would help new players orient themselves
i think as long as ccp are very upfront about the changes and discuss them with the players and give them a good bit of time to play with them on sisi and provide feedback that ccp actually listens to it shouldnt be a problem
one of the devs i forgot which one said that it was something they are working on for the winter expansion he said it in one of the studio prematch sessions on sunday the studio segments between atx fights
i think its a great idea though like the other posters i think itd be very hard to implement it in such a way that it wouldnt break the game instantly thats not to say its impossible just very difficult im just very dissatisfied with the way shares are currently handledi think instead of having seperate shares to sell on the market a corporation should be able to put some of their existing shares on the stock market or they dont have to put any or they can put all of their shares on the market that way theyre being given a choice in the matter share price could be determined by total estimated value of corp assets plus total amount in all corporate wallets divided by the number of shares this would give corporations a reason to create more shares since if there were too few their share prices would be too highjust my thoughts on the whole thing
i agree with this however i would think something more to takeing say 45 hrs to recover a dead pos and it only works on towers that have been offline for say a week at lest this module should also beable to unankor anything else aroudn the pos also no point steling the ct and leaveing the corp hanger is theirthe reason im saying such a short timeframe is if a tower hasnt been looked after for longer than a week it is more than likly abandond and no if you forget to refule it tough crap its a tower you should be looking after it with more care like everything else in eve if you forget about it and leave it in space dont expect it to still be their pray that it is an alterntive to a module would be something that fits in mid slots and requiers a new skill with hack v as a prereq it uses a scriped or somesuch as ammo and when the hack is done the ammo is burnd out and lost make the ammo cost a lot solves the iskprofit ratiothis would mean the player them self has to sit at the tower waiting to try take a tower specily if it takes a long time any interaction with the tower from a crop meber would reset the hacking atempt and eat the hackers ammo make the starting the hack triger the pos to send out a warning mail of somekind so if their is a player online and they know where the pos is they can do something about itthats my viewlost in space looking for a home dreaming of building outposts acrross eve

we have enough consequences in game if you want more go play real life that has more
why so any justifications
1 yes i do understand that and we still have consequences in game this will not erase all of it it will however lessen the consequences we take now the question is how muchmany consequences do we need in this game have we gone to far yes no that is the real issue just arguing that this game has consequences i can argue pushing your argument to its logical limit then why dont we have more consequences in game2 this is true but we also have to understand that thingfocus changes benefiting from the skills has nothing to do with changing your focus and benefiting from them even more why not3 its highly unlikely that it is an accident4 accident nah not gonna happen people chose to be a miner or an industrialist or a mission runner out of sheer ignorance and people forum posting about quadrillion iskhour newer players are easily swayed by this5 ok this is the only valid effect that i see would affect the game less players will buy from the bazaar since instead of selling their industry toon and buying a pvp toon or pve toon they can just skill remap ok to address this issue i believe that giving newer playersnewly created accounts something to look forward for after a year of subscription like a skill remap will make the newer players like to stay in the game more i believe that the money gained by ccp for newer players having subscribing for a whole year and also returning players that have their skills in disarray will compensate for the income lost in the bazaar
came in expecting a topic about unlearning a skill where you put a skill in the unlearn queu and it deletes your sp so you dont have as expensive a clone
see now this would actually be interesting not the op though that guy just wants respecs and thats just silly
nope
many
been a while since we had one of thesei could get behind a one time per account gift allowing a player to unlearn a certain number of skillpoints lets say at 18 months after youve had plenty of time to figure the game out and know what you do and dont enjoy doing you get the opportunity to reclaim from 13 million sps and undo those noob mistakes like training industrial skills you used a few times and then ignored it would be a peraccount thing so characters couldnt be sold with iteve is just fine without it i dont see any need for it but at the same time id love to be able to scrap a few skills and repurpose them toward something i would actually find usefulinstead of having skills trained that ill never use because i didnt really understand what they did at the time
apparently not biomassing characters just because you werent happy with your previouslychosen skills this isnt some other mmo where youre at level 20 with a crappy skillset and needing to reroll as soon as you realize you took the wrong path just start training what you want the few million sp you wasted isnt that big a deal you probably wasted quite a few support skills that apply to anything when you trashed those characters
good sir biomassing a toon and just start training what you want is very much the same this whole point of this feature is to not waste the time you have invested in training the skills you want so you can play i believe eve is already painful enough that you have to wait for a few months before you get to pvppve or build something properly which i totally love about the game but making a mistake realizing that mistake and spending all the time all over again to be able to pve is a bit painful for newer even midlevel sp people
i dont think it is silly first of what is silly is what the other guy is proposing for me its too one sided nothing for the player all for ccp if you have the time and the money to pay for monthly subscription and just throw away all that so just you can have a cheaper clone then i feel really sad for you sir a better solution is to just lower the price overall but then again thats another topic and a different issue
unless you completely forego and amount of combat skillsunlikely for a new player as ship combat is the first thing youre shownthen biomassing your first toon is throwing out combat skills you almost certainly acquired support and fitting skills that will apply to any ship you could fly biomassing a toon because you picked the skills is just repeating training youve already done if the op has biomassed four toons that is probably months of training time thrown out just keep the skills you have train new ones and carry on
i totally agree is months of training time thrown own this is because as a newer player i had no direction everything was on the table the tutorials sucked and forced me to do everything i thought that was how the game was supposed to be played i learned industrial and combat skills and tried to make it work but when as you advance and learn more about the game you realized that you would have been better of with a focused skill training i am not saying that the previous skills you trained are totally useless they are just something that you wanna get rid of or something that you realize your not interested in ok i admit i may have done a mistake biomassing the toons but it was horrible that the skills were in total disarray made me feel bad that i couldnt fly a kestrel properly but i can fit an osprey with miners why so because industrial tutorial asked me to mine so and so then security tutorial suddenly asked me to kill something but i couldnt fit anything in my kestrel i real world example of how new players get frustrated
what would be the point from a designers standpoint ccp already has quite enough on their plate what with keeping us players in check and happy iterating on inferno and working on the winter expansion the jove race is ccp for all intents and purposes  you cannot access their section of space without devhax as far as i know the talocan and sleepers are npc races they are there to provide background lore for ccp to build on not for players to play as unless youve forgotten the jove talocan and sleeper races wereare highly advanced compared to the techology in eve nowoh did i mention that the sleepers are all in hibernation the talocan are all dead so far as we know and the jove mayormaynot be totally extinct as well no well i just did
ask for more to get less
well if the at is lame than the league would be lame also i dont find it lame the league d be smth a bit more complicated then can flipping duels there would lots of things goin around it
i think it is an outstanding idea this would allow for more roleplaying and a way for players who enjoy pvp to do it without being in a corp or a pirate themselves
no it is not how it is today that is why ccp is changing it properly fit t2 defences only modules  rigs on a hulk will still lose to a ganker squad who are vaguely competent because the gankers have had 5 years of damage upgradesi think ccp needs to remember that this is a game it is a cornerstone of most pvp games that instant kills and alwayswins builds should never be possible because they dumb down the game to all attackers using the instant kill tactic and everyone else who hasnt rerolled to that yet the current alpha levels are simply too high making combat frequently too short and hence boring the quintisential fight in eve is about two different ships using all of the tactical tools in the game to fight each other in essence like a fencing duel with reposte parry counterthrust etc currently we have uncloak or warp in instant lock and instant melt tactics mainly due to overheating being radically too effective that is as boring in nullsec to someone on an sbu as it is to highsec miners  pvp in a game needs to be fun dynamic and upredictable or the game suffers currently a cloaked hotdrop ship in nullsec has total first strike advantage with no possiblity of being found just as much as a cloaked scout in a belt marking a jump in point for a gank squad on a miner you guys are so quick to blame miners for being upset about bad game design that you seem to forget that this is a game and that if the balance is off the game will suffer for it  as any other pvp game would a person you have no chance to locate hence no chance to pvp against is boring advanced cloaking in nullsec a person you have no chance of surviving their alpha is boring highsec ganking a fight that is so fast there is no possibility of tactical manouvering is boring instant lock web alphas dominating nullsec 1 v 1 pvp stop whining about miners learning to fit when you cant achieve what you claim and blaming miners for wanting to see the game improve step back and look at the big picture currently there are a range of things in eve that are simply off in terms of balance the best fights are nearly only when a titan gets pointed and it goes fleet vs fleet and there is time for both sides to actually play  either making tactical mistakes or not most pvp is currently as boringly vanialla as wow combat  sneak attack sap backstab win without the other guy having a chance to do anything eve is better than that and the developers who have been increasing dps over and over and over to appease the whiny pvp crowd have a lot to answer for because they have dumbed down the game the recent ship chances announced show that the developers have realizied some of thier number have gone too far and they are looking to restore the balance to make engaging unpredictable and dynamic pvp again a feature of eve currently its not  you see the ship type on dscan and you know how the fight will play out before or if there ever is a pvp encounter that is as boring as fighting rogues in wow with a shaman  you know who wins before anyone clicks their macro eve is better than that and i exepct the community to be better than that too  stop attacking people for making comments in an endeavour to improve the game if you disagree with suggestions say why you disagree rather than attacking the person if you dont like the suggestions then offer up better ones and many above have including eg security system consequence changes but bottom line stop using the precise same tactics i would expect to see on the wow development forums  you make yourselves look like whiny children rather than adults playing the most complicated mmorpg ever made
and they will keep on losing their ship to a ganker squad who are vaguely competent because no ship is ever going to be safe ever all itll take is bigger numberswhat you arent seeing is that there are a ton of things which can be done today to make hulks etc hard to kill as it is various fit options exist you can implement constant repping you can keep constantly moving around so you constantly go out of blaster range etc etc etc but no way too many people arent adapting to the reality that is todays hisec and not totalsec which means that ccp have to make changes to force them to fit their ships properly by design so they can fit their precious cargo expanders cargohold optimizations and mlu2s to get more yieldhorseshiti guess you dont really understand the fight dynamics in todays eve the only reason why alpha is such a big deal in normal fights these days is because logistics are pretty powerful and you basically have to either alpha through someones buffer or you have to field so much damage that no matter how much repping power they have you field more incoming damage
xorv  i dont have time to go play every game out there but sounds like you have a lot of experience around sandbox vs nonsandbox games  please elaborate on whether its possible for a pure sandbox game to successfully exist  are there any real life examples of pure sandbox games that are as successful as eve a niche highly but not purely sandbox game or even other mainstream mmosimo sandboxes real or virtual have a big problem to deal with  they always get taken over by a few bullies then everyone else goes home eve needs to cater to a wider spectrum of players in order to survive and to do so they hybridize the sandbox  id really like to hear more about how this supposedly does so much harm to the game  how does a pure sandbox automatically equate to a better game experience except for the predators of course i dont log into a game just so i can deal with the same ss hats i have to fend off in real life nor do want to have to become an ss hat just to play the game effectively  eves got room for a full spectrum so why not make the most of it
ok men with trying to reclaim our lost territory all prior fights and planning have come down to this ready yourselvesok they are warping in primary will be tara maroo in a hurricanedo your best to look at the blob then spin your screen until you find a ship that will let you look at closer to the center of the blobshes in there somewhere just take this time to find and lock her ill message the enemy fc and let them know weall be ready to go in a couple minutes this battle will certainly last for 6 or more hours with this super non abrasive targeting system dddlel3no
in this case less is most definitely less
what the op wants is to see battles where everyone shoots everyone like in the trailers for that matter i do too that would be far coolerwhat the op will get is a mass exodus from fleet pvp as people get tired of not having useful information ffs were flying space ships in a star cluster thousands or millions of lightyears from earth in clones of our bodies with neural enhancements embedded directly into our brains yet we should have a hard time targeting the correct ship
making all stations kickout would be a good and obvious first step adding an undock timer which increases with every redock might also be a good idea basically add a minute to the timer after every redock within 1min of undocking so the more you redock the longer you have to wait before you can undock again what do you think
the op suggested a cooldown timer if you try to dock twice within a short amount of time like within 2 minutes or something not if you log on undock see theres a blob waiting outside the station and dock again
id shorten the timer on docking under fire if youre under attack and can stop their ability to deal damage with you for 15 seconds you should be able to dock up before they start shooting again this would require jams getting under their guns or some other method of stopping their dps people should still be able to undock and redock without taking any other actions just as they can now id rather not create an environment where people are punished for not having an alt to scout the outside of a station before they undock an alternative to this would be a new feature that would allow players to view the station via external cameracomplete with overviewso that they could check for bad guys before they undocked after all the station has windowswhy cant we look out them theres no reason to force singleaccount players to undock blind
heres an idea since there are agression timers etc and im assuming the op is referring to targets that have agressed and then changed their mind and docked using ehp or tank how about adding a specific docking timer to different ship hull sizestypesif i remember right the timer for de agressing is somewhere between 45 secs to 60 cant remember what it is exactly so how about this sorta thingdeaggro timersfrigate  45 secscruiser  60 secsbattlecruiser  75 secsstrategic cruiser  80 secsbattleship  125 secscarrier  200 secsdreadnought  250 secsi know i have missed some out and the timers might not be best but its the general idea im trying to get acrossmaybe that might not completely eliminate docking games altogether but it may solve alot of the issues related to itld
supported also they could add some color to the gate icons or colloume that could be modified in the overview settings that would make gates stand out if you choosesupercap nerf  change ewar immunity
supported though i think bubannis suggestion with adding colors to gateicons should be optional i already have enough trouble with my overview sorting icons by color rather than type i dont need a dozen more colors it can sort by
1 great suggestion easy fix
oh yes for sure optional as i suggested p so we can add or remove different colors if we likesupercap nerf  change ewar immunity
there wouldnt be a great market for contraband goods if moving them posed no risk at all prices would plummet

lowsecwell my aim d be primarely to animate some more low sec it can be done in pretty much simple way i know that there are already some static anomalies around but they are not so interesting what i had in mind was to make those more meaningful make some static anomalies harder that they need at least 10 guys to be completed but those anomaliesplexes should bring quite a bunch of isk also the respawn of that anomaly should be randomized and should be once per week the cooldown would run every sunday at 0000 o clock and during the next week the complex d spawn randomly make some different plexes appear in different timezones alwaysthe plexes wont bring immense amount of isks but by doing it once per week it should be enough to cover some expenses for small low sec or pirate corps the number d be around 1 bil guaranteed per week so 4 bills per monththe sum aint some wonder but d have some nice effects low sec corpspirates would gather around it would make strongholdshomes around it there would be fightswars over em highsecnull gangs would come to do them ppl that want fights would know some certain places where some corps are there d be ganking of fleets while they doing plexeshighsecmake the same tweaks for some current static anomalies for the highsec too make some easiest ones where only frigates could enter and min of ppl would be again 10 and make the iskhour better than lv 3 missions and a bit harder ones where frigs destroyers and cruisers would be only able to enter and u d need min of 10 ppl also make the iskhour a bit better than doing lv 4 solo in both of the plexes make some faction drops possiblewhat it d achieve we ll it d some content for that first 23 months gap where new players are very much restricted when they are solo they could do missions mine explore salvage for others etc but there d be some corps community that d be built around these plexes and ppl will have more fun doing it in a group more fun and a bit more of isk for the bothering to make 10 man groupsafter those first 3 months players can alredy start doin lv 4 missions solo or slowly preparing for incursions which d be the next step
i love this idea  will be interesting to hear others chime in and see whether it has any gaping flawsseems like this might be a good mechanism to allow wannabe good guys to partake in pvp without having to be the bad guy pirate thief or some other form of aggressor i know there are quite a few who love the wannabe greifer using the term loosely here as an attitude not referring to actual ula abuse mentality including ccp usually but i know many others who would like to participate in pvp but dont enjoy being forced into ruining another persons day without a good reason 
good idea but id change a bit rules who could shoot who where and on what time ddor u can put that dedva can shoot the pirates anytime and anywhere in highsec but change a bit the rules for lowsec
why bother with all that make it simpler  let any suicide ganker receive some form of gcc variant that lets anyone kill him for any amount of times while 1 this gcc thing is in effect and 2 his sec status is negative not sure about podding though could be overkill also make this timer exponentially rise by each suicide kill and reset the remaining time  each time a gank happens its counted as if all the ganks happened at that very momentwhat it will mean well any suicide ganker with neg status is legal game for anyone after his first suicide attack provided he is still neg status career criminal at the same time it wont do squat against someone who has positive status for someone who cares about that losing status is bad enough perhaps or make positive status guys get this aggro after n suicide attacks where n is the rounded down sec status valuethis mechanic will allow a single suicide attack for anyone but it will prevent multiple suicide ganks without retaliation still if the ganker feels he doesnt care about possible retaliation hes free to do it  nothing else changesmake it so that single suicide timer is 1 hour then exponentially all the way till 1 week if you live in hisec it makes it tougher for you to indiscriminately attack several times per hour but still quite doable if you live in lowsex not a big difference just lets folks that care about their sec status actually hit you before you dofor those that sit at jita or someplace else and wait for that perfect mark shouldnt be all that bad at all

yes ccp didnt make sence to make the change the frills were the signiture of the ship now it looks just plain stupid
my name is deuce tbe and i want some goddam vaga frills backalso i approve this thread
any word on this issue
its not arena like in wow i just named the mechanics that ccp uses for at the arena and at wldnt be turned this d coexist with at
interesting stuff it could work tbh would add some nice content for lot of players
simple solution remove agression timers if heshe decides to become a global criminal he should be a global criminal until he has increased hisher standing heshe should not be able to be destroyed by concord and run to the nearest station to wait out an agression timer if the killer can be podded by anyone then maybe they will think twice about it but if they have enough isk it wont make a difference but at least people getting griefed can pod them out of the system
as though the system we currently have isnt exploited daily
as a carrier pilot moving lots of things for various people it can become very troublesome trying to remember who has what items maybe someone forgot to put their mods in a selfnamed can some would say these are free donations for doing said jumps however i have a proposalrecode the corp hangar on the carriers to some other type of hangar and allow carrier pilots to rename them for example a 10km3 container that adds the value of all 7 slots to the total 10km3 of available space this would help carrier pilots keep themselves organized either for themselves or when moving modules for others

1 for bringing the frill backi was so dissapointed with the lack of frill i sold mine
has anyone approached one of the csms on this
agreed in principle once a year or perhaps even just once per character cost a plex or two fka formerly known as tabnext question would be if the old names should be released for new players or namechangers to use probably yes after a year or so but not immediately
throughout the alliance tournament basic game mechanics have been explained with animated pictograms these did a fantastic job of demistifying things like optimal ranges and falloff electronic warfare orbiting and so onfurther to discussions that took place in the new player roundtable at fanfest these animations would be perfect for use on the captains quarters screen as a library resource for playerswith the addition of relevant audio explanations you kill two birds with one stone  you greatly enhance the new player experience and simultaneously give captains quarters some unique contentpersonally id like to hear some character being added to the audio accompanying the animations why go with the anodyne aura voice when you could have a officious caldari bombardier explaining missile mechanics or an unhinged minmatar autocannon specialist describing the benefits and dangers of closerange combat theres a lot of opportunity to weave a bit of colour into the experience to flesh out the universe for rookies
theres some real opportunity here for sure some of the animations arewere quite good although i wouldnt let mbiii narrate
very cool suggestion only problem being that the screen streams from local disk so wed all have to redownload that contentgetting the cq to be able to stream from network youtube or other sources might be worth looking at
vertias probably wouldnt be so keen to trying to stream things from the majority of the current eve cluster due to bandwidth concerns there would probably need to be a new streaming server created which while not too bad to do would be a capital investment which could have been used for something else
theres no need to complicate it with streaming and bandwidth issues if that will cause a problem the initial videos could be downloaded as part of a bigger patch and subsequent ones could be an additional optional download for interested parties
i like the idea it might make me turn cq back on
a onceaweek plex wouldnt generate enough content to be worth the development effort 52 times a year
cargo expanders to miners are like magstabsheatsinksgyrostabs to gankersimagine a new eden were ccp forced you to not fit those to do what you prefer doingfood for thought
oh look its this thread againyou know of hulkageddon yet continue to mine in 7 and lower spaceyou know of hulkageddon yet fail to watch localyou know of hulkageddon yet fail to properly prepare your shipyou know of hulkageddon yet fail to you know what theres just to many things to listthe only ships with larger cargoholds than exhumers are haulers freighters and capitals the largest cargohold otherwise is the marauders with what 1km3 space then bss w 625 m3 spacedont want to lose your ship fit a tank yea youll lose your precious mlus but let me ask you would you rather lose a 300mil ship to get a slightly faster return rate or would you rather spend a whopping 20 minutes extra a day mining with a tankevery time i see a miner cry i think of this videotldrlearn to fit your ship for combat you know about grow up and shut up
so i guess everyone is happy with the current situation of noguns fitted cloaky plexing ships as being the exploit du jour
after thinking this through id like to propose a bit more dramatic solution give each player inventory tabs just like the corp hangar a lot of us would get good use out of the organization options afforded by this change currently i have to use containers for the same function but they also appear in my inventory list making item selection more tedious oops grabbed a container the item move failed and i have to figure out where in this list the container is change the corporate hangars on all ships orca carriers rorqual titans did i miss any to a peronsal hangar which would use those tabs allow the pilot to share the personal hangar with fleet members so that an intercorp operation can be properly supported from an orca or carrier
i really like this idea i also like driving with a blindfold
or you can just uhm i dont know broadcast the primaryhowever mxzf nailed it  this would make even the simplest actions take longer and be that much more frustrating i actually wouldnt mind a slightly less informative overview but your proposal really doesnt go into any specifics maybe flesh this one out in the fi forum before proposing it in the assembly hall
this proposal would only affect supercarriers and titanscurrently superstitans cannot dock in stations having done all this work on captains quarters and seeing as how supers are basically mobile stations why not implement a walking in ship feature for these ships alone some exceptions could be checked for example to only be available at a pos this could be further implemented to all ships down the road but give supers something to do rather than sit in space doing a whole lot of nothingon a side note it would ultimately eliminate most supers from being dropped as they would be too busy sitting on the couch watching tv
pluses of your ideanot game breaking at allinteresting to see though might make people want to have access to all the supers not bad eitherminusesneeds dev time which is limitedmight be problematic with the server how would it handle if you ship got bumped out of the pos bubble and attacked for examplei think they should finish the insides of stations first with some meaningful gameplay but im not apposed to such an idea
from what i have seen most supers are in a small personal pos with a personal password so the chances of being bumped out is very limitedbut yes it would require some innovating coding for sure maybe a check to see if the pos is launched for self and if the pos should ever come under attack it automatically kicks you out of ship walk mode or more interestingly it could simply be a first person flight control with some sort of screen showing you the outside of your ship as though you were seeing it normally
current incurions are difficult for new players how are in a frig and have little or no combat experiance i agree that the current parite factions are not a real threat so maby instead of incursions for piratees maby npcs could give players a notice that parites aee becoming a proplem and give a reward to players who go out and kill these piretes based on how many kills are acumalated by the player and how difffacult the enamy wassincerly mardon hashur
lets keep this thing going and keep in mind so far these are rough ideas and concepts i am currently still working on the monolithclass envoy and it has proved to be a bigger pain in the  than i once thought it would betell your csm that you want a dedicated shiphauler and make this thing a realityi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

initially i was against this but after reading all of the responses ive been convinced its a good idea1
this right here along with the suggestion that otherworld helped develop it in its bio are possibly the best ideas in this entire thread right nowalso win thread needs more love
i would like to have a chance of retrieving some of the implants from corpseslets make it a small chance but make it possible what you guys think 
impossible to justify that would mean bob would not be available anymore as eve is a single universe this would mean names would get more and more convoluted as they get taken  no character should occupy more than one name slot as it werethat said i cant really support name changes eve promotes a certain amount of forward thinking and if you decided on xxxxxxloviedoviexxxxxx you should have thought about it more before comitting to iti can see the reasoning behind allowing it for the its eve thing but when you can see the old names anyway i dont see the point of it after all doesnt make senserather than allow name changes and using character transfers as an answer why not simply mark characters who have switched accounts this way youll know that the account has changed  though it wouldnt make clear that the owner has changed aswell in this regard youre fighting an uphill battle anyway
honestly this is a somewhat acceptable idea with an extremely lazy opto iterate taking over a c1 wormhole and locking it down during actual gameplay would be an easy way to prepare matches your asteroid that you badly need ccp to make for you could indeed just be a can sitting in the middle of a safespot or hell just put a ship with a big fancy title in the middle put a nag in there make it look like a central tower xdyour idea isnt lacking in any regards except for the fact that youre too scared or lazy maybe both to do it yourself its not really that hard to advertise all youd have to do is drop cans in every 57 you could find and youd get some attention advertise on blink or something and youre goldenthe actual battles would have to be something more complex than 5v5 t1 frigs theres no style in that thats lame lame lame maybe if there was a different stipulation added for each match youd be able to find some interesting middle ground between lameness and overkillbuilding on your money circulation system just add a gambling corp donate to the corp with a message on who youre betting on and then you have income this would obviously have to be somewhat monitored or matches would get rigged like no otheryou have a good idea but you lack the mind and effort to actually see it put into action i wouldnt be surprised to see someone come in here and steal your idea only to make billions and billions of isk laziness is killing you here because you have 100 of what you need
it is a quite nice idea well imo the resources are well worth if they allow for eve to keep the new players
supported and i would like to suggest that the screen in the captains quarters could really use some customization options aswell if something like this were to see implementation like controls over which kind of things pop up on screen
plus one thisproposalgive lp for defensive plexing to incentivise people to defend their plexesfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
for highsec ones they defo should be more often as i stated they should be farmable and have a bit bigger iskhour than missions but only up to cruiser hullbut in low sec they should be imo once per week my aim is not to make them a persistent content where low sec corp will get bloody rich and they d even attract large 00 alliances if they are once per week but let say in every low sec region and npc 00 there is only 1 thats quite a lot of static anomalies and ppl would defend their virtual space so they are able to farm that one and attack others static anomaliesthese should be a content alone but more like an addition to what lowec is offering atm
awesome idea as above poster pointed out great rp potential and will let the decent lads head down to low sec and clean out all the scum that hang around on gates scratching their balls waiting for shuttles to pop could lead to some epic fights
very well said we need players in all space accomplishing all there is to do in eve to keep it rich and vibrant the forums are so clouded by lownull sec morons that just pvp all the time that sometimes one can forget theres actually a lot more to do in the game that just locking down and hitting f1 on any random people you come acrosstelling other players to quit over any circumstance just hurts the community as a whole
victory for botters yay for making mining ice or ore not worth the time of day again woo
recently ccp seems to have taken a liking to slapping a camo paint job on every single ship using the v3 update as an excuse thing is camo in space does not make sense its not necessary for one and it makes your ship look well ridiculously bad in most cases the new angel update ferments this adding to that the v3 updates have been paired with a ridiculous darkening of colors  amarr ships first and foremost eve is a dark game overall making all the ships appear nearly completely black doesnt help  conversely originally very dark ships were brightened up and given a camo job like the navy megathron and the machariel  what is the reasoning behind thisgive us back the proper color schemes give us back our golden fleet our black navy mega our silver cruor
o that black navy mega man that was a cool looking ship now meh
i dont think that is the problem with you solution if the timer doesnt start until you kill a faction war target in the plex why would a defender ever go in a plex the enemy openedthe only enemies coming in the plex to potentially get killed and therefore allow the timer to run would be the plexers own altsthere are other solutions to the problem you describe though 1 require kill all npcs2 give pvpers notifications when plexes are entered so plexes cant be ninjaed3 after someone is chased out have the timer they ran start counting down automaticallymake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
hey long time no see jacki still very much support this idea get it done ccp
good to see youre still showing support spread the idea as much as you cani am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this sounds like a reasonable change meaning that a character will have to have max skills and implants in order to get full refine when they can achieve that easily on outposts and npc stations poses do need some love and this is a simple change to allow players to make better use of these facilitiessupported
thanksi do look forward to the upcoming pos changes  but this simple fix helps out the industrial types to be more selfsufficient in doing alliance  corp productionhrolt ceo live free die proud
i agree
op  you are a dumbass you are asking for either a sp remap or an attribute remap with no penalties  go  yourself for the vast majority players dont want this  go screw yourself this would be game breaking no sp for remaps
cant support this proposal
bad enough that offensive plexing can be done in frigs and pay a bazillion lp  meaningful system upgrades is the ultimate incentive for defensive work imagine if the docking restriction was part of the upgrade path for instance  leave enemy to plex for too long and he gets a beachhead cheaper or even free repair in upgraded systems defensive plexes adding half their value to system upgrade pool if enemy has plexed it down in the last 68 hours replace wzc concept with a localized versionbenefits constellation based makes a lot more sense and makes stopping enemy plexers a lot more urgent etcmany ways to skin a minmatar cat
hi veshta nice to see you abouti have no problem with people risking their ships and making isk even by turning a button turning buttons is something i despise to begin with the current system seems to reward one while penalising the other so while i may get lp from offinsive plexing and taking systems the opponent doesnt get lp for defending their systems at any stage so while i have incentive to get out there and risk my ships the oppenent doesnti like the occupancy aspect regarding stations and the further tweeks you mentioned are good ideas as welli do think however that both sides should be rewarded for turning buttons as an incentive to keep them both active and concerned with occupancyfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
another idea is to have systems work similar to incursionswe currently have a situation where tehre are 13 systems vulnerable and no one is turning them they should automatically plex themselves down after going vulnerable to a degree or percentage below vulnerable if no one is taking them in timefight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
if you want to defend your system you should do it by killing the war targets who are running offensive plexes not by waiting for the war targets to leave and then running a defensive plex there are many many good reasons not to have lp for defensive plexing as it is right now it is unclear that the amarr will ever be able to make a comeback under the current mechanics if ccp changes the rules to help minmatar defensive plex their system then our slim hopes get even slimmer the compeling reason to not award lp for defensive plexing is that it gives some reason to continue to fight for the side that is currently down i would rather they did away with defensive plexing altogether force the winning side to actually fight the offensive plexer in order to defend their system defending your system by running a plex when wartargets arent even present is lame and deserves no rewardthe other option would be to make a player have to pay lp in order to have his defensive plex lower the amount the system is contested in sum the system is liekly too lopsided for the winning side we dont need to make it more lopsided but here are some other reasons its good not to give lp for dplexing1 encourages the defending side to stop plexers in pvp before they capture a plex so that they do not need to orbit a button for no pay defensive plexing is best understood as punishment for not defendig your system properly in pvp 2 gives some reason to join the side with fewer systems since although your lp is worth very little you have more opportunities to make lp through plexing it also limits the winning sides ability to make lp through plexing yes they can still make lp from missions but that does not help their occupancy efforts and if enough people switch over to missioning instead of plexing then the side with fewer systems is given some respite3 it can lead to a war where many systems become vulnerable or close to vulnerable and then flipped in a dramatic fashion sort of the topic of this thread as i mention this can lead to all of the militia getting the isk needed to sustain constant pvp 4 its sort of neat to use individual greed as a balance 5 if you want to farm systems where your enemy cant even dock then eve offers that already sov null sec i think sov null sec could greatly benefit from a system like this where you are rewarded for taking over new space instead of just sitting in your space and farming it imo that is a big reason why null sec has been so boring for the last few years by forcing people to take over new space in order to gain isk you encourage conflict make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
yep all your proposals would help the minmatar no surprise there make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
while the spirit of your thinking is sound there are two major practical problems the second being far more important than the first with trying to force people to defend their systems through infwcomplex pvp timezone warfare if one of the militias winds up with poor timezone coverage which can happen very easily and quickly if a major participant leaves then defensive plexing is their only shortterm means of holding space until they can restore their timezone coverage catching people who dont want to slug it out inside the plex and making them pay this is nearly impossible with a minor unless someone is not paying attention to their directional scanner as covert cloaked vessels cannot enter minor complexes even for the larger plexes which do allow covert cloaked ships trying to ambush someone turning a plex is more difficult than it looks due to the decloak hazard posed by the acceleration gatelanding beacon obviously you shouldnt be able to turn a plex while cloaked but not being able to practically use a warpgate without dropping ones cloak in a vessel that is otherwise capable of warping while cloaked is silly no
i tend to agree with both of your points but do not think either is a good argument to give lp for defensive plexing the second issue you raise i think is only made worse by giving rewards for defensive plexing the second issue can be addressed by doing the following1 have the timer start counting down back to zero automatically if you are chased out of a plex by a wartarget2 give players a notification where and by whom and plex type when plexes are attacked these two changes will drastically reduce the effectiveness of ninja plexing and warping out every time an enemy comes make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
in principle offensive plexing should be rewarded more than defensive plexing because offensive plexing drives conflict defensive plexing is a reaction to offensive plexing plexes both offensive and defensive should be run most efficiently by the appropriately sized ship plex mechanics should reward those looking for kills not reward those looking to run any plexing mechanic ccp comes up with should follow the principles listed abovepotential solutions much higher lp rewards for offensive plexing timer slows down if appropriately sized ship is not running the button ex if frigate is on timer of l4 plex then plex timer should slow down by a factor of eight timer move toward baseline if no ship is close to button this enables players interested in pvp to run off those not interested in pvp and still be successful this has been discussed extensively elsewhere
the first point you raise actually probably is a better solution to dealing with nonfighting plexers than what i was talking about although i will have to raise that point in isolation as it is not directly tied to fw
title says it all  a notification when being quoted somewhere on the forums might be a useful thing to haveif its been suggested before or already implemented and i missed it sorry for that search didnt turn anything up
sadly this is still the casebeing able to buy implants for 16m and 16k lp versus the 80m and 80k lp normal missioners have to pay is in no way balanced you could sell at 80m still make a profit and make it completely impossible for nonfw missioners to make money
before i go any further let me make this perfectly clear this is not a wahh rework cyno graphic threadnow that i have gotten that out of the way i propose a gamebalancing change to cynosural fields require cynosural fields to be at least 2000 meters from any celestial much like cloaks if you want to cyno to a station then you have to actually watch local for possible ganks this would promote the use of cyno generators and jump chain networks with poss to regain riskfree jumping currently i can be drunk half asleep and not worry about losing my carrier as long as i cyno to a station if i had to light the cyno at least 2000 meters from the station chances are i wouldnt try it drunk andor half asleep given eves nature nothing should be risk free and currently jumping any sort of capital even jump freighters is 100 risk freebeing next to a ship would not disallow a cyno either cynos would still be able to be lit at a pos as long as it was at least 2000 meters from an anchored object superstitans would be unaffected as they cannot dock anyway and cynos would still be able to be lit next to pos shieldsalso i have flown capitals for over 3 years im not some scrublord new to capitals

dunno if i would rather have the titan bridge faster than the capitals but i do like the idea of spool up timer in general
dev or gm or csm reply would be appreciated thukkyoufrillme
i support the idea maybe some new and improved frills  since you changed the design of the other fins
supportedi am no corpse trader yet but i imagine that it makes the hit you were hired to do all that much more real when you can flop a dead body down on a corporate board table before you and your goons demand your isk
i used to make corpses part of my wardec contracts but if no one can see my trophies whats the point reverse the changedamn i seem to be writing that on almost every post
sort this out ccp
timers that reset to 0 if the plexer is driven away should go a long way toward more fights as a short intermediate fix after that special defense plexes where the defender needs to kill stuff and can get lp and the like for contested systems are imo the way to go

i like it capital ships should die more often and not only by big blobs small pirate gangs that dwelve around lolsec should ve more possibilities
percentlevel resistance bonus to amarr and caldari t1 ships helps them with1 buffer tank2 repping efficiency3 remote repping efficiencysince amarrcaldari are supposed to be the buffer tank races these resistance bonuses should only be applied to the baseline armorshield hp respectively having these bonuses also affect repping self and external ability puts them at an unfair advantage over the other two races  especially in fleet fightsanother way to balance out the respective tanking bonuses is to apply repping bonuses on minmatargallente t1 hulls to remote repping as well as self repping which would allow these hulls to be more viable in fleet settings
you are forgetting the most important onethe navy comet it has been slaughtered
ill be honest i just listed the ones from the top of my heada lot of v3 ships just look not good p
just my opinionamarr ships need to get their luster back they are too dull looking like someone took the gold and let it oxidizeminmatar ships need to be darkened they in general look washed out like someone left them in the sun too longi have no issue with camo especially if it matches with the units in dust showing a link of tradition rather than attempting to hide via a paint jobsome ships look better with it than othersthe serpentis and blood ships have what i consider perfect camo it looks nice and not so camo like though it uses a camo patternthe angel stuff is ok would have preferred that ccp went the route of the dram rather than the mach but i can live either waythe digi camo of the caldari is interesting at least it is differentthe gallente camo is ok i dont like it but at least its limited to the navy ships
thing is though that the camo obscures the ship shapes and detail it detracts from the overall design of a ship rather than add to it especially in a game where camouflage is not necessary or even warranted  you dont want to obscure the ships theres a fine line between realism and believability in a game such as eve one should not cross over to the first imho
i like camothats about it im waiting for the whole optional paintjobs to start allowing people different coloured ships which will hopefully mitigate this whole no camo in space issue
why would you need camouflage in space there is no realism or believably argument here camo paintjobs on spaceships are a logical culdesac  do they hide you from the overviewthe camo look of the new ships cant be argued from that perspective and instead has to be seen from an is this cool vantage point and this is subjective as all hell for every person who likes the look therell be one who doesnt so its a zerosum equation and hence this entire discussion is moot
yup still need an updatehrolt ceo live free die proud
even an increased mUFFFDrun on the refineries would be good enough and could be done by the devs in less than no time
logistical hell if trying to cyno to a hostile system especially if the inhabitants dont like cynoships idem ditto for a lot of other situations the majority of cap pilots will say no to this as such a system wont permit you to have an alt on standby ready to cyno you out when you are in a potentially dangerous situation with either a jf or a travelfitted carriermomtitan cynos already depend on skill location and fuel to add a timer as well would be rediculous imho this would mean slightly higher prices to transport your stuff through services like red frog or black frog or whatever its called p as they would have to spend time whaiting to be able to jump each time or less income for said services if they dont want to charge for those 5 extra minutes per job if you think of them as cab drivers they keep the meters running while youre grabbing a coffee too what about covert cynosural fields and bombers recons black ops timers i can imagine if theres no timer on covert cynos that people would abuse this and fly more covert stuff to jump in  gank  jump out before anyone can call in a carrier to rep up their stuff meaning even with perfect preparation having cyno alts on standby during industrial operations or whaiting to bring in support during gate camps you wouldnt be able to counteract bait  blob tactics while in some cases they might be a good thing i can imagine a lot of people being pissed about such an update though
interesting  ill try to commentwell the idea was that a titan bridged ships are the most dangerous thing that can enter through a recently opened cyno just because they could be anything if youre having a mid sized fleet fight and someone drops dreads and carriers onto you well thats not nice and youll probably lose the fight but its still nothing compared to a titan bridge that potentially spits out tons of heavy tackle and tons of perfect counterships to your fleet and all of that before you even have a chance to lock up the cyno pilot thats true but to be fair it adds a whole new layer of strategy to fights like that just because you cant simply bypass all defenses on gates etc and just say something like i just met you here have some supers maybe it wont work as simple as that anymore people might want to consider cynoing in on a safespot or cynoing onemultiple bridgehead dreadscarriers into the system when they start assaulting it which gameplay reasons aside just sounds more awesome they could still have their alt somewhere with the cyno already opened for example in a brickbs at a friendly pos or in an empty backend system somewhere they just need to understand that when their outcyno gets attacked its probably time to gtfo if they dont want to be stranded in a hostile system for 10 to 50 secondsabout covopswell wasnt hitandrun what blackops was all about  however if you wanted to protect your industrial operation you could put a cyno on grid and keep it open during the operation it if you feel like 20 seconds would be enough to obliterate the industrial fleeti think altogether this change would force people who want immediate cynosural fields to play with open cards if they want to hide their cyno and bait with it they have to take some repercussions in return
i think providing players the option to fly a tech 2 destroyer or battle cruiser that prevents a cyno to be lit on grid forcing the enemy to cyno off grid or destroy the specialty shipif forced to cyno off grid then the spool up effect of letting faster ships engage in the fight faster is already in play as now ships now have to get up to speed to warp into the fightthis would have no effect on cover cynos
fc ok cyno in the capscyno pilot ok just gimmie a minute man i hope that i dont get alphad by anything in that welpfc god this was a dumb change as its now impossible to get caps into a hostile environment at all unless you have absolute sub cap superiority which means your caps are relegated to only shooting structuresno this is terrible

sure make the game harsh then and youll see no progress of ee at all new people are coming and they leaing just becuase we hae no safe space its simple as that why cant you understand that people hae job school family they just want to make some isk and hae fun in the game lossing the ships only if they decide to go into lower secs to make more isk so they could fly better ships ect ect ect can fliping and stealing should ofc also be panalised in 09 and 10
wow jint you should quit your job and go into marketing with the ability to predict consumers behavior with such a high degree of certainty and precision you could make the entire process of market studies obsolete overnight fact is its not that simple unhappy customers like unhappy lovers start thinking about leaving it wont be one thing that makes you dump your girlfriend  its a lot of things and usually there has to be another girl in order for someone to end their current relationship but if you are unhappy and there is plenty to be unhappy about with eve that ccp has no intention of fixing eventually you will leave its just a matter of time and the final straw might be something quite trivial
this is a proposal designed to stop the waste of implants upon podkilling a capsuleer it is my understanding that implants are only destroyed upon oluntary remoal from a capsuleers head in order to presere the life of the capsuleerthat said when the life of the capsuleer is no longer a concern ie corpse is residing in a cargo bay or station container it is not actually necessary to destroy the implant the lifeless corpse is of no concernnow to the actual mechanicsthe mechanic for showing implants on podkills is already in place apply the chance loot drop mechanic to the implantssalaging the corpses could be done using reprocessing in station or using a salage module in spacethis could proide a alid reason to try to seek out pp against experienced pilots attempting to pod them for their ery precious implants alternatiely gies pirates reason to seek out offgrid boosters for their ery shiny mindlink implantsthis remoes a major isk sink and would add a new source of income for ppersthanks for reading this notsowellwritten but ery needed proposalthis has been mentioned before but it needs to be made to happenfly recklesscecil
boom boom bump
a good reasonable idea are you giggitty
this works for me good idea  good source of reenue  good incentie to pod people
mentioned seeral times 8
i alluded to that fact it had been mentioned before the isk sink could be turned into a manufacturing process rather than lp purchases or drops make pirate npcs drop blueprints instead of the implant itselfotherwise losing implants is just a waste of isk and pod killmails are worth nothing more than bragging rights dont get me wrong still enjoy those but why would ccp implement showing pod mails without planning the ability to use them
edit ive changed the title to reflect the excellent assistance of corina and abdiel they speak the truth1 even i dont notice this very often although i found it however it is there 247 in everyones face that cares to look for it2 concerning your ship as it floats in space or station imagine someone holding up a picture of the mona lisa and waving it around in front of your face and telling you thats 3d 3 one cant really detect this if one is moving one must be absolutely still4 what really makes me mad is that ccp brags about how great all their improvements to missiles and ships and rebalancing and everything else are but when it comes to the simple 3d graphic of my ship floating in space or station they give me nothing more than a static image wiggle it in front of my face and say 3d by design 5 as far as i know they are not going to fix it and i know for a fact that it used to be realisticnow its a joke a joke on anyone with half a brain and two good eyesdont insult our intelligence ccpthankssub

floppie its simple really floppie imagine looking at two trees one close the other far away but directly behind the first one if you move your head a tiny bit the image of the far away tree shifts in relation to the closer treeeve doesnt do that
weve finally found it the dumbest thread on the whole of the internet
how about this post some examples because i am lost
i dont think i like your attitude
dusenman i understand how you might want something a little more concrete to help visualize what im saying buti would have to make a video or show you in person really i think i gave an excellent example sometime when your ship is just sitting still
its a video gameget over it
no clue what you are referring to last check i was still getting different views of the objects in a scene when the camera was rotated and the perspectives of the objects present were shifting properly edit no wait i think i misunderstood basically this is a complaint about the static skybox right
i partly approve of the op but i agree with most of the following changes to the proposition as they are more realistic in terms of balance and effectively a fun new way of living in new eden i support the lp system and the reciprocal aspect of it if empire navy factions would be removed fw would be a bit more interesting as each party would have to bring more to the table in terms of home defense npc target mission podding isnt allowed in empire space anyway pirate militias would be a good idea obviously and perhaps lure more people to lowsec as is the wish of ccp i would suggest you would have to be part of a fw militia before being able to become part of dedva as i would imagine becoming part of dedva being an honor extended by concordded similar to becoming a spectre in mass effect your dedva agent status would then only be available in your factions conquered systems through fw and your factions highsec systems by limiting your agent status to your factions owned systems you will focus the fights a bit more in certain regions effectively creatingreplacingexpanding market hubs  popular fw systems which is good for new market opportunities gankers etc indeed lets whait till after the new bounty system gets deployed hopefully the bounty system will include some form of option to include or exclude pilots corporations or alliances from collecting the bounties
the npc target mission refers to the ops statment that a dedva agent you can go to an npc and recive a mission to kill a player
theres no such thing as hulkageddon anymore right  its just business as usual permanent hulkageddon from now on corrrectanyway lets just all give in already and admit  ccp wants everyone to become a greifer  its really the way they intend the game to be played rightthat being the case most of us should really just quit since we dont like playing that way 
that isnt people thats just riverini
rewards for pvp and making fw a viable place to be farming playing problem
i am guardedly optimistic that ccp will do the right thing and give pos gunners proper killmail credit
this and of course support for the op
hello allim sure weve all experienced the graphical memory hog that occurs when your ship takes significant structure damage  the plasma fire that comes from your ship this is decent eye candy but is by no means necessary to the game to displaytherefore i request that we have an option to turn the graphical effect off in the escape menu we can turn most other effects off but not this one and that needs to change
scordite is the most profitable highsec ore at the moment as far as i know so that might be pointless p still i get your pointalso while i agree with you op that the csm is perhaps too focused on the nulllowwh way of life in general you have picked a very odd time to complain about highsec ganks and other carebearesque issues especially with the mining frigates mining barges and exhumers getting a complete overhaul to counteract the ridiculously easy ganks also what are you talking about with no power items i thought ccp was going to stick to vanity onlynot necessarily more botting mackinawshulks in belts means more wardecs and ganks too especially with the new wardec system should be fun to watch and in nullsecwspace the ehp doesnt matter much in pvp situations unless if solo vs a frig or two but still and theres always large alliances like the goons we can count on to organise events like hulkageddon
the botting mackshulks will be in npc corps so no there wont be wardecs
capitals are currently the safest ship to fly around as long as you dont fly it in combat even safer than mining barges this is not easymode online this needs to be changed prontoedit this may even take some of the qq away from the miners as pirates would have real ships to kill instead of ganking afk miners they still will im sure but now theyll have the option to gank either afk miners or capitals
tlddr 1let me guess youve been farming officer mwds but theres not enough demand i like the idea as it will allow people in a corpalliance with less than over9000 ganknados to kill caps and supercaps who stupidly cyno into a very hostile system and i assume people who are into factional warfare to like this too as it will restrict the number of systems for an enemy capital to jump to safely
i have a better idea why dont you start lighting your cynos 2km away from the objects and leave the rest of us alone
actually he said 2000m from the objects not 2000m from docking range  so it doesnt matter much
til 2k off station  1500m from dock depending on where you land could be  0 could be 6500m off
lets get support for thistell the csm and ccp that you want thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
im sorry if this proposal disturbs your vision of capitals online
disagree1
1my vagabond looks really ugly now  i will not fly it again until it regains its attractiveness
the dead must be rememberedby having their name printed on their corpse for us to lug around as trophies
5another great feature broken youre killing me ccp
exactly right as if the pp crowd needs a bigger reason to go about poding eeryonei would support the idea behind this partially eliminating the isk sink but theres a reason the bounty system is in place that and your bragging rights cecil are all the reason someone needs to podkill me
1add npc corpses please
actually i think there are not enough isk sinks
if you remoe isk sinks you can lower pe isk rewards and people wouldnt mind
you mean the bounty system that is basically just a way to anonymously gie free isk to the person you want huntedto the op not a bad idea 1
ccp announced in a not quite recent quarterly economic report that there are not enough isk sinks incursions hae been downgraded but they said may lower bounties without warning if this continues i suspect they may increase other isk sinks as wellthe economy needs isk sinks implants are a decent one
on that same note there needs to be incentie for small gang pp in lowsec implant salaging most of us run around with expensie clones out here to make money this is a perfect way to get paid to pp and a much more profitable way to hunt pirates or encourage pirates to shoot each otherit would pay us more to shoot our fellow pirates than to shoot noobsit would be an excellent step to making lowsec a more iable place to lie
for what its worth nope i dont like this or think it fitsif you dont know the reason for our ability to awaken in a clone at the point of death is being our minds are paralysed and destroyed as a necessary processthe brain scan that stores the state of a pilots mind at the point of death is initialized by a powerful neurotoxin that freezes the matter in its current quantum state thereby destroying it to scan it this state is then sent to a fluid router at your cloning stationthe scan itself is destructie and that would destroy the nonorganic portion of the implanteen if the scan wouldnt its been hinted at in the back story that parts of our implants are organic and therefore would also be destroyed by the toxini dont want the risk of putting broken implants in my head thanksi ote noeditid ote yes if it was a case of doing this from npc pilots theyre not capsuleers and therefore not subject to the same destructie scanning at the point of death
well i am a big fan of sports i think it d be awesome to have this going in new eden will have lot more content to follow and read about while i am in my office and i think it pretty doable1 from me
tyberius  well i think youve got it yes you know how when you look at the screen the ship and the background slowly move together is that the static skybox you mean when they put in captains quarters that is when they broke it before that
dude what are you talking about
i too am vain enough that i want to know when my adoring fans are spreading my words
confirming what eve needs is more complex aggression mechanics
then theyd bring more people or a shiptype with more inherent dps given the time constraints available like they do when they go after t1 mining barges vs t2 mining barges or orcas etc etc etc just like they did during burn jita the ships going after freighters were setup for ganking whereas the ships going after the wartargets werent setup for gankingthis analogy of yours wouldve worked only if miners as a whole had actually been tanking their ships instead of just fitting for yield or going abloo bloo bloo its impossible
a new contract with the following featurescollateral on both sides the side that failscancels a contract gets nothing the side that doesnt gets it all if a contract times out the issuer gets it materials being providedmaterials being requestedpayment to the issuee on completion of the contract from the collateral doesnt need to match the entire valuethis way someone can issue a contract saying i want x of this thing here are the materials to make it must be completed by this date in relative security or they can leave the materials out but stump up the entire value in a way that the person that accepts it cant be left with something they personally dont want
i was not specifically posting about the author of the article in which i linked previously more so pointing out the comments by some of the more avid readers of his quaint blogcms is not needed devs and ccp should focus more on updating the game versus expanding it every few months with a ship or two and a visual update with maybe some clothes or a new door to a new box to do absolutely nothing in with your characterjudging by posts on the forums and from what players say in general not taking into consideration 2 year old trolls that just want to argue against your point just to show how immature they are ccp is doing a  poor job sure they allow a group of csm to be elected each year to go on a safari to iceland to pet ccp employees but come on what the hell is with aurum clothes captains quarters and so many other things they put out that just doesnt make sense when other things clearly need more attention than wasting time developing new content dont you think people would  bricks if they actually said the next expansion is going to be nothing but updates to major mechanics of the game and things that have needed work for a long time instead of inferno set space on fire with smoke trails from your missiles fawk me i didnt think i could play eve another day without smoke trails on my missiles while my poss are still  as can be sov is stupidity beyond description in some respects and the ui is still sketchy as hell same as the first day i played the game as a trial accountwould it be so bad to take a hard look at what currently exists fix it move on and then add new content all im saying really i think that would appease a lot of players and show new ones that they arent going to be subject to neglect by out of touch staffim am very sure that ccp their coders and other employees have a general direction for the gamei dare say that they have any sort of well thought out plans after seeing some of the bullshit pictures and videos of the staff working on the gamelike the horribly done white board of stuff that was scatterbrained with ideas of what is up in the air real pro guys i am also pretty sure they are passionate about their game since they work on it everyday with the rest of the staff and want things a certain way but you probably should look to your customers first instead of i dunno maybe turning eve into a clone of world of warcraftwho the hell wanted to walk around inside of a station and play barbie with their character anyway i sure as hell didnt ask for that crap
this what youre missing op is that riverini is doing that because hes fed up of having his butt kicked around in nullsec all the time and trying to save face the whole time no one really takes him or en24 seriously at all because its insanely biased and unfactual that post is more of a joke than anythingits not a failing on the part of ccp or the csm its a butthurt player ragequitting under the pretenses of branching out nothing new really and not ccps fault in the least
again pointing out the those who made comments on the article not the writer of the article i personally could give a  less if riv jumped off a bridge my view also comes from more than the comments of the readers including people that i used to play with who got annoyed and frustrated with eve and ccp but not limited to either of the aforementionedif riv choses to ragequit like a  from eve because of how crappy his blog is or how bad he gets kicked around in null i say lol i also share the same view that most of the articles are pretty biased and en24 is pretty much a propaganda machine for the alliances the writers are members of but as for it being unfactual sometimes it is  but not all the time sometimeseither way ive watched people leave the game personally over some of the crap ccp has put out there or neglected to fix for so long there are too many other games out there that just do a better job about the only thing eve has going for it is a large player base and it has been around for a while that isnt going to work forever you know they can still drive everyone off eventually
his problem with the pos revamp is completely unfounded unless he has some insider news that nobody else hasblob warfare isnt going anywhere there is absolutely nothing that can be done to change that and whining about it just makes one look like a soggy carebear fairness is irrelevantand the csm  while not having any real power to control the direction of the game  has the power to do something that is going to help keep eve alive for many years to come it gets people involved in the community
i can see some of what youre saying in this post but i do believe ccp has the best wishes for this game at heart they tried to update sovereignty and take it away from the pos bashingi think some of the changes they made were in dire need removing meta 0 loot from npcs a concept i championed when i served on the csm they do listen to the players and many of the needed changes were as a direct result of the csms involvementi think the next major change to help eve will be ring mining almost eradicating overnight the whole moon goo imbalance i know its still a ways off but it will be welcomed when it does arriveunfortunately blob warfare is here to stay try telling the us army not to bring a good chunk of their soldiers to a war  it isnt gonna happentldr eve is changing and the devs are working on it constantly just be patient and have hope
maybe the changes should have been done a long time ago  that is the pointive played for two years and the game has gone stagnant in some ways just cause you add wormhole space or smoke trails doesnt make the game all that much better to me honestly there are major things that need to be reworked updated etc now things are starting to get done yes but they need to keep their nose to the grind stoneclothes aurum smoke trails this that and the other really all unneeded crap they should fix what they got and make it all work stop keeping yourself busy with new stuff sure look at the future but if what you have in the game is crap and needs to be fixed stop stacking crap on top of crapgo champion that in your csm
and about blob warfare that is only natural anyone who bitches about that needs to play a smaller game anyway
the pos revamp needs to happen if you honestly dont see why poss are in such desperate need for a fix youve never used them before in any real capacitytheyre in such terrible shape that yes indeed it needs its own dedicated expansion to fix itsummary of eves last four expansions
l5s and missions in general need a revamp there never has been a thoughtful planning of missions and agents are randomly placed throughout new eden incursions and the agent quality changes caused an unmanaged lp and isk influxmission runners are not the problem but things have been changed that have caused adverse reactionsnote incursion payouts have been dropped down a bit so ccp has acted on the problem
because thats what actually happens rightalso silly people flying carriers in lvl 5sif there was gonna be any change id want to be lower the chances of getting missions against empire factions i like being able to go thru empire space just fine tyvm
i hope people read and give this reasonable idea a chance  it is about rewarding the effort taken by players to learn valuable skills becoming a pos gunner requires a commitment of time that could be spent on other isk or killmail generating skills it is a basic question of fairness in our violent sandbox single shard universe how can ccp justify not crediting all those who participate in a killprogramers program saying it might be hard to correct is pure nonsense some of the best game programmers in the world work for this game time for ccp to man up and do the right thing for players while also improving the game and staying consistent to rewarding those who participate in killspower to the players

this is pure new fresh content for ppl to play with and thats is in essence what this game need
bring back the names
heres another quote from the author of that listtranslation you pop a real rookie theyll nail your ass to the wall you pop a et et whines about it being in a rookie system  theyll tell the et to plant it not an issue unless you are indiscriminate with who you go after

yes this should definitely happen hae labs at poss and stations hae 1 extra slot for a surgery allowing poeple with a decent skillset biology nanotech skills and surgery remoe implant materials so that implants can then be player manufacturedthis is a logical step forward
if youre still interested convo me sometime and ill try to walk you through seeing it on your own screen maybe 5 minutes time hopefully less
its called the parallax effect if your drone camera moves 200meters and the object youre looking at is 30 km away like a ship or 3000 km away like a planet then you wont see a damn thing what you see on the screen in eve is absolutely correctif you want i can explain it in american units toogood call grath
it seems like what is being discussed isnt something that a lot of people notice as being wrong if it were a big issue i am sure most people in this thread would immediately understand what the op is talking aboutall in all it is possible that there are bigger issues that need to be addressed
thisisntmymain  ah thank you for that parallax i did a little checking and found this which describes and has a little video loop too what im talking about perhaps at the distance of 30km to the ship what you are saying is credible but i am n
i think what hes trying to say is that when the camera wobbles you dont see the orientation of objects in the distance changeif youre standing in front of a large cube thats got one of its corners closest to you you should see both sides of the cube yesmove your head to the left and youll see more of the left side and less of the right and vice versai believe hes saying that he doesnt like it because that doesnt happen in eveive only been around since 2003 in one form or another but i cant remember that ever happening unless hes referring to the nvidia 3d vision thing which eve used to support 
sko hmm i am uncertain but i dont believe it was the nvidia 3d vision although i have nvidia based graphics cards i never really used the 3d vision software part i think you needed special glasses or something is that righti really wish you could
are you referring to the depth of field effect where it changes what appears to be the focus of the imagejust trying to get an understanding of which 3d you are referring toedit also what your seeing may be the side effect of the game not having full v3 stuff yetperhaps there is a visual blend issue with the old shaders and effects and the new ones if this is the case we just have to wait for them to finish the updated stuff
i have still have no idea what the op is on about sounds like a detail issue ignore it like all details and carry on
corinia not referring to depth of field just when your ship is close to you and completely still the drone camera moves and their is no parallax effect with stationary objects in the background also not sure about the full v3 thing you mention i
sounds like you are angry why dont you try organising your side to take the 14 systems that are vulnerable or is it that your guys dont like defensive plexing so they are leaving a situation where you only need to offensively plex all of the timethe system is by no means benefiting us right nowadvice its just a game get over it and offer a solution rather than gripe like a child this suggestion is meant to benefit the factional war system and everyone in it not one sidefight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
some interesting suggestionsmy basic thought on this is to have lp for both offensive and defensiveid slightly reduce the amount of lp for offensive plexing or remove the ability to afk plex entirely then id give lp for defensive plexing but less lp for defensive than offensiveim not saying this is an end all solution either it needs some more thought and tweeking even after thatthe situation we have right now benefits and rewards the winner and punishes the loseron the issue of timezone warfare that has always been a part of eve anywhere you go im not sure how to resolve that or if you can also i think people should be forced to slug it out thats the name of the gamei also think that something needs to be done about people not taking vulnerable systems the 25 systems of ours that our opponent has vulnerable half of which have been so for over a month nowfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet

great idea i already see my self and friends doing those highsec anomalies would add lot of content indeed
i put up a similar idea but i think the model to implement it is simplerrather than double collateral which servees limited purpose it works more like a courier contract fulfill the contract get the isk its that simplei think single collateral makes a lot of sense lose the collateral if you either fail the contract or cancel it or it times out
within corps and outside of corps one of the challenges is organizing deals to get something produced in a way that there is some structure around itwhy not create a new contract type called industryyou offer x number of isk to have a contract that is fulfilled by having y amount of z product at a certain stationyou can optionally include some materials in the contractyou can optionally include a collateral valuetimeframes can be specified for acceptance and for the term of the contract itself up to 30 daysif you think about it the structure is very similar to a courier contract and the mechanics to implement it are very simple using this contract for someone mining on your behalf you would offer a contract of some value to produce some amount of mineral or ore dont include a collateral and dont include source itemsusing t his contract for outsourced manufacturing you require some value of collateral to cover the source items include some source items and ask someone with the relevant skills to produce whatever it is and provide it at the location you specify
finally  youre right  this time eve really is dying 
there is not enough space for people to progress and have fun esspecially no nullsec for young corporations and no lowsec for people who like to earn some isk
well i dont know why so much bithcing but with the last year with last 2 expansion ccp is doing great work new bcs new modules lot of ui improvement fw  wardec lots of graphic updatesccp doesnt have founds like many other companies so we need to have some patience they already said that they are working on mining poss and exploringlast 2 expansion showed that they got it and i have faith
the more people we get supporting this the betteri am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
everyone knows that corporation roles and how they work are flawed and have been for a very long time but i want to highlight the single biggest flaw which has a negative impact on game experience and social interaction which inturn hurts subscriptions and player retentionsimply putwith the current corporation roles you can only give a player entire access to factorieslabs or nothing there is no inbetweenproblemplayer a and player b are trusted friends who start a corp together and start producing things they put up a pos start researching their blueprints and doing invention player a is making stealth bombers and player b is making jump freighters both players have known each other for years they are both directors in the corp and have full access to everythingdue to current mechanics this corporation is basically blocked from ever trying to recruit and expand with new members this is why you see very very few successful industrial corporations ingame and most you do find are very smallthey cannot recruit a new player to their corporation and let the guy build ammo and frigates as he learns manufacturing ingame because to give him the role to build tristans will in turn give him access to cancel 7billion isk of inbuild jump freighter or multiple freighters stealth bombers etc its impossible under the current mechanics to have an industrialist corporation with 30 players all using shared pos to build ammo ships tech 2 tech 3 etcsolutionallow the roles rent factory and rent laboratory to enable a player to rent and install jobs in corporation facilities to see other jobs but only to be able to canceldeliver their own jobsthis would up corporation recruitment create more social bonds and greatly increase the chance the players whos primary drive is not pvp to remain playing the game because of those social bonds
2 year ceo reporting1 from meall the roles are horribly broken besides pos roles rent roles are the most broken and gets far worse when you combine pos and rent roles you can still recruit you just need to force everyone to manufacture in npc sta
totally agree with everything you say im sure all of this has been on the backlog list for years and is planned as a huge review of these mechanics but i really think its gone on too long and a quick fix like mentioned above in my op would atleast bandaid the problem until they get a chance to really review all of the roles
1and i too am a ceo of a very small corpmy solution has been just to allow players ive known for a long time to join all players are people who take care of their own blueprints and resources i keep assets locked away
ive been director of two corps and see no problem with this proposaledit you can use more than one pos to solve this problem one with its own password for the trusted guys where highend production is done and at least one other that will allow anyone in the corp through the shieldid really like to be able to configure a pos to allow blues access to labs
i think you hit the nail on the head there problem is if someone gets upset or malicious they can still trash a 7billion isk jump freighter in productionyeah i think this is the closest thing to a workaround people have used still doesnt stop the above griefing you still cant have a situation though where your researching me1 on a titan bpo and let your normal members use your lab services as again a player could simply undo that 170 days job with a single mouse click hell they could even do it by accident which makes corporations wanting to take on unknownnew players even less likelyi want to see a situation where an industrial based corp can build 3 titans whilst at the same time a new member can build his frigates and learn industry in the same corp
yep something like that happened before i wasnt burned too badly but others were i wasnUFFFDt a ceo in those days

lowsec needs work alot of work so lets bump this up again add ideas or debunk ideas that are here but lets get lowsec talks open again
interesting ideas very creativedividing new eden via lowsec i am not for it would really hurt new players and stifles trade people will not trade in vast amounts as they do now and if they do they will soon learn not to trading is a profession as much as mission running and pirating you want to entice people into lowsec not force themalternatively more lowsec shortcuts would be great i would like to see some designed trade hubs that have jitalike features no agents several neighboring regional jumps etc this would lure people into lowsec trade hubsi like the black market idea overall i always loved the idea of a hightech black market in eve but implementation was always the problem the lowsec only access would make sense i would have the old skill black market trading work like broker relations
make harder for life for cloaker fags in eve
we need far more isk sinks not supported as proposedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the deil your parents warned you about
so you can shoot your alt if you want an implant restored instead of destroyed when you get an otherstep in a pod get your alt to shoot it couple of millions for a new clone and eery implant recoered this way is probably more that the cost of a new clone
i hae to disagree i cant remoe my own implants without destroying them yet you want them to remain intact after my iolent deathif anything change t2 implant drops to blueprints and add t2 implant salage so that they are manufactured items made from the salaged implants of othersstill i like it the way it is no need for a change
this is a good idea
great idea i support this
ah i get what your talking abouthavent seen this in space usually moving or not zoomed in enough to notice ill play with my succubus some to see if i can spot it
quit ing seriously there are so many more issues that need to be addressed prior to thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
thanks corina

whats wrong with a buy order
who does a guy have to pod to get a csm lookingfeedback 
1ohh yes roles need to fixed
you guys trolling right 
trolling to ask for something thats been broken for so long to be fixed
ah you actually serioursforget about it  as far as i know ccp likes it they cant imagine eve without these bilions of isk losses due to theft and such if the corp settings and hangars are actually safe then that would make eve a very popular game for being fair and kinda easy ect ect i personally would love changes for it but after few years of hearing promises about so many things from this company i just gave up there is no point in telling them what should be done they just know better lol last changes to ui is a perfect example  they dont care that the damm thing worked perfectly they just changed it so now its working their way looking at the archive forums and it looks like people crying about the same things over and over again for long long years  some topics as old as 20042005
yeah i get your point i think this change listed for the reasons mentioned though outways the omgcarebear eve if corporations recruit people and get them involved in game mechanics like research production invention etc said player is more likely to keep playing for the game
1it looked way better in the past
did you really just come back to this topic 20 days after its last post and do nothing but spew disgusting bigotry i think you need a time out
nooooo it was supposed to die
girls you need cry harder
not supported
isk sinks are added intentionally to mmorpgs they are needed to help fight and slow the constant inflation that occursi think this is a bad idea removing isk sinks are bad reducing demand for implants is bad as this will mean there are more on the market price goes down those that earn them will get less isk for themplus side some people earn more isk but now alliance fcs have to scream at their fleets to focus on killing  rather than being the first to scoop the corpses for the chance of getting 100m isk of implants
i logged in just to confirm and this is definitely the case however minor the issue might be now i cant unsee itfor those who dont understand hold your finger up in front of your face see what objects it points to in your room now move your head a little without moving your finger or your room duh watch as your finger points to different objects in the background as you move your headnow log in to eve switch to ship spinning mode in a station and watch closely what is behind your ship let the camera float around on its own without rotating it manually you will notice that your ship is exactly in the same position against the background even when the camera movesafter a while of staring at it the hangar looks like someone took a screenshot and is wobbling it in front of your monitor not as if the camera is floating around in a 3d space
ah ok thank you for takeing the time to tell what the hell the op was talking about now who care there other thing that need fix then something that little
finallythank you abdiel thank you

nothing but if you have agreed with an industrycorp to provide you with a certain amount of stuff at a certain price youll most likely want unforgable documentation of the agreement and as far as i know text is way too easy to forge
exactly and it avoids taxesfor example someone building carriers wants a bunch of minerals from highsec but transporting them raw isnt a good idea so you arrange for them to be converted into 425mm railgun is either you have to find an indy corp willing to risk say 10 billion of their own isk on something that someone could then just say nah to or you risk someone running away with your materials these wouldnt be particularly public contracts just contracts between corps protecting both
buy orders and wtb contracts can be cancelled after a build is started this would leave the industrialist with a job they wouldnt have otherwise started wasting their time and resources having to get something to market that they wouldnt otherwise be dealing with i can see the value in an industrial contractlets say i want a drake theres an industrialist in the local mission hub that has a highme drake bpo the easiest way to think of this is a courier contract inside of an item exchange he offers a drake in exchange for an amount of items andor isk along with this he promises collateral and a delivery time as soon as you accept he receives the requested items and he pays the collateral into escrow once the drake is delivered he gets his cash backi see this mostly being used inside corps and alliances where justintime manufacturing makes the best use of local resources
