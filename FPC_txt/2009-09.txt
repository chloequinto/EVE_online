playing at 1680x1050 here which i assume is becoming the norm there is an enormous amount of information on screen that has to be left onscreen to play this game the current font is not easy on the eyes i have seen contract scams that specifically take advantage of the font in this game that is a pretty good indication that the font needs work please provide choice in the for of font selection and larger size selection rangethanks
5er10u5ly 516ned the screen shots ive seen from way back when you could add your own font to the client are fantastic clear and no confusion unfortunately ccp nerfed that a week before i found out how to do it
and options for it to be larger than 12 point for those of us running it at 5040 x 1024
dear god yes give us back the former glory of the jump drive i miss the whoosh

not supportedimo it was given console exclusivity because if it was available for the pcitd become a must have for every alliance interested in 00 by making it soley for the console ccp is making a way for events happening in eve to be out of reach physically of those who dont own a consoleedit and the last thing we want is every goon on a planet without orbital bombardment
i dont even own a console yet and hate console fpses but im not supporting this the motivation and impact of cheating is higher because of its eve ties once its on pc the game will be hacked to bits and because of the games realtime nature it cannot be hackproofed by doing everything important serverside as in eve
you gotta love the entitlement in this thread people talking about being offended by the decision or feeling like ccp gave them the short end of some kind of stick grow up you damned babies this game isnt for you its for the existing target audience which would be console fps gamers there have been plenty of reasons listed why this makes more sense on a console from the point of view of preventing hacks and keeping the playing field even if you choose to ignore these arguments thats your own problem these points are well proven in the history of fpssits one thing to say please release this on the pc and quite another to say that ccp is stupid or has offended you for not doing so ccp knows what they are doing and this decision makes sense from the angles they are looking at it from
yes please
this is supported i see benefits for everyone in eve from pirates to anti pirates
i think it is a great idea just a couple of small pointscrew could gain experience in addition to training training can only get you so far but to be a veteran shield tech crewman you need real combat experience obviously managing to keep once crew alive until they reach a veteran status is a bonus for a commander as well thus making it easiercheaper to higher already experienced crew in that way crew leadership is not only dependent on skill level but one once ability to effect moral of the crew moral could be effected by number of things as well wages battles won etc this could be a wonderful addition to rp as well i realize that such a mechanic may make this idea even more complicated to balance however i believe that if the devs would decide to put their time into such a rather complex concept they may as well approach it with an all inn attitude
i like the ideaneed lots of adjustement but the idea is good

two ideas to resolve this situation1add a scroll to setup a scaning distance for example1 2 5 10 max  distance to scan in au  scrolland from 1 to2 add an unique scan time to the each distance you choose for example if scaning distance scroll is 1au then no delay after scan if scaning distance scroll is 2au then 05 sec delay after scan if scaning distance scroll is 5au then 15 sec delay after scan if scaning distance scroll is 10au then 25 sec delay after scan if scaning distance scroll is 1421maxau then 35 sec delay after scansomething like this

i like the fact that insurance issues are heating up more but proposed changes so far are pretty horrid insurance in this game is a good thing people should be encouraged to insure ships because it does promote more pvp activities that said people should not be unjustly rewarded and loopholes in the insurance system should not be exploited insurance is the single biggest inflationary pressure on this game daily isk are being flooded into the market due to insurance without any player driven effort if i build a beam and i die i likely loose the beam but if i build a ship and it gets blown up i get rewarded main issuesinsurance scamming  i build and insure a ship 2 months and 29 days later the ship is still alive its better for me to blow the ship up and get a new one than it is to insure this one agian why if i build the battleship for 85 mil of mineral cost i insure it once for 30 mil meaning my total investment is 115 mil if the insurance runs its cycle i have 2 options 1 is i can insure again meaning i have to invest another 30 mil for a total of 145 mil invested the other option is i can have it destroyed if i destroy the ship lets say i receive 110 mil of plat insurance ive lost 5 mil if the ship thats been insured 2x gets blown up by comparison ive lost 35 mil leading me to blow up the ship i own buy a new one rather than insure the old one twice no place for secure space currently with the smallest of exceptions there is no distinct difference between a 5 system and a 10 system a 4 system and a 1 system why arent we taught that a 10 system has a much better safe zone than a 5clumsiness lets face it people make mistakes it happens it sucks thats the beauty of insurance but why should someone be rewarded equally for the same mistake over and over and over again especially in a short period of time screw up once and hey it happens but do it 10 times in a week and well maybe you might just be a risk so what can be done to fix these problemsno insurance no reward 40 base pay needs to go you shouldnt be rewarded if you dont insure its an unneccesary burden on the economy when isk flows in without a good drain and insurance needs to be a small drain insurance needs to be more dynamic no more 3 month insurance cycles change insurance cycles to 1 to 2 week intervals and reduce insurance plans base cost accordingly additionaly add in a tracker player statistics need to have some role on insurance to insure a ship of whatever type the insurer must consider what your current performance rate is with that ship so your weekly stats will show ive lost 3 battleships 4 cruisers and 1 frigate based on the previous 7 days performance battleship insurance cost will increase by 13times the base cost cruiser insurance will increase by 14 times the base cost frigate cost will increase by 11 times please note the tracker will only consider recent events meaning if you have a run of bad luck it wont hurt you forever but it will mean you need to be more cautious in the short term base insurance cost if were going to lower the insurance time to 12 week cycles the cost cannot drop at the same rate it would just become way way to cheap to insure so rates should drop to about 12 of their current cost this means players who have no expectations of losing their ships can make the choice do i pay immediately or do i wait for a more risky scenario secruity levels cost and payoutsa player who loses a ship in a high sec system should garner less penalty for repeated offenses with the exception of wars so if the scale of losing x amount of ships per 7 days were 10 extra cost per in 00 then in 10 maybe it would be 5 more cost again excluding war targets where the normal 10 would apply

finally remove insurance payouts for 3 task self destructs death by turret guns and death by concord removing those 3 payouts adds an element of risk to crime lowsec isnt hurt horrendously because honestly how often do people lose ships to gate guns but high sec gets a bigger hit it also removes the desire for people to self destruct ships in losing scenarios unless they want to prevent loot drops self destruct removal also prevents forms of insurance scamming all of these features together should provide an adequately friendly pvp insurance system protection for empire players and a revamp to a desperately poor and exploited system
thatsa lot of stuff on the face of it i like some of what you have in therehowever i have a problem with this bitspecifically the flawed assumption that the system where i insure my ship is necessarily the system i use it in i could just as easily fly four jumps over to a 10 system buy the ship i want because its the only place i can find one insure it there and then fly back to my 05 system while paying 10 insurance ratesim not ready to support this idea yet because its got so many moving parts and i want to see how they shake out as more people post but i like the overall thrust
thats exactly where the 2nd part of system security comes in losing a ship in a less secure system penalizes me more than in a higher sec system creating more balance to the scenario what that does is promote more travel between systems which in high sec is more opportunity for piracy and war decsremember its very hard to move unpackaged ships in high sec in bulk if youre talking 12 mil to insure a teir 2 bs in a 10 and its a 3 reduction per sec point then in a 01 its only going to cost about 15 mil 3 mil in savings isnt a huge deal to a lot of people but it does create a small incentive to move that ship to another station putting you more at risk
im with de on this one everything seems to be ok except that one bit just utterly does not make any bit of sense to meoh and im not supporting this unless concord voids insurance amongst other things that are obvious
ill remove it until further review and thought
she does specifically mention that in her second post after the first support post  i think someone got thumb happy selfdestructs gate guns and concord deaths no longer generate insurance payouts which i have wanted for a long timei mean at least a month which for me is like nearly forever i am going to give this a tentative thumb at this point and well see what shakes out of itedit thumb failure
while from a realistic pov if there is such thing as it does not make any sense at all insurance should be cheaper in hisec than in 00 from a gameplay pov the contrary probably should applyinsurance is there to promote pvp and pvp is arguably i know more risky the lower the security status well hisec  lowsec  00 coupled with dynamic price due to clumsiness it all should even out as youre supposed to lose more ships in lownull than in hisecanyway supporting it its time for a review of insurance and so far i like your propposed changes except the mentioned issuenijaedit for support damnit
yeah i know but im making it clear that is my pet peeve at this pointtentative support
this is a historic moment2nd part of post got cut off by a damn rainbow warrior from ff wouldnt you know but it does deal with concordsd deaths
removing payouts from selfdestructs is pointless it seems sensible but faces the same problem as bounties its impossible to accomplish its intended goal when there are no negative consequences for fraud i can easily selfdestruct without selfdestructing by setting autopilot for amamake and going afkthe argument that ships inject money directly into circulation is a bit of a flawed one too procuring the material to build ships takes time time which could be spent doing missions or killing npcs which also injects it into circulation but at a higher rate nevermind the countless ships in highsec which have not been destroyed and may never be especially freightersregardless insurance does have issues but you missed what they actually are the entire premise of the insurance system is flawed1 there is no way to effectively model risk without that it is impossible to determine appropriate premiums2 there are no negative consequences for fraud realworld insurance companies have ways of avoiding issuing policies to people who are just trying to file a claim they will either refuse to cover you or it will be illegal to deliberately force a claim in eve there is no way to detect that sort of thing nevermind punish for it3 bearable losses dont warrant insurance in the first place nobody insures things they can bear to lose except maybe extended warranties which are still subject to point 2 insurance is there for things that have low odds and are devastating to lose people buy policies as a shield from financial devastation not to gamble with the insurance company that they will be able to file a claim
its an interesting concern and i think it does address some real problems but on the whole i think itd wreck a mostlyfunctional system basically youd be transforming the system from added security for the person who loses the occasional ship to free money for people who lose ships regularly even more so than it is at present a week or two is not a long enough insurance contract for the scrubbish missioner but its plenty long enough for a 00 player who loses three ships in a fight furthermore while you solve the problem of people selfdestructing on day 89 i think youve created a far worse problem of selfdestructing on day 6 instead of buying 100 mil of coverage for 30 mil youd be buying it for 15 mil in 00 or 105 mil in 10 but the payout would be the same that makes flipping it over even more profitable and it means itll happen dramatically more often essentially what this proposal would do in the end is nerf insurance for people who are actually using it as insurance and buff it for people who are using it as free iskbar suicide gankers but theyre minor i cant support that
i like this proposal i do but to interfere with drake a bit herei dont think that concord should void insurancewhat about thistwo timeframes and one period of paying the pricetimeframe 1 7daystimeframe 2 30 dayspaying the price activates after timeframe 2ok so if a person for whatever reason trigger concord timeframe 1 and 2 7days if a ship is illegally fired upon tf 1 will engage if a ship is illegally fired upon again within tf 1 void insurance if a ship is shot at after tf 1 but whithin tf2 note that it can only fit 4x tf 1 within tf 2 reduce insurance payout to 50 if a ship is illegally fired upon after the 2nd tf 1 withing tf 2 reduce to 25tf2 tf1 100tf2 50tf3 25tf4 void2nd period 30days void insurancetf2 tf1 voidtf2 void2nd period void insurancetf2 tf1 voidtf2 50tf3 void2nd period voidwith this system you can void yourself all insurance payouts from concord related death for two months4th tf 1 withing tf 2 void insurance this is important if a ship is illegally fired upon 4 times within tf 2 void insurance globally for death by concord for a certain ammount of time say 1 month and then the process starts over againeffects only once a month can you have 100 payback on insurance if killed by concord or whatever reason if you continue to do this you will not receive any insurance payoutsif this is implemented in the idea i think ill actually support itwe all have lost at least one shiny ship relative to character age to concord dont void the insurance totally
i dont attack people personally here i just attack there ideas unless they are realllllly stupid but then its just a bit obvious at that pointyou had a rational and plausibly good idea im not going to deny that

howd you lose a covops in jita of all places smart bomb attacksheeshand 299 doesnt make sense
signed ive seen this before looking at my losses you think im sure i would have taken more damage than that and then you realise it is bugged
yeah smartbombs i was afk on the gate so its my own fault but still and yeah 299 doesnt make sense at all  the ship has 809 structure before skills never mind armorhp that was sort of the point
maybe his ship was allready damaged before the encounter
support
not just that the damage numbers are wrong but many instances your logs show you doing damage over a long period of time yet when the km shows up you arent on it shot a small tower with a very small group of people logs showed over 700000 damage dealt but didnt even show up as having participated on the kmthough come to think of it it makes perfect sense because ccp has stated many many many times that the logs show nothing how the server can just lose information in such a haphazard way yet still function is beyond comprehension
and that helps how less money higher prices more people in ships huhthink again
you should possibly visit some economics 101 class
enlighten me
no insurance payouts in 00 and losec space which insurance company is stupid enough to pay out on a claim like thatand no insurance payouts when you get killed by concordshiplosses dont mean enough right now
this is a nonissue ship prices are driven by demand if people thought ships were worth more to lose after insurance then their prices would be higherremoving insurance would simply result in a massive crash in t1 material prices until they settled around the same postinsurance values because ships are the main thing keeping t1 material prices where they are its a flawed system but it is not one that is causing any sort of problem outside of disproportionate representation on ships that are generally uninsured ie capital shipsremoving insurance payout in 00 is a terrible idea increasing the difficulty of replacing losses only results in more risk aversion and less action look at anything that is disproportionately expensive to replace for a nice example of this ie command ships and supercapitals
so basically you want this to be counter strike in space
you want it to be grinding in space i bet if you could insure you aeon you would have done it aswell 
i want this to be a game where people consider fighting because losses are tolerable not warping to safespots and cloaking because they arent

needs more votes
it needs more add you mean not votes1 socialising is not an argument it is a social paradigm which stands independant of mechanisms or even features if there were not a single communications channel in game people would still communicate and socialize2 macros would florish since as long as the current scanning mechanisms remain unchanged all they would have to do is adapt on a technical level something which most of the newer generations of macro software already do for example for wspace mining3 the tactical argument is invalid since it is solely based on individual perception and not on either mindset best practices or the need of human beings to seek shelter in herdstruth be told the proposed change would only drive the player groups with such mindsets and unfortunately they are the majority to overcompensate its why this proposal comes across almost as an old time structural mistake ccp has often made underestimating the insanity of its playersbellum just think for a moment imagine someone up north having to run ice mining operations because the isotope prices in empire are going silly picture 50 mackinaws in a belt now with these proposed changes they would throw anything into the belt from orcas to logistics to even titans since people are crazy about not wanting to take uncalculated risksyou are thinking that because of the changes you suggest you would be able to get in with a small group do a few ganks and force them to engage with similar smallish fast ships to defend their lossesin reality they would just pump as many people as they could into the belt the system and the constellation both to prevent the risk of getting ganked and to mop up afterwards should anything get throughbut wait this is not a theoretical example this is a common appearance this is actually already a standard doctrine in a lot of places the changes you propose would only drive them to go even crazierbut to add insult to injury in spite of all that blobbing and paranoia displayed they regularly get their behinds spanked losing dozens of ships in the process regardless of local as this imaginary realtime intel tool regardless of having titans and logistics in the belts regardless of having multiple blobs running aroundhow a few people running around with black ops and bombersbrainpower effort result4 a compromise is only a compromise if parties or ideas meet somewhere in between of respective viewpoints your proposal is not a compromise it is an attempt to pick up on a playstyle which got traumatised by blobbing and blobs being far richer then the ganker groups in the mean time plenty of people have picked up and adapted getting not only results in spite of what those rich blobs throw at them but having a ball doing so as wellanyhow im sorry but this i just cant support i agree that changes are required there is a structural need for eve having a degree of fog of war but not by introducing good oldfashioned kneejerk changes scanning as a mechanism has technical limitations as visible in the recent changes to the scanning interval the idea of even half the rich blobbing bears and macroers starting to hammer the scanner every two seconds affecting the cluster is rather unnerving considering ccp had to change that interval already thus forcing people to adapt in their own blobbish ways is neither promoting fun gameplay the way you want it nor is it promoting stable gameplay the way you want it pif the technicalities of scanning are changed perhaps this can get looked at again eve does need a different mechanisms in my humble opinion howeveruntil someone comes up with a concept which would not be counterproductive to fun by not taking disfunctional mindsets into account we are going to have to make do with local and scanning as it is
yes
its amazing that there until you disable them there are warning windows for every single little thing you do in eve yet there isnt one for an action the only thing that will potentially cost you a month of irrevocably lost training time maybe its a concious decision by ccp to get a sliver more cash by making people with podded alpha clones play for longer  either way its really terrible and lameyeah you might think im careful forgetting to update my clone would never happen to me  until it does the pace of getting new ships for big battles can be frantic you might fly several accounts and forget to update some so in reality getting podded in an alpha clone is more likely than you thinkps there isnt even a quick way to telling whether your clone is up to date  unlike in any other window in the game the information on the character screen appears slooowwwwlly one characterline at the time and the current clone information is at the very bottom coincidence

currently you only get security status gains for one rat every 15 minutesnow lets say youre at 10 youve decided that being a pirate had its charm but not you want to get back into highsec wars or possibly even veldspar mining in the comfort of high security spacethe best rat for sec status i know of gives 04 which compared to other rats i know of is absolutely enormoushowever if youre at 10 youd have to kill one hundred and twenty seven of those rats to get back over 20 and have access to highsecurity spacefair enough you might say he chose that route when he podded and attacked all those innocent carebears in lowsec while thats a legitimate opinion surely you agree that if he has to kill 127 rats the least you could do is grant him the possibility of shooting them all in a rowif he has to wait 15 minutes be each rat he takes over 31 hours to have access to highsecthats over the topi suggest that ccp find a way to solve this some examples are make rats with bigger sec status boosts as well as a helpful page on the evelopedia where players can find the places to rat for sec status in high sec in low sec and in null sec get rid of the timer make the timer shorter make high security status work correctly so that someone with 27 for example can actually go to highsec so that having a low sec status is less harshif i need to make myself clear on the last suggestion heres the explanationcurrently a person with for example be 2 and 25 should be able to go anywhere except 10however if they have to travel through a 10 system to get to a 09 system they get an agression flag for passing through 10 and then get shot by the navy in 09 this is ridiculous and makes the whole security status  system security rules useless because as soon as youre under 2 youre unable to really travel through highsec
supporting this as everyone in their rightful mind shouldnb im not a pirate myself i podded one person because it was the first time i had managed to caught a pod and have lived in highsec ever sinceim posting this for two reasons id like to be able to go to lowsec from time to time and not farm for ages to recover sec id like it to be easier for people to decide to live in lowsec as 10s the current penalties are extremely harsh there are many other sources of unconsensual pvp high sec wars for example in eve and theyre not penalized at all
under the impression that a 10 pirate can grind his way back within 31 hours theoretically sec status should update only once a day
having done the 10 to 2 grind on three pilots its not all that bad tbhi would prefer to see them remove the faction police spawns for outlaws in high sec as an outlaw in highsec any other player anywhere in the game would be able to freely attack you and concord would still spawn if an outlaw attacks someone else first illegally
making it harder to pvp in lowsec than in highsec doesnt make sensea highsec war decc is even harder on a carebear corp than a travel through lowsectraveling through lowsec can be avoided at the cost of a longer journey with a highsec war decc wherever they are theyre vulnerableyet we dont lower the sec status of members of a corp that deccs another corpwhile i believe that the whole sec status mechanic for the previous reason makes no sense i think that a step to fairness would be to make grinding sec status easier
31 hours to grind from 10 to 2 sounds nearly too easy considering the impact on the game
you mean that people who were partaking in unconsensual pvp would be able to go to high sec easilybut wait they can look at those who use high sec wars so why shouldnt lowsec pirates be able to
wardec  ganking people if you would use wardecs in lowsec aswell you wouldnt have sec status problemsnot supported 31hours sounds like a reasonable amount of time to get from 10 to 2
unfortunately i happen to agree with the part of your post where you say you chose that routeeve is a game of choices and consequences make different choices next timenot supported
sec gains are once per 15 min per system now that your ignorance is dispelled you can greatly improve your sec repair speed
the bit about being flagged in 10 and thus shot in 05 seems kind of silly but 31 hours is fine for a fullon sec status grind especially given that you can train social skills and lower it
what part of doing the time for the crime do you not understandthe solution is simplestop podding people without wardec and you dont have to grind for secthere problem solved case closedjedimindtricknow move along move alongjedimindtrick
this is true rats killed and everything shiney that comes with that are updated once every 15 minutes problem is finding rats to grind that give both a big sec increase and that respawn fairly often and hope nobody else in the system has the same ideanow we just need ccp to fix the forums so i dont have to login 5 times to post

the problem atm is that to mine ice which everyone needs you are forced to mine for hours upon end just to get a small amount even in a large group this is mindnumbing gameplay and requires no interaction at all from the player but pushing a button every so many minutes depending on the ship usedif the processing is moved towards a structure ship or bpc then the mining part will become not the long slow process which promotes the use of macros but it will become more of a logistical and production matterthe process will become more player involved due to the fact that the cubes need to be transported to the refinery the refinery needs to be maintained and defended and the end product must be delivered it may in fact lead to less time being spend on the entire process but the time spend on it now just to get enough fuel for a tower is by far not realistic
sounds much more interesting than the current system
supported
i think to make the belts more realistic yes yes i know this game is completely unrealistic not only should the roids contain all the ores as akita suggested but also ice if we look at the roid belt between mars and jupiter u can bet that there is a mix of ore type roids and ice type roids the same would apply to both the kuiper belt and then oort cloud so instead of just ore only belts i think all belts should be a mix of ice and ore roids also a new ship that could be added to the game is the terraformercolony ship as players fly about in 00 they can scan planets and find uninhabited worlds and terraform them level 1 terraforming allows you colonize earth like worlds level 2 allows u terraform desert worlds and then colonize them level 3 allows you terraform ocean worlds level 4 allows you terraform volcanic worlds level 5 allows you terraform ice worlds these new colonies would count towards sov in the system and could then be linked into dust 514 for planet side battles also once a world is first colonised the alliance that colonised it gets to name that world much like the way outposts get renamed only gas giants cannot be terraformed or colonised
zydrine and megacyte frequently drop to 50 below peak and ore value frequently drops to 40 below peak for months at a time at the low point this year a maxskilled hulk would be pulling about 35mhr off of arkonor minus time spent hauling which is kind of mediocre especially considering that it involves several months of training that are utterly useless for anything else
the best solution ive ever seen to the moongold bottleneck mining unprofitably and 00hisec balance by seriously increasing the value of access to highvalue ore while only effecting the tiny minority of players with serious moongold access negatively ive seenthis is a simple and elegant solution to a lot of eves current economic problems and imbalances well thought out kudos to you opalthough frankly i have no clue if the numbers are right i dont do either mining or t2 production
i think ccp should handle the numbers but this sounds like a sweet idea i like the idea of forcing it to be compressed this might push me over the edge for getting a rorqual
this sounds fun and interesting
mixing dysprosium and promethium into other items isnt really a great solution because its uncontrollable and could do anything from very little if they dont make their source worthwhile to crash the market for them if it causes a glut of unneeded supply ie certain salvage items and thuliumideally there should be choice involved either produce just dysprosiumpromethium via some mechanism or dont produce it at all doing that means their supply can be easily scaled up or down to meet demand without unwanted byproducts
this is excellent and will be added up top while i might differ somewhat on your implementation eg im not sure that requiring rorquals is necessarily the best solution the general concept is solid
i think i speak for many when i say please learn to spellplease
thanks you made me stupider
while its offtopic we talked about it on iceland in january why discussing mining improvements but yes it was never raised as issue
i think everyone talking in l33t sp33k may solve all our problems

the 5 to kinetic missile damage per skill level damage bonus that applys to the following ships is a poor bonus and should be replaced with a 5 per level damage or 5 per level rof bonus like the other races get on there shipsships affectedcaracal cerberus hawk kestrel drake nighhawk buzzard phoenix condor heron onyx crow rook caracal navy issuethe whymissile systems do less raw dps than guns to compensate for the above missile users get to choose damage type so that they can fire against a ships resistance holeprefered damage type versust1 shield tanker emt1 armor tanker expt2 caldari emt2 amarr thermalt2 gallente expt2 minmatar kineticas can be seen above kinetic is only really the first choice versus t2 mini and will be somewhat effective versus t1 armor tankswhen a player flying a caldari ship engages in battle very often they will need to switch to a damage type other than kineticas soon as a caldari player switches away from kinetic  he loses his ship damage bonus effectivelly a level 5 pilot becomes no more effective at dealing damage than a level 1 pilotno other races are expected to discard there damage bonuses while in combatthis does not happen with the other races where dictating range rather than damage type is often the required battle tacticgallente always get 5 more kin and 5 more therm per player skill level and 10 more per level with drones  emthermkinexp amarr always get 5 more em and 5 more therm per player skill levelmini always get 5 more  emthermkinexp  per player skill depending on ammo choosencaldari get 5 more kinetic in 13 engagements depending upon targetaveraged out this is only 166 extra dps per player skill levelto be fair if this change is voted for and approved the following ships should also have there racial bonus replaced with something elsehelios 10 thermal droneinquisitor 5 em missilesbreacher 5 explosive misileseris 5 thermal rocketlight missilei have not included the stealth bombers where each race gets the same bonus applied to one of the four damage typesexcluding stealths14 caldari ships get racial only damage bonus2 gallente ships get racial only damage bonus1 mini and 1 amarr get racial damage bonusthe kin bonus is less of as issue during fleet combat where the pilot will load up one ammo type and stick with itwhere the kin bonus really falls down is in solo  small fleet action where choosing a damage type becomes more importantmight help towards improving the solo ability of caldari ships which is a bit lacking atmcaldarisolopvpsuccesschoose any threeon a side note if it is important for caldari to keep there kinetic flavour then it should be applied through the damage types done by missilesegscourge 100 kinwidowmaker 75 therm 25 kinthunderbolt 75 em 25 kinhavoc 75 exp 25 kinthe kinetic flavour of caldari would then be applied through the ammo as is the case for minigalamarr

does make sense this way to have more rof rather that a specific dmg type like you said when your in pvp with missiles you always try to get the best dmg type which is not always kin in any casebetter than the system we got now i personally dont like to have 1 specific dmg type for a ship since it penalize you with other types pve or pvp ofc
signed
yea me getting ed at a sucky nighthawk fireing thunderbolts
not supported if anything add kinetic damage bonus to the raven and golem to put them in line with the rest of the caldari ships
not supportedkinetic damage is caldari racial flavor it needs to stay that way
in that case would you support the followingamarr only get 5 bonus to em component of damage from laser  5 to em dronesgallente only get 5 bonus to thermal component of damage from hybrids  10 to therm drones onlyminimatar only get 5 bonus to explosive component of damage from projectilescurrently only caldari suffer from a racial bonus other races get damage bonuses to all damage types they do with exception of the 4 ships listed in the opget your facts straight before you post
not supported lasers have mostly em with a little therm hybrid is mostly kinetic with a portion of therm projectile is mostly explo yes you can get other damage with proj but then it is projectile low rof low optimal low clip size any damage bonus on hybrid or lasers is quite similar to the 5 kinetic bonus and the damage bonus on projectiles is well   on projectilesevery weapon system is limted if caldari got rof accross the board where would the drawback be my phoon gets rof but then it is trully split weapons and only 4 launchers but those 4 launchers consistently outdamage and outrange their gun counterparts similarly bonusededit missiles can still be swapped to address a tank focused on one or two damage types gun damage type again except projectile    cannot be swapped out to address an opposing tank
if caldari got rof accross the board where would the drawback beno other ship has a drawback for training the skill level upwhy should caldari missile users be expected to lose there ship damage bonus when other races do not if your using proj on a proj bonused ship you always get a 5 rof or damage bonus for every level you have trained on that ship typethis is not true for caldari missile boats  when a players switches out ammo type to  em missile  thermal missile  explosive missile  the damage bonus for traing for example lvl 5 caldari cruiser goes missingthe damage bonuses for minigallenteamarr ships are allways there
the drawback is that if we use any other type of dmg we got no bonus while other weapons usually get 2 type of dmg excluding proj which have 3 sometimes thats why it would be better with rofalso like you know if you dont youll know it missiles  pvp  not so good because of dps so having more rof should be better i dont have the numbers but guns are win in pvp compared to missiles usually and most of the timeedit  thats another way of saying it lol you beat me to it
pure damage bonus rather than kinetic would be preferred id take rof though
there is wonderful thing called falloff ie paper damage is not always there and missiles tend to outrange their gun counterparts excepting on certain range bonused ships again though you have the option to switch damage if your damage type bonus is essentially neutered a gun user does not
im caldari i fly almost exclusively caldari i dont support this caldari missile boats do just fine other races dont get to pick their damage type  theyre stuck with one or two types and it is always those types youll never find a ship in another race that has 5 damage per level to any weapon you fit caldari is the kinetic race  their resistances are high in kinetic and their damage is primarily kinetic thats the way the game has been designed and its perfectly fairthis has been done on purpose if you need proof just look at the kestrel which gets a good bonus to kinetic and a substandard bonus to every other missile type there are some ships which already have rateoffire bonuses instead of damage bonuses  if you must choose your type fly one of these ships hint half of the cerberus damage bonus is an rof bonus all of the rooks damage bonus is an rof bonusif you think a ship is vulnerable to a specific type of damage use that type of missile most ships these days are tanked evenly across the board or at least as much as possible if anything kinetic has an advantage because of all the people mouthing off that caldari the kinetic race has some sort of birth defect when it comes to pvp
and drones how about fighters shall we make it so that amarr carriers get to deploy an additional templar per level instead of fighters either way works for mei dont use missiles btw
nonow go run some more missions in your drake
all projectile mini users get to choose there damage type all 4 damage types are bonusedall gallente drones users get to choose there damage type all 4 damage types are bonusedhybrid users dont get to choose there damage type no its allways thermkin but both of those damage types get the 5 bonus per level  not just therm laser usersdont get to choose there damage type no its allways emtherm but both of those dmage types get the 5 bonus per level  not just em if you train level 5 amarr cruiser you will allways get 25 more dps no matter what ammo you use  range based tactics if you train level 5 mini cruiser you will allways get 25 more dps no matter what ammo you use  fallof  damage type based tactics if you train level 5 gallente cruiser you will allways get 25 more dps no matter ammo you use  range based tactics if you train level 5 caldari cruiser you will not allways get 25 more dps  you lose your ship damage bonus in 2 out of 3 engagements if you use the best ammo for the target yes i understand the racial nature of why caldari get kineticracial bonuses would be cool if they were applied to all races but they arntbut racial damage type bonuses are not applied to the other racesif racial bonuses were to be applied fullygallente would get 5 to blaster thermal damage only and 5 thermal dronesamarr would get 5 to laser em damage only and 5 em dronesmini would get 5 to exp component of projectile ammo damage  currently they get all 4of course that what any decent missile pilot does but choosing anything other than kinetic means you get no benefit for the training you did up your ship classes skill levela level 1 pilot will do the same damage as youcerb gets a rof bonus yes  racial damage the other damage hacs deimoszealotmuniin get double damage bonuses
i mission in an ishtar
look if ccp did this would there ever be a reason not to use a drake in pve an afk drake for all seasons you ignore the further imbalancing of pve if this change were implemented for a pvp bonus you think you see a lot of drakes and ravens etc in mission hubs nowlet me try to find some common ground as i will never support your proposal and i highly doubt ccp will do what you want a change should be made not to the ship bonuses but to the missiles themselves as things are now all missiles have the same stats a thor torpedo is no different from a rift torpedo except in the type of damage how about if kinetic missiles as a class had a better max velocity wouldnt that make them more useful for pvp and take more advantage of the caldari kinetic bonus as well as being scientifcally consistent then explo missiles could have better stat for explo radius em missiles better stat for explo velocity and thermal a slightly better base damage this would make missiles similar to drones particularly as to sentry drones and light drones where the type to use has factors beyond the damage type so if you want slightly better range or speed to target and the benefit of the kinetic damage bonus use kinetic if range or speed to target is not an issue you have a second damage option thermal if the speed or sig radius of the target is an issue   
if i come off with a its that way now so it must always be that way tune thats not the way this is intended i used to think that they should get a bonus to all missiles but i thought about it for a while and came to the conclusion that a buff like that would unbalance the caldari shipsand the different types have a different range and do different amounts of damage if you want the maximum damage output you have to chose the close range ammunition which is explosivekinetic again if you want maximum range you have to choose the longrange ammunition which is also explosivekinetic a minmitars choice is more about the range they want rather than the damage type they want to deal caldari get the same range and same damage output from each of the four missile typesill give you that one but there are penalties the gallente pay for that their dps can be destroyed and for maximum dps they still have to use the thermal drones as the others dont quite do as much damage also you cant carry five lights and five heavies from each race unless youre an ishtar and you can fit a whole carrier in your drone bay whereas missile users can fit as many different types of ammo in their cargo hold as they have room forisnt that what i said missiles just get one type of damage its different but its not unbalancedgiving the caldari a bonus to whatever damage type they want would push them too high we already get to choose to have a weapon system that concentrates all of its power in a single damage type  if we know where the hole is we can take advantage of it if an amarr pilot knows that the target is vulnerable to explosive he doesnt have much of a choice about what to do
fail i dont even fail like explaining why because it shouldnt be that hard to see racial bonus should stay as isedit im bored so ill take a stab at ityes but unfortunately you only do em and thermalyou do multiple damage types but not in the same way missiles do your damage is spread between 23 different typesyou only do thermal and kineticwith missiles you can thermkinexpem and exploit the racial tank holes of the other races easier sure its not as effective as if you were using kinetic but you can do explosive damage where hybrids are stuck with thermkin
as a caldariminmatar combat pilot i understand the frustration of that damage bonus  but i also understand the reasons for itmissiles have too many disadvantages to balance their two advantages  damage type selection and 0 cap use with the exception of hams all missiles do noticeably less damage than their counterparts rockets and cruise missiles in particular are very poor weapon types and their damage boosting mods require more cpu while their range is typically better than blasters and autocannons of the same size this was intended to compensate for the time it takes for them to hit their targets the fact that one of their advantages  damage type selection  is negated by the ship bonuses of the majority of ships intended to use them just adds insult to injuryi would say either give us a rof bonus or buff missiles across the board to be more effective damage dealers in line with blasters and autos
yes it would make drake a bit better at pve  ravens dont get the kin bonus atm they get rof and are finenh would also benefit for pve other races also have good pve ships i personal like the ishtar as it is ecmdamp proof and can salvage as it goes  even if its a bit slower than drakenhreengineering of missile combat might be a solution as long as i always get a damage bonus on dps bonused ships for each levels of that ship class skill i have trainedbut i dont think missiles are broken to the extent of requireing a rewritewhats broken imho is the kin bonusesbecause having a bonus which increases dps only on one damage type is incompatible with combat tactics that require you to change damage type in order to do significant damage on targetim not trying to make missile boats opif the bonuses did get changed and it did make cmbs overpowered then a small change in base missile damage would be enough to rebalance thatbut after both changes we would be left with a situation where a lvl5 pilot is 20 more effective than a lvl1 pilota situation that other race pilots take for grantedclass for class cmbs are generally not as useful in solosmall gang pvp as the other races and this could be the shot in the arm that they need

personal attacks are not arguements for against a topicand btwmy combat ranking  366you combat ranking  2639so really who sucks 
your gallente so you must be refering to drones yes this is a thread about missiles and missile bonuses on caldari ships
one last thing i need to point outi dont ever remember anyone saying the sacrilege is overpoweredit get damage and rof bonuses to short range high damage missilesif the sac is fine then the same bonuses can be applied to caldari missiles boats without issue
things do not have to be the same to be balancedthe sacrilege also has no range bonus which limits the usefulness of its heavy assault missiles note also that it does not gain a bonus to heavy missiles which have a very long range and which have longrange ammunition that does as much damage as its closerange ammunitionyou cant pick one example and hold it up as a shining beacon of light and knowledge all by itself look at all of the ships in relation to one anotherthe ishkur has drones and it is accepted as balanced why dont all assault frigates get drones all assault frigates should get drones and they will all be balancedheck why am i arguing please make my missile boats more powerful
the reason you feel missile boats are sub par is because you dont understand how to use missiles not because the weapon itself is lacking missiles get many bonuses that the other 3 races do not missiles always hit even if for little damage they always hit on ships of even size and larger that advantage becomes more pronounced when tracking fails missiles also get more average range and consistent damage at all ranges where as turret ships have to swap down to lower dps ammo and less varied damage on those ammos lastly missile boats do consistently better damage or near equivalent damage to their turret counterparts if you compare apples to apples you cant for instance compare a heavy launcher cerb to a blaster deimos because one is set for range the other for cc add to all of that the fact that missiles get 4 flavors of damage youre always likely to get the best damage results shot for shot if you understand statisticsfor instance you say to use exp ammo on armor tankers thats actually not true depending on the class ship and platform on that ship there are different ammos to choose each time regional affects also matter if i go to war with someone in caldari space im likely to have a different ammo in than if i go to war with someone in amarr space why because theres already an inherent chance that theyre not even fit for pvp which means there a high likelyhood that theyre tanked a certain way knowing where and when to use what type of ammo gives you that extra advantagegal min amarr none of them with the exception of drone or missle boats get that same luxury the only issue missles really have atm is their damage vs speed even ships like the nighthawk that get bonuses to cope with this struggle a lot with even mild speed
support  because missiles need some love already low paper dps plus damage reduction from anything not webbed make it theoretically speaking the lowest dps in the game and almost unviable in pvp plus drones can do the same job almost as wellno support  as aforementioned racial bonus problems plus any pvper worth his weight knows that paper dps means nothing in the world of eve as it assumes perfect conditionsall in all i have used both missiles and turrets in pvp and they both have their problems im no great war hero but seems to me that kinetic damage would only have a great impact on t1 pvp most t2 fits ive seen have had strong omnitanks command ship for small gang warfare 90 resists ftwflame away

this has to happen the new sb effect is seriously bad for the eyes
oh god yes pleasei really dont get why some of the ew effects are quite subtle but sensor boosters make any fleet into partytime i dont think the artists tested it in a gang situation where everyone has one either
i honestly liked the old sb effect i mean the effect was appropriate now its a really weird blur and it just hurts your eyes when everyone in the fleet is useing it
i must agreethis style is much better than the old blue vomit circles but still can be annoyingi think the eccm effect is pretty nice but cant really be seen at a distance so its hard to see whos boosted if you make it too weakperhaps a change to the bracket itself in some way
i also much prefered the old hypnotic ring it wasnt hard on the eyes and was strangely relaxing imo the eccms now they give me vertigo and make me feel naseaus im never affected by anything normally what i really wanna know is what prompted the change for all the effects they werent a problem in the end retooling the effects seems like a massive time and money sink for the devs who definitely couldve been working on something more pressing like sov mechanics or reducing lowsec lag
supportedthough maybe just in a 6 month grace period for new playersi originally setup my character with little knowledge of how i would be playing the gamei thought id be more interested in some rp side of things im notim now left with a name that makes me cringe each time it gets used as a call sign
i support this idea if there is a log of all name changes just like the current employment history that every pilot has this would eliminate the problem of scammers just changing there name and disappearing while still allowing honest players to modify their name to something that suits either the pilot or themselves more

fix the rapier pls
not supported i fly rapier  huginn a lot like 25 of all my game time and webs are fine the way they are
yup i support 5 per lvl reduction in speed
fully support this i still love my rapier but the web nerf hit too hard double webbed ship running back to gate any one
im in full support of thisi dont fly neither the rapier or the huggin but ive fought against them quite a lot and i can say their performance has dropped drastically after the nano nerfi dont advocate a return to the 90 webs 60 is fine for most ships but i do feel that a ship whose specialty is webbing should be able to better than average thats why i like the ops idea with a 75 web on a max skilled minamtar recon

the recons and eaf need to be refigured accross the board the falcon sortanerf and the nanonerfs that ccp came up with were not the best solutions to the problems presentedall recons have extreme locking range for a cruiser make them all or at least the curserooklachesishuginn usable again at those distances what should have been done was a buff to all the other racial ew so it too could be effective at the 150200km range like ecm was then we could have had gallente ewships dampingin falloff against caldariew ships and viceversa caldari and gallente also having to try to ecmdamp amarrew ships which were trying to tracking disrupt fleet snipers and minmatar ewships that were painting everybody the coplexity and fateful decisions of what to primary and how to ew in your standard sniper fleet fight would have been a blast instead we have the stupidity of recons today the cov ops cloakers could stay as short range gankers but the combat recons should be in fleet fights making things very interesting and not just a numbers gameand yes web ships need a slight strength boost to webs like damp ships need a slight strenth boost to damps to make these two ships lines worth using again how about a 75 damp strength bonus per level and a 5 per level web strength bonus afterall the ing caldari ew boats were never nerfed into uselessness like the damp and web ships they got a damn strength boost to 30 per level at the same time as they were nerfed ffs gallente and minmatar are still waiting for their compensatory boost and while were at it give the damn pilgrim more cargo space so it can power the damn neuts more easily

i will say im running under the assumption that market prices are floored because of insurance in its current state id expect ship prices to rise after these changes went in if they didnt id fully expect the payouts to be tweaked downward just so that wouldnt happen self destructing is a non factor as there would be no payout for it if you have someone else destroy your ship for you then youre increasing your premium i set the increase at 10 cost for shear example sake it could easily go higher if not much higher depending on testing numbers imo are always arbitrary on this forum til testing its the concepts that matter numbers can always be tweaked the whole 7 day system is the best way to limit how many ships people can lose or fraudulently destroy if 7 days isnt enough maybe make it 14 or 30 whatever it takes for the system to workdo people lose ships in 1 day yes but under the current system theyre basically insuring any ship they get upon assembly and then housing multiple ships in their hanger ready to go if its a matter of constant insurance updates then insurance would likely be forgotten or run out far more often making it financially cumbersome on people who were not cautious enough to keep their insurance up to date there is no way to take drastic measures in insurance imo i think this system works as an adequate base to build on base on my 00 and empire pvp experiencesi fully understand the arguements that are being made against this but i think they are based on too litteral of translations of the post understand that its a base to work off of not the final solution

one thing thats been overlooked and everyone still seems pretty clueless about is the moon mining exploit that affected one of the reactions cant remember which but basically allowed infinite amounts of some major t2 component to be produced without any of the required items to do so after 4 years of this bug going undetected and some mass banhammering prices for t2 naturally went up because one of the items dropped in supply by an astonishing amountccp has changed the supply of this subsequently changing the prices which after 4 years of getting used to buying hacsrecons at 5080m is not going to go over well with most peoplealso lol at pl in this thread you guys damn near control t2 prices what should happen imo is the material requirements for t2 should be tweaked slightly just enough to reign in t2 prices a bit
not supported because the price on all tech ii is symptomatic of other problems there are two causes if you read the latest quarterly economic report it is the dominance of tech ii bpo due to much better me lower build costs in the tech ii ship markets try inventing ships and producing its mostly not economical not to mention the hastle of gathering the components also as has been stated earlier in this thread it is the static r64s and the increasingly napped cartels that control them that are the root of the problem with pricessolutions boost the base me on invent jobs and remove static moon mins why cant static moon mins be removed as static complexes were make them deplete and respawn elsewhere no reason to have them stuck in one place in perpetuity if they periodically get reshuffled then everyone has to explore and consider territorial moves on neighbors instead of the boring static borders we have now with 2 powerblocks possibly soon to be essentially one 00 with two sides is already dull enough imagine it with one isnt this what happened to the chinese server

how soare you onboard get out of the corpallianceare they your enemies more to shootare they somewhere else where you dont even go why do they bother youin any case you cannot and should not force people not to be friendsif the game doesnt allow it theyll simply use other methodsmaybe there will be more friendly fire but surely not more hostilityintel channels will have to do more outofgame checks thats all
its called clicking the undock button
how about we just make a skill called diplomatic regulation which adds one additional high standings slot for every level except level iii and then a skill called advanced diplomatic regulation that adds one more per level maybe an implant too
before beginning i warn my suggestion will seem unimportant and effectless at first sight so please hold your bs reaction until having read to the endi propose that market order prices should all be sufficiently round numbers my specific suggestion for the interpretation of sufficiently round is 3 valuable digits ie prices below 10 isk can contain cents like 123 isk prices between 10 and 100 isk should be like 1230 isk ie tens of cents are allowed prices between 100 and 1000 isk should be integer whole numbers like 123 isk and so onthis is easy to implemet and can be done in a nohassle way if you enter an improper price when creatingmodifying an order it is automatically rounded with or without a warning messagealready existing market orders can be updated by a oncerun automatic process or simply left untouched until they get filled or expirefirst why is it not bad one can easily counter that it is bad idea because it limits choices as you can not set whatever prices i counter that you can still set prices in increments that is between 01 and 1  of the value which should be enough for all normal trading purposes clearly human mind tends to like round numbers fex imagine haggling for a 50k family home  who in his right mind will ask for a discount to 47 64273 you will clearly suggest 47k or 475k or imagine a salary negotiation situation  an offer of 5kmonth can be seriously countered with 542379 or 5500 think you got my pointside note can be skipped market system of eve exactly mimics an orerbookbased exchange which is the model followed by vast mayority of exchanges in the world including stocks derivatives commodities and currencies and most of these exchanges follow a practice that is somewhat similar to my suggestion there is a prdefined tick value and an order must be a multiple of that the tick value is usually larger for more expensive products example the price of us dollars is quoted as a 4digit number vs euro but as a 2digit number against jen why bc a real eurusd price is something like 12345 while a jpyusd price is like 12345side note endsand now finally what the heck is it good for as a direct consequence when entering a market order one can not beat the already existing best order with 1 cent if heshe wants to achieve that then has to underovebid by a meaningful amount as a side effect this in turn eliminates the 001 isk turf wars a nuisance for many of us however this is not the point here bet i can expect half dosen no supported from the centsnipers nonetheless d now imagine that many ppl want to sell the same thing and quickly now that can not be done with using the 1cent exploit if you want to be first is line you have to settle for a bit smaller price some will decide to accept that trdeoff resulting in the ask acronym for lowest sell order price to sink the same holds for the buy orders and so the bid highest buy order will rise even possible that both happens the same time if the bidask spread difference beetween best buy and sell order price was too large initially this mechanics strongly works towards narrowing the bidask spreadnow imagine that the market is in equlibrum and suddenly a sell pressure emerges no time is wasted on the cent games as it would happen today and so the ask price immediatly start sinking as the ba spread was already narrow soon many seller will hit the bid instead of entering a sell order and thus the whole market starts sinking until a new equilibrium is achieved or even healthy paniccrash is possible similar can happen  mutatis mutandis  in the case of a buy pressure the extreme case here is the socalled bubble this mechanics results in a market that reaacts faster to buysell imbalances and more voltile in genrealcontinued
these two mechanics can i expect they will bring the following benefits smaller bidask spreads ie better prices for each and any buyer and seller including those hardcore pvpers who spit on such a carabear thingy as a market mechanics markets that are more adaptive and react rapidly to changes in supply and demand thus markets become more volatile bigger differences between regions and time significant intraday price fluctuation becomes possible resulting bigger geographical arbitrage possibilities and more variable prices in time enable new profession the speculator speculators generate more turnover as they trade resulting in a much more liquid market  do not have to travel all the way to jita just to do your business pun intended d possibility for exciting spectacular market events crashes bubbles as seen in rl educational purpose anyone who knows maybe we develop our own notorious manipulators and robber barons in the end
this is a very good ideamarket trading needs to kill off those 001 isk order undercuttersbut i would suggest 4 digits of significanti need to price my dreads at 1495000000 for exampleedit to support  you might wanna support your own topic too
not supportedbecause i like it when people fight over me for business
drake if you like figth for business than you should rather support the 1cent game is for kids real figth starts with bidding by the 100000 dbut really the new rule would force those pennypinching pretenders to put up a real fight or resign their place in the arena to a better gladiator
no the solution is to get people to bid differentlyforcing the issue is a waste of timepenny pinchers get stomped on by 101001000 bidders easily without the changes you propose
i like this idea a lot but i agree with gilbert when he says that the first four digits should be counted instead of just the first 3 in any case supported
drake cant agree in my experience if i am overbid by 001 and in reply i overbid by 10000 in 5 mins my new order is overbid as well guess what by 001 however i do not really want to discuss the pennypinching as i stated disabling this exploit is only a sideeffect not the main purpose of my suggestion
i like it
this my trading has basically come down to running through all my market orders not even checking what the sell price is and lowering everything by a few dozen isk because i know everyone else is doing the same thingeven if i make a significant undercut someone will be right there ten seconds later undercutting me by a hundredth of an isk so i might as well not undercut by any significant margin
there another solution you know  sell your things in another place than jitajita is for shark but jita has the best price for seel and buy on immediateif you want to place a bid 1 play thier game2 place the order in another systemwhen i want something quick i go to jitawhen i want to make profit with an order i go to another hubim not sure your idea is goodits really dangerousas said someone will make a little bit lessmore than you on a short timenot a problem for the market if its 001 isk but if its 1 its something else 1 is a buseness for some trader if they cant do it anymore they will lost their gameyour idea is good for the buyer as its quicker and for a seller who want something quick but for someone who want to play the order game its a real problemsure i dont like when someone crash my order by 001 2mn later but i dont like the one who set  100 0000 isk 2h afterand with your rule the first one wont exist anymore but the second will and thats really dangerousnow we can buy something on a place and sell it on atnoher at a best princewe can buy it at a place and sell it on the same at a best place with patiencewith your ideathe first one will be more intersistingthe second one will be less intersitingso for people doing a lot of this for example when doing something else at the same time mining lv4 or working mid afk its a big loss
ive written the quoted one in at7 forum but now i copy it here toothis could also make a place for more public sporting events and possibly a new industry to grow out of this like gambling andor advertising industry i mean if its done for the at it could be rented out the whole year for corpsindividuals to let them use for their purpose whatever it is or profit however it is madeso what you say
as everyone knows the current bounty system is pretty much a joke players constantly exploit it by having their buddy  alt kill them and collect the bounty themselves its insult to injury for the players that they have griefed in the pasti propose to make it more difficult to exploit the system that collecting a player bounty should require you to have a certain amount of positive security status also i believe there should be a bounty hunter skillcertificate that must be trainedobtained to collect a player bounty leave rat bounties the way they are in order to obtain this skillstatus the player must have completed requirements to obtain civilian law enforcement status in addition i would make it so that an unlawful attacking or killing of any ship in secured space results in immediate revocation of your law enforcement status and bounty payouts also if you pod any pilot anywhere in the game including 00 space you lose your ability to collect bounty also since concord does not approve of killing players even when they are wanted criminals an unlawful ship killing results in the temporary suspension of your law enforcement status and a pod kill  murder results in indefinite revocation unless you reach a sec status of 50 or higher and complete recertification requirementsi think this feature  addition would make the bounty system more viable of course it would still be flawed people would still be able to create an alt and complete the requirements to collect their own bounty however it would make it more difficult to accomplish and it would give the rest of us a cool profession  hobby in bounty hunting best of all it will really make people think twice about the consequences of their actions is it really worth it to pod kill someone if i wont be able to collect bounty in the futureim sure this topic is a dead horse so my apologies if this a duplicate thread but i feel strongly about this issue so i thought i would throw my hat in the ringi would appreciate everyones thoughts  input  constructive criticism im sure that this community will be able to build upon and improve this basic concept
ive always thought the best way to make bounty hunting legitimate is to not let anyone but the bounty hunter know who has a bounty on their head you give the capsuleers that have a certain number of qualifications ala the op post a bounty license which lets them collect bounties then instead of the bounty window in station showing just the most wanted and give bounty tabs it also shows a locator tab similar to a locator agent and a tab that shows all bounties in system and 1 2 or 3 jumps out depending on how much power you wanna give the bounty hunterfrom then on its a hunt for people who have no idea theyre being hunted
make it so the bounties are issued by an agent the agent randomly assigns a player that is currently online and not docked that is in your region as your target for this missionin the event that the players goes offline you will receive an evemail letting you know so you can stop trying to find himthis would prevent the current altabuse and make life a little more interesting
tradeable kill rights would fix 90 of this
any t1 hull can be flown recklessly because of insurance there is no meaning to losing a t1 ship that in itself is flawed game designwars of attrition are virtually impossible thus making this no more than counter strike in space where endless respawns make the only way to kill another party to grief them out of the game or lower their moraleeconomical victory should be possible and would solve a lot of the problems in 00 warfare
nah platinum insuring that aeon wouldve meant i wouldve spent more isk on insuring it than what i wouldve gotten as a payout remember you have to renew insurance every 3 months
dude wth is this insurance does not pay enough there is no replacement for the time it takes to get all the parts together and properly set up a ship losing one out in the middle of nowhere can completely leave someone out to dry even in highsec it can take a day sometimes just shopping for partsok i feel better now if anything make insurance more realistic like having a car in eve have fees taken out of your wallet every month for each ship you have insured based on a scale that adjusts for the class of ship
wowzers sooooo many numbershow about ships are free and you just end up paying for mods
fit a ship for 150mil and compare it to what you got for that last year but lets see how far the rig intervention carries us its just another shortterm remedy to distract from the static moon mineral supply yet again
yes high sec needs a buff and low sec obviously needs a nerf
campaigns have frequently been won and lost via repeated capfleet obliteration showing that there is already plenty of room for victory via attritionsupercapitals are frequently held back from deployment because of the risk of severe loss id rather not see the same apply to battleships people generally want to fight each other not hide in a pos unless they are really sure they can winthis is ignoring the fact that ships are the primary price support for t1 materials t1 material does not have a fixed cost of procurement unlike t2 material which at least needs tower fuel value is demandbased so removing insurance would drive the value of ships down tremendously resulting in a massive depression of their price and t1 materials in the process
supportedbattleships and even capitals are too cheap to losealso i dont understand why everyone should be flying battleships anyways
the only reason capital fleets are less easy to rebuild is the fact that the supply is way more limited because theyre harder to build and not many people insure their capitals it simply gets too expensive because cap ships have too long life times you can be pretty sure that you lose a battleship in 3 months if you play actively so insuring it isnt a risk its a giventrit used to be 1 isk pye 2 isk mex 16 isk iso 64 isk nocx 128 isk zyd 1024 isk and mega 4096 isk things will balance out its actually capital ships which for a big part dictate mineral prices
not supported its a bad plan
i do not support thisinsurance payouts allow players like me who do not have the free time to spend 4 hours a day earning isk to activeley participate in pvp factional warfare and even 00 warfareeve is a game which encourages people to scale fleetbattles in numbersyou are often faced with the fact that in a battle between dozens sometimes hundreds of people you loose assets in seconds im talking about 150200 million isk worth in ships mods and rigsto afford this sort of participation you need either to earn isk in large numbers time investment or buy and sell multiple gtc a month driving the monetary investment for playing eve up to a level people like me simply are not willing to spend eve is a game and not a money  time sink it should be easier to access and less time draining thus allowing people to focus on having fun instead of wasting their time grinding missions for money
vagabond  200mill rigmodsshipinsurance  17milli still fly everynighthappythat i understands total st2 fitted rupture  25mill total 35mill with medium trimarks
dont fly what you cannot afford to lose theres noone forcing you to fly 200250m worth into pvpalso funnily enough the ship youre trying to buy will be cheaper if there wasnt something like insurance
what annoys me is people self destructing their carriers before the insurance runs out and then they buy new carriers its rediculous imo it just ruins game mechanics for me
true losing a cheaply fit t1 ship doesnt hurt at allwould also be an indirect boost to t2 hulls got my support
no eve is about pvp and pvp should be viable to everyone a fully insured raven with cap controls and a semi t2 fit is still going to be around a 60 million isk losstech ii insurance is already worthless and good tech i ships already take up a decent amount of isk to fit properlylowsec endeavors already became far less viable for new players after the wcs nerf we really dont need to take away their only silver lining when getting ganked for the zillionth timeand on top of that it isnt like people are just going to run more missions and get their ships blown up more often they are going to keep their ships in highsec stay away from pvp and make the game more boring for all parties involved
kay heres the sekrit gaiz1 get in the ship2 save the fitting3 get out of the ship4 ctrl  shift  f and open the fitting5 6 profit
11044821002981 percent agree icing on the cake yummy would be having the ability to at least remove mods this way yes repackaging can do this but if i just want to use a weapon that i know is mounted on another ship the session timer can be very annoying in this circumstance

signed be waiting this for a while ty
so this is when your in station then right   obviousam i going to far if i request this while your in space so you know what your vict enemy is equipped  without using the ship scanner of courseps last time i used this module i was disapointed
oh yesso i have 3 hauler on the region which one are fitted  need to go see it not this one waiting not this onegot a mission to do but do i have the good fitting on the ship 10 jump away or do i have to buy some  dunno
why hasnt this been done yetgo do

is there any reason we should not be able to fit assembled ships as well without boarding them maybe even let us be able to autofit using a saved setup if all the needed modules are in our hanger i dont know about these but i fully support this
taking a stand against meaningless content injection fix the bugs and bring back the epic font
while at it allow us to rename them as wellgive us full access if we have full accessthough im sure the answer will either be too much work or the holy database does not work this way as its with blueprints
bump
i sorta agree but not enough i dont know if 8 accross the board is right possibly less muninn ok with that change ac ok tempest bonus change no to the role bonus it is a tech i ship leave the slots as they are but maybe add one turret hardpoint and make the falloff only affect arty just as the apocs optimal should be made to affect only beams the rokhs only affect rails and swap the megas tracking bonus for a rail falloff bonus increase tracking on blasters to compensate gallente and help cure the blaster boat problems this will make the tier 2 battleships except the raven where the rokh swaps places the snipers of each racial fleet and it would preserve the utility of the other tiers for the short range weapons and pvp or missioning
let me get this straigh minnie ships that uses arty use no cap can swap to any dmg type and now you want more dmg uhh no lmaops did i miss something here 
speaking as one who flys both amarr and minmatar yes you are missing something train minmatar or create an alt to experiment with
since you havent made the effort to research this i invite you to the ongoing discussion related to this issue located here tempestautocannon issue threadi suggest you actually read the arguments before posting there though

up for more tickage
nerf cargo containers im sick off seeingsome fother mucker is recruiting to a dumb corp that cant get player unless the leave 1mill cans out side heknow ill go and read the rest of your post rant over these should only be aloud in the the cargo hold packednothing stranger than a industral with 6000m3 space carring 8000m3 of stuff because he put it in a box what happend to that extra 2000m3not that is  signed
so basically you want to increase your cargo capacity without any penalty like in too lazy to open five containers and have to split the stuffif you dont like the stack splitting then just dont use them and live with the less capacityso nobtw you could have asked for faction cargo expander  drichter haulerpilot
not supportedneed a bigger can get an orca o pyes the can system is screwed but this makes it worse
do you enjoy stack splitting  stacking is it fun for you are there better things like umm i dunno pvp  we could spend our precious ingame time on rather than dcking around with cargo cans 
works for me
i dont stacksplitor any of that crapi have no problems here i deal with what i got and i dont exploit the gsc cargo can trick because i dont want to have to deal with the stupidity of stack splittingive always thought the way they did the cans with them taking up such and such space and providng more space than the can takes up was always screaming exploit to methis just makes it worse
ive pondered this in circles many times myself mostly while moving my 5 rigged and fitted battleships 25 jumps moving my ship hangar takes 3 days moving my items about 30 minutes with a crappy skilled badger mk2what ive come up with is a ship transport or whatever it would be called that can only hold sub capital ships only unload and load in stationsdirectly from ship maint arrays being able to carry 68 battleships should be more than enough to satisfy anyone with a ship collection really for storylines sake it can be developed by interbus or something cause really we dont need 4 versions of the same ship just one made by a neutral partyseeing this ship put into the game would make me infinitely happy to train for and buy
i agreeif ccp dont want us to use capital as freighter they need to give us something elseat least a big thing in 05capital industrial ship are only for ore now why not creating one as a real industrial ship or change something existing i dont carea t3 module is an idea  like a version for cargo and another for assembled shipeven if its expensive it will sell well in empire space at least
a ship called the mobile deployment transportfor highsec it can move around your craploads of ships for nulllowsec it can be used to unleash a crapload of bs and then when yourr bs explode get back in another one it would add a whole new dimension to warfare
with a limit on the total number of ships that can be carrierso that when you get suicided the server does not explodeso 15 ship limit and teh bay size you choose cant carry capitalsme gets t1 fitted raven and 15 corpies in same
i was actually thinking that since the ships youre transporting are rigged onto the hull of the ship sos that they dont move that they are all wrecked along with your ship when you get blown up
this imply an important change  the limitation of 3900 m2 will deseapearits important for example when hauling big modules like pos structure cause we cant use container with then and we lost a lot of spaceim for but dunno if ccp will accept allowing that
sounds like fun more fun than managing containers that is
supportedand to the idiots who keep saying that using cans lessens the load on the database please stfuare you ccp are you a dev a gmthen how the hell can you say such a thing with any amount of authoritythink about it 1 more object is more entry in a db and said object is a container which even more stuff to store in the database this means additional queriessomehow i think your logic is really screwy therethe fewer things you have to store and the fewer calls to the db the better
this would not work for freighters unless the volume of capital ships is increased because as it stands any freighter would be able to haul a packaged dreadnought or carrier into highsec given a small percentage boost in cargo storageor freighters could just be excluded from the cargo boost
yeah fon my week long discussion amounted in being told that in order to avoid losing a ship to this im calling it exploit out of logic and ccps very own definition seen here i had to stay docked and potentially log off for several hours which even then didnt garuantee my safety i learned after the fact that there was a neutral party killing the rats in my mission to generate wrecks for the gankers to aggressfor extra clarity this is what ccps exploit defenition isive also heard that using known exploits is a bannable offense with the help of a friend we found a post of a dev stating that the context in which i was killed is a known exploit i was told that the dev was simply misinformed although we searched for and didnt find any evidence of the contrarybumping to give this a chance of being looked at by devs and fixing an important issue that everyone gets snagged on at least once
this is clearly an exploit  o pa possible solution is to get concordd for shooting someone elses wrecks but im quite sure that would go over really well like a lead balloonwell you get concordd for shooting a friggen rock in a mission so why not keep to the same wacky train of thoughtps no it wasnt me member of my corp set off a smartbomb in mission and got concordd for nailing a rock it was funny as hell but not so funny after you think about the stupidity of it all
ha ha ha i know what you mean
i remember hearing that shooting a wreck to update aggression was an exploit something like two years ago now its an intended game mechanic i never knew someone shooting one of your wrecks updates gcc timer too thats even more messed up
time to start popping all rats in lowsec 
the post i found quoting the dev was 25 years old the gm pointed this out i asked him if time should make a difference they didnt like that too much 
aye

hi allok  just what is the point of the csmtheres a thread going on in the assembly hall regarding the competence of gms and the seeming failures of the petition system its over 350 posts long yet ccp feel able to not bother with any form of official responsethere are multiple threads going on the the issues workarounds and localization forum regarding people bringing hack attempts on their accounts to ccp they subsequently get locked out of their accounts for weeks on end and are left high and dry by ccp in the meantime with not a single scrap of feedback on their issue while still being charged for the privilegeccp seem from the lack of an official response to these threads to feel able to ignore these threads tooso just what is the csm doing about this and can they do anything about this seeming endemic failure within ccpor is the csm simply a tipping of the hat towards player concerns about eve while nothing actually gets resolved
its purposed is to generate some press interest and act as a lightning rod for forums whining
there have been some changes that were made because of the advent of the csms i think the most recent was the faction warfare lp payouts so yeah from time to time ccp does listen to themsometimes though youll have a dev in the ccp group that will not for the life of them will see things the players way and have often sabotaged various attempts to get things through add to that csms just wanna play the game too and stuff can get dropped or as what happens in real politics you sometimes vote in an idiot
when is the next csm meeting
cerb can get 550 dps from 0 to 41km with heavy assaults and kinetic rage or it can do 440dps with any other damage typedeimos can get 635dps at 34 optimally and can hit out to 81 with falloff or it can do 499dps at 49 with a max range of 176 not even half of the cerbs rangeto that the diemos has to consider tracking and only 2 damage typesthe one saving grace the deimos has is its drones which can add another 158dps tops if youve trained those skills also but can be shot down smart bombed lost and forgotten or whatever else deimos has to give up 3 slots in its tanking zone to do that damagecerb has to give up 3 slots not in its tanking sectionexplain to me where the problem is with those 2 ships2 unique platforms that complement each other with strengths and weaknessesmissles fill a role part of that role is racial kinetic damage for certain ships live with it
so who should be the one complaining i could care less about combat ranking i play eve to shoot stuff and be shot at as ive said on just about every other buff thread quit fcking whining and play the game this forum is here for game development ideas not rebalances while i salute ccp for coming up with the idea for the csm i want to slap them for succumbing to the 80000 whiners posting thread after thread asking for their race to be buffedshut the hell up and play the game
my response to that would be i would still put my money on the deimos 3 possible situations in a 1v1 which almost never happens anywaycerb tackles deimos  deimos is already in tackle range and counter tackles  deimos wins due to higher dps assuming same ehp tanking and all lvl 5 skillsdeimos tackles cerb  deimos in optimal and does higher dps  cerb tries to run and cannot due to bieng tackled by deimoscerb at optimal and engages deimos  deimos warps out due to no tackle at that big of a range  cat and mouse game ensues with either pilot getting blown up or logging due to boredom side note why are we arguing about 2 different ships different stratagies and gang tactics to both of them caldari and gallante pitted against eachother as always
i agree that kinetic missiles being the only bonus on caldari ships sucks but what you are proposing is not the way to fix the issue a more reasonable solution would be for missiles to have more than one damage type for example a missile can deal 25 kinetic and 75 damage specific giving kinetic missiles 100 kinetic damage this would keep caldari the kinetic race but also allow for a more uniform damage increase that is the only solution i can see for an issue such as this
i want amarr ships to fire explosive kinetic and thermal more of it laser beams111111 seriously missiles do not have a optimal range and you can drive right up the face of another ship and torp it to death or cruise him from afar even with my ty missile skills my cruisies can reach out and smack someone at 200km or come close and torp them at 30kmon top of hitting your target 247 with no minimal range and a range my apocalypse struggles to match is the flexibility that missiles offers whats that hes down to armour switch to expl or kin or therm or emgallente minmatars and amarr are restricted to exp thermkin emtherm caldari has access to all 4 with amazing range and no trackingwishing his abaddon can shoot explosive and kinetic laser beams stormie
if you think missiles currently need this buff do us a favour and go fly a missile boat or even better get on the wrong end of one
nobecause that would mean i always have to take all missledamagetypes with me and test what dmg type is the best  would take too long in a pvpscenariowith bonus to one dmgtype i just carry 2 or max 3 dmg types with me and i at least get the feeling that although kinetic may not be the best its not the worst either because of dmgbonusalso every race is somehow predictable what damagetype theyll deal from a megathron i only expect kinetic and thermal from zealot em and thermal vagabond mostly explosive  and from caldari its kinetic but while the other races have to stick with their damagetype caldari can switch to something differentif u want to change something about caldari weapons complain about rockets
while i do not agree with the op i found this very interestingperhaps not balanced in the way suggested here but more flavour to the different types of missiles sounds awesome
fly khanidproblem solved
not supported
you say you carry 2  3 damage types  your happy that you lose your damage bonus when you switch ammo  when this doesnt happen to any other ship than a caldari missile boat 
i fly all races  id like to fly cmbs but i cant because they have bonuses which are incompatible with there combat tactics
i can and do fly khanidit doesnt solve the problem that cmbs have damage bonuses incompatible with there combat tactics
your completelly missing the pointthis is not about ship x verus ship ythis is about player x versus player ywhere player y has trained level 5 and player x has only trained level 1take a caracal as an exampleput 2 pilots against one anotherall other skills and mods are equalplayer x has caldari cruiser 2  player y has caldari cruiser 5who wins that fight youd think it should be player y who has done 20 days extra training but thats not so its actually a draw as they both have to use em missiles so nither is fighting with a damage bonusthis only happens with cmbsthe damage bonus is not compatible with the combat tacticall other races ships that get damage bonuses allways benifit from those bonus
this is not about ship x versus ship y read the opyou talk about damage switching as and advantageyet tou fail to comprehend that a level 5 pilots does not more damage than a level 1 pilot when the advantage is usedsacs are not overpowered  even though they get double damage bonus to all damage typeswhy do you think it would make a caracal or cerb overpowered 
the stupidest example is the kestrel and the inquisitor and breacher which gets a 10 kinetic bonus and a 5 bonus to the other damage types meaning you can never take advantage of both hull bonuses at once but yeah it does suck that a bunch of caldari missile ships only get one of their bonuses while using a particular ammo type imagine if the megathron only got its hybrid damage bonus while it was using uranium rounds or if the geddons rate of fire bonus only worked with standard crystals loaded seeing as the supposed advantage of missile launchers is the ability to swap out damage types its silly to force the player to sacrifice a hull bonus to do so its like arguing that amarr players do have the ability to do variable damage types after all because they can always choose to take off the lasers and fit artillery
flawed analogy anyway you appear to not have experienced the wonders of the 10 reduction in cap use on lasers or the piddly 5 rof bonus on the deep in torpor arty which basically make the weapons useable at level 4 and sorta ok at level 5 so you see other races are stuck with one meaningful bonus as well additionally you appear to not have read the entire threadagain flawed analogy you cant in the middle of a battle ask everyone to wait while you dock up and swap guns instead of simply reloading your already fit launchers
thanks i would like this on a phoon and my alts would like this on their drakes

and god forbid you might actually have to be creative to win a fight
i have dreams to some day build a rocket ship it sounds like from this thread though that would be totally pointless since any other ship in the game would beat itsomeone here mentioned a meeting in september with ccp where they will bring up rocketsdoes anyone know what day in september
support i like the better explosion radius and velocity optionalso how about giving all javelin variants of unguided missiles a little more range say 6575 over base range to make them worth the hit to shipspeed
1 lag  yeah right its just additional formulas to give you a boost on existing numbersjust like rigsand from my understanding rigs doesnt make the game lagging so no it wont make this game laggy2 this is optional i guesswell i hope cause yeah its gonna get complicated with new recruits lol there head hurts after they done the tutorials in the beginning lol3 this complicated  omfg no seriouslycomplicated mwuhahaha what do you think the damage formula is  believe me this looks simplewell it is anyway just be thankful your not the person who does the coding for the dmg and all that kind of stuffps complicated pss ccp get this idea on the double nowi like itpsss can i get a crew down the airlock and see him die 
sucky game mechanic
yes when there are things you can do to the same effect take my issue for an example you try to hunt a ratter in an empty system the moment you jump into the system you have a few seconds to locate him before he is safe from aggression even then he will very likely escape if he pays attention it was already very hard to catch him as a forum  you notice the lack of any whines about how overpowered the scanner was i for one cant think of a single oneplease tell me how to adapt i cant train a skill to do it faster i cant use a different fitting or a ship since they are all equally bad no implants or rigs will help me the only thing that i could do was to try and learn to how to scan the target down faster by training my real life skills ccp has now put a hardcap on this that i have no way of compensating for the competition between target and prey was between time and it favored the prey already ccp just decided it wasnt easy enough for them and didnt allow other ways of achieving the same result so there isnt a way to adapt to the change the only option is to have them change it to something more reasonable so it doesnt affect gameplay so much but still prevents constant spam of the scanner this thread is full of acceptable compromises

public petition to take back the spanish tutorialswhen apocrypha expansion was deployed at begins of 2009 the spanish tutorials and some other already translated tutorials stoped working some days ago we started to send petitions protesting for this issue and the answer that we received was that this isnt an issue that ccp doesnt support nonoffical languages after that they encouraged us to write a public petition on the forums so here it iswe want that ccp bring back us all the spanish tutorials that we had before the apocrypha expansion first thing i would like to say is that we are not after a spanish client we are only after the spanish tutorials spanish is the 3rd more spoken language in the world ccp is a company and we are almost sure they deeply studied this and if they decided to dont make a full translation they will have its reasons but we dont think that translating the tutorials would be a huge issue since they were translated before the first question that new spanish people do is if the tutorials are translated and lot of them are discouraged to continue playing when they find tutorials are not translatedthere are some spanish communtys trying to cover this hole and would be a huge help if ccp supported us a bit since we are ready to help ccp in all we can in this aspectnote this is not a discussion thread this is only a petition you can find a discusion thread about this here discusion threadthanks for your attentiontokp lotas

here are my personal initial thoughts changes should be gradual so you can look back and fully grasp the direct and indirect affects of a change some of these are too steep and conveniently leaves out factors that do benefit matar i think a slight nerf to amarr would be of more value as they got the ships with stats so out of whackall autocannons 35 falloff hit quality reduces the damage at optimal  falloff to 386 tracking independent this is a very steep loss of damage and ambits are practically manditory on every ac ship just to get decent damage so a straight up 35 falloff increase so my vaga can then hit from outside point range and still do pretty good damage would have to see a graph to compare it with other race weapons but seems a little overpoweredtiered falloff keep the falloff the same for the middle tiered autocannons reduce the falloff of the lower tier by 10 increase the falloff of the upper tier by 10  you do currently have an incentive of 5 increase damage maybe take tracking penalty off then you will see more people switch between the different tiers so on top of the 35 you want another 10 i am guessing for tier 3 would have to see this in comparison to others factoring tracking cap usage ammo bonuses and ammo typesartillery increase the base damage modifier by 50 compensate by increasing the rate of fire by 50 as well this gives artillery a bit of its bite back but not all of it increase clip size by 50 as well finally increase optimal by 10 across the board the result is a higher alpha but the same dps and a little bit less pain from reloading  so you want a 10 increase in optimal on top of the tempest optimal bonus couple that with a 50 alpha increase on guns that take no cap and have a nice falloff compared to the other guns the tempest increase speed and agility by 15 change the bonuses as following damage bonus to 10 per level 5 falloff per level this gives it a little bit of seperation from the maelstrom which currently overshadows it in nearly every role it makes the tempest a much better pirate boat and gives it a good antisupport role while staying mobile it has the option of sitting nice and close with a large alpha from artillery or being a mobile autocannon and neutralizer machine it will still suffer from a confused midlow slot configuration so it wont be the next ganktank battleship like the mega or geddon it will actually lose dps in favor for some true versatility so 25 falloff increase plus the 10 increase you want to give guns the tempest does have 2 utility slots so it can quickly turn into an rrneut bs without any sacrifice of slots and it has the unused cap to use them why not just have a total of 23 bs in the game as they are all turning the samethe muninn move a highslot to a midslot utility highslots dont belong on sniper hacs nevermind two of them increase speed and agility by 10 combined with the artillery changes i think it will be just fine it may not reach the dpstracking of the zealot but it will have a seperate damage type and be faster and more agile there is no reason why the amarr hac should be faster than the minmatar hac hmm this one i am on the fence with we have 2 utility plus drones that are both useless for a sniper i would almost be fine taking away a utility plus the drones for a mid the one extra utility could possibly be used for a neut though you wont have grid for itthe typhoon switch armor and shield give it some more fitting room 1000 pg40 cpu more grid would be nice i would be willing to make drone bay smaller for it and then a double dmg bonus for just one of the weapon types missile or arty like you did with the naglfar
that doesnt make any sense dont increase my base range i dont want to have to fit rigs to increase my range why do blasters get a falloff increase and not autocannons also remember that falloff is only about 385 as strong a mechanic as optimal the tempest does not have an optimal bonus nor is astro calling for one even with his proposed changes artillery will still be the shortest long range weapon his tempest proposal actually lowers its dps below its already lowestinclass dps im against his tempestspecific changes but for different reasons i support the reststill far far less than the 90km optimal you get with an apoc using pulse lasersno he means give it more armor than shield right now it has 7 lowslots and more shield than armor  a very confused ship it doesnt have the grid for an active armor tank either but i feel the phoon is pretty decent alreadygiven these clarifications would you support his changes
i updated my post and where i do support the changes i noted it i dont support all of it especially all at one time though if you did get this all in it would definitely benefit me
signed
got my vote
yeah what he said minmatar is already eve on hard mode so make their ships worth the effort
yes1000x yes love the look of minnie shipsespecially the pestnow give me a good reason to fly it
supported although im thinking arty may need something more the increase in alpha will help artillery instapop things but will only be helpful if instapopping things and even with 10 more optimal they will still be the shortest range and have by far the worst tracking for sniping against targets that you know you can not kill in one volley artillery would be even worse besides for the much needed optimal boost
supported
the intent wasnt to make them a better fleet weapon the intent was to give them more of a role in small gang combat where they excel while keeping around the same performance in a fleet the optimal nudge plus the falloff bonus of the pest will make it a little easier to use arties in a fleet setting but the big change is small gang and hit and run mechanics i want people to say oh  when they see 4 tempests sitting on a gate right now its lol
i dont know what you call pretty good damage as the vaga has mediocre to poor damage at optimal id love to include some graphs but i dont really have the tools necessary the falloff increase would make the graph look somewhat like the eft graphs currently eft graphs dont account for hit quality so a 33 boost would make more or less identicalother guns have scaling optimal and damage i dont see why minmatar should get the shaft here another 10 ontop of the 35 proposed is very little when considering dps at range honestly thats what a single ambit the equivalent of a 34 boost in optimal if my math serves me rightyes you fail to note the abysmal dps optimal rof fitting reqs among other thingsi dont know what youre talking about here the proposed change will actually make it do less damage than before 9 effective turrets vs 10 but instead give it a larger alpha and some extra range it will continue to be paper thin with a crap mediumlow config low sensor strength low lock range and other things it will basically turn into an oversized bci think the bonuses and slots are fine and will be fine especially if the changes applicable to autocannons go through
signed minnies need some fresh air as its getting kind of musty and dank inside our old rust buckets some caveats though i dont see the need to reduce the minnie long range ammos damage carbonised lead titanium sabot proton etc since they are about the only counter that minnies have in long range engagements with caldari for instance unless you want to really use tremor which wasnt even mentioned here because just about no one uses it because its dps is so anemicpersonally i dont like the arty rof changes either what arties need are better optimal higher rof and bigger clip sizes and theyll still be worse than either missiles or lasers at long rangebut the rest of the proposals yes

easy to supportalso remove the killmails where the top damage dealer did all the damage and everyone else did 0
not really a hac can do certain things a lot better for example the muninn or zealot will always be better at anti support and kiting than any battleship of battlecruiser becuase they are smaller faster more maneuverable and possess a dps parity to battleships against smaller targets my muninn would at the moment probably cost me including fittings about the same as my fleet tempest did for that i get a ship with considerably more utility and as much dps that is nominally less likely to survive an engagement due to ehp differences you could easily ask why use a titan when you have jump bridges or commandships or fleets of battleships or whatever the answer would be the same the shinier ship is genuinly more useful in certain circumstances
and apparently its not working well enough for the original posteri actually use that mechanic quite a bit more than you it seems

posting in a caod thread
this came from someone in the nc oosupport for the madness it would make in eve
seems everyone wants to talk on the pennypinching ok i yield in lots of cases yes but far from always first pennying is a phenomenon not limiteted to jita second some items have a usable market only in jita anyway if you check my op posts you can see that among the expected positive effects i listed improved market liquidity which will probably help with the second issueand let me reiterate my proposal is not aimed to simply eliminate pennypichingi dont think it works this way imo the main issue here is how many orders are inserted into the line before yours and their exact price is less important the competitor who is willing to underbid by 100 000 will underbid you no matter what the only difference is that now he may choose to do so by only 001 wich will change however the competitor who is not willing to really underbid just wants to jump the queue will no longer be able to do so at the end of the day it means less orders unerbidding you however some of those will in fact have considerably lower pricebut just the opposite is true for the second one ie an attmept of selling the same place at a better price i agree that narrower bidask spread menas that you can earn less if you are playing market maker ie if you try to buy at the bid and sell at the ask however recall that the markets are expected to become more volatile larger price fluctuation and swings will be on order you dont play such a market by trying to sell at ask level and check back in every 5 minutes if you have been underbid you enter your sell order on a higher but realistic level and dont care to be the best seller  you wait for the market to cometo you as it flucuates rapidly changes are it will do and soon this way you pocket more money with each winning trade not less
so basically you want to increase the cost of bumping in front of the queue i have no issues with 01 market warriors it decreases the cost of bumping myself in front of them when i tweak my sell orders as a related question why are you calling that an exploit
tellenta your question cuts to the point what i intend to increase is the effect caused on the market by the event of someone bumping the queue true that it also increases the cost of bumping or id rather say that from now on it would have a cost and while not the main purpose i consider the elimination of 001 underoverbidding aka pennypinching as a beneficial side effect i readily admit that pennying is not declared officially to be an exploit that is only my personal jugment based on the argument below which you may or may not acceptif your order is the best in the order book that means it is the first in line and so the first one that gets filled when a matching immediate transaction is initiated by someone so you can be more certain that you can make the deal at that price and it also will take less time  these advantages clearly have economic value as a basic priciple to gain something valuable you are required to give something in return there is no such thing as a free luch is almost a mantra in some schools of economics  indeed in this case you are expected to pay by offering a better price ie forfeiting a portion of your profit however the system mechanics allows you to underoverbid by whatever amount when cutting price by 001 you take advantage of this mechanics in order to gain something valuable for practically free and in my book that constitutes for an exploit
just 1 bump for this thread i wasnt aware it was such a lousy idea but perhaps someone will answer yes it is d
im pretty sure the only broadcasting of the tourneys these days is on youtube thats not exactly suited to what you had in mind its an interesting idea but i expect it to be quite a lot of work and im not sure the end result would be a big improvement over just having someone fraps it
wowwhere to begin ever tried to fit a caldari ship for damage before  if you did im pretty sure you had trouble not enough pg to fit that last weapon slot right without sacrificing that low slot for an rcu or a pds to get it online if you did fit it with an rcu or something similarwell you guessed it you made it less useful in some wayi dont think i need to go in details but caldari ships really need more pg im pretty sure the caldari community will benefit from that changeadvantage   more pg  usually more dps which caldari ship is not really good for now more pg  more usefulness for low slots more dmg mods instead of using it for an rcu people will probably be using more caldari ships a bit more useful since it can fit some real weapons lol pirates will have a good challenge now and will stop laughing ps i can feel the flame coming lol
i have a hard time accepting your argument that caladari ships are weak in general when the most popular mission running ship in the game is a caldari battleshipfill all the high slots with guns and shoot anything that moves isnt a strategy contrary to popular belief

4 turrets 4 missile slots 5 rof boni to bothfair enough ccp has a hardon for split weapons on minmatar ship as they are at least in theory flavoursome as versatile which is dev speak for outperformed in any specific role by other ships in the game and requiring more sp invested to even hope to competethe problem comes when we consider that you effectively get half the benefit from any damage mods you fit compared to any other battleshipthis topic always generates replies from eft warriors if you dont fly tyhpoons please dont venture an opinion as to why the typhoon is fine as it is alreadythe clever chappie that does the qen expressed suprise as to abysmal phoon sales compared to all other bs people that play this game and fly minmatar know why this is the casei would like to proposeeitherchanging the boni on the ship to 75 rof per level for both weapons compensating for the issues with damage modsorgiving the typhoon a 5 damage bonus to large proj which already have a high fire rate and 5 rof to cruisetorps then giving it 8 missile hardpoints and 8 turret hardpointslet people choose how to fit it really choose
first for the love of god its bonuses not bonithat aside theres not much reason to change the typhoon  its an adequate shipand yes i fly one i dont pvp in it but then i dont pvp anyway so thats no real surprise i do run level 4 missions in it and havent ever looked at my screen in horror wondering why the ship was failing abysmally it works well for my style of flying and playperhaps the problem is not the ship but that that particular ship does not fit well with the way you play andor fly and i mean that with no saracasm or mal intent we all fly differently  some more agressive some more defensive some favor tank some favor dps speed resists what have you the real problem may be that the typhoon just isnt the ship for you  nothing wrong with that but it works just fine for me so i see no rason to change it when there are a 11 other t1 battleships in the game to fly
i personally love the typhoon and the challenges of fitting one i think are just part of its character you can do some very effective setups with it all that being said its a teir 1 battleship i do not believe it is in proper balance with the other teir1 ships it requires entirely too many sp to fly effectively to be a starter bs i think any changes made to it however need to be very minimal otherwise it will either become way overpowered or just completely noninteresting and fun anymore i think that maybe a 66 highslot layout would be more balanced and would still give it two utility slots i support a reevaluation of the balance of the typhoon compared to the other teir1 battleships and the sp needed to make it effective
while this topic is new exiting and isnt already well discussed i will still comment to object to the 8 omni slots solution even a 55 or 66 would be preferable since it would still maintain the flavor of the phoon but i would prefer this issue looked at as part of the whole minmatar package you tend to get better long term result if you step back and look at the big picture before starting to make individual changes to existing ships

ok so big battle happens people use faction ammo the fed navy antimatter stacks back up nicely and gets back on the market faction crystals on the otherhand are damaged and cant be put back on the market so there is a large amount of waste happeningthe xl crystals are far worse because there is no amarr navy crystals thusly there is no mission runner supply of them so there is practically no faction ammo for revelationsbarring any issue relative to if the revelations need the faction ammo or notproposal be able to stack them say you have 20 crystals all damaged to 50 when stacked you could have 10 crystals at 100or simply introduce amarr navy xl so that supply can be produced
faction ammo is not the only thing in the whole damn gametheres standard ammo for crying out loudis it such a bad thing to be forced to use standard ammo
all xl ammo are limited to pirate factions not just crystals
i like tiramisu
yeah do it

supportedsame goes for cargo expanders if you have a mammoth with 4 cargo expanders on it you can only fill it while piloting the ship otherwise the cargo is too small

yup
its unusual to say the least for a t1 ship to get this sort of bonus but it is not without precedent though the other example that comes to mind is a faction ship nightmare despite that this is a very elegant solution to the tempest problem proposed tempest changes supported
not supportedi agree with almost all ipod said
so the idea is to introduce a new shiptype with frigate or destroyer sized hull i particulary love destroyer hulls and would very love a new one with that size   with sole purpose of intercepting and tackling fleeing enemiesmy brief suggestions ship should have a warp speed which is significantly higher than any other shipship should have moderate combat cabalities corvette  assault ships  corvette  interdictors  corvette  t1 frigs  corvette  t1 destroyers  corvette  interceptors   ship should have good tackling capabilities maybe a minor bonus for warp scrambling or stuff like thatno bubblesthere is no need for this ship to be faster than t2 frigates on regular speeds  basically its purpose is to gain advantage while warping and wait for the enemy on the other end of the warp tube where enemy has a chance to escape with regular drive if he is fasterwhat do ya thinkps mostly im interested in a ship with such capabilities either than this particular name or ship hullso even if it would be just a new tier of t2 interceptors  its fine
so its basically another interceptorwith current warp mechanics high warp speed is nearly useless as acceleration and deceleration take up most of the warp time
actually t2 frigs are not that fast these days and having a dessy on steoriods with tackling and gunsyou do realise that itll die to quick to make use of that tackling bonusid suggest td bonuses insteadt2 dessy that wreak havoc to gunships 3
in irl navies the corvette is a bit smaller than a frig which makes it faster and more maneuverable which just gave me an idea what if motherships can fit corvettes in its drone bay as a sort of interdictor drone with warp and bubbling abilities to stop other ships from warpingcynoing off you could assign them just like fighters but they have a bigger tank and stronger guns it wouldnt be filling any missing role shipwise but itd be really neat to know theyre warping constantly towards the fleeing bogey wherever it goes in system itd give motherships a huge role as defenders of whole star systemsoh and to make them op give them the availability to hold names and become warpin points for the rest of the fleet
aint current interceptors already filling that role 
heres the real problem with this ideawe already have a ship class that does what youre looking for theres no reason to add a second one
no supportyoure trying to introduce a redundant nonnonsensical rolealso bad nomenclature a corvette is smaller than a frigate which is smaller than a destroyer
i admit i would like to see a corvette class ship but not as a intercepter clonei always pictured it being something like a t2 newbie frigate or t2 shuttle that is designed as a courier boat something along the lines of the interbus shuttle a little more cargo room fast align fast velocity fast warp speed t2 resists maybe a bonus against scramming but that would be about it

theres also a flaw that if you aggro someone that has a global criminal timer but fail to kill them and they are destroyed by someone else up to 30 minutes later you get a security hit for aggressing a ship that does not have a global criminal timerhad that happen to me today pirate aggros a gang member we attack the pirate when he goes flashy unfortunately he escapes30 minutes and several systems later i suddenly get a security status warning because that pirate got ganked back in the system we left him in so even though he aggressed our pilot i get a 25 security hit later when im not even involved with his demisemajor bug
i support fixing things

wow just wowwhere did you learn english
lol
need old cyno back asap
this is less a issue on how the things should be and more a issue of i dont use missile anyway because i pvp so let them be as they always were this thread is not about boosting missiles is about ship bonuses and the worthiness of training that to level 5anyhow supporting or sending the supporter back to missions aint changing nothing ccp has a history of implementing changes that were never proposes by the players and complete ignoring others with tens of pages of support posts
i support this if i get crystals with kineticexplo damageseriously kinetic is not a bad damage to deal and you still have the option to switch ammo type being amarr your limited to emthermal
again you are crying on the tune of fix the game to dav varan combat tactics dav varan should not adapt his tactics to different ships and weapon systems
if the op is after parity with other races then the solution is to replace kinetic damage bonus with a generic damage bonus then remove all missile types except kineticsimples
i do not find any problem with the damage emphasis on missile ships it is even more intresting this way and does not stop me from using these ships like some ships that suffer from broken weapon systems for real rockets projectilesno they do less raw dps to compensate for the lack of tracking range and cap issues hell you could throw in even locking issues kinetic emphasis compensates for that missile ship can choose its damage typemissiles have so many inherent advantages that you who never flew other ships forget that other ships usually have bonii just to try and cover up for these issuesyeah make drake even better than the best solo pvp bc with all of these winning 4 out there and i will have to stop flying it just to not look uncool flying obviously the best ship of its class argue if you want but i am more happy with drake than other bcs yes i know that sounds like but you have vaga but so what it always works against minnies
to bring about parity  one of two things should happeneither no races should have racial damage bonuses orall races should have racial damage bonusesthere is no parity atmi went through and counted the ships that have racial damage bonusesthere are 18 caldari ships with racial bonuses3 gallente ships with racial bonuses2 minmatar ships with racial bonuses2 amarr ships with racial bonusesrof  damage to guns are not racial bonuseslasers do emthermal  thermal is not amarr racial damage type  yet amarr get 5 bonus to this damage type through rof  straight damage bonuseshybrids do thermalkinetic  kinetic is not gallente racial damage type  yet gallente get 5 bonus to this damage type through rof  straight damage bonusesprojectile do all damage types depending on ammo loaded emthermal and kinetic are not minmatar racial damage type  yet minmatar get 5 bonus to emthermalkinetic through rof and damage boniidrones do all damage types  amarr and gallente boats get 5 or 10 per level to damage types which are not there racial damage typesnow look at the disparity  caldari do not get any damage bonus on cmbs to anything other than kineticeither racial damage bonuses should be applied  gallente only get bonus to thermal damage they doamarr only get bonus to em damage they do and mini only get bonuses to exp they door caldari have there racial damage bonus replaced with a non racial one like the other races currently enjoy
another solution might be to take away 25 of raw damage type and replace it with 25 kineticso a heavy em missile becomes 75 em 25 kinetic when fired for a cara for examplethis would give cmbs the kinetic flavour and then a 5 per level rof bonus for each level a player skill up the hull
thermal is not amarr racial damage  you still get 5 more thermal for every level your train on a hull with a rof or damage bonus
missile have a tracking type paramater its called explosion velocityi dont have a problem with kinetic emphasis as suchits having a kinetic emphasis that depends on player skill level thats the issuethe more you skill up a cmb the more tied into using kinetic you are so every time you skill up the less of an advantage swapping damage type becomesif it was a straight 25 kinetic for 25 of missile damage type to give a kinetic bias then add a 5 per hull level rof or damage bonus there wouldnt be an issue
the quote is messed up true but this tracking is different and not as critical factor as with turrets for several reasonsthis leveling thing makes some sense though there is no real problembut this does not in short to not make too drastic changes to ships that are already good or decent you would have to plan all the bonii from the ground and your allaround suggestion would blow balance to hell
there are allready ships in game which have rof bonii to missilesthe raven has a single rof bonus  no racial damage bonus  this is generally not complained about as overpoweredthe sacrilidge has double bonii to missiles  rof and raw damage  again its not really seen as overpoweredyes the ships will be boosted somewhat  but not to the point of being overpowerednon of the ships in the list can be considered best in class for pvpmissiles are someway behind guns atm for pvp usage and could do with a boost
the irony of this post is overwhelming anyway this isnt the proper way to fix missiles want to fix missiles fit a tp reduce the explosion radius penalty if you have to missiles are the only weapon type that always do some damage unless you can outrun them difficult unless you have a fast ship or you get enough range from them
well im sure all races have ships that could use the best possible bonii for them like drake with 25 rof and 25 resists guess which bc would be the only one you would see out there after thatthe damage bonus is made as it is for a reason
im not seeing the ironythis post is not about missiles  please read the op  its about the bonus on caldari missile boats being incompatible with tacticsits about a lvl 5 player getting the shaft for all the training he didits about the racial damage bonus that cmbs get being equivelent to 14 of the bonus that the other races get through there racial weapons systems damage boniiif amarr get 5 rof to lasers andgallente get 5 rof to hybrids andmini get 5 rof to projwhy shouldnt caldari get 5 rof to missile launchersjust trying to level the playing field hereimagine if tomorrow ccp changed the mini damage bonuses to only apply to the exp component of the ammo choosenyou would here the wails from 1000000 lightyears away
would you post the exact ships you are comparing here also remember that you are comparing different weapon mechanicsdrake 5 resist 5 kinetic dmg  harby 10 cap use 5 damagecane has double bonus in practice just about making the projectiles usable myrmi has is its own storycerb 5 kinetic dmg 10 missile velocity 10 flight time 5 rofsacri 5 ham damage 5 resists 5 cap recharge 5 rofand so onnow why do i still fail to see the problem
your not seeing the problem because you are comparing ship versus shipdo thiscompare a level 2 caracal pilot versus a level 5 caracal pilot in a small fleet shooting at an ishtarimagine that both players know what they are doingneither player will fire scourge because an ishtar starts with an 85 kinetic resistthe level 5 player does 00 more damage to the ishtar than the level 2 player because both players fire emexpthe player who trained level 5 got no advantage for training level 5 in this scenarionow look at any ship other than the ones listed in the opmini damaged bonused ships get a rof or damage bonus  not a racial bonus a level 5 mini pilot will allways do more damage than a level 2 mini pilot in the same shipsame is true for gallente and amarr and caldari rail boats i might add
you are right about caracal but only because the second bonus is also a bit ty fixing that would be more of an idea
please excuse my harsh words if your responce was ironic or sarcastic and i didnt notice itbut this is by far the dumbest thing i saw in this whole threadnot thinking much lately arent we 
this is about dual pvp wreck ownership yes yes good support that it would be a great step forward with no drawbacksedit no its about parallel or multiple wreck ownership still supported
nice informative replyi am simply saying because some one steals faster than you you want a game mechanic change implimentedthat is the ops argument correct i mean take away all the sugar coating and fluff and that is what is left correct me if i am wrong
it should be 3 hours reduction per lvl making you have a 5 hours timer when maxed long enough for you not too use it for forthback quick combat but short enough to use it to get out of your expensive implants and in a pvp clone and back after the pvping make you lose a lot less and thereby motivating players too pvp more
yes24hrs is tarded mkay
this is an intentional drawback to the jump clone yes you can fly across the entire span of the galaxy in an instant no you cannot jump right back youll have to take that into consideration before you jumpif that game mechanic does not work for your play style then dont use jump clones or have something to do at the location of all your jump clones
supported due to potentialnice idea though when reading the whole thing my brain melted and is now in a puddle on the floor has great potential but probably needs to be simpler to work and be coded into the game maybe have crew be equivilent to t3 subsections with fuel needs

erm you do realize that tremor does more damage than proton nuclear and carbonized lead right ammos other than phased plasma emp and fusion  t2 long range are rarely used for good reason minmatar long range ammos do more damage than other races but astro is suggesting that all minmatar ammos are moved 1 damage level toward closerange since nobody uses long range ammos
i support this
signed supported loved touched and kissed
supporting all but the tempest changes i dont believe any concessions need be made to justify boosting that ship eckys tempest changes seem superior all of astros other changes i fully support signed x2
this seems to be a recurring theme id love to work on the tempest some more to be completely honest this whole list was from the top of my head written in 10 minutes but i have no faith in ccp using a 100 role bonus on a tech 1 ship i do quite licke eckys change but i dont think its realistic at all i think we should come up with something easier or more concrete perhaps something as simple as 75 rof5 falloff this gives it even more dps than 10 damagelevel and doesnt have quite the overwhelming alpha im open to suggestions always
there are a number of equivalent ways to boost the tempest 100 role  25 damage  10 falloff is the same dps with battleship v as6 turrets 8 highs8 rof per level gives 1000 effective turrets  10 falloff same dps less alpha than current but better range6 turrets 8 highs135 damage bonus per level 1005 effective turrets  10 falloff same dps far more alpha better rangebut again the above changes would make the tempest very heavily dependent on battleship v
758 rof and 10 falloff sounds pretty acceptable to me yeah it would pretty much demand bs 5 but i think im okay with that the maelstrom is by far the easiest minnie bs to fit and use especially for pve and that type of thing
i love minnie and my first bs was a typhoon great fun and loved it to death litterally lost 3 but not flying it again until i got better skills im cross training atmo because i feel kinda backwards for being a minnie flying minnie bs dwhat i like most would be the change to getting a better alpha while retaining dps thats what i expect when i hear artillery  slow to reload but when it hits it does make your ears go popso good ideas  signed d
while it wouldnt bother me personally in the slightest im sure most whod disagree with this proposal dont read this forum so i will speak for themnoben
are you guys forgetting that you dont get back your insurance for yours mods or do you fly around in empty fitted ships which really no one doesi can buy a bs for 90 mill and easily spend 100 mill on modsthats 190 mill investedi have insurance gives me back say 80 mill ive actually lost 110 millwake upanyway i wish they would allow insurance on t2 ships why they dont offer this is crazy yes prices vary but make insurance percentage based on cost and perhaps insurance claimsthe risk you guys want is there in t2 ships you can lost a 130 mill ship and not get anything back you train up all that time etc for t2 and then poof its gone no money  now theres your riskand if you fly alot of t2 ships and t2 fitted then if you pvp alot then you lose money very quickly jeez what more do you wantblood
while you personally may lose a lot on fittings a lot of people dont people exploit systems like t1 loot drops smart bombs or cheaper solutions to fit their ships in addition modules are simply a transfer of money not a removal of it you may spend 2030 mil on guns but ultimately someone else gets that money insurance you pay into and nobody gets the money theres always fixes to the module problem you mention and they are natural and expected and need to be influenced more not everyone should be in a battleship 247if you cant afford to fly a bs fly a bc or a cruiser or a frigate if you cant afford insurance  mods for a big ship go down a scale learn to fly it and expect your fcs to addapt to that fleetinsurance negatively impacts economic warfare in its current state its why corporations are so easily willing to toss battleships out like candy to their members its why the proliferation of battleship heavy and cap heavy fleets has occurred i personally prefer diverse fleets that show of all types of ships and abilities but in todays game its hard not to expect 90 of a fleet makeup to be battleships and the remainder hacs its unfair to the alliance leadership because wo bringing these ships monetarily members are considered a waste its just too easy not to afford one or the other its unfair to the members because it rules out whole fields of ship styles for a majority of fleet types and its unfair to everyone because warfare gets dumbed down to its most simplistic form which is point and click warfarebelieve it or not in the past warfare had an element of artistry to it individual pilots had roles and everyone from the guy with the most expensive fit navy mega right down to that guy who brought the t2 crow were all capable of doing amazing things
insurance needs a changestop the faucetstop the payouts for concord
thison another note t2 ship insurance could use a slight boostbut thats a different topic
insurance is more or less built to encourage pvp pvp is the basis for a lot in this game especially driving the market no insurance  less pvp not no pvp just lessany fix in insurance needs to address that issue or it wont happenif you want a virtually no insurance then use tech ii shipsequating real life with a game is usually not a good idea in real life insurance factors in whether you are often driving long distances or livedrive in bad areas but again the reason for insurance ingame isnt to support you in case you lose a ship and cant make it to work without one its to encourange pvp to actually compare to real life military assets arent insured at least in the same sense of the term because they are built to go into combat and are expected to blow up at some pointfor the insurance scamming section lets actually go over that math assume you are correct first off you dont consider the price of the battleship to be mineral cost but how much you could sell it for if its 85 mil of mineral cost then it is 90 mil of actual cost but anyways you pay 85  30 mil for 115 milnearly three months later you could blow it up and receive insurance however platinum insurance is for base mineral price only if base mineral price was 85 mil thats what youd get back you blow up your ship and receive 85 mil now you have to buy another for 85 mil and insure it for 30 mil you are out the 30 mil of insurance not the mere 5 mil that you ratednow if the insurance isnt working correctly and actually repays more than price of minerals you might try to fix that mechanism
im not sure you even read the first sentence of what i typed but let me correct you on one thing insurance payouts have always been flat rated for instance the raven insurance has always payed out at 108 mil max off the top of my head the reason it currently cost between 72 and 85 mil on average to build a teir 2 ship depending on region and if you do buy orders or if you buy off sell orders you have to consider build cost not market cost because market cost isnt accurate for the ship it fluctuates based too much on demand in a region and any buyer can always circumvent that if they so chooseso what you get is essentially the floored out cost of battleships or very close to it 108mil  32 mil cost to insure  76mil floor that means that beyond the bad mechanics insurance has on players getting new ships it also has a horrible effect on markets mineral prices cannot drop lower than insurance floors that means that tech 1 ship prices will always have an artificial build cost floor and mineral prices will ultimately always averaged out to whatever the floor is sure zydrine price might fall but somewhere else the price has to go up once that floor is met changing the insurance system helps the economy of this game as well as the warfare of this game the trick is to still keep it pvp friendly not stupid friendly
i smell an alt
maybe tweak alchemey from the x10 time and resources crap fest that it is to something more reasonable like x5 or x8 but that is a solution for themoon minerals as for omg hac prices are to high foff they are not back in my day mumbles walks away waving a cane
ok look i would like to address the back in my day commentsthis is not your day back in the day hacs could fly 10000 ms kite missles shoot out 800 dps of fast tracking blaster pain and web for 90 today is not your day subtle and small nerfs to the hac over the last few years have slowly eroded their cost effectiveness theres nothing wrong with this so long as ccp knows that they need to balance the cost of an item to their usefulness specialized ships do not need to cost 200 mil whats rediculous is that command ships just as specialized are now costing as much as certain hacsthat being said i find that yes in fact the problem might lay more with r64 moon distribution likely the loss of delve to the nefarious goon swarm has driven the costs up because resources are scarce as they acquire sov 4 and build their large poses on now empty r64 moons i think the discussion ought to shift to fixing hac and t2 production in general dependency on r64 minerals and work to balance the cost of all t2 ships and equipment more towards rational levels
ok then maybe i will paint you a picture and maybe you will understand that the cost effectivness of the hac has very little if anything to do with the actual price of the damn hac get it through your brainskull hacs cost as much as they do because the cost of actually building the things is going up using the fluctuations of the market as some sort of gauge to decide if a particular ship needs a buff or nerf is not only stupid but criminally so if you think there is an issue address the issue it self if you think the hac has been nerfed to much and needs a boost say so do not hide behind things that you do not understand like markets and breathing as an excuse to get what you are going for in following man up and stop  dancing post what you want not some half assed excuse for what you wantpicture as promised red  invention costspink  mineral costsblue  moon poo costsgreen  profits i dont actually think criminal charges can be pressed i am reasonably sure op understands breathing special note the scale for profit increases or decreases according to individual inventors and the cost of materialsedit to clarify what determines the cost effectiveness of any ship is the pilot and those he flies with anything no matter how cheap is not cost effective if you do not know how to use it properly unless of course somehow insurance pays out more than the shipfittingsinsurance costs

fine then the market value bottoms out at value x anyone but a moron will not go under value x as this cost is barely a  above cost now you have sales queues stacked on top of each other how do you determine whos items get purchased is this who placed the order first based skill based what if all the sellers have the skill to 5 if you say this will not happen i ask you to recall one of the first lessons you learn in life other people are idiotswith 01 isk wars i still manage to sell my goods despite only manipulating my orders once or twice a week barring a high volitility market like jita this whole proposal is a solution to a nonproblem in my book or maybe you didnt make your case properly im not sure maybe i dont see this as a large enough issue to validate changing everyones game play experience
now this is only possible for two reasons first if the product is in vast oversupply  in this situation the market will fall to the level of production cost no matter what granted it will fall quicker if my suggestion is adopted but in current system pennying can only delay the process so long second possible reason if the market is unhealthy and cant rapidly react to changes in supplydemand and that is precisley what my suggestion would improve oversupply situation the price can easily fall to production cost in a hours notice even below if sellers some of them not producers but speulators panic or just bail out to move their money to a greener pasture but prices can skyrocket for the same reasons placing huge extra profit into the producers pockets in the system that i have in mind momentary supplydemand plays bigger role than today and production cost counts to a lesser extend what production cost anyway raw material and semifinsihed goods prices will also fluctuate yes thats precisely the rule employed by orderbookbased exchanges worldwide anyway eve also has a timebased precedence rule to prioritize orders that are on the same price level so no need to reinvent the wheel here either however i suspect that in eve the order with the less time remainig to expiration stands first in line i am not solving a problem rather proposing to adapt an idea based on seeing how well it works in rl that i think will make the game better and more exciting also i hope other regions will have thriving and volatile markets then agree its not a large issue but the consequences for the average palyer are commensurately modest as well however for ppl playing around the markets new dimensions will open or at least so i hope
well im going to disagree based on your original principle and not just the 001 isk warswho would want to do that um i would yeah i would ask for a discount to 47k and the seller would respond by offering me 47750 and i would counter with 47640 or something happens all the timeand yes paychecks often get paid in ridiculous amounts like 542379 dollars you would tell your friends that you made 5500 if you care to talk to them about your salary but the truth is differentever buy gas i dont know if you can say 001 any better than that but walmart does they cut their prices from 108999 other store to 108978 walmart it happens and it works on somebut on your original idea a sufficiently round number well what makes it sufficient some might buy and sell out to 5 or 6 significant digits because that counts to them who gets to say at what point it no longer matters if inflation continues in eve and you are selling something in the tens of billions does the million spot no longer matter i would think millions still dothe reason why this might be more important in eve than the real world is because in eve you are selling the exact same item in the real world you can convince people to buy from you because of your charming personality or some kind of guarantee or because you keep flowers in your shop window the only way to stay on top of an order in eve is by small tweaks in the order so you come out on top
ok so i proposed a way to solve factiont2 crystal issuesbut it was not very popular because of the random natureso heres another solution based on crystals shattering that removes the randomnessreplace the damaged attribute on crystals with a hidden attribute on the player himselfthis will be a counter that gets reduced as a player fires his laserswhen the counter reaches 0 a crystal is destroyed and the process starts againto the player this will look like crystals shattering occasionaly during usecrystals would only shatter occasionally and never all at the same timedetailplayer has an attribute called crystalpop  this is server only and not visible to player player starts of with a crystalpop of 1000  1000 used for example only 1 player fires lasers2 if a factiont2 crystal is fitted in the laser then 3 crystalpop  crystalpop   damagesetamount  damagevolatility   groupsize4 if crystalpop  0 then 5 consume one crystal  if a spare crystal of the same type is in the cargo hold then the consumed cystal is taken from there   if there are no spare crystals  then the group is reduced by 1   if the group size becomes 0 then the weapon shuts down 6 reset crystalpop  1000 crystals will get consumed at a steady rate as they do atmprosall crystals will be brand newall crystals will be stackableships with faction crystals will be contractable  because there will be no damaged crystals unwanted  looted  crystals will be resaleable on the marketall issues related to damaged crystals go awayconplayer will have to carry 1 spare crystal minimum

this idea i think is much better i would support this ideaone problem i see with this is and i havent worked out any math but wouldnt this increase the supply of crystals on the market since they cant be destroyed except when ship goes poof and people will resell therefore price would crash not sure if this matters much just throwing it out there crystals become more of a module that is destroyed once and a while than ammo that is used although cant you reprocess damaged crystals to get all the minerals back anyways i thought i read somewhere that you canbut yeah much improvement on the idea
dont double postquote your original post then edit it with your new ideaps it still wont work with weapon grouping during a fight do you want to ungroup your guns and find the one that is broken replce it and regroup them still not supported second time around
this way people who thumbed up in another post arent supporting what essentially is a completely different approach to the matter where we can support the topic a new thread makes senseps with weapon grouping it can work the same as missiles and ammo recharge do a replacement of the same kind automatically being taken from the hold if a replacement exists if non exists well how does that work for other ammo types i dont see that as a prevention of this idea
ok i never thought about the support button i do beleave you can unsupport need to try at some piontyeah if you reload the whole rack that alot of isk to carry around in cargo hold8 guns  8mill  1mill for cystal guess  8 spare crystals  16mill isk in ammo not that i would mind the kills mails on that but thats alot of isk just in ammo
yeah just inconvenientimpossible to make everyone to do thatexcept with this idea it only happens every so often for the player not for each crystal it could be modified so that it happens rarely enough that you should only need to carry one spare crystal maybe two for an especially long battle or something
what happens now if you use grouped weaons with crystals with different damage levelsi never live long enough to find out what happens when a crystal pops i would support the popped crystal being taken directly from the cargo hold if spares are availableguns would keep firing without interuptionedited op with crystal consumed from hold 
except the fact that it is 1 realtime and live2 interactivewhich is quite an improvement in my eyesi agree that these days the only option is youtube but for the next at im not a programmer thats true but the more i think about this the more i think its not that hard to implement the client already contains almost everything for it the rendering engine the ships outlook data and also the window thats capable of showing a new layer of 3d visuals that is look at in show infobut for the devs luck it seems that theres simply no need for it d
please give me 10 billion powergrid and 10 billion cpu for every ship that way i wont have to think about my fit
youre going to have to be far far more specific to save this thread from the rolfires of lolhell pg issues nighthawk definitely drake onyx hardly
ill add another to your list rokh that thing is ridiculously easy to fit try fitting amarr ships and discover the real need for fitting mods and as to the nighthawk i have no experience with it but it sure seems popular and there are no lack of sellers and buyers of it and whats all this about using it to tank level 5s must be indicative of it having insurmountable fitting problems oh maybe it could easily flip to quite overpowered if buffed but i wanna peeveepee wit itwhy are there so many caldari flying crybabies not at you gypsio at the op
nighthawk suffers when trying to fit a gang link heavy assault missiles ya know the close range high damage pvp ones mwd and tank other command ships can fairly easily fit the above only with specific weapons of coursewhen it comes to passive tank  heavy missiles the nh is a fine ship other then that caldari is pretty much fine
the nighthawk doesnt have any fitting problems when used for carebearing but for pvp it needs a gang mod and mwd and with hmls it just doesnt have the pg not even for a basic singlelse buffer tank dont even think about active or a dual lse buffer the great thing is that adding pg wont affect the pve capabilities because the carebears have no use for more pg on their passive bricks but tbh all the field cs need to be redone the nh isnt alone in having unnecessary fitting problems
id trade 10 cpu for 10 pg on ferox and eagle any day maybe even 15if you need more then 1 rcuacr to fit something is obviously wrong
just because you cant fit all neutrons
the problem is that they are mostly hard to fit compared to other ships when it comes down to pvpmy believe is that this is mainly due to the fact that caldari already has high demand for pg due to the shield mods and launchers couple with that the ew mods also have a high demand for pg caldari ships run into trouble fasthowever this topic holds no solution or idea whatsoever except a demand without argumentation therefore no support
are you serious i think you are have you much experience with other races ships i have experience with them all and caldari ships are possibly the least difficult to fit sorry you cant have your ridiculous passive shield regen point and web range speed and damage all in one bundle learn to sacrifice some tank and range ability if you want to do high damage and tackle
just because i cant make a fit with all 250s or even 200s without powergrid mods and have 100 cpu left unused after fitting wtf is with this cpu am i supposed to fit cloak in spare highthe problem with those is they seem to have pgcpu balanced like a missile boat with more cpu and less grid
you mean the way it cant even fit a rack of 425s and nothing else
actually i am what seems to stand out is that caldari ships are low on pg and consume high amount of pg which is what my post was about especially in pvp fits take a drake for example i for one dont fit it with as huge as possible tank but max out on damage mods and ew and it tends to run into a heap load of trouble because the little tank i have is also consuming loads of pg especially with 7 heavy launchers this is going to be a tight fit i can name a few others but i wont start a whole list herethere are a few ships of each race which tend to stand out due to fitting issues but i know none so many as the caldari ship lineupwith my experience as mainly a minmatar first and caldari second pilot i have run into less trouble with my minmatar pvp fits than with my caldari pvp fits

supporti cant quite see any normal player needing to open a new topic more than every 10 minutes so wouldnt affect normal forum functions if its not a bot the person doing it is going to get real bored real fast always a plusalso wouldnt an ip ban or even batter a mac ban be a reasonable solution to caught isk sellers i say sellers because i know a friend in wow whos account was hacked and used for gold spamming by the hacker
agreed for legitimate posters its a price worth paying i thinkben
the mack is a great ship for mining ice however its cargo capacity w two large cargohold expansion i rigs is only 7935 m3 this unfortunately is 65 m3 less than the 8000 which would be required to store two ice mining duration cycles mack pilots are faced with the choice of returning to station with 4 cubes after one cycle or waiting for the second cycle and seeing one of the next 4 cubes disappear in space because the cargohold is full putting an expanded cargo module in a low slot solves the space problem but at the high cost of not having an ice harvester upgrade in the slotsimple fix increase the base mackinaw cargo attribute from 6000 m3 to 6100 m3 this would be in keeping with similar recent increases for the orca and some of the capital shipsglobal enhancement add a new skill to either industry or trade  cargo management prerequisites industry v and trade v attribute 5 increase in cargohold capacity for all shipsthanks for your consideration  fly safe
ill leave it up to csmccp to decide whether to do this it might make sense butyou could instead fit two cargohold optimization ii rigs andor two expanded cargohold iis which would bring your total cargo hold space up to 14045 not bad now you can do three cycles instead of the one for your fitedit yes you may have to give up some upgrades or armor resists or something for those low slots but eve is all about choices and the consequences which do you value more your current low slots or increased cargo spaceas for cargo management skill which increases cargohold capacity for all ships im going to suggest a no to that this would unbalance existing industrial transport freighter ships as well as give missionsalvage boats more room for loot and all ships more room for ammo and other mining ships more room for ore
i think ive seen somewhere that such a skill existed at one time but was either never released or removed from the game macks dont need more cargo space you just need to not mine alone or afk
yes eve is all about choices here is one where less than 100 m3 would make a huge difference in the performance of a specialty ship probably the 6000 m3 was an arbitrary number ccp has changed the orca and the capital ships fuel why not a minor tweak to the mackinaw
reduce base cargo to 1000m3 add 8000m3 ice bay and optionally allow people to mine directly into the ice bay
basic reason not to support this idea you will get plenty of amarr players changing races or quitting the game because their crystal shatters on the first tryrandom number generators or chance is a funny thing even if the chance is 11000 you could still buy 1000 crystals and have them all break on your first use the average is not your average its the average of every crystal used in the game of course someone else will buy 1000 crystals and end up never having them break such is the nature of chancefor invention this might be fine as the end result that really matters is overall supply and if you have a bad streak of luck you can make some money missioning or producing or something for something like pvp if i were amarr i wouldnt find this acceptable to rely on
i posted an improved solution which does not involve randomness it should still be on the first page but could do with some support
this who the hell counts the number of shots they make in order to figure out oh my lucks running out better get more spares as an amarr pilot any other pilot can see exactly how many shots they have left also with 78 weapons each with a 11000 chance of breaking youre down to 1200 chance so a crystal that costs more than 1k of hybrid ammo can break on the first shot or will very likely not live to fire 200 times im thinking this is a stealth nerf to amarr more than anythingand i dont even fly amarr ships
deal with it minmatar have to carry ammo 1000 rounds of medium barrage 250k to 400k deppending where you are battling a bs in my vaga can take 10002500rounds so amarr having to carry ammo and reloading during battle welcome to wonderfull of minmatar pvp
read the thread before posting dav wasnt complaining about having to carry spares this thread was his idea he was just pointing out the pros and cons and having to carry spares would be a con even though he doesnt consider it a very large con
my moros uses guristas or shadow antimatter xl depending on what i have in my hangarlooks like youll have to find a supply of blood or sansha multispecs wont youhave a good dayps try jita
you do realize it takes billions of isk in skillbooks and almost a year to train a titan parking altright i dont fly one but i dont like that so many pilots are just trapped in their ships simply because metagaming keeps them from using other methods
not supported its a players choice to fly in one or not supercaps can turn the tide of battles so not giving them safe haven is an acceptable drawback
metagaming is up to them their choice to stay in their titan nondocking is the designed drawback to titansthis channel should be for making suggestions for the game to run bettersmoother not to get around designed balances so not supported
supported for ending that terrible anoyance

heyive posted an idea to the features and ideas discussion forum regarding the use of live events to introduce changes to eve such as new tech being introduced i was hoping for some feedback but that forum moves a mile a minute and overnight its dropped to page 3 without a single reply and even ideas on that forum which get dev attention have consistently resulted in absolutely nothing being implemented id like to know what the csms positions are on this concept and whether or not its something that should be pushed for the thread is below
i think the icons representing bpos and bpcs should be improved there should a color difference or include bpo or bpc in the name so that it can be easily and quickly identified as such so that players with hundreds of bpos and bpcs dont have to waste all that time figuring out whether the icon is bpo or bpcfont size is a huge problem in eve it is hard even for people who has great eye sight like myself to read anything on eve font size should be able to go up to 20pt for everythingnot just chat windowsicons such as the character sheet eve mail etc all should minimized to their icon instead of the bottom of the screenchat interface should be changed to where you press enter to type in the channel that youre on so this way all keys on the keyboard can be used as hotkeys instead of having to use shift ctrl or alti think that was the dumbest idea ever
sounds right to me still supported

i agree with the op the kin damage bonus really is inferior to what other races get
you keep saying the same thing over and over your brain doesnt seem to be able to process the logicmy zealot can only do em and thermal unless i stick autocannons on it and then i dont receive any bonusesyour raven can do emthermkinexp damage equally across the board even the cerberus can do decent dps doing non racial damage have you ever tried putting lasers on a vaga

aye it was a nerf to far 75 with maxed skills seems about right
not supportedthe mine  build  insure  pop  isk thing is a problem but you are creating a lot of other negative effects in trying to deal with it in the way that you arealso the minerals  isk conversion via ensurance is not all that bad it helps set a price floor for minerals
i could address your examples like saying that 47640 is just a bit less round as i like 4 digits of value rather than 3 or a 542379mo salary is probably resulted from a combination of a negotiated originally round yearly salary having been divided by 12 undergone some percentbased raises and bracketbased taxation thogh the walmart example really baffles me the main question here is whether based on your experience you feel like these cases are rare exceptions or a general rule my experience suggests the former however if you feel the latter is true i cant argue with that and respect it as a valid reason for your voting against my proposalit is never easy to draw a boundary but that is no reason to go limitless anyway the current fixed 001 precision limit is just such a boundary only it is drawn not where i think it should bebased on the contributions made to this topic those who supported my idea either did not critize the 3 digits of value rule or suggested just a bit more 4 digits it seems at least so far that a compromise would not be difficult to achievejust on historical note in our country we had a massive inflation after ww ii the currency pengo practically entirely lost its value during this process first milpengo notes were printed in which name mil standsfor millions and later bilpengo notes the word billion menas 1012 here and then nobody cared for millions any longer or for those bank notes anyway as the paper they were printed on had more worth than the money i can not agree because eve market system is both in purpose and implementation the replica of an rl orderbookbased commodity exchange not any arbitrary kind of business conducted in rl in general when trading on a rl exchange you are trading just the same item and naturally only the price matters these exchanges almost without exception do have tick rules and it works for them
so pretty much the current system only you cant tell how damaged it is stupid and the crystal always remains packaged good sure at least its not as stupid as the other ideas youve had
nvm misread a very importent point in the idea
no support for caldari nerf them if anything
what should be specified is that most caldari gunships are almost impossible to fit within pg rokh ferox eagle ect all struggle to fit a full rack of guns never mind fitting a full rack of guns and a mwd utility highs are pretty much impossible to use perhaps the most glaring example of this is the eagle even with all level 5 skills the eagle is short over 100 pg with a rack of t2 guns and the 10mn digital boosters the cheapest mwd in the game this is even more ridiculous considering the general lack of low slots on caldari shipsjust to give a comparison to its counterparts at level 5 skillsmuninn 1450pg 5 lowszealot 1475pg 7 lowsdeimos 1237pg 6 lowseagle 1093pg 4 lowsso yeah i support some more grid for caldari railboats at the least
umm you know you can fit a full rack of 425s and doomsday tank a rokh without rigs and still hit further and harder than most others id say its pretty ok
neutron blasters its a railgun platform and it needs two grid mods in order to fit 250mm rails id say it needs some 3
blaster ferox is a nice solo ship

do you fly a frig in your fleet if the orders are to bring a battleship or logistic cruiserthe point is that todays pvp is very costly thus requires people to plan their isk loss in advance thus insurance helps you to prevent going bankrupt to fastalso i think the buildcost of ships is not determined by insurance but by material pricesa bs wont cost 5 mil overnight just because theres no insurance anymore dont you think so
im for insurance reform certainly no insurance for concord caused losses would like to see premiums based on frequency of lost ships like rl so the insurance mineral price ceiling is less predictable
that would be in keeping with the changes to the orca and other ships mack is a specialty ice ship so he gets an ore bay sized to ice good idea
i dont see any problemme hugs his t2 cargo rigs
mack is a mining ship with mining bonus and 2 ice mining bonus not a ice mining only shipif you substantially remove the mining roles nerfing the cargo space into oblivion you are making a 15 yield in ore mining useless btw with kazuo suggestion mining in the ice bay should not be optional but a automatic feature as the main bay will be incapable of accepting even 1 cycle by one of the ice harvesters in a mack 1 cycle produce 2 1000 m3 ice cubes of 1 cycle by one stripminer the initial suggestion of increasing the main bay to 6100 m3 seem the more sensible one and so i support that suggestion
i like the idea of a dedicated ore bay in the mack however it should not be for ice only as the mack can be used for mining other than ice probably nerfing the regular cargo bay would be a good way to balance the change but not too smallwould support the original suggestion to add 100 m3 to the existing configuration simple and straightforward could probably be done in a routine patch
an oreice bay would be reasonable i suppose its not as if all the ice would melt
changing the base cargo capacity from 6000 to 6100 m3 is probably updating one attribute in the mackinaw object should not be a big deal dedicate ore bays would be nice but that might take a lot of time and effort go with 6100 and declare victory
covert jump portal generator uses 1500 power that is 10 of the total amount of power availeble on a black op black ops would be much better to fit if it should get a bonus on this mod lets give it a bonus that reduces the power output by 999
ummwhy its pg requirements arent that bad considering mega pulses or other related weapons take up far more pg space no support for an issue that doesnt existisaac
probably already mentionworst idea ever but whateverin real life when you keep getting your car trashed over and over what happens the rate goes uphow about scaling insurance or something based on how ofter you lose your ships if you keep cashing in on insurance left and right the rate goes up and if not then it goes downi am sure there would be more to it to make it work well but would badflame on
honestly why how things work in real life isnt a reason to do anything in a game you need to provide an actual argument with reasoning why this should be included in the game
especially since there are several other threads about this topic already including at least one on the first page of the assembly hallplease learn to read for comprehension not just speed
i like the idea so long as with the allowance of docking supercaps in this manner you actually lose the ability to control who can dock at the stationso you gain the ability to dock supercaps more or less safely but you lose the ability to control who can dock which open ups worlds of lame for docking games which given visual confirmation of supercaps add in the future changes of sov very cool

the following changes should be done to streamline the interface1 customiseable position and size2 split inflicted and incurred damage currently you cant really see anything in situations larger then 1vs13 messages should be made shorter and simplifiedi think these changes would make the notifications useable and not something randomly popping up on your screen without a chance to read itregards rino
i agree the damage notifications need to be looked at as currently nothing can really be read without going back after the fight and reviewing the logs also does anyone think it would be a good idea to add on incurred damage the type of damage taken

no ac falloff is already twice as much as blasters and pulses a 20 increase to dps is probably needed thoughfixed and yesno ccp must have been on drugs when they created the ammo for minmatar ammo mixing it with this will only make it worseinstead ccp need to recreate minmatar ammo from scratchfixed and yes as for the rest i disagreeare you high i dont even know where to begin with this one the 66 dps bonus already makes this ship a beast and you want to make it better than a tier 3 battleshipi dont know enough about the muninn to saythe phoon is arguably the best tier 1 vessel in the game for the sake of versatility it doesnt need any changes imo
please limit discussion on this issue to the ships and modules thread that is currently running at 32 pages nowin addition here are some following pointstempest even ccp has acknowledged that the ship is no longer viable if you cant see that yourself you have no business making any posts about solutions to any minmatar issue the ships and modules thread goes into great detail why the tempest does not measure up to even tier 2 damage dealing ships please read itmuninn see suggestion above or make a new threadtyphoon there is another thread on ships and modules on this very subject again please read it and make your points there

support this all the way soloi have flown a rapier alot and true with some fancy flying and good skills you can damp a cruiser stay out of range with webs and shoot him with artys but your dps is  so unless he is plated you most likely wont get the killfleet taking of damps and fitting more webs and shield extender or plates mwd ext ext still leaves you having to concentrate on one maybe maybe 2 ships depending on targets and having the worst survivability of all the reconsi would like to maybe see some sort of bonus to its tanking ability ie extra mid or low for plate or shield extender pg bonus as well would be nice

did you read the op at all
yes i did i only misread the part where to store the info my apologies for thiswell i still see some issues extra dataok minor with only one atribute but not any player uses lasers you will need a spare crystal any time since the damage carryies over between ships you will lose more isk in pvp with it since you lose 1 crystal any 10 minutes instead 5 after 50 minutes  if you lose your ship after 40 minutes firing you allrady had to burn thrue 4 crystals in the corrent scenario you are still with your first set of crystals  you could fire some shots with a s crystal to prevent your xl crystal from getting destroyedok comedy issue since the price diffrence between scorch and faction amno isnUFFFDt this big no real issueon the code level you could simply destroy the crystal in the gun after firing if the value hits zero then reset it since there are no unrepacked crystals any more you could even use the block standard reloading like other weaons do while ungroupedif the gun runs out of amno it realoads automaticly with the same amno type if it is stored in the cargo what isnUFFFDt possible with unrepacked amno atmoverall a ok idea even if it has some minor drawbacks in pvpsuported
you can unload and reload when that happens no need to ungroup and regroup i like this idea a bit better then the other one
frankly no the shatter chance idea was far better than this one  hidden information about your ammo state is silly and the random chance whining was only because most people dont understand statistics worth a damn this is harder on the server than your first proposal conveys even less information to the player than the status quo and is farther removed from your original purpose no support

tradeable kill rights sure does sound interestingthat would be a better version of a bounty hunter if you could hire someone to kill someone via trading your kill rights through eve contracts they bring the corpse back to you and keep the loot etc implementing this skill you are talking about as well so you have to train for bounty hunter rather than having someone on 10 racking up all the killsanother question does killing people with bounties give you a security boost
the op is just wrong wrong wrong not all of us have all day to make isk we have real jobs t1 ships should be cheap to fly and to lose t2 is where its at anyways
i think insurance is a good ideawithout such insurance payouts if you were to pvp murder someone in cold blood the chances of them making another attempt is significantly less therefore less pvp will occur because carebears like myself will refuse to participate due to the huge isk loss possibly running myself and others into the ground
technically someone once payed for it so the gametime itself isnt actually free
i agree with this the plex is bought and owned by the character making the conversion if you need to sell one somewhere you cant get to use one of the spare character slots on your account and send him to jita or wherever convert sell give isk to main chari personally tend to sell within my alliance and ask where the buyer wants the plex flying around isnt that bad of a thing to do as shuttles and interceptors are fast besides why risk transporting it and loosing it when you can fly to your destination then convert it
there are no real legal issues i can see developing an individual has not bought gametime when he buys a plexhe has bought an in game item that can be exchanged for gametime as can gtc as can anything with an isk value in evea plex really only represents its isk value as much as gametimeif someone blows up a freighter carrying faction bs and sells them they can buy gamtime with the iskthere is absolutely no functional difference if someone were to blow up a hauler full of plexallow people to transport plex give piracy a boost ffs its about damn time for one
agree to thisplex market is really strange  look at the price at jita then look on other system you can see a 50m difference sometimesa way to transport then is neededotherwise the day people will stop gambling on them the price will fall a lotand i dont think ccp will appreciate a little price for this 
what you do with an ingame item should be your choiceif you choose to buy 50 of them undock and jet them all in a can and then shoot them then that should be your choice
armor resistance is currently 10253550 plus 10 toward the racial opposites damage type however shields have an unconditional 0204050 resistance as a base on all ships not including bonuses i would like to see shields having the same base resistance model as armor this would be either10204050  10 where appropriateor10253550  10 where appropriatethat is all flame on
why not supported
to make shield tanks more popular in pvpsupport
not supported
only if you give armour tanks a 30 across the board resist mods aswell like shields have
in your own words why are you somehow suggesting the 20 base resistance deficit for shields is a good thingyou can have your capcpu hungry omnitank active mods too if shields can have the notsocapcpu hungry passive omnitank mods
shields have natural recharge armor doest not hence the more resistance to equal it outnot supported
fixed
since the best argument youve yet to offer is i dont think its right not supported
look at the tournament small gang pvp shield tanks and caldari ships are dominant along with ecm and before someone says but those shield tankers dont need to fit a point there are dedicated tackle ships being used this year because the scrams can stop mwdingnot supported shields regen armor doesnt and for the person that said armor repping is more efficient yes but it does not rep as much raw damage per cycle as a shield booster shield transfers are preferred for small fast engagements remote armor preferred for larger fleet battles the two tanking types are different and they are relatively balanced in dissimilar ways
shield tanks are unpopular in pvp for two reasons 1 missiles are bad and the number of gunarmor ships in fleet far outweighs the gunshield ships in practice because of that titan command ship rr and other such fleet structures push people to armor over shield 2 mid slots are more valuable than low slots  ew sensor boosters tracking computers abmwd cap injectors and tackle all take up mid slots as opposed to just fitting and damage mods in the lows and aside from ecm ships theres virtually nothing that has more than 1 extra mid compared to its lows in terms of raw numbers shield tanks routinely outperform armor tanks at burst tanks and are on par for sustained the problem is its almost impossible to actually make use of that in a practical setup for 80 of pvp roles until you fix that resist changes wont make a difference  shields already have an advantage there anyways because invuln  eanm

its a legacy workaround which shouldnt be necessary a suggested replacement is a sessionchange icon that persists for as long as the session change needs to complete with no mistakesthis timer takes little chunks of time from you continually in absurd places like switching positions in a fleet often leaving you stranded on the wrong side of a gate or when switching ships you have no intention of undocking in an unoccupied system in the quiet and cold reaches of 00depending upon your play style and a conservative estimate of how much time is actually wasted on the timer compared to the actual session change ie 30 seconds wait 15 seconds of clientserver activity you could be looking at spending almost 1 hour out of 10 waiting unnecessarilythere are some chunks of text floating around somewhere explaining the reasoning behind the timer with regards to stuck petitions but with the recent supposed fix to desync it seems like a good moment to slot this in as a measurable target for the dev team a box to tick as it werefor those that dont know the current explanation is that without the session timer people were getting stuck and the gms had to free them the session timer allows the clientserver to interact until some unknown process finishes its calls safely thus preventing any race conditions from occurringhowever its quite unnecessary since a modicum lmao ccp wordfilterof good coding puts error checking in place and the amateurish workaround of relying on an arbitrary timer would go awayive also seen several people argue that there are gameplay implications to these timers but thats mainly because people have gotten used to them and since the change would apply to everyone equally the pubbie motto of adapt or die seems apt for setting aside this irrelevant worryso vote yes and get back that wasted time
i have to support this if it goes through it will cause sooooo many lolhighsecstationcamper tears i think ill have enough to fuel my pos for years to cometwo thumbs up
ship switching clone jumping are both affected negatively by this id like that reduced as much as possibleits not like ccp doesnt know its cumbersome they know its required but even if we can shave of 10 seconds it would be helpfull
session change timers feel like an artificial limit hacked into place to make someones job a bit easier maybe im wrong about his and theyre still needed but its certainly something worth asking ccp for
its a role that is sorely missed in my opinion would add a lot of diversity to frigate gangs and be a lot of fun for everyone
on 90 of game virtual or real no one want this roleand i dont think its usefull on a frigate sized gangnot sure its a good idea 
then dont fly it no reason to limit other peoples choices based on your lack of imagination
bss have 2 tiers hacs got 2 tiers command ships has 2 tierswhy not black opsi can imagine a black op that would cost around 15 billion to build and has more abillities it has the same race abilities but the black op is boosted a bit more to get inline with its 15b build costs it would be able too make a jump portal that is twice the lenght and it would be able to use covert cloaka new shiny toy too play with
its probably along the lines of why giant secure containers are 3900m3 so that ice miners cant just sit on their backside watching tv or browsing the internetshowever i support your idea i may as well just a hulk as i wont have to move
i am one of vics mining partners so am obviouly affected by this situation as are most of the people responding to the thread else you guys would not bother even reading if roberts rules of order were in effect i could call for the question in the current situation since current opinion seems to be mostly favorable how do we get things movingthanksfly safe
i dislike the proposal for a dedicated ore bay  feels too much like trying to remove the ability to increase your cargo space  but the original 6100 m3 proposal makes perfect sense let the mack do its role better
four ships can fit this module all four of them were designed to fit this module and have their fitting levels calculated for fits including this module i see no good reason to ask for this yes black ops cant fit everything at once theyre not supposed to be able to just like every other ship
your math sucks 8 guns at 11000 is 1125 7 is 1143 its only 1200 at 5 guns and a crystal that costs a little over 1000x as much as hybrid ammo will not very likely fail on the first 200 thats actually rather unlikely one shot out of the first 125 volleys yes but that uses 1000 rounds of hybrid ammo not 125 like you seem to be implying remember its not a full reload when a crystal breaks its a single new crystal used just like its 1000 total rounds used in the same number of volleys of hybrid and no its not a stealth nerf at all except for applications where a ship wont ever live to fire a lot of volleyseg suicide ganks but suicide ships maybe wanting to carry an extra crystal wont exactly cause me to weep and given that it dramatically clarifies the pilots ammo situationan issue you specifically identify  status quo amarr pilots have no idea of their ammo situation under this proposal they would know exactly and it greatly simplifies logistics of ammo by allowing used crystals to be traded by means other than a station trade for the average amarr pilot i think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages
i always carry some spare crystals in my amarr ships anyways so yes
1 carry spares crystals are tiny bringing 50 mostlydead ones into battle shouldnt inconvenience you too much 2 if you want to propose an actual game mechanics change the crystal shatter chance thread seems a better bet than crystal merging
yes
do want
do it
hell yeah check boxes
i started my own thread on this idea in case anyone decided to give it a thumbs up cant exactly have thumbs up reguarding my idea in someone elses threadplease learn the forum mechanics even if eveo forums suck
simple enough change the standing system to allow only five 10 slots and five 5 slotsthere is just too much aggression and hate in the universei have had friends who were picked on in jita for not being smart enough nanoed enough rich enough ranged enough bobkenny enough fotm enough skilled enoughor just notenoughi just dont understand why people have to be so cruel to one another like scramming a pod for hours and hours in wormspace just because i wanted to mine why cant we live and let live
because this is a game where people beat up other people with internet spaceships
ill support this if you pay me 5 billion isk
probably just trolling this
although i really dont know what needs to be done projectiles need a boost badly
not supported as proposed however i would support an anchored supercap with a stront bay for manual reinforced mode that would last a week before the anchor expires

great idea
at first i was highly annoyed with this change as i had been in wormholes before i moved to 00 and i realized what kind of nerf this was then i went and watched a certain pvp movie and realized why this was nerfed said movie showed first a rifter and then a typhoon engaging in some very interesting lownullsec combats i realized though that as they moved in to attack a player the person controlling the ship would be constantly jamming the button to scan almost nonstop this to me seemed like the reason ccp nerfed it i can imagine there would be some serverbased performance issues with someone constantly jamming said button to scan the area also it puts in a tad more risk to those who attack targets just as much as those who are getting attacked is this nerf too much maybedid ccp need to nerf the constant hitting of the scan button yesdid ccp need to make a stupid message that annoys the crap out of anyone nowill this affect me no since i didnt hit the button every 001secsshould it be unnerfed slightly again maybe it seems that ccp has decided it should be 2 seconds im more of the opinion it should be 1015 seconds per calibration thus no support for this isaac

not so minor people use crystals in stripminers tooso what will we get2 different minor attributes mining laser crystals usage and combat laser crystals usage1 single attribute mixing the twohow often will it be checked once every time the laserstripminer activatedont seem so minor especially if it require more steps that the current weapon activation and checks for crystal damagewhat happen when you use a empty stripminer ii not efficient but you can run a stripminer ii without a crystal in the laserit seem prone to problems
got a coupe of questions for youwhat happens to your timer when you change crystals from one type to another because if it resets ill be swapping crystals regularly what happens if i have a high crystalpop value and change from a bs to a frigate does my small lazer get a high pop to begin witheven funnier what happens when i change from my miner with t2 mining crystals to my bs with faction crystalsand what happens if i exchange a t2 crystal for a normal t1 crystalthis is a can of worms better shut and bury it
it is actualy not it is even a lot more simple as you think the damage simply carries over if you switch the ship or crystalthis is why it is mentioned in the op you need spares even if it looks bizare doesnUFFFDt matter this much in a bigger picture for faction amno any 4k shoots you lose a crystal no matter of size or ship you are in at this point since you canUFFFDt see this value you cant exploid itand the price diffrence is not this big that this would make a lot of sence to beginn with t1 crystals donUFFFDt got the atribute that discribes the damage to them so they canUFFFDt affect the value
i see no big issue to using the same value for bothsince any crystal atm takes damage seperatly the checks are done atm to there is no change in the needet calculations you simply merge all the seperate stats into one and remove the crystal that caused the value to drop to zero all what changes is that you lose the crystals linear one by one instead all at once if the reached her capacity so basicly you need to replace one crystal every 3h for mining instead 3 after 9 hours the t1 crystals or no crystal use would cause no change to the value at all since the atribute that describes the damage a crystal would take is on the crystal and missing on t1 crystalsor zero this is why they donUFFFDt break
can we develop new technology to scan out cloaked ships with tachyon probes
after years of playing eve this needs to be addressed this game has been out long enough for this to be changedrecently we engaged a guy sitting outside a station we got him down to almost no armor 6 people from his corp joined the battle immediately after logging in the reinforcements instant logon fighters saved the raven by jamming our ships and forcing me and a friend to retreatin eve the strategy is about assessing the situation to determine whether or not you can defeat the enemy with the given intel which the game provides i determined that we could kill the raven and i was correct until his buddies logged on and joined in the battle and changed the entire situation that is unrealistic and ill thought outto prevent this unrealistic strategy the following should be consideredupon logging in there should be a stasis period for your ships targeting systems and weapons systems a period of time which would prevent people from logging on and joining a battle the people who are logged on are basing their judgment on the current situation and deciding to engage on that information creating a stasis would prevent the log on fighters from manipulating the game this is not part of the strategy the game was designed forreinforcementsits understandable to expect reinforcements but to have an army log on and instantly appear all around you and fighting you instantly makes no sense at all if anyone has any other helpful solutions please post them
i can think of a fight or 2 if that was active then i would be able to kill that mofo yeah i support it since it makes lots of sense to me anyway
while logon traps are not a method ive used with any frequency i see no reason why they shouldnt be a valid strategy if someone really has the coordination to pull one off effectively then good on them for working as a team part of eve is knowing who youre fighting and if theyre the type to try a logon trap then you need to factor that into your strategy and not just go in gungho and try to gank their ravens
no strategy is foolproof and reinforcements is a valid tactic there are no guarantees in eve nothing says two battleships must defeat one variables are what makes the game fun for long time players
at this time it is a part of the game and any smart corp would keep that in considerationlog on traps are not realistic and manipulate the foundational strategy of the game a stasis period would simply force battles to be more realistic and embrace the overall strategy aspects
reinforcements are of course realistic and should be part of any game perfection is a life long goal my friend and this is just one issue which would step eve that much closer to a simulated battle which doesnt consist of log on instant reinforcements variables are welcomed in a battle that is what the strategy plans are created for you plan for contingencies the issue here is when you create a plan of attack based on a current intel and it is manipulated by ships being added instantly due to being able to jump into the game with no stasisstasis period should be embraced to create a more realistic simulated experience
while were at it should we put rpgs on our ships and use steel armor eve isnt exactly based on reality again if this was something that was legitimately broken about it youd have my interest but the fact is its a part of the game if you get tricked by a login trap then so be it you lose a ship and buy a new one ive come damn close to losing ships to login traps on multiple occasions and you dont see me complaining
its odd really most pvpers seem to be gungho about removing local which would make traps of this nature far more common and far easier  you wouldnt even have to log off just get off grid and align for that matter most pvpers fly in 00 where a single high slot on a frigate can spawn a couple hundred dreadnoughts and frequently does and yet here we have a pvper who claims that traps are unrealistic immoral and should be nerfbatted at the end of the day traps will exist and traps should exist this particular mechanism for a trap is unrealistic but plenty of realistic mechanisms for traps are impossible because of gameplay issues balance  realism and given the limits of the tactic id say its pretty balanced no support
your suggestion wouldnt prevent this kind of traps it would just delay them and as herschel mentioned with the wh style local you wouldnt even notice that
that is the pointinstant log in trap is not supposed to be part of the game it is something that people discovered and manipulate part of the game it is unfortunately however i dont think the devs intended for it which deems not a functionpure and simple a delay is exactly the point a stasis period that creates a realistic combat scenario yes this is a game and the goal is to simulate as close to reality as possiblei hope the devs take a good look into this that is the purpose of this posta stasis delay would reinforce the strategy aspect of this game and allow the people who actually plan their attack based on the enemies who are logged in not the hundreds of other people who might log in
you missed a point right there when you remove local you still see them in your address book and if your not sure where they are cause local is gone let say they you still got the agent locator which should help you alotwhat hes asking for is a simple delay in loging on i could say 30 seconds or so which could give time to finish what he was doing in the first place this is just to give a fair balance log on traps will always exists if you ask meagain read it one more time hes not asking to prevent it just delaying the log on which should in turn give a bit of a fair advantage as some other said which i cant remember whoit might be called complaining but its still argumentative for the simple fact that lots of battle could of been won or saved because of the log on trapin short i find the log on trap unfair
not really most caldari ships can fill their lows with damage mods and have t2 weaponry at least if you have awu 5 and that skill has to count for somethinghowever there are certanly some caldari ships that do need some extra pg the craptor comes to mind perhaps even the nighthawk but the rokh and eagle is not one of those that suffer from pg shortage
if by full t2 250mm snipe fit you mean fit with no hint on tank then yes it can and every other sniper hac can fit same without that extra 15 pg from rcu
youre crazy this would effectively mean that shieldtanking ships would have fewer slots than their armourtanking counterpartshang on nerf minmatar
just as an example my cerb has 3 bcu show me any sacri normally featuring 3 damage mods
true i didnt give any details on the fit im sorry about that but theres too many and people who fly caldari ships especially gunboats will know about the pg problemfor example the rokh try to fit 425mm x8 a mwd and some others mods which i cant remember cause im at work its impossible  theres almost 100300 missing and i could have all mods online and running at most i have to take a gun off and everything else fits but if i do that i have less dps which most caldari gunships have problems with since it gives a distance bonus insteadi could use the named versions but stillagain i lose some dpsbut i could get it back with some faction ammo but those arent cheap in pvp after a while i could be really specific over the setups but soren already started to do that here anywayps im talking about pvp no pve since pve dont have any problems with pgwell i dont anyway
you really really need to train some fitting skills as i mentioned the rokh can fit an all t2 sniper fit including a full rack of 425s and a mwd and still tank a doomsday even without the use of rigs now where does that imply a need for more pg
ohh ffs ok sorry again doing 2 things at the job and writing in the forums is not a good thing to doanyway it wasnt 425mm it was blasters sure sniper is fine thats cool and i got no problem with that also to note i got all skills max to fit a ship the only things thats missing is the implants which im not ready to buyheres the setup that im trying to get to workrokh ion blaster pvp rokhtracking enhancer iidamage control iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iiheavy capacitor booster ii cap booster 800xlarge shield booster ii100mn microwarpdrive iishield boost amplifier iineutron blaster cannon ii antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii antimatter charge llarge antiem screen reinforcer ilarge antithermal screen reinforcer ilarge capacitor control circuit ihammerhead ii x5as you can see that doesnt work if i remove a blaster it works but i dont want to remove it theres also the fact that i could use ion blaster instead and have 8 of thembut i dont want ion i want my fockn neutron blaster grrrr edit i tried using named for everything except cannons and it doesnt work still not enough pg

consider what images are conjured when one thinks of a titan it may not even be a ship but one of the mythological titans whose power was exceeded only by the gods alas assessment of battle does not paint as daunting an image to be sure in their current state a titan is a good asset to an alliance as they can move capital fleets using jumpportal generators but on the other hand they by no means on the same scale as mythological titans where save perhaps the scale of their size despite this size titans can be easily outtanked by dreads and mother ships though a titans main offensive weapon its doomsday has a myth logically intimidating name lets face it it cant take down most battleships if fitted properly in its current state a titan does not fill the role that ccp originally intended here are some proposalscurrently a titans doomsday will do about 70000 damage of a specific type now with any ship you are not hard pressed to get 80 resistance this brings a doomsdays damage down to around 14000 all battleships can withstand this and even some cruisers leaving capital ships almost unaffected to try rectifying this by simply boosting the amount of damage that a doomsday inflicts also presents a few problems 1 friendly ships on grid will also have to take this damage not to mention that having a weapon that can wipe the grid of all but capitals would be considered too powerful by some be that as it may one solution to this would be to set the doomsday on a timer the timer would be visible to everyone on grid and would count down until to doomsday activates this would give friendly and enemy ships alike a chance to warp out unless bubbled or pointed 2 alliances with multiple titans would essentially be able to destroy every thing on the grid by warping in multiple titans solving this would be easy by not allowing the pilot to activate their doomsday while another doomsdays timer is active hence there would be a 10 20 or 30 second delay between doomsdays color this with some back story on how a black hole will open if two doomsdays activate at once or something along those lines nowadays titans usually dont fit guns which in and of itself isnt a problem but as a compensation titans should get a remote rep and cap transfer bonus additionally a titans tank is disproportionately low with faction fittings there are battleships that can almost tank as well as a titan to fix both of these problems titans could have a siege module similar to the one that carriers and mother ships can useconstructive criticism is welcome so post away
1 the timer is stupid you can already warp out when you are not tackled your timer wouldnt change that much2 titans can be tackled and killed aswell shown regularly doubld dd is not nice but well part of the game and its not like we have 24 titans on 1 grid regularly so most cap ships are fine with 12 dd3 imho rr bonuses on the titan isnt really going to help they already give huge bonuses to your fleet4 titan tanks imho the real problem is that people learned how to kill them and bring the right amount of shipslast but not least i can say you mix too many topics into one and i cant really support the thread
fyi dominion brings titan changes they get a single targeted dd now and moms get fighterbombers
well im glad that it will be bringing titan changes i hope that they fix the tanking ability if at all possible i would like links to any and all changes that dominion is bringing

i support overhaul of the insurance bc of its distorting economic systems however the csm council should consider the exact modifications carefullyit is also interesting to see a topic for a refreshing change where hardcore pvpers are whining forth and back instead of talking from their high horses as they usually do man the mining sites agents npc spawns explo sites whs and everything else is miles better and profitable in 00 than in emp if you still cant support your pvp lifestyle even despite your intellect is ohsomuch superior to that of a carabear  then pvp in a nice cruiser instead of a bs i did that too and was my most enjoyable pvp experience beleive or notbtw have it not occured to you that any insurance or whatever modification causes you any hardship it will cause just the same problem to your opponent and at the end of the day you will be at no disadvantage
i am against unnecessary prohibitions if you are stupid enough to get yourself shot whit a handful of plexs on board so what you have the right for that we in this part of europe had enough states telling whats good for us and forbidding anything for our own good after having ged rid of them with all that hard work i feel to puke when now companies start doing the samesorry for the rant
personal contract  use remotelyyou can transfer them to anybody where either of you is actually located is irrelevanthe can then use it from his assets pannel once he accepts the contractplex dont need to be moved to be used by anybodyyes you cant put them up on sale on the market in a different region but thats about it  if you know the buyer you can just issue the contract to him wherever he isthats the only inconveniencebut other than that lulzworthy killmails with hundreds of plexes are worth supporting this
but that sounds awesome supported
shield tanks already have plenty of advantages over armor tanks as do armor over shield they are each regularly used and have their purposes for the reasons already outlines in this thread i do not support this change
no invul  active meaning it requires lots of capeanm  passive no cap neededshield doesnt have a passive type of shield take gives resist to all without sucking cap we need that besides that this thread is not supported usually shield users are here for supportnothing else its a good balance in my opinion if you want a better tank use an armor tankhonestlyno pun here
depends what you fly for smaller ships invuln cap use is very relevant for big ones it really isntunless someone is neuting you and it turns off i suppose my answer was a bit more skewed towards bigger ships but thats what needs to be balanced for the most given that theyre whats flown the most and no you dont need to have everything armor has just like armor doesnt need to have everything shield has balance can be achieved without everything being identical
you do realize its a tier 1 bs right that it has 8 hardpoints at all is a major advantage over other ships
from everyone ive talked to the typhoon is at or near the top of the list for rr roles its also a great solo ship as it can dish out good damage with nice speed and have extra highs to play with for other usesits a great pocket tool thats cheap and fun to use its also very versatile as it has the ability to use drones guns and launchers all with nice but not insane dmg or it can go straight gank and dish out insane damage for low cost but high skill requirementsin all honesty i wish more ships were like the phoon in its very unique role its definitely not a point click bs like most but thats what makes it so awesomethere are 11 other t1 bs out there there are faction bs soon more faction bs and t2 bs there are also bc t2 bc and a slew of other ships to choose from if the phoon doesnt suit you if you want a double damage bonus to turrets take the tempest if you want tank and gank get the maelstrom the phoon is in an ideal 3rd slotoh yeah and just for the record any ship with a rof bonus gets more of a boost than a ship with a dmg bonus so while it might be split weapon its also getting more dps per gunlauncher than any ship with a straight dmg mod bonus
typhoon pilot here and i like the setup sure its an oddball but so is the scorpion well a primary target and an oddball personally i use it as a giant logistics ship thanks to all them tasty lowslots to keep the power flowing while it may not be the best for dps it is definitely a versatile and useful battleship which is the point of the ship
not supported a typhoon with 8 bonused torpedo hardpoints would be able to dish out over 2200dps overheated and with some implants
big big mistake i hearby request rollback
ok yeah do this
an option to enabledisable this like the balance delay effect in the wallet settings would be greatbtw the skillpoint count is also immediately available in the skills tab where it shows current skills 21 skill points 953517
i agree completelythings like changing ships or fleet positions should not start an unconditional 30 second timer but instead take only as long as actually requiredi wouldnt mind keeping some timers as actual game mechanics eg the earliest you can undock is 30 seconds after docking but you may change ships as often as you manage to do during those 30 seconds
i support this product andor service
there is no good reason for a hull like this to exist not every niche demands a specialized ship to fill it  sometimes you just fit the relevant mods on a usable ship and go from there its not like frigs lack for utility highs after all
tbqh if they were at all usefull theyd be overpowered in general the smaller the ship the higher the resistance thus the more effective remote rep is on it not to mention they have lower sig radii so theyre harder to hit a cool idea but again if it was worth sacrificing a dps frigate itd be overpowered afs are already stretching the limits of being overpowered as is
afs  logistic shipotherwise use the logistic highs of your afs
i see no good reason to add this the black ops is a specialized enough hull that there is no need whatsoever for four more ships to do the same job
no not even going to justify the noisaac

having spent some time with this feature rather than just doing a kneejerk reaction to change i have to add my voice to the throng and say this was a terrible idea it may go some way towards cutting down lag at times but at too great a cost to gameplayenjoyment  surely there must be a better way to reduce lag
i understand the reasoning behind the change but the worst part about it is with the lagged text you cant even figure out if youve actually scanned something or not until about 510 seconds after the first scan horrible mechanic implemented
signed
i agree the new system does not work the lag on the message is the bigest issue you dont know if the scan updated or notif its at all posible can we have the old system back 
yo the csm asked ccp about this for you guys and they replied that the directional scanner puts a huge load on the server and spamclicking it was creating lag youll have to start using long range probes instead of an inty
well they could at least try a shorter delay 2 seconds is way too much getting rid of the annoying message would help too maybe make the scan button unclickable during delayand while theyre at it fix the forum so you dont get logged out when trying to post
im speechless so they are seriously not going to fix it

i cant believe the people against this ideain fact i believe that when you buy a character changing the name and portrait should be mandatoryas soon as you buy a character i think ccp should force a name change and a new portraiti dont believe you should be able to change your name if you arent selling unless it is fairly soon after you created it have a cooling off period during which you can correct a horrid naming mistake but otherwise only for sales

insurence should be permanent
this is really detailed and well thoughtout ive taken advantage of insurance scamming myself so it definitely needs to be fixed how often do you hear someone say that some of the details probably need tuning but you have my support
interesting that this is trying to solve a problem and not just screw over pvp and that is encouragingi agree with this but points need to be mademany pvpers in 00 lose as many as 10 or more ships a day and kill many times over that a shortterm tracking system could give them a needlessly bad recordalso a tracking system is going to task the server which ccp is constantly fighting to cut lag we should avoid adding to the problemspayment per cycle 30 days might be more stable should be automatic dont know about you but if i choose to insure something i dont want surprises unless i want to stop coverage voluntarily
if you setup a small delay in insurance where it happened on 20 minute cycles much like npc bounty payouts do i think it would help cut down drastically on lag

tried t2 stasis webs they are 60
use 2 t2 around 83 speed reductionno 1 web shouldnt be a i win against anything speeding
point stands 1 t2 scram is equal to 3 t2 webs not counting how long it takes for a ship to slow down with webs
this scrams also dont work on afterburning targets so there is a clear drawback when using them if you are so butthurt about your rapier suggest changing one of its bonus to web strength increase the new webs are much better for the game as a whole
omg i just realized you can fit a scram and a webi think i just won eve
you are dumb and completely dont understand ship roles the idiocy is strong in here yes a long range web ship should get within scram range genius
tryed page 2
do i need to point out how rediculesly op rapier etc was against fast ships before the changedidnt think soits balance dont f with it 
no webs slow down the target nomatter if theyre abing mwding or just slowboating scrams only work on ships mwding in addition to that only 1 scram has any effect what so ever for speed add a second scram and it doesnt reduce speed any further and when you web a mwding target he goes slower but keep his high sig radius so hes easier to hit then someone that got scrammed since sure his speed dropped but his sig dropped porportionallyweb the target so your friend in an arazufast ship can close in and scram

we really shouldnt just leave afk cloakers be because for all that people whine that its working as intended and a legitimate strategy how can it be reasonable that players can bring so much psychological pressure to bear while theyre not playing the game the fact that cloaks are completely infalliable is ridiculous nothing should be 100 infalliable in the gamehowever noone can come up with a really balanced solution to it and even if they could the howl of protest from people who like unbalanced exploits would drown out any voice of reason so were just going to have to bite our thumbs and live with it dammit
for anyone to think they are infallible must have some serious issues
there is nothing to worry about afk cloakers but a coverts ops with a covert ops cynogen is your real nightmare
this has been brought up not once but many times there is a small subset of the playerbase that actually considers this a problem lets be honest  psychological warfare only works if you let it the fact that an afk cloaked ship is in system doesnt change one whit if you know hes there or not if you didnt knopw he was there you wouldnt care if he was afk and cloaked without local the all infallible intel source you wouldnt have clue that he was in system if local was removed the only thing that would change is your perception of the situation ergo the issue is not the fact that hes cloaked and afk how do you know theyre afk anyway and not simply laughing at all of you for hours on end but in what you choose to do with the information you possessnot supported

given the latest example of corruption by the csm it is imperative that their role in the development of eve be reevaluatedfrom the original postinside knowledge such as this can and will be used to the advantage of the csm and their alliancesno amount of posturing and trolling from the regular assembly hall pseuds can deny that this is exactly what has occuredthe csm was envisaged to keep the development team in check after the t20 incident by the time the first vote was cast this role had been downsized to that of simple player liason ripe territory for an opportunist to exploit proving themselves no better than those they were charged to watchpeople get the representation they deserve so it was only a matter of time before corruption would come to light how many more economic deals have been made based on insider information how can we trust any decision made by the csm in this lightthe charade must end

 this
hahahhaa this is the best way out there idea ever
i happen to like hearing the booms of my artillery cannons i got a surround sound system that plays it crystal clear with base and as i am running missions it just turns to nothingfix it
eve has sound
yes eve has sound p haha and yes i turn it off myself while running missions its rather annoying to hear the shield hardener sound going over my missiles firing and me being hit by missiles imo that the shield hardener and scan res sounds are quite a pain
i flew a few missions yesterday and turned on sound for a change of pace i wondered if i forgot to turn it on initially since i couldnt hear anything different apparently you need stare your battleships rear thrusters to have sounds in this game it is sort of sad that the eve has sound crap has turned to be an accurate description of the current sound systemyou are better of playing without sound at the moment it gives a performance increase and if you like using a more tactical view you wont hear anything even with sounds turned on
no worries ccp is not ignoring eves sound
welcome to eve 
think about it the buddies who logged on he could have been in contact with the whole entire time via vent or cell phone and if you take into effect that if the game was real his buddies are just sittin in the station doing nothing loged off when he calls for help the rush to their ships log on undock from the station and join the fray adding a delay to locking upon log on will cause more issues then not having itim sorry you didnt get the kill but thats eveedit fixed to think from thank p
yeah and even delaying is stupidwant some tissues
id never thought id see the day a pvper is ing about getting outganked by a bunch of clever pilotshell they logged on they didnt runand your throwing a damn fitseriously thats messed upi can get log offs station camping games but thatthis is normal for eve dont like it gb2wow or somethingnot supporting yet an another whine threadps this is no different than pilots who are logged on and a system over
you guys do not value real strategy its seems you value taking advantage of game mechanics so you can feel get off some cheap kills and then brag that you did it so wellwhat would you all do if you couldnt sit at your computer at the log in screen waiting to attack perhaps you would have to fight toe to toe and figure out a real strategyi do not expect anyone to understand this except the devs which i hope take this to heart yes we have heard it all crying whining that is nothing new for an insult i have been playing since march 2004 so honestly tell me somethign i havent heard or better yet dontthis thread is meant to help the devs realize that there might be something to fixtry not to cry on this thread and be helpful or dont post

you cant change the logon trap without making some serious change to the game problem with statis ispilot x logs in after an op deep into enemy territory and suddently hes is a blob he cant lock he cant target back the blob can poff or if the blob cant well we have a serious issue of ships escaping situations they really shouldnt be able to escapeplease stop whining about a game attribute so widespread evryone should know how to use including you
buildso lets put it another wayyou said in eve the strategy is about assessing the situation to determine whether or not you can defeat the enemy with the given intel which the game provides and i totally agree with you some people claim that eve is about numbers it is not its all about intel when you know they have more and that you cant engage just dont engagein your case you did the right thing considering there was only a single ravenyou also did the right thing by retreating when you realized they had more in systemif you knew that they had a lot of people in the station would you have engagedit seems like you didnt so just consider it a lack of intel and next time be aware that they probably live in that stationbasically logging off is another tactic to hide numbers just like waiting in a nearby system does player shouldnt be displayed in local anyway so always be ready for that situation as far as i know it hasnt been considered as an exploit and obviously will never be so get used to it its part of the game and it makes sense when we consider local not to make any sense
its not the lack of intel which is the problem its just the fact that if you attack someone and then all of a sudden you get 35 or more guys coming online to help him myself too find thatexploitative in some way if they were online and waiting 23 jumps over i believe i wouldnt mind killing that raven myself but log on and be ready right away there just seems to be a problem with thatso the point is not the fact the intel was missing its the fact that people can get online and be ready immediately
well this is a game so some differences to real life are to be expected the metagaming being something you just cant remove and any attempt to do so only shows the lack of thinking of the one who thinks it is possible you are more likely to hurt the actual game then metagaming with changes that are designed just to limit metagaming it isnt that big of a deal once you adjust your thinking to consider itthat said it is a lack of intel since proper intelligence gathering would have aided and can help you defeat them you just have to consider more then just the single situation when you consider intel and think as a gamer not just as a character if the one lonely raven sitting there was everything you knew you would have no real intel but only some situational awereness and possible capability to assess that ravens fighting capabilities one basic way to gain intel on hostile organisations is to engage them solely for the purpose of measuring their reaction attack a normal resource gathering site to see what their backup is so when the real offensive begins you know to attack them too attack one of their ships and measure response time ships used tactics usedlogon traps belong here active players vs those just logged on ect the list goes onthe op didnt have much intel he just saw an opportunity and took it hoping for the best it didnt work as planned but the whole situation propably helped him to gain a lot of helpful intel on how that organisation operates he can now avoid similar engagements with them or set a trap to counter their logon trap if he has the resources to manage that the intel game is constant and can be turned to your advantage if you put effort into it
this isnt an issue that is solved through a stasis perioda stasis period just punishes people who were disconnected for whatever reasoninstead this is part of the remove local argumentlocal is one of your only sources of intel this is the source of this technique
not supported for all of the reasona already outlined
that raven sitting outside station had trap written all over it even a dumb grunt like me would have seen that you should have brought more firepower to the party to take him down within seconds and if you couldnt do that you should have waited outside system on a gate he would likely go throughremember now when a wt is sitting outside station 9 times out of 10 its a trap
and the other 1 out of 10 it will turn into a trap faster than you can say its a trap
is it realistic for a pilot to have lag in a battleis making me have to wait 30 seconds after dcing to continue a fight fair even when i dc multiple timesif you guys can complain about your problems ill complain about mine im not blessed with 8 meg internet and no lag like you are i lag i dc sometimes with your idea you have effectively crippled me as a pvper you get to gank that raven and ill never get to pvp ever again i think that is unfair i will gladly have my most expensive ship ganked by a logon trap and loose all of my wealth before i allow my ability to enjoy the game crippledif you want to make eve more realistic fix the problems of those who lag and make the game more realistic for them too if i can adapt with my unrealistic problem and enjoy my game then you can adapt too your proposal does not put in account everyones situation and failsnot supported
you can at least if you go for a buffertank with extenders and harderners ofcourse you have to put one power diagnostic on there but that leaves room for three magstabs and a dcu if you have tackler support load null and enjoy that 17km optimal
those are pretty expensive ways to die to a dominix
you honestly not going to put an mwd on thatanyway to the op its balanced try getting a full rack of neutrons on a mega and see what kind of things you have to compromise on oh and train awu 5
for empire and low sec it is not absolute nessesary and the extra range  null helps a lot to be usefull without one in small gangs
you also see amarr and shield tanked minmatar ships without mwd often
i agree with null i just know from experience that not having an mwd will get you killed  its not about range to target its about a lot of other situational thingsyou should really consider fitting one
its dumb to attempt to use a rokh like this
until you get scrambled no more mwd in that case and since i got blasters im gonna be pretty close in some way
its a better idea that if a char with bounty is podded he will lose security status so every pirate is avoiding to be podded
i like the suggestions that are going on in this thread if someone wrote it up into a coherent single post id probably support it
i think there is another way to fix the problem of people collecting their own bounties with altscurrently having a bounty on your head is a bad thing unless you have an alt collect it but what if having a bounty also had benefits this would mean that people who want those benefits would actually try to keep the bounty on their head as long as possible and will even try to raise it if they are shot they have to start all over again with zero bounty this means that collecting your own bounty may not be as tactically sound as keeping it there this is well intune with the riskreward philosophy as having a bounty on your head is a dangerous thingthe type of benefits a bounty gives you might include things like access to certain agents that require your bounty to be a certain amount or higher or having a bountyversion of an lpstore you might even go as far as having npc pirates not attack you if your bounty is high enough as they start to respect you unless you fire at them first the reward needs to measure up to the risks involved and it may be difficult to find the right rewards for this but i think its a good solution if you want people to keep their bounties
another thing you could do is to remove bounties on players and instead do killing on contract the contract is created for one specific bountyhunter by an investor only that one specific bountyhunter can fullfill the contract and collect the reward bountyhunters would need a specific bulletin board where they offer their services a board that can be browsed through from anywhere in eve so investors can pick their bountyhunter who may have specified a minimum fee and when the investor picks one the bountyhunter receives an evemail with the targets name and the amount he can gain is also specified in the mail contracts have a time limit if the victim is not killed within that time the investor gets his money back from the unfullfilled contract and the bountyhunter nolonger has killrights on the target
i dont like this idea and i wont support it my main problem is that for some reason people seem to think only trustworthy individuals high security status should be allowed to be bounty huntersi know its not the same universe but its probably still comparable in star wars many bounty hunters such as boba fett were not necessarily good law abiding people he worked with jabathis idea sounds like turning bounty hunters into cops with very stiff mechanics and on top of that much better suggestions have been made regarding the bounty system in the past go support those

great idea
i have been thinking of proposing an idea roughly like this but with some small differences that id like some feedback onthe corp ceo could flag items as corp items that anyone in the corp can use however they like but they cant be sold given in a trade to someone outside the corp or put into contracts outside the corp however when somebody leaves the corp the game searches though their belongings looking for corp items and all of them have to be put back into the corp hangar before they can join a new corpthis could also work for the corp wallet where eve keeps a tally of the isk going between your wallet and the corp wallet you can get as big a debt as you like but when you want to leave you have to repay your debt to the corp wallet this debt can be reduced by the ceo if they feel happy about the exmember leaving before the debt is paidthat wouldnt stop people just trashing your corps assets but then you just be careful of new players which could be altswhat do you think
ccp already has devs working as investigators and proudly exclaiming they hold the record for highest number of bannings
speak for yourself more seriously make sure the limit isnt too draconian someone might legitimately want to make two new topics inside an hour
perhaps this has simply not been implemented due to the tediousness of the task but it seems to me that factions which are not amarrminmatarcaldarigallente do not give out storyline missions ie ore the syndicate interbus servant sisters of eve thukker tribe and pirate factionsnow i havent checked them all and havent done missions for pirate factions since 2 years ago or more but i am pretty certain that interbus faction for example does not give out storyline missionsthat means that these factions which do give out missions unlike the jove empire and the society can only have standing with them raised indirectly via the major factions however since the caldari only like interbus to 150 that is the maximum that one would be able achieve and at x015 times the rate at which caldari would increase it would be very slow to get there anywaythere seems no major reason to specifically deny these mission but not storyline giving factions storyline missions since they are liked only to a small degree by most major factions anyway the indirect increases would be small and max out at 025 to 300 anywaypersonally i would love to see an additional mechanic added to the game that allowed faction standing increases besides storyline missions especially since it is so easy to destroy faction standing obviously the idea to make faction standing increase with agent and corp but to an even smaller degree has been thought of probably by the designers who worked out the current standing rewards for missions so we would need some ingenious new mechanic
ehore the syndicate not sure but i think they have storyline agentsinterbus they have no storyline agents because they are on good standing with all the empire faction and raising all the empire faction at the same time is a nonoservant sisters of eve thukker tribe and all the pirate factions have storyline agents
with the proliferation of titans i think the proposed changes in dominion will not be liked by larger alliances or people with titans the leak of this information before the pax conference also explains why titans have dropped in price and are being sold and raffled leftandrighthopefully they will also provide another function for them in fleet warfare the cost to manufacture titans including minerals and 10 profit on the required bpos is in the ballpark of 4951b w current mineral prices you are taking a ship that is very expensive to build and removing its primary ability that is unique black ops have covert bridge i can only hope that there will be something added to the strategic capabilities of the most powerful supercapital in the game
that is the problem it never was 1v1 a dread could kill a titan
yes it has but it hasnt changed the fact that this is the wrong proposal for a comparatively minor problem yes the system is broken t2 ships not working plus only 3 month limited coverage however this will only force people like myself who have a rl plus eve to buy isk i dont have the time or the patience to farm isk like some kind of zombie no thanks
short answer noif it ever served a purpose it no longer does its just a popularity contest now
i do understand the wardec system and all the good and bad points of it i read some threads regarding the changes and all but i believe theres one thing thats missing and now wonderedjust out of curiosity if a corp the wardeccer doesnt attack at all shouldnt that constitute the violation of the yulai convention from the evemail i get thats what it says anyway in other words since they dont attack for x number of days why should the wardec continue  also to note that in this situation even thought it may be wierd the wardecced started the wardec there intention is to almost never attackjust terrorise i guess or always have the feeling they might i dont mean to change anything just to get some feedback on this
i dont think this is the right forum to ask you could try the general discussion
moved to gdand to answer your question yes that is inappropriate we will also announce a new method of submitting alliance logos in the near future fyi
rational discourse on eveo forums  never thought id see the day tbh

i dont see why this is so hard for you to understand blasters kinthermdrones all best is thermlasers emthermprojectiles all but multiple types per ammomissiles all single type per ammoso instead of comparing using laserblastersprojectiles on the ships instead use projectiles on the vexor railguns on the stabber and artillery on the omen because that is what youre doing by not using kinetic on the caracal
show me a ship other than a caldari missile boat that losses its damage bonus at any point when using the racial weapon systems designed for that vesselyou may not mention heliosinquisitorbreachereris or any of the stelth bombersthey are included in the op
i seem to be in the minority on this i think that dust 514 is a brilliant ideai dont think that sovereignty will be solely in the hands of a bunch of 12yearold mouthbreathers the winners will be those alliances that work closely with skilled groups of dust 514 players they will have an impact but they cant do it without us

now that this has been implemented i have seen a huge decrease in server lagactually not at all the minute server load contributed by directional scan usage has not effected in the slightest anyones gameplay at the moment the incredibly terrible 2 second delay coupled with the central pop up message and the fact that changing the angle of the scan counts as a rescan all come together to form a big heap of steaming failwas this actually tested did not a single developer understand the faults of this changei find that hard to believe instead i will fall back on my personal motto blatantly stolen from penny arcadewe are being digested by an amoral universewell done ccp you have somehow managed to screw the pooch once again

i havent noticed a reduction in lag thereforegiev lag back plz
surely there are other areas where they can easily cut down more server load without fing over combatwhat about the market tab you open up 1 section on the left and it loads every module in that section on the right how bout only loading that if a player specifically wants all that info 99 of my market functions i use the browser to find 1 specific module not 1 module and 10 others similar to it along with all their relevant market info

well if they are not going to modify this can we at least get the button fixed where you cannot press it again until the 2 seconds has expired so that we know we are getting true results or not that is really the worst part about the entire thing is that your never sure if you actually scanned or not unless you wait like 5 seconds which is totally sillyalso using probes to find out if someone is in a safe is a rather difficult thing to do in systems that are gigantic
2 seconds is too long
signed
i supported this before i tried to get used to it tried to see a decreasing in lag like the old scanner must have createdbut i cant get used to it its a horrible implementation  usability is crap if eve was a special software for a huge rlcorporation to manage their assets and employees the programmer would get fired for that piece of  he createdthen the lag  we went on roams in gangs of different sized  from 5 up to almost 80  and nothing changedi still get ppl locked read i see them as locked as one of my targets with hp and my warp disruptor wont hit them although i got it preactivated i still cant do anything for 1 second after jump cause my mouse wont click but thats kinda normal  i dont fall behind in fast gangand in large fleets with around 80 ppl i still get jumpinlag the syncissues maybe better but i yet didnt had the chance to see it  wait till we get the next pospw to bump ppl out
is this for real this is possibly the most ed answer ccp could have given it is ed on so many levels people arent going to start fitting scan probe launchers and screwing around endlessly with probes as a replacement for the speed of using the directional scannerthis change is so utterly ridiculous can ccp not understand how lame it is and how its upset so many players well another nail in the coffin of what was once a fun game
no to name changesfor one tracking scammers corp thieves and the like as well as intel on wartargets would become more of a hasslesecond the fact that you can not change the name of bought character is a way to reduce the number of people which are rl rich and want to buy their way in its a needed drawback for character buying

when i first read this i fell in love why this hasnt been implemented or at least worked towards yet is beyond mesupported for amazing design ideas
not a good idea imosome of you say domi is useless at gatecamps so are all frigate classes this will change a wide range of common tactics like the one to engage battleships with a group of assaultfrigs when the bs got global it will be useless to use assaultships in lowsec then since they are good use when bcbs sized enemies get gcc at stationsgatesthere are things you have to calculate with when firing at someone dont want that to vanish in eve
just give sentry guns tracking

i like this idea tier 1 and tier 2 freighters would be awesomesupport
while lower insurance and fewer rr bses for that matter means less pvp it also means much higher quality of pvp reduction of insurance will mean more diversity and it will reduce the desire for pilots to stay away from purchasing t2 ships it will also remove the incentive to make the alltoocommon disposable battleships we all love to seesupportedoddly enough my proposal had way fewer supports even though the changes were fewer i wonder why 
one reason i support this is because it increases costs for griefers in highsec now griefing is pvp but there are many of them who are purposefully in a noob corp so they cannot be wardecced which as you know is also part of pvp there should be repercussions for every action in eve and the additions yaay has added will increase costs for griefing regardless of corp these are my reasons for supporting yaays additions but it could very well be that insurance is the wrong way to do it in which case those additions should be removed
ah that vaunted highquality pvp shooting wartargets on the jita undock yase we need more of that

sounds good
another suggestion start a document on the wiki with some of the lesser known but frequently petitioned game mechanics so people know how things are supposed to work for example i thought that if you logout without aggro that you cant get a 15 minute aggro timer but if you light a cyno and logout without aggro and a minute passes and youre killed your pod is given a 15 minute aggro timer and apparently this is an intended game mechanic considering that this is contrary to what many thought about aggression timers its something worth letting other players know also its buggy this leads to a cyno that never dies until downtime and your spawning in your medical station but you still keep your clone which is awesome when you have a ton of skillpoints
supportedbut the cynical side of me says that since this is uirelated nobody will ever be assigned to work on it
bump for more support
imo scorp needs at least a looking at dont know about the eos ive never used it the scorps role as a sniper ecm ship acording to the bonuses is kinds odd considering it takes an eternity to align and warp the thing plus bs sized guns vs bs turns out alot of dps on a ship thats supposed to have little tank to begin with
i dont get whats wrong with the scorp the eos could use another gun though
ive finally figured out why the myrmidon is so uglyits to motivate players to move on to battleships its not working with me though no sir im still flying it
what the myrm is a sexy and vertical killing machine 3other than that the eos desesperatly need loveand drake you whine about the fact that he doesnt post any suggestion but you dont do it eitherand you dont even say anything useful about this issue let us know if you agree or not wheter the eos and scorpions are not worth flyingso let me startthe eos either needs more firepower or more tank right now its information warfare links are far from being as useful as the other kinds of gang links changing its gang links would also help the ship was overpowered in the past now its not worth flyingthe scorpion is  okay i dont see any way to change it without making it overpowered
are you insane the scorpion owns

if you use a hac like a battlecruiser youll generally find that battlecruisers are better at being battlecruisers than hacs
maybe you should get booted from the csm about it
no lets talk supply and demand for this video game which the mechanics are already in place foridiotic real life comparison you seriously expect ccp to redesign the whole moon mineral system so you can fly more hacs into suicide runswe are talking about supply and demand in this game not about rlmy point still standsjust to clear my post up incase you dont understand what im talking aboutyour trying to apply real life economic logic with completely different circumstances to a video game with again completely different circumstances and trying to justify the former rl economics to suit your needs again i say stop flying hacs or stop dying in them

1 would like to see drones taken out of the drop down select window and moved into a module slot on the hud2 you could load this slot with total number of drones you wish to release3 this module can be placed in any unused slot on the hud it does not efftect the total number of fitting slots a ship has4 the drop window would reflect the drones on the field of battle as it is now this window would also control how you want the drone deployed it woud be set up like the slected items window the overview uses5 pressing the module once releases the drops pressing it a second time returns them to your drone bay

i will not go into complete detail on the mechanic of this exploit but after talking to several sources and testing we have conclude yet another instance of pos bowling exploitingsimilar to one that occurred about 6 months ago after the ban hammer threat was tossed out it is now time for ccp to take legit and harsh action against thisi want to be the first to say i fully endorse meta gaming and the actions that result from it what i do not support is exploiting the game mechanics beyond fair rules pos bowling is one of the lamest tactics ever invented and sadly i have a history with the founders of it yet up until it was deemed bannable i accepted its use what irks me greatly is that an outcry from a large portion of the game and a resulting stiff warning from the devs has not resulted in any real action since even with multiple cases petitioned and confirmedunder the most recent incident it was used in a manner to prevent the pilot from having a chance to log off or recover from the action and warp or move to a safe spot in the shields in time had bowling not been used id consider the kill fully legitscreenshots petitions and convos have been recorded confirming the foul play which will be dealt with through proper resources but action needs to be taken swiftly and harshly to make the statement to players that this will not be toleratedidle threats towards my past alliances should not be discriminated only against the bob ilk its time to call an exploit an exploit and not discriminate simply because we didnt like one alliance for doing itthere are 3 confirmed ways to ignore intended game mechanics to prevent bowling 2 of them do not require a pos pw at all the 3rd way requires an exploit of the pw system that does not involve the pos owners at all all 3 ways directly counter mechanics placed in game to prevent bowling bowling is not bumping having a pos pw and bumping a ship out or having the tower pw changed to create ejections results in bumping bumping is an avoidable mechanic that gives both parties options on using and avoiding itbowling creates artificial unattainable speeds resulting in extraordinary physics outside of normal game mechanics it is done compeletely against the will of the pos owner meaning no pw change bowling results in actions that cannot be countered by the tower owners
supported
tell us something juicy like how to do it
some of us are not so called self proclaimed egotistical experts on matters you outlineand until you get into details dont expect any support
no pos pw change occurred it involves direct warp into the tower and instant bounce out of the shields capital ships were used but not required for the effect beyond that to go into the exact pos exploit mechanic is i believe against eula and to talk directly about a petition content is the same i do not care about the loss of the ship the guy who lost it had it coming i only care about the exploit itself
my heart bleeds over this really it does
youve just discovered this nowthis thread is bleeds of irony
ummmm
mazz isnt really a girl and got on csm for that reason only im petitioning thatedit gameover respeckt supports
ooo my own assembly hall threadpretty simple mazz its a far cry more simple than your exploiting of the training multiple chars several months ago while it existed ps  tell us how youre not an ugly girl so i can link to contradictory proof
be smartperhaps you need a button on pos anchoring my ship here and thats make it immobile like the dread in siegeneed anchoring iv and 1 minutes
there are a lot more than three ways to pos bowl illegally under current game mechanics most if not all of them have been bugreported for over six months now
whats most frustrating is that with petitions in they get closed with the response that an investigation is underway this should be a public knowledge issue there is so much gray area in rules because gms and devs do not open up the issues to the public with a close petition how can i keep an open flow of information to see if action was taken or if the incident was passed on how do i get the option of escalating what i think is a perma bannable offense if a regular gm does not handle the issue adequatelythe reason threadnaughts happen is because the gm policies are total garbage for things like thisi can assure you if this is not handled properly i will take every opportunity to repeat the incident until we have another goonesq response to the outrageousness of this bull at the very least information on par with the pos indy exploit needs to be handed out types and numbers of bans need to be listed for exactly what the offense was on issues such as this so that players can reference them in the future and a database needs to be compiled on previous history of bans for said actionsi would petition or have petitioned all groups friend and foe alike for actions like this i strongly discourage it even though i strongly encourage metagaming viperpl was petitioned on the basis of using the borked capital mass bumping issue to the extent to create pos bowling mechanics same effect same unintended feature different causethat issue was resolved when ship on ship bumping mechanics were fixedhad i been aware of bob using them as ive been informed they did and publicly educated members on very recently they would have received the same treatment im all for winning at whatever cost no matter how gay some tactics are but i do expect tactics to be within the rules and that the rules apply equally to all partiesthe eula clearly states that knowingly using bugs to your advantage is a bannable exploit and that is the issue addressed here
irony overloadthis incident wasnt bowling and the nyx owner died of his own mistakes that being said ccp did not fix the bowling concept i agree and it should be looked into you should probably have posted this with a alt as people will accuse you of hypocrisy and just because of that many will not suport this idea
i support thispos bowling is pr0 gygood thing we didnt do that
so what your saying is we killed your nyx altpos bowling suuuuuuuuureplease take those tears to jita 44 snot shot needs more water to wash windows
yaay a hypocrite say it isnt sopos bowling should be fixed though but as far as i can tell the ms kill in question was nothing of the sort
not supported because yaay dying is hilarious
that whole comment kinda makes you look a little stupid i dont know the story of how he died the way he flew it was bound to happen eventually but i am supporting it as the issue at hand does need to be looked into
phreeze i love a good yaay loss as much as the next so much so that i think we need to post our favorite yaay losses however this wasnt yaay yaay cant afford motherships
i personally love that one where yaay is in the covops
i have fraps of ze mothership kill in question you can have it for 20 billionz isk
i am interested in seeing this for posterity and posterity alone therefore all i can offer is this smiley face and knowledge to help better inform the public and the csm
i vote to reinstate it as a proper mechanic i mean its good sport
noand fyi those speeds are still attainable in game through conventional means
i hear the recording of you emo raging that you missed the kill is almost as funny as the buildup to what happen next if you listen closely you can almost hear the pitter patter of your moms steps coming down to the basement to assist you in a southparkesq manner ill leave it to the gms to decide that isolated matter but for the game mechanic as a whole id like for clarity and consistency of rule
we have a screenie of the gm telling a posbowl exploiting tri nyx pilot to quit it and leave system a couple of months ago
you mean when you engage warp to tower with correct pos pw in then change while in warp 
so do you mean to suggest that that means this was a bowl incident aswell if one person did it then the whole alliance must do it by that logic all of kia are made up of scammers since eddz scammed evebank
its esque you twit
so what youre saying is that rapiers are solo ships and should never ever fly with an arazu beside them because if you are ill just point out that a rapier can pretty trivially slow a ship down by 875 which is a bigger penalty than a mwd is a bonus would you rather turn off a mwd or turn off the bonus and keep the penalty
using an afterburner instead of a mwd is kind of like permawebbing yourself
abs are fitted to make tanking easier rather then to move fast and frigs with ab is pretty common now the small sig combined with high speed and no scram effect really is nice
when you died with a ceptor due to the 2pt scram multiple times you put an ab on to counter those
oh ive read it i just dont agree with youwhat youre suggesting results in exactly the same underbidding except people would be forced to underbid by 1 tick instead of 1 centso now every 5 minutes i miss out on 010 or 100 or 10000 or 1000000000i still have to underbid if i want to sell fast your proposal changes nothing in that respectcurrently if people want to sell now then they have to babysit their orders while those who can wait are able to set a price and walk away the market moves a great deal each day and for most products its possible to sell low volume at high margin or high volume at low margin depending on your choice and the availability of timeyes your proposal would make things move faster and further however this would be forced by the tick rather then forced by the market things move fast enough with 1UFFFD increments if you want to sell now then adjust your orders to suit like your competition isedit formatting long lines are harder to read
that would be true only if each and any of those centcutters would be willing to cut by a full ticki think only a small minority is really willing most are doing their undercutting only because it is freecant you see how abnormal is that in a funtional market if you want to sell now you have togive a sizeable discount as tick rule is part of an analogous real life market like a commodity exchange whatever is forced by the tick is forcedby the market but seriously if there is a sell pressure then the natural logic dictated by the market is that the price goes down ppl cutting by the penny do nothing else than prevent the move that the market would force on the price ok not really preventing just slowing down however there are buy pressures as well normally prices wouldmove up and down up and down as the wind blows with pennying hidering the price movement a sell pressuremay have not enogh time to see the price plummet because soon a buy pressure kick is similarly a buy pressure probably cant raise the price either because sooner or later a sell pressure kicks in we are missing a lot of volatility herewhat is volatility good for it provides a lot of opportunity to make good bargins for clever buyers and sellers alike also for speculators to make quick kills naturally this money comes out from the pocket of ppl who are greedy panicked desperatly need the goodmoney or a just plane lame taking advantge of others situation or stupidity is as old as the stock market in eve call it market pvp if you like
supportedbelt marker is a virtual object only perceptible through the use of superimposed hud simbology theres no corresponding physical object like a beacon hence there should be no decloakingonly workaround is to have belts displayed in overview toggle tactical display on click on belt marker at the end of the warp and try to fly away from it this way you avoid decloak 90 of the time even warping to zero
warp to zero on other celestials like stars planets and moons dont trigger this nither should an asteroid belt
get rid of it
this very bug makes me very very sad as a dedicated recon pilot
make non gallente rookieships more in line with their rolesim sure i cannot be the first to make this proposal but i cant be bothered with searching for themneedless to say i think this has been one of the biggest sources of imbalance in eve for as long as i have been playing the velator has and always will be king of rookieship battles hands down with its massive drone bay and ridiculous gun bonus it cant be ignored when on a battlefield of manysome people disagree citing the reaper as an obvious speed tanker but when its dps is so laughable that it can barely solo an industrial who out there can really claim it to be one of the elite hulls in frigate warfare today not only that but should you use the ship for that purpose you sacrifice your shield and armor for something that cannot even outrun a dronethe ibis is just a joke clearly intended as a mix between a sniper and a shield tanker it barely has the pg to support these vital functions it obviously has an issue with tanking and maintaining transversal at the same time unlike the armor based variants causing it to become overcome mercilessly should it encounter a frontal collisionlastly id like to bring up the imparior it has a well spread distribution of armor resistances making it a solid choice when you dont know what you may encounter however like so many amarr ships it has a critical flaw in its bonus list the reduced capacitor consumption of its racial weapon variant it causes one to make the choice between using a decent midrange weapon with no damage bonus or go all out on dps with a full rack of light ion blastersi now present to you the velator in all its solopwnmobile glory not only are its weapon systems the most lethal in game but as mentioned earlier it has a drone bay 100 larger than that belonging to any of the other ships mentioned that my friends it 100 more dps that has no way of being jammed neuted or disrupted making it an unstoppable onslaught of raw power the tank as with many gallentean ships can go both as an armor tank shield tank or hull tank endless configurations for each this makes it not just tough to crack but unpredictable to even the most wary pvperwhen we get over those shock inducing realizations we take a look at the ship bonus 5 bonus to hybrid damage right thats per level folks while many have not the skills to maximize the damage potential select few have indeed invested into training this juggernaut to the fullest facemeltingraw carnagerocket chainsaw all phrases used to describe the ferocity of this ship thus concluding my segment on the velatorim not going to say i know the best way to get around this crippling game changer unless to suggest raising your children as gallenteans but i do know this one day it could be you staring down the twin barrels of this behemoth as its hive mind wingmen cascade upon you with hellfire and then you will realize how disturbingly true this problem really istldr boost non gallente gratuitous frigates
this is a tragic and highly frustrating imbalance and should be treated with the highest priority possible
sure but first introduce a reason to fly an eris or a phobos or a hyperion and a better reason to fly a thanatos or a nyx
you must be kidding1 eris ok not so nice but try a pure missile dictor for real pain or even one with rocket bonuses rockets are the most useless weapon system in eve atm2 phobos lowsec gate campers best friend good active tank with place for 2 sensor boosters to catch everything that passes through3 hyperion may i recommend darknesss videos nice solosmall gang ship with a very strong active tank4 thanatos yeah i would also hate to have the carrier with the highest damage output same goes for the nyx it sucks so much to have 25 more damage than all other carriersmothershipsi give you a big box of tissues and the op a not supportedwhine about rookie ships facepalms
you should have put this as topicbecause your topic is really too complimentarily racial equalized amongst itself
i find the biggest issue im having with the 2 second delay is having to hover over the button for 2 seconds before hitting it again it may be cutting down on lag but to those operating in wormholes or outside of highsec this thing is your eyes and its just tedious so how about having a tickbox next to the button that when clicked automatically hits the scan button every 2 seconds while the scanning window is open and putting in a 5 minute autoswitch off so people cant just leave it running afk and adding unnecessary scan lag to the system maybe even put in a bit of animation so it at least looks like its sweeping the entire system and reporting every 2 seconds instead of the scanner is recalibrating nonsense basically ccp has made it appear that the scanner is slower and stupider and that should be easily rectified hell the dradus scanner on bsg sweeps the area and updates every couple of seconds but at least it looks like its working as it should
supporting my own post yeah
idea balanced fix for directional scannice topic the only down side to it is that it isnt actually fixing the scanner is it you just automate the scanner and leave it just as broken as it is today read the threadnaught on this forum about it and you can see how this would not actually fix the issues people have with the directional scanner i also fail to see how this is a balanced solution since you didnt balance anything as for the idea of an option to automate the process i have no strong feelings either way it would be pretty useless for actually trying to determine the location of someone in a hurry but if you are just doing a 360 degree scans to see who is around it would remove the need for constant mouse clicking and let you focus on playing
every character would have the attribute  as at some point they might use factiont2 crystalsthats a non issue  characters have hundreds if not thousands of attributes allreadyits just a counter to prevent randomness destroying all crystals at oncei would go for just the one attribute for all crystal types but that would be a dev decision if they thought it would be a good idea to implementit would be checked with the exact same regularity that crystal dmage is applied to crystals at presentall the idea does is move the counter from the crystal  crystal damage attribute  to the player  crystalpop attribute server load would not be affectedthe attribute would only be altered when a volatile crytals is loaded as is the case atm with crystal damage
i prefered the random shatter method toobut it was not garnering enough support though and id rather see some solution for crystals than non at all
what happens to your timer when you change crystals from one type to another  nothingwhat happens if i have a high crystalpop value and change from a bs to a frigate does my small lazer get a high pop to begin withthe crystalpop attribute is on the player not the laserchanging ship would not affect iteven funnier what happens when i change from my miner with t2 mining crystals to my bs with faction crystalsagain no change to the player attirbute crystalpopand what happens if i exchange a t2 crystal for a normal t1 crystalthe counter crystalpop would not change if t1 crystals were fitted as per the op
thanks for the supportjust to answer some of your concerns extra dataok minor with only one atribute but not any player uses laserseach skill a player has can be considered an attribute id bet there are other hidden attribs as wellrelated to booster and other stuff i dont think adding one extra is gonna be an issue at alland for every attribute that is added onto a player  there will be hundreds of attributes  crystal damage  removed from the crystals in play  so overall the dbase will probably end up smaller you will need a spare crystal any time since the damage carryies over between shipstrue this is the con you will lose more isk in pvp with it since you lose 1 crystal any 10 minutes instead 5 after 50 minutes  if you lose your ship after 40 minutes firing you allrady had to burn thrue 4 crystals in the corrent scenario you are still with your first set of crystals cost to pvp is hard to guage yeah the loss of spare crystals will be a small cost  but is ofset by the fact that you dont have to discard badly damaged crystals and also any you get in loot will be new  so you can use them or resale you could fire some shots with a s crystal to prevent your xl crystal from getting destroyedok comedy issue since the price diffrence between scorch and faction amno isnUFFFDt this big no real issuepossible  but i think players who are this concerned about losing isk generally dont pvp in the first placeseperate counters on the player for each crystal type would remove this possibliity although i dont think it would be worth the efforton the code level you could simply destroy the crystal in the gun after firing if the value hits zero then reset it since there are no unrepacked crystals any more you could even use the block standard reloading like other weaons do while ungroupedif the gun runs out of amno it realoads automaticly with the same amno type if it is stored in the cargo what isnUFFFDt possible with unrepacked amno atmdestroying the crystal in a gun would be an issue as pointed out by a previous postercurrently lasers keep firing till all the crystals blow more or less at oncei wanted a method that would keep lasers firing without interuption as only this would be acceptable to most amarr as it is what they have atm
n1
i read scrapheap it tells a different story in his own words hes a  im for extending his ban permanentlythat said ccp are ed for giving the csm any kind of info they can abuse
permaban him
15 days  30 days thats a joke he should be permanently banned period what he did is the samething equivelent to what t20 did he needs a permanent banthey also should investigate everyone who is posting in this thread that seem to have a vested interest in getting larkonis unbanned how far does this breech go we the eve community deserve answers
oh go phone someones home or post personal information in local about it oh wait
another csm member breaking the rulesUFFFD warnings and bans are not to be discussed on the forum such matters shall remain private between the ccp and the user questions or comments concerning warnings and bans will be conveyed through email or private messaging likewise discussions regarding moderator actions are not permitted on the forum if you have questions regarding a post or thread please file a petition
ban him and keep him banned its bad enough we have corruption in rl politics
u mad
UFFFDu mad
i agree banif lark did care about this he would never of done it in the first place and he knew what was happening so he messed up and he needs to pay for it
supporting this because it was p hilarious and made me giggle you cant just ban a man that made you giggle u kno well you can technically and i suppose him being banned is kinda funny too so im good either way
ccp goes too easy on these peoplepeople that cheat are one thing people that cheat and use their position to cheat are anotherperma ban is in order never to return
not supported a permenant ban is necessaryor are the csm oh so lofty that they are above the rulesedit its hilarious that the support for this is from other csm members afraid the rug is about to pulled out from under you eh
30 days from game and what i hope is a lifetime from csm sounds about right to me anyone acting that fundamentally stupid deserves no less he shouldnt have been flying what he couldnt afford to lose
lol its just a game unban him and reinstate him only s and queers think that this is a loss of trust blah blah its not like he will do it again i guess it was probably just a brain fart
and real life harrasment is not worth being perma banned for
ahahahahahaha
free my beloved malarky
so let me get this straightwe have a csm breaking the rules  a csm everyone knew was an asshat and a pirate when he got elected uh who else saw this coming ffs people what did you expecti am also not surprised that the request to unban him comes from the member of the csm whos campaign slogan could basically be reduced to vote for me i have boobsdisband the csm its lost its meaning and sense of purpose  we are officially better off without it
this minus the disbanding bittry elect people with brains like hersch and company  o p
i agree and i think maybe as much as i hate to admit it that when the cosmos social networking stuff arrives we might be able to get a better read on what candidates are really like honestly the current csm group has not performed well at all some of the ideas ive seem our precious csm reps post this term have been dumber than the ones i post while ed off half asleep having a nicotine fit and going through a caffeine withdrawal migrainetime needs to be served and while i somewhat respect the openness thats going on about the case i really expected a longer ban than 30 flipping days
first of all if you think lark is dumb you dont know larksecondly the csm cant do anything that is not ccp aproved so their hands are tied
larks a good guy and a smart one supporteditt negative ten and their alts qqing because they want to ease the burden on themselves by keeping their primary rival banned
well goons were the ones least willing to forgive bob over the t20 stuff etc we are your nemesis ingame and had your exploit worked your corp standed to gain tens if not hundreds of billions of isk in one night 2 chars in your corp had put 5 b into ithow much more would be in it before the patch came through that money would have been used to offset the war between usand any future competitorsi feel that ccp would have permabanned lark if he were in any 00 alliance because of the pressure from the competitors of that alliance over the outrage of them essentially cheating in the race as much as you want lark to come back to hold your hand ingame again im angry that he tried to pull this so yeah everyone in this thread is playing from their point of view including the girl that lark bought a drinklark wanted their to be more attention to be paid to low sec in that spirit his cheating shouldnt be looked on as less of a game changing exploit that would have ruined the game for others try for a little integrity ccp instead of giving in to some smooth talking douche thats gloating on scrapheap right now about your impotence in punishing him
how is he smart again
after reading what this person larkonis trassler did i must say i am surprised he didnt get a permaban he is well deserving of it in my opinion he used inside information to try and gain an advantage he also signed a nondisclosure agreement which he violated and from what ive been told his main character was banned from the forums for 6 months for inappropriate posting i feel this person is nonrehabilitative and should be banned not only on principle but on his past digressions integrity is something i feel ccp should show in this matter my vote is a permanent ban of larkonis trassler and all his accounts as well as a permanent ban from the csmban him we dont need people like this in eve
just enforce the rules in place without any bias or favoritism end thread
where to start where to start well t20 kept his job the money was not going to the neo spartans corp i have seen far more serious offenses be overlooked by ccp so a perma ban would be out of the question if you look at those thirdly how has this effected your game experience in any way shape or form if lark was able to make a profit and not get caught your experience would not change at all you would still run whenever there are more than three of us in a group and also about integrity  off you are in a corp controlled by a man who has gone as far to make three harassing phone calls to another player and has posted personal info of players in local chat
i like your logic a perma ban would be out of the question because of vague references to worse things you have seen go unpunishedwell sir i would suggest you file a petiton to help resolve those unpunished offences and help ccp to have a more fair and consistent policy for enforcing rulesdo your part
this
him and all his known alts should be perma banned
spending a bit of isk on some insider information is clearly worse than rl threats and harassment right just too bad ccp cantwont act on things that happen out of game
we are discussing the cold hard facts of what lark did in iceland this week and whether he was deserving of a lighter punishment i responded that i do not feel that he deserves a lighter punishment infact it deserves a harsher punishment pls stop responding with off topic replies about different incidents and or make another thread and or file a petitionyou were more than happy to talk about the topic at hand when everyone was supporting larks punishment being halfed why the smokeshow now
it seems to me there is alot more to this than meets the eye while we sit here reading this thread larkonis is gloating and bragging in the scrapheap challenge forums about how he pulled one over on ccp how he basically wiggled his way into a measely 30 day ban after reading his comments on scrapheap i feel he hasnt learned a thing from his given punishment i also see from his posts that he thinks its funny he has no remorse for what he did he even makes a comment about how he hopes that ccp doesnt notice that his statement was actually a trolli think the banhammer needs to be smacked down on this guy like the hammer of thor on lokis headhere is the link for all of you that want to see how unremorseful this guy is
i dont see anything out of line in that shc thread he seems pretty reasonable and genuinely sorry about what he did you on the other hand come off as a stilted united alt on a quest for blood get out
maximum irony overload hahahahahahaha
remorseless everything ive seen him post has been along the lines of i screwed up ccp was merciful i think we got some good things donei dont have a dog in this fight but youre flat out lying
whos lark ban anderson williams imo
you sir must have been reading a different thread than i do at the exact same linkto the topic30days is already easy on him as he could have been perma banned so sadly i have to vote no to a reduction to 15 days
i strongly disagree despite of truly liking lark on nongay way i was advocating permament ban of all his accounts for the stuff he did but thats just me
sorry but thats well worth a permaban
permaban the cheating 
pointing towards specific posts may be more useful hardly anyone is going to read the entire thread and at least the first few pages seem harmless enoughanyway what he did deserves what he gotit would set a bad example for others if the ban were rescinded you can bet that soon others would follow knowing that theyd merely have to fake repentance to get off easy if caught at all
permaban account  trash the character for good measure end of discussion
initial response page 2 page 4page 4i only read the 1st 4 pages and found enough evidence to prove that were dealing with an idiot who cant handle their drink that after their initial reply has quickly resorted to using slang and personal attackscsm is a wonderful thing no
as you can read in the blog larkonis used insider trading it was quickly discovered his accounts were then frozen for investigation and whatever assets he gained from the transactions have been stripped from his accountsthere was no significant effect on the market as a whole and ultimately no personal gain that is how far it went
this is pretty hilarious in a way anyways lark fulfilled all my expectations except for the getting caught part that was just stupid supporting thisalso kinda nice to see ccp actually monitor certain things a bit closer than expected which we wouldnt know if it wasnt for lark
while i have no personal intereset in larkonis trassler being banned i think ccp should set the tone right to prevent further cases like thisif the worst people got to fear is a 30d ban it is highly likely someone is gonna try it gain maybe a bit better prepared with a few friends actually do the trading instead of himselftherefore i think it was bad decision not to perma ban the character
not at all it was clear like the sun that he was breaking the law he got our votes and tried to take an economical advantage from this and thats a shameccp discovered him and he said im sorry oh my god you are sorry and what if ccp didnt discover him he was not a man he was a chairman of the csm and must behavehis attempt was stupid and bad he deserves a permanent ban he should have sent his characters to the biomass prcessing queue for the shame
no disagreement on the bolded parts or the rest actuallybut overall i think his replies are decent enough maybe im too used to reading internet forums by now and filter too muchto me it reads as if he simply acknowledges that hes an idiot not trying to cover it or play it down
he got caught so he has to pay be smarter next time its sad because he was oen of the few interesting candidates this term bringing issues and stuff 25 bill is pocket money too a shame
he has complicated my life beyond measure kept me from being in iceland when the sun came up and kept the discussion of fixing low sec my favorite topic without a champion so i vote permabantrak you owe me a nonnies lamb subisslerellan thrace

in his defence she was hideous
abusing trust given should be harshly punished
banmany pilots just want to use tricky and dirty play in eve because the ccp csm and others left themcorp stole ally disband afk cloak cloak mwd no cloaked ship scanner scammers corrupt alliance and corp leaders station huggers thiefs pos bumpers logoffsky etcmany players will tell this this is the part of game realy  dishonour lolpart of game when he got a high position and accepted a contract he forget the rules  this is not the part of gamewhat happend now csm want to bring back a member who cheatstole etcthat was the second mistake and not first but csm member who wrote this petition dont want to told for common players thishe bought an alliance tourny slot for isk and when got the money  he dont give to customer the slotlooks so a reliable csm memberdear mazzilliu why dont tell this information for the players too for you the most important thing good behavior he demonstrated by buying the rest of us several rounds of drinks lolfirst thing not the honour and the players of game in your position  if we talk about the game and not from the real life
unban larkonis this game needs more metagamers and cheatersbut seriously did anyone expect anything different from this dude a cp clown elected by cp clowns and their alts 
what we didnt buy any at slot for isk we got into at fair and square we sold it for isk but then kept the slot which is known as scamming if you have a problem with scamming you might want to go find a different game to play as theres no problems with it here
hideous or not  spit roast wtf were not slabs of ing beef normally i dont play the feminist role very well i like to cook and i actually enjoy cleaning as long as someone else does the laundry but if some guy actually said this to me in a bar i would plant my foot so far up his ass theyd have to amputate it at the knee to get it outffs ban him ban all his alts ban anything thats ever connected from his ip address and biomass the lot hes a repugnant cad
calm downsome people enjoy that you dont speak for women everywhere
posting again in a thread that by rule should not exist and started by a csm just remember the lesson we learned today children if you buy fat chicks a drink sign legal documents and break the agreement use insider information for personal gain you too can suck enough icelandic  and get away with it
now that it has been proven there are exceptions to ccps rules i have an idea every time any you lose a ship to lag or desync and you petition only to get the we show nothing in our logs simply reply to the gm with a link to the dev blog this thread and offer to buy them a drink according to recent events you should promptly receive your ship back
hes honestly lucky he didnt get permabanned tbh what he did is a gross exploitation of ccp and every legit player in this game the more important question here is why is his ban only temporary i dont understand what makes him better than the average player if i betrayed ccps trust and exploited the market and playerbase like he did would i get the same treatment you guys dont know me and im sure the op of this thread would be tossing a torch under my stake just like the rest of you it doesnt matter if he was in the csm or if he makes you giggle or is a good guy hes a paying customer just like the rest of us if a world leader is convicted of murder should heshe get a reduced sentence this doesnt seem right to mefavoritism failsnot supported simply because no one is better than the rest of us
he did something he was not suppose to he got caught now he needs to do the time let the ban run its course
and some women will let you get away with anything for a round of drinks
does this mean you now support the thread to disband the csm instead of wanting it lockedif the initial tone of that thread offends you feel free to start your own  which i would happily supportunless of course youd rather be represented by populist manchildren whose attitudes to life and personal relationships have barely left the playground
i support a permanent ban of larkonis trassler i would like to see a csm proposal of permanently banning larkonis trassler and his accounts larkonis trassler disgraced himself the csm ccp and the entire eve community his permanent ban should be in order
he never bought the rest of us drinks who he truly ed over with his massive betrayal until i taste a beer paid for by him im voting against this
mazzi youre a joke the csm is a joke and that fat iceland chick told all her fat friends your  is a joke
the message that the csm is giving us is that hey we can manipulate the game when we want cause we only will be banned for 1 month so
ticket to fanfestharborprofit
epic fail on using your main account for the insider trade come on you should have known better than that
why dont you post on your main maddog
my only questionwill this be dealt withlarkonis trassler best trassler free lark
the thread you mention was a proposal to disband the csm for doing what they were supposed to be doing assuming they knew anything about dust 514 to begin with this is a completely different can of worms please dont confuse them
because my main is banned another 42 days for using the word tampon in a humorous way
im not supporting until i get some isk sent my wayisnt that how things work with him
i shall hold your support ransom for 5 billion iskpay up or get your forum privileges poddedwell thats how you chaps normally do it right
while i could believe that he wasnt thinking and he couldnt remember where he knew that tidbit so when he acted on the information he then got banned because he was abusing knowledgei sure as hell wouldnt support unbanning him though
such a fuss over just a couple billionsgeez get the poor guy out of the ban
ban the whole csm
1 for acting quickly to capitalize an opportunity1 for not realizing it was an inside opportunity1 for open honest confession1 for not confessing till after it was discoveredlooks even to me let him back into the game there is work to be doneedit p
wasnt too unexpected id still vote for him he still seems to get the game better than most out there lets give him another chance this time do an epic haul 45 bil is pretty meh
impersonating a ccp employee is bananble free lark hes like nelson mandela but a pirate as well as a terrorist
who said i was impersonating an ccp employeeid think of all people you would not take a post out of contextyou need reading glasses or something
this is the best thread in the assembly room
ccccc
make cloaks run on tears plz ccp
fck off and learn to use forumsbesides that its not an issue
are you kidding me the csm was never designed to be the ccp internal investigation squad they have a human resources division for that reason that everyone says they are the csm is supposed to be the players voice to the devs of ccp that is all nothing else they bring up ideas suggestions bug problems and more to the attention of the devs given the fact that ccp is willing to work with players is saying a lot since many companies ignore their player base completely isaac
you have an extraordinarily large forehead
i really hope they arent thinking of centrally hosting a server farm for an fps gameyou can play eve with a 500ms pingyou can not play an fps effectively with a ping above 250mslocal servers hosted by community members with a system for safe  secure transmission of play data back to eves servers is a must as an australian i can tell you ive never successfully played an fps game on a overseas server they must be geolocated
yes a member of the csm used insider information to try to make money he got booted from the csm and a 30day game ban within 12 hours of doing so the system seems to have worked just fine in this case so how exactly do you have a fight between say bob dusters and goon dusters when one is 90 euro and the other is 90 us if theyre fighting each other it has to be on a single server and if theyre not fighting each other the whole thing is a farce that said i agree with you theyre either going to have to make a nontwitch fpsgood luck regionally segregate itwtf or have issues with pingugh thats one of a few structural concerns i have with dust im not going to chicken little it up like people were doing when it was announced but i do have concerns and this is one of them well see
32yo vrs 14yo  200msdrunkstoned vrs sober  300msaussie vrs us  250msso i see an enemy and react he saw and shot me 34 of a second before  no fps for older drunk aussies pits simply impossible to play fps with 250ms added to your pingeveryone else gets upto 12 a second of advantagelocal servers are 100 required without them we just cant playwho really wants to play with xbox squeakers anyway
hell he should have been permabanned if not that should have had his ass sued for breech of nda at that rate
yes the 00 members conspiracy just look at you and to others csm members all is 00 members like vuk lau you and othersthe csm members just 00 puppets who it was made compulsory for their alliance members that it is possible to vote for just their delegated members only not for anyone elsewhen the other playerbase low sechigh sec want to change a positive thing in game this 00 it is not allowed and it is voted downlike afk cloaking  mwd cloak logoffsky and other dirtytricky and cheater things just see it what the first thing what to want to do itvote for more isk to 00 and lot of 00 idiotismcsm a 00 bllsht nothing else
i have no real interest in 00 other than as source of targets but you are either not very bright or you are an alt of some one who is not very bright
im pleased to state this is something we can both agree on we both care deeply about the cause of user representation in online spaces otherwise your participation in this thread would not be so involvedso drake in the interests of debate how do you feel the csm can be redeemeddo you feel that ccp will be more eager or less eager to share future design decisions with the csm in the wake of this betrayal and if the sharing of this information is withheld then what purpose could the csm have in the futurewe are starting to approach the limitations of a playerrun democracy is there a way forwardim very interested in your opinion
goodthe sooner we get people to stfu and stop whining about the csm needing to be disbanded the sooner someone will get the balls to stand up and push for more intelligent representation and less egotistical epeen waving popularity crapi may be a troll at times but i only do what i do because i am sick and tired of people posting stupid little whine fests waving ego festered epeens all over the place all the while having there hoards of even more foolish pilots showing upi dont hate the individual i hate the fact they are so dimwitteded and narrow sighted that it makes one scream when it comes to rationality of the situationno im not an expert or a know it all and i apologize if i come accross as such but no one can deny the massive population of people who make assumptions and quick conclusions without thinking things through 9 times out of 10 i see people posting posts for one single reason they lost something or they failed to do something becuase someone did something somewhereeve online is a game ffs people are so damn greedy they lose focus of that factwho the hell has the right to dictate what ccp does or say yes im a paying customer yes id like to know what to expect when i log into the game each and every day but i couldnt care less about what ccp does beyond that pointdust 514 or whatever its called is just an another game yes it may affect eve online in some form or fashion but what we have are nothing but assumptions and if theres one thing ive learned people who make assumptions on assumptions are making themselves out to be an ass outa u and meim sorry but thats the harsh cold reality of ituntil ccp fully discloses the details we literally have no right to dictate or guess or judge something that literally does not existthere are far more important things to worry about over some stupid opinion over some game that may get canceled or not even affect the grand scheme of the game in the long runhell i welcome it the idea of interacting with people on the ground with people in space has my corporation clan rather rejoicing some of us cant really afford to play this game but they can afford that game 00 is stagnant its the same ol tune next verse this disrupts status quoi refuse to deny such a new thing because it just might make the game even better than beforeheck you guys have had it too easy whats wrong with a little challenge im a small potatoes ceo of this corp we have to struggle to surviverome didnt last forever it fell in time times changethere is no such thing as a true democracy someone has someones pocket lined in some form or fashion its nothing more than a stupid popularity contest whose got the largest epeen and whose got the most iskthat said the csm will never fully satisfy everyone and it will surely continue to generate people just like youcont
the csm will continue to have my support as there will always be at least 1 rational thinking individual in that bunch who will see us small time guys and say hey hes got a good ideamy idea skill injection was carried to the top 10 list to be delivered to ccpeven if it gets shot down my measily little troll voice got carried up to the ears where it needed to bethat means the csm is doing there jobam i assuming they are doing so noi have faith they will do there job because theres not much else to dothe csm may not accomplish a great deal but there job is not to change this game or change policy or do the things over half the people demandthe csms job is to represent the player base and talk to the devs whether ccp accepts them or not is ccps decision not ours not csmi realize its such a contradictoryhalfassed way of thinking about it but until you get there the csm will never make sense nor will it work in your eyesyou wanted my opinion you got itwhether you accept it or reject it is none of my concern
while im obviously rather annoyed at thisas anyone who has seen me post here can imagine my guess is that ccps craptacular forum software cant differentiate between new threads and new posts for the purposes of time limits so they just hit both or failing that they figure spammers would just start replying instead of posting which has the disadvantage of being harder to spot and kill in any case new forum software is coming soon and itll hopefully be less bad and capable of doing things to better deal with this nonsense
its a good thing
theres no way
of getting around it
nope no way at all

i despise everything about the login trap it is by every definition an exploit as of now we are limited to certain ways of collecting intel local is one surrounding systems is another we have no way of identifying which ships are waiting in space hell we dont even know if they existon the other side of the coin the pilot who is not logged in uses outofgame means to receive ingame intel from the battlefield and make a decision to login which is quite different from undocking or jumping in system based upon this intelthis exploit needs to be addressed whether it be a 5 minute login flag or a login delay something needs to be done to fix it
well eve is a persistent universe after all logged off players arent really gone theyve just shut their ships down to be off the neocom network the time it takes to login is long enough if they had timed it wrong you still would have gotten the kill after all its just ppl sitting in hidden ambush positions waiting for a signal to light your ass upthere thats all the rp reason you need for the login trap sure most of us dont actively rp but its still part and parcel of eve if it wasnt then ccp wouldnt bother with all the chronicals and such
since when does privateers accept such whinerany kind of delay is just stupid i would have lost multiple ships to fw lag if i had any kind of delay on logging back insomeone has been smarter than you cope with it
maybe everyone should remain ingame regardless of login statussure it means a bunch of people in local who arent online but with local removed as it likely will be at some stage that would no longer be an issueships could persist you leave it in space its modules stay active if youre not careful in where you leave your ship you may lose itthis would make eve truely persistent on this levelwith improved scanning and intel systems besides local this could work well
god what a terrible idea
ill make this easy you jump into an est camp that has three yes 3 nyx they get a long range point on you you try to slow boat it back to the gate because you thought you didnt need an mwdbut were getting way off topic fit one dont fit one caldari gun fittings are still balanced
contract based bountyhunting shouldnt require high security status to get the desired effect though if i understand the innitial threadstarter correctly the only reason for changing the system is so that people wont collect their own bounties with alts if they get too high and i also dont think security status requirements would really change that phenomenon anyway its not that uncommon to have a missioning alt with high security statusi wouldnt want bounty hunters to be turned into cops either but even if it was the only way for bounties to work itd be better than it is now as bounty hunting currently isnt nearly going to cover your expenses few bounties are high enough for thatcurrently id go with the option of making it beneficial in some way to have a bounty on your head so that you have to make a risk assesment keep a high bounty for the benefits and live with the added risk of getting shot anywhere and at any time or cash the bounty yourself and lose the benefitsif this where implemented i think some people would even put bounties on their own heads to gain its benefits risking to lose their own money if they get shot itd be a little bit like taking a bet on your own life
walking in stations is vaporware ccp has been talking about since 06 and honestly i dont think we are any closer to it now then we were then
just wanting to know if theres a time frame that the meeting minutes from last weekends meeting could be postedthankssol
if the last couple csmccp iceland minutes are anything to go by your looking at a 3week wait before the sanitized minutes get postedi for one expect them to sadly be further delayed because of ccp focusing on getting the finishing touches on fan fest that takes place in less than a monthif we are real lucky the minutes come out before ff giving those who are able to attend a basis from which to form smart questions to the ccp qna panels at ff i suspect this is just wishful thinking on my part
ill see what i can do to speed things up
you can read an account of the csm experience here with everything covered by the nda redacted while you are waitingmazzillius iceland trip reportedit or you could if ccp didnt censor urls smart people can quote the post and g to the linked address manually after trying to navigate to wwwxxxxxxxxxxcom thanks to the censors

totally for supporting more bonuses for t2 frigsmy hawk is being out dpsed by a tech1 ship in eft with all lvl5 skills and the other one with basic noob skills sigh why even bother getting it except for the range bonus even that isnt that great
assault frigates lacking 4th bonus
its not a matter of people agreeing or disagreeing even its part of status quoall t2 ships get 4 bonuses and assault frigates are t2 ships and should thus get their 4th bonusoriginally the assault frigates 4th bonus was the racial resist which is now built into the hull like all other t2 shipshowever they have yet to recieve their new 4th bonussupported all the way as afs not having a 4th bonus is breaking the current t2 ship standards
supported there is no reason to have one bonus removed from the frigate bonuses for example incursus 10 small hybrid falloff 5 small hybrid damage per frigate level  becomes enyo 5 small hybrid damage per frigate level wtf
supported
1 yeah lets get enough people on here to make ccp give the 4th bonus once and for all seriously t2 frigs are too fragile to bs neuts  light drones bss shouldnt be able to use light drones anywaysi just insta pop each time i fight a bs cus i get ca
in our little chit chat with ccp on this they told us the reason that ass frigs only have 3 boners is because the damage resistance that is innate to the hull was supposed to be the 4th bonus yet they did agree that ass frigs should be looked at again and i personally suggested an afterburner speed bonus anyways i know this isnt a resolution or anything i just want you guys to know it was on the agenda and was duly raised as an issue
maybe this will help think of kinetic missiles as the caldari weapon system missiles are really a weapon system all by themselves the launcher is just a thingy you stick on the ship so they have a place to launch fromso any time a caracal pilot uses the caldari weapon system kinetic missiles a damage bonus applies any time the pilot uses a noncaldari weapon system em thermal or explosive missiles no damage bonus appliesthis is analogous to a rail or laser ship using projectiles  theres no damage bonusproblem solved
supported you make perfect wonderful sense
youll find missiles under the ammunition section on the market cause erm there ammo not the weapon systemthinking about it in a bizarre way does not change the fact that caldari mb tactics  damage type swapping  is not compatible with the damage bonus given per player skill leveli have demonstrated xxx times that against 23rds of targets you either damage switch and get no bonus  or stick with kin and do even less damageplayers who have trained up caldari cruiser 5 have no way to get extra dps against these targets than a player who has only trained level 2if you can show me a way that a pilot who has level 5 cal cruiser can get more dps against an ishtar  example  than a level 2 cal cruiser pilot while flying a caracal  example  i will agree there is no issue
i agree having the bonus only for kinetic also makes it easier for pvpers to predict what type of dmg caldari pilots are more likely to do
supported something must be changed to separate level 5 pilot from the level 2 pilot
supported
again you fail to understand that you have the option to damage swap a laser or hybrid to a lesser extent projectile gunboat cannot it must keep shooting its racialbonused damage types at resists no matter whether they are advantageous or disadvantageous whereas a laser or hybrid gunboat has to stick with his bonused damage typelike your kinetic and do even less damage than if he could reload with antoher damage type so you see the missile boat comes out ahead on that count as to training level 5 in ship getting you no benefit it is a flawed premise upon which you base the argument a harbinger pilot with bc 5 is still doing 5 to lasersmostly em with some thermal damage per level more to his target just as a drake pilot is still doing 5 to kinetic missiles damage per level more the extreme resists of certain select tech ii ships to their backstory enemys bonused damage type is a different matter and in that the drake comes out ahead because he is not stuck with his bonusedbutnegatedinthissituation kinetic at an ishtar all he has to do is use em on shields and then swap to explo on armor to do way more dps unless the ishtar pilot plugged and overcompensated for either resist hole in contrast the harbinger pilot is still stuck doing emtherm at a vaga with insane resists to those damage typesregardless i doubt you will understand the counter arguments that have been presented by many that have replied here i would simply point out that for the number of pages and replies in this thread you have a paltry 17 supporters and the majority of those are undoubtedly pilots who fly only caldari ships and cannot look at the ship bonus situation with much overall perspective your suggestion is going nowhere please read up the earlier posts i for one think some creative things could be done to missileswhich would mainly benefit caldari ships and i gave one set of examples your suggestion is not good for the game it would imbalance it every race is for the most part stuck with one meh ship bonus for example 10 less cap use per level to simply make them not cripple your own ship 5 rof on lol rof arty and falloff afflicted ac projectiles caldari should be no different and in fact your meh bonus is the least limiting
ops argument is based on the sophistic principle that balance is determined by the nature and utility of bonuses rather than comparisons of the performances of shipstry again with a proper argument
qftthis post is about bonuses and the pathetic worthlessness of them on cmbsif i have included other ships in post it is to demonstate the effectiveness of there bonuses as compared to cmbs bonuses
youve just agreed that your own thread is stupid and based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how game balance is determined
noi have just agreed that this post is about bonuses and not ship v ship balanceunfortunettely lots of peops dont seem to understand that yet  but they will
this post was bound to be contentious when i made it i never expected it to be an easy ridethe issue is not immediatelly obvious especially to those who have never flown cmbsas expected most arguments against have been of the ship v ship balance nature by people who have not read and understood the opplus anytime anyone dares to mention anything that might boost caldari there is gonna be resistancei am more than happy with 17 supports at this point this thread is still relativelly youngyour quite correct i think in assuming that only cmb pilots will support this threadthis is due not to them misunderstanding balance but to them understanding the contratictory nature of cmb bonuses versus battle tacticsi have deligentilly read every postif people want to make suggestions about missiles to make them more like guns they should do so in there own topicthis suggestion would not imbalance the gameif that were true then everyone would be flying the double damage bonused heavy assult spewing sacrilidgethis suggestion would bring more balance to the gameinstead of virtually all experianced solo roaming cruisers pilots being  thorax  vexor  rupture  we might be able to include caracal in that list too yes i know there are some solo caras out there  but these are flown by newish pilots who have not had chance to cross train to something decent yet your argument about other bonuses is off topic and irrevelant cmb have other non damage bonuses toothis post is about damage bonuses on cmbs and there woeful natureby woeful i mean a damage bonus that averages out to no more than 16 per level over all encounters when ship is flown by a competent pilot who knows which missiles to fire

the problem with this proof is that the sacrilege is still very limited by its range youre advocating a pickyourowndamage type out to the 100km plus ranges of a caracalif you want to look at this as a bonusonly problem and not draw balance into the equation then youll need to change it to something that is not a damage bonus  but since youve kept it as a damage bonus which changes the way the caldari ships stack up against others it is intrinsically a balance issuedamagetype swapping is as youve said a valid tactic but so is putting small weapons on a vexor no bonus putting lasers on a vengeance no bonus and any number of other commonly made choices that would seem to negate any bonus you get from increasing your racial ship skillagain i am looking at this suggestion as a caldari pilot i fly a lot of missile boats id love for the bonus to always apply and would support something like what was suggested earlier to change the bonus to apply to explosion velocity or explosion radius but then id be sad that my damage output had gone down on the caracal id even take a bonus to targeting range as you cant fire out to your maximum range without sensor boostersbut im happy with the bonuses the way they are now
sure the sac is short range i concuris it overpowered compared to other short range ships i cant point to a cruiser hull that does 100km missile damage with nonracial bonus as an example  because im pretty sure there isnt one in gamei can however point to the raven a bs hulla cruise raven can hit out to 100km with easea cruise raven has a rof bonus of 5 per levelis a cruise raven overpowered when compared to other battleships please ask yourself the above questionsdo you still believe that a rof or damage bonus on other cmbs would make them overpoweredpersonally i can only say that i rarely get to fight a sac  and have never fought against a cruise raven that i can recall this leads me to the conclusions that the eve population in general does not consider rof or dps damaged modded missile boats to be op
caldari are currently the worst pvp ships in the game because most ships have no ken hole plus missiles are currently in a fail state rockets need to be fixed what else is new fix caldari bonuses boost missiles it would be about time
i talked about racial damage types in reply 60sure gallenteamarr are stuck with 2 damage types from there turretsno way on gods green earth can you argue that mini are stuck with 1 racial damage typegallenteamarr gun boat tactics do not include damage type selectionwhen an amarr pilot fighting with lasers or a gallente pilot fighting with hybrids enters combat the choice of ammo depends upon the range which the gallenteamarr pilots wishes to fighthence gallenteamarr tactics are based on rangetrackingoptimal and falloff paramatersthe bonus to damaged bonused gallenteamarr gun boats is either a rof bonus or a dps bonusthese bonuses work at all rangestrackingoptimal and falloff configurations of a fight no matter which type of ammo you choose to firetherefore it is true to say that the hull damage bonuses are compatible with the combat tactics that a gallenteamarr combat pilot is expected to employif 2 pilots of equal competency are compareda level 5 pilot in a gallente gun boat firing optimal ammo out of hybrids will allways do 15 more dps than a level 2 pilot all other things being equalnow compare to caldari cmbscaldari cmb tactics are based on damage type selection not on rangea caldari mb pilot does not have the option of selecting a more damaging ammo based on range  just as a gallenteamarr pilot does not have the option of selecting a more damaging ammo based on resistsif a cmb pilot changes ammo the hull bonus does not apply hence this postcaldari missile boats bonuses are not compatible with caldari missile boat tacticsif 2 pilots of equal competency are compareda level 5 pilot in a cmb boat firing optimal ammo out of missile launchers will do 15 more dps only in 13 engagements when compared to a level 2 pilot
looking at the worst case scenario for both shipsa level 5 harbinger pilot will do 15 more dps against a t2 mini ship than a level 2 harbinger pilot when both pilots are fitting there bonused weapon systemsthis i calculate from 10 more thermem for the level 2 pilotand 25 more thermem for the level 5 pilotremember lasers have ammo which increases damage based on max range of the ammo  range based tactics a level 5 drake pilot will do 0 more dps against a t2 gallente ship than a level 2 drake pilot when both pilots are fitting there bonused weapon systemsthis i calculate from 0 more emexp for the level 2 pilotand 0 more emexp for the level 5 pilotremember missile do not have a range based damage increase based on max range of the ammothey have equal damage to one another but in 1 of 4 flavours  damage type selection tactics i am only interested in discussing damage bonuses in this postgallente damage bonuses are allways beneficial during combat when gallente pilots fit gallente weapons to gallente boatsamarr damage bonuses are allways beneficial during combat when amarr pilots fit amarr weapons to amarr boatsminmatar damage bonuses are allways beneficial during combat when minmatar pilots fit minmatar weapons to minmatar boatsi agree with all of the above  i acknowledge its as things should bei wish i could say the same thing about caldari  but that would be a liewhy should i consent to second rate bonuses for caldari  or cover my eyes and pretend that the playing field is flata bonus to a single type of ammo is not equal to a bonus to a weapons system

01 seconds and no morethe reason its used so much is because you used to be able to check stuff constantlyits also a nerf to interceptors and covert ops ships and solo pvp checking out the system midwarpin addition its annoying as hell when reducing the angle to constantly get that messageso out of the blue rather than trying to discuss or introducing a tiny delay like 01 seconds you kill off the functionality of one of the primary pvp tools in the whole of eve without any discussionspam clicking it was the way you could remain aware of your surroundings and check up on ships in warpinties and covops ships had a role in this as a cloaked covert ops ship or an inty in warp could quickly roam  scan around the systemeverybody always brings a directional scanner but not everyone brings a skilled prober but now were being forced to use probes if we quickly want to check out a system for targetsid rather live with the lag and keep the directional scanner as it wasnot mad just confused and somewhat dissapointed that such a huge change to the dynamics of pvp happens without any warning or discussion as it wouldve instantly been revealed to you that 2 seconds is way too long a delayspamclicking was the primary function of the directional scanner not a problem that needed fixingthe fact that was it being used so much that it was causing a load on the server shouldve already told you that its not something you should remove so easilywhats next 10 second delay in fetching market orders for tritanium

wow they seriously didnt fix thisccp blows
many of the effects are annoying and overdone eccm is another example that comes to mind and then the effects that were great the old cyno jumping caps wormtunnel thingy get replacedthe old sensor booster effect was no better than the new one both are irritating especially in large groups find something less irritating
old fx
talking of this rayoflightandmagicworst effects eva bring back classic effect

i always find that the systems i explore in frequently start to fill up with garbage bookmarksperhaps something simple could be implemented like 36hour bookmark something that only persists for 36 hours then deletes itself in the places menu something like a temporary bookmark bookmark button or even checkbox could allow for creating a temporaryexploration or permanent bookmarki dont know how easy or hard this would be to implement but i dont see the slowdown i get when i open my places folder becoming any shorter and it wouldnt surprise me if its not helping server performance eithersuggestions support
1 for posterity
how about having a scan bookmarks folder which is laid out in days but support none the less
by the time youve set a bm temporary youve already done as many clicks as itd take to just delete it adding a time created column id be for and i think would solve the problem nicely but this proposal doesnt seem like it would solve much
its just 1 bloody click to remove a bookmarksorry but i dont see this as an earth shattering need 
not supportedmake separate bookmark folders i have separate folders for safe spots commonly use stations my anchored gscs have a bookmark folder for exploration sites and select alldelete or make a bookmark folder each day you start and delete the old ones when you deem necessary
this tbh
doesnt go far enough double all of the things youre suggesting and add an extra 4 high slots just in casecome on ccp you know game balance is all about eradicating any possible disadvantage to each ship this is a game we dont want to think or make tradeoffs or any of that nonsense
sounds good
supporting this though all minni boats and all projectile need some serious overhaul
i fly all 4 races p good but i luv flying min the only draw back is the autos and split weapons this sounds good 
i noted in the op that it applies across the board to small medium and large projectiles not sure how many people noticed though
agreed but this might make minmitar the new fotm can you live with that
signed
i doubt it the boost is moderate at most even with a 100 falloff increase youll still be doing more damage with more ehp as amarr minmatar still has fundemental issues such as ehp and sensor strength and lock range that come into play even more in todays pvp environment it makes minnie bs usable not overpowered
agreed i hope ccp will test it on the testserver i doupt your suggestion would be enough but tbh its far better then nothing
supported and please fix the damp boats while youre at it

shouldnt some ships who are designed for speed be able to get away from a huginn by design otherwise the tactic of slowing ships down would work against every single shiptype which doesnt promote varied gameplaythis does however mean that alternative tactics should be available to take down really fast ships currently the only alternate tactic i can think of is to have a really fast ship of your own and that might not make too much sense alternatively you could say that webs are designed especially to be used against the really fast ships and therefor should be largely uneffective gainst other shipsi mostly support the proposed change exept that i wouldnt want the huginn to be effective against every shiptype otherwise you end up with huginns everywhere
i support this thread but not at its current value i feel a 90 web bonus for recon 5 is in orderthe web strength for both minmatar recons and the hyena is way out of line it should be 90 for recon 5 if you choose to keep it the way it is then every other recon also needs there bonus reduced to come in line with the current iteration on the minmatar recons why this wasnt correctly when the web nerf was instituted is beyond me it makes absolutely no sence and makes the minmatar recons utterly useless for its intended purpose
sighif only people were intelligent enough to judge an opinion based upon the merit of the issue and not by the alliance he is a member ofbtw i dont do jita i did once and i will never do it again my kills are mostly at gates
the only thing that i would add to this is a way to alter the insurance payouts based on a characters standing with concord if someone is 100 then the insurance would be reduced greatly if someone has 0 standing or higher then the payout is unaltered this rewards good behavior and again adds a level of risk to crime
on my opinion the problem is pretty easy to solve actualyinsurance contract length places where you do fly etc etc arent that meaningfulthough just consider this wreck x ships in a given amount of time and youll see your insurance fees increase wreck none or few and expect fees cutyou tend to play too much with the insurances stuff  you give your insurer a call every two days  no clue he will end telling you he will insure you no morefor a whileso the maths here are easy to compute much ships broken more insurance fees few ships broken less insurance fees way too much ships broken no more insurancewhat do you think about that 
this old old bug  exploit has been abused by many player over the years and frankly is kinda of redundantthe whole emergency warp feature is also an out dated feature that is more than redundantmy suggestions is simplehard code the coordinates of the log off location and until the player reaches that location via the reentry warp which should also still be in effect even if the player logs off again should only warp into that locationloosing kills to poor judgement is one thing but seriously this is the oldest of the old sort it out
was raised by csm a few days ago i beleive
the first time i heard about this mechanic it was from a guy talking about how he killed the guy anyways any idiot with a scan probe launcher can find the person trivially since you know hes within a million or two km of where you saw him last this doesnt seem like a problem to me  its a tactic more interesting than it is powerful i like it personally
i hate having this happen
just make logging in space unsafenoone should be able to log undocked and disappear no ship should disappear magically if one logged unsafe in space the ship should never disappear but stay there scannable 1 mio away from the spot he loggedfurther no emergency warp or disappear while scrambled within 15 minutes or some longer timei
that proposal is just stupid for all systems without stations 00 wspaceyou would be mostlikely ganked every money and back in your med clone stationbefore your propose something else think it through
this seems like a problem i currently know and lots of people know and use the log on trap dun dun dunn sure not the same thing but it made me think about itjust some guy uses the log off log on method to gain an advantage to the game either by using it for escape in warping or by the log on traop for me thats an exploit
i have a feeling you dont like it because its not stupid but because either your using that method yourself a lot or because you know youll become very vulnerable yourself maybe people should try to use another tactic beside the log offlog on
well ok make logging in a pos ff safe besides logging docked nothing elsethat should be enough if you fly to a hostile region you have to come back for logging or you will die
lets assume i am roaming in 00 it is getting late and i cant get home so i log out but my ship stays in space and i get killed by a prober passing through a few hours after i loggedhow is that useful
i gotta agree with no way on that were not all station huggers some of us roam deep space many many jumps from a friendly place to dock for some of us logging out in space is a normal way to end the day it has nothing to do with hostiles or agression its just like pulling into a dock
why does it have to warp you away couldnt it just log you outin where you are currently located without warping you
until you realize that if they do the logonlogoff quick enough like using 2 computers  clients they are invulnerable when you land right next to them and you cant put a point on themhad it once with an obelisk the guy kept logging off and on we probed his ewarp spots like 15 times and had a whole fleet sitting right next to it but nobody was able to lock it
i can respect the frustration of having this tactic used against you however i think that this aspect of the logoff mechanic is currently balanced the reason that it works the way it does is because more often than not people logging off in dangerous space happens by accident their client crashes or something goes wrong in their network and believe me problems like that occur a lot more frequently than the people who abuse this mechanici dont support the idea that you should stay in the same spot you originally ewarped to on logoff however i do strongly support that the 15 minute aggression timer should be reset if you are aggressed and logged out
because if you lose connection in the middle of a fight youd generally prefer that the game at least try to get you out of danger
this big timethe one thing that keeps me from supporting any sort of logging proposal is my expeince as an information technologistthe science of internet dictates that you can never ever know the real reason for someone logging off in the middle of anythingyou naturally assume they did it but how do you know it wasnt joe schmoe driving his damned backhoe over the ing backbone fibre optic trunk in some obscene random location knocking out internet for the region true story  you dont and yet you say well its there problemccp however ignores you regardless of your wardrum banginlike it or not this issue is not likely going to resolve in anyones favor
do it already not even asking for modal windows and stuff i just want a possibility to set where my shipcenterpoint is displayed move it to the right or left now my ship is split in half when going dual screen
yes please
like it and want it
currently many players spam their directional scanner in lownullsec to look for the probes that could be scanning them out while strongly i agree that lownullsec needs a buff i dont think that giving low security and nosecurity systems the extra security of scanning out probes is the answer probing is meant to be a covert activity and used as a tool to surprise someone remove probes from the directional scanner we can work on buffing lownullsec in other ways
thats seriously not funnyplease tell me your on space crack
you needed to ask
well the last few posts hes done or proposals for that matter have been refreshing that is until today
consider my arguments and give me a legitimate counterargument before accusing me of drug abusebut seriously checking the dscanner for probes is something done primarily in lownull security to the guy who is paying attention it buffs that space by making him virtually invincible i dont think that adding security to lownull sec is the way to buff it that just defeats the point of the systems in the first placeim interested to hear you counterarguments
the game needs t2 shuttles asap
awesome well formed idea
as long as they can fit a covert ops cloak and warp at 15 ausec with a subwarp speed of over 9000 and carry 5000 m3 of cargo im downand then i woke upwhy what possible purpose could they serve that a t1 shuttle cant
epeen booster duh
ive been referring to speed ceptors at t2 shuttles for years now theyre like regular shuttles that go 20 faster fit mwds warp 225x as fast hold 8x the cargo have a fair bit more hp and can even pvp in a pinch skill requirements are a bit high for shuttles but its still not too hard if you can come up with a ship better at the t2 shuttle role than that im all ears
right so youre trolling thanks for the confirmationand here ive been using my firetail for that ceptors you say
on a thread demanding t2 shuttles asap you bet
agreed
lol ok you win you made me laugh when i was having a craptastic day troll away you are officially my heroat least until i get home and have some baileys
im a gallente pilot and the comet really doesnt compare to the ares in this role firetails make a fine substitute for the ducttape crowd though anything that autopilots from point a to point b faster than a t1 shuttle is fine really
yep i would buy one
i would definetely buy one of these sounds like a great idea im surprised ccp has not implemented this yet
ok i have just been informed that ccp once again is getting weird ideas in there heads about how the game is playedread thislinkageso basically they are going to nerf the titan so that it can only be fired at a single ship  i mean come on nerfing the titanthey should be in fact upping the power of the dd device no nerfing itif you support me on this and dont want ccp to nerf the titan then vote yes for this petition
hey chicken little yeah you mr sky is fallinglinking to an outside source is called rumor mongeringnot supported until i see something from a local source
im not quite sure id support this either most of all because i dont know the design philosophy behind it but i can guess that they want to get rid of the liniair bigger is better dynamics especially since resources are becoming less and less of an issue in the game i wouldnt want to see titans popping up everywhere making them more powerfull will increase the likeliness that i will end up seeing them everywhere on the flipside i do want to have to be afraid of them and im unsure if i would be when the doomsday device gets nerfed either way id want to know more before i back you up on this one
titans are the worst ship ever introduced into eve
lol nerf them to hellok seriously whats been hinted at seems pretty good to me otherwise the game will eventually become titans online because as it is now get enough of them together and it is
ok i see your points are valid but the point of a titan is its meant to be big and epic and not many ppl can fly them because they are expensive etc so making them weaker isnt gd  i know why goons will like it cause nobody will be able to wipe out there swarms of rifters anymore in a single fell swoop lols
i hope this is a troll
dds do not a fun game make im quite glad they are being rebalanced titans are way too much iwin and not enough ilose shut up and wait for the devblog before whiningisaac
well think about it this way they only kill glass cannons and not much else if u have descent resists so really its you who wins against titans and its alot of potential ilose for the titan pilot actually
problem is the more time passes the more people will be able to fly them as i said before resources arent much of a problem anymore and skills are a matter of time if you want to make them strong but exclusive youd need to somehow limit the number of titans that can exist in the game at any one time which id prefer over making them weaker but i reckon ccp would have thought of this and their reasons for choosing to make them weaker are probably more complicated than there are going to be too many of them
titans need a boost to their defensive abilities not their offensive this is about the right level of offensive powerif they can survive on the battlefield replace their laughable gun dps bonus with a 15level resist bonusor more and you might get somewhere theyd still need to travel inside a carrier blob but at least theyd have a chance of living in real combat if they did
did you ever consider that you shouldnt be able to fit the biggest of everything on every ship often downgrading to the smaller turrets doesnt really harm you and frees up resources for other modulesfitting always be a matter of compromises
i hear the scorpion excels in wh space against sleepers in pvp situations not so much because its primary target so often what i would like to see changed is the coveter not the ship itself but the skill requirements i believe the skill requirements for the coveter need to be lowered a little the difference between flying a coveter and flying a hulk is 36 hours of skill training or less alternatively the difference between a retriever and a covetor is a level five 4x skill and a level five 3x skilltheres really no point in even going for a coveter due to the skill requirements so similar to a hulki propose the following nerf to covetor skill requirementsmining barge ivastrogeology iv
and so onthis tbh although the vigilant is a gank cruiser and setup as such works fine see this link gila needs a more solid tank and more pg  cpubut i do agree with all this post and the op the eos needs its drone bandwidth back or the drone bay bonuses moved to drone damage like a domi they are fairly pointless otherwiseedit was the link i forgot to add it 
not on an omenit only has the pg to fit 5 medium pulses and an mwd and no pg for a cap booster or a plate but simply lacks the cpu for much of anything elsewith a proper pg and cpu boost enough to fit an 800mm plate with guns mwd and dcu ii it becomes a more viable shipas a tech i cruiser it shouldnt require a lot of skill to be fitted properlyvigilant needs to be able to do more damage in order to be a viable choice over a thoraxisk wise a thorax is always better as you can lose 45 of those for every vigilant if not moreand the times that your tank is tested to the point where it would die if it was a thorax but not a vigilant are very raregenerally youll either get blobbed in which case it wont matter what ship youre in better cheap thorax then or youll win with some tank to sparealso keep in mind a faction ship a rare one at that attracts a lot of attention negating any additional tank a vigilant might have over a thoraxwith more damage however it can kill targets faster and get out sooner making it a more viable optionadditionaly it might be nice to give it 25m3 more dronebay space not bandwidth so it can carry 5 meds and 5 lights giving it more versatility in what it wants to do ecm drones or damage drones
i want a hotkey to drop drones we have one to attack to return and to scoopwe can assign drones to groups so why not a drone group deploy hotkeyother than that drone ui is fine by me
the issue is the lag and drop down window i agree with the above poster hot keys for all drone actions would be a better work around something needs to be done for us drone users and making it easier to use them loading them on the hud would make it fun to load them like a gun and launch them
i wouldnt say no to the ability to assign hot keys to my drone groups so i can launch them but i have never found myself saying omfg why the hell cant i do thisand before the obligatory you dont use drones yes yes i do not to the extent of a gallente pilot but youd be silly not to use them on a typhoon  i mean they give you all that lovely space for them
1 never said you didnt uses drones i would be lead to believe it is not your primary choice when using weapons by your response2 adding features that allow drone boats to utilize thier hud instead of drop down menu would make drone use easier and more fun
please dont misunderstand that comment wasnt directed at you per se but at the hordes of screaming flametrolls that will eventually descend on this thread using it as an argumentside note my cynacism is showing today its been one of those daysthis would be an accurate statement drones for me are like decoys that happen to shoot back they provide a distraction to the enemy so i can shoot them while they shoot my dronesthat said im not sure a hud addition is the way to go unless it replaces the drop down box in some fashion so i can move it away from my guns and stuff if i want to i dont need additional circular objects cluttering up my gun displayhot keys i have no opposition to i would probably actually learn them if they included the one to launch a specific group of dronesfor instance if you can map a hot key combination altdx where x is a number from 1  0 so i can can create a group called defense map it to altd1 and another called reppers and map them to altd2 then when i hit altd1 it launches the defense group if i hit the recall hot key or altd2 it recalls the first group and in the second example autolaunches the second group once the first ones are stored
me stands on soapbox for ui moddabilityahem while i like the sentiment this is too narrow a solution to too broad a problem i dont think itd be the right fix so i cant support it decent idea just not the right one
despite the fact there are currently useful methods to split up large stacks in game they can be quite timeconsuming or repetitive this proposal is to offer another means that would complement the current methodologythe idea is to split a large stack with one simple request into 2 or more stacks of approximately the same size per stack depending on the size of the original stack and the selected size of the new stacksthere would be two methods that a player can use a basic and extendedadvanced method these additions would complement the existing methods that we all use today i have summarized the discussion that has occurred thus far and integrated most of the ideas into a single proposalbasic methodthis method does not require a major change to the existing split stack window but contains 2 minor additionsthe addition of a split into multiple stacks checkboxthe addition of a show more options drop down arrow similar to the one on the contracts window this would bring up the advanced features of the split window and would also default to the state the player last put it ina player would then use the following steps to split a stackselect the stack that is to be divided into many smaller stackswhile holding down the shiftkey drag and drop the stack so the split window appearsat this point enter the quantity that the stacks will contain after the split has completedbefore hitting ok ensure a checkbox option called split into multiple stacks is selectedhit okadvanced methodthis method contains an additional numerical component that the splitting mechanism would have to take into account on top of the 2 additions made to the basic method the advance window provides the followingthe addition of a numerical entry box for the total number of stacksthe show more options is replaced with show less optionsa player would then use the following steps to split a stackselect the stack that is to be divided into many smaller stackswhile holding down the shiftkey drag and drop the stack so the split window appearsat this point enter the quantity that the stacks will contain after the split has completedif the advanced options was not already expanded the player would click the show more options arrowensure a check box option called split into multiple stacks is selecteda numerical amount would be entered into the number of stacks entry boxhit oksome examples areexample 1the player has a stack of 48 blocks heshe wants to split into 16 stacks of 3 they would simply bring up the split window enter 3 into the quantity entry box and ensure the split into multiple stacks options is checked then they would hit ok they would then get 16 stacks of 3 blocks in their hangerexample 2the player has a stack of 50 blocks heshe wants to split into 16 stacks of 3 plus a single stack containing the remainder they would simply bring up the split window enter 3 into the quantity entry box and ensure the split into multiple stacks options is checked then they would hit ok the would get 16 stacks of 3 blocks plus 1 stacks of 2 blocks in their hangerexample 3the player has a stack of 1100345546 units of tritanium and wants to created 10 stacks of 100000000 they would simply bring up the split window enter 100000000 into the quantity entry box ensure the split into multiple stacks option is enabled expand out the advanced options if not already done so and enter 10 into the number of stacks entry box the would get 10 stacks of 100000000 plus one stack of 100346546 units
uh not an issueive never had any trouble with stack splitsi just hold shift and drag put the number in rinserepeat
aye tis the rinse repeat part that can be tiresome on larger stacks and i never really stated it was an issue was more looking at it as an enhancement of the ui interface
while i disagree with the motivation behind this idea i agree this could be a useful featureas for the feature itself this could be implemented easily enough with an advanced button that opens the window up a bit more like when you want to place a sell order it opens it up to be able to specify how many stacks you want at the quantity specified the computer would then attempt to split into that many stacks of that amount any left over would be in another stack or if you cant make that many stacks like for example trying to split a stack of 50 into three stacks of 20 only two stacks of 20 would come out and 10 left over in the original amountfor the above its really just a heh thatd be cool rather than a real needas to the ops need of putting ice into gsc cans the current mechanic works pretty good just drag the stack of 50 to the gsc can youll get a warning saying the whole stack wont fit and asking you how much you want to put in there but the max amount 3 is already in the box and you just hit okso dont split the stacks first just drag the stacks into gscs and hit ok to the warningsedit for emphasis
aye a slight alteration of the basic idea possibly more refinedaye i know this mechanic quite well and the ideas was to provide the player a means of optimizing that process by providing a quick method of splitting a stack all the player has to do is dragdrop the stacks and not have to worry about another pop up each time heshe does so
a sound ideai would prefer 2 inputs rather than a checkboxinput 1 how many per stackinput 2 how many stacksif you have a very large stack of stuff  you may not want to unstack it all
good call keep the ideassuggestionscomments coming ill readjust the proposal after some more discussion and refine it with all the ideas presented
while i dont have any strong arguments for it i dont have any really convincing ones against it either im not opposed to having it labelled a nice to have
this is probably the best version i think just make sure that the second box is the number of stacks and it defaults to 1 so that anyone who wants to use it like the status quo can but yeah sounds like itd be handy supported
there are many ships in eve too many even for an experienced player to remember however some ships are similar to each other there are classes of ships like destroyers interdictors and such its easy to remember classes as its only a few of them compared to the number of shipshaving a ship class column in overview would help many players distinguish a titan from an electronic attack frigate before its too late this would bring the learning curve down considerably
kicking you guys out of 00 to lose motherships in lowsec to tri of all people is something i will tell my grandchildren aboutill support it just because i feel so bad for you guys
after a couple revisions youve got a very solid post yaay think thats the first time ive ever admitted that pi do hope that anyone who knowingly implements or participates in the implementation of a known exploit receives the ban hammer  regardless of their history or affiliation actually it was pretty funny tri failed hard after a semisuccess ddos attempt i switched computers and logged in at half armor after drifting outside the pos i turned around dropped a booster overloaded the bottom rack and waited i entered the shields at 6 structure and everything was burned upafterwards the fc emo raged on ts and proceeded to setup a fail pos bowl then came back another more successful bowl once out of shields that was all she wrote 15 armor and 6 structure later i saw the pilots pod for the first time in 2 years sad to think you can get under someones skin so much theyd risk getting banned for using known and clearly denounced exploits
tri does not dos attack
yaay was why insurgency failedhe thinks talking fast and saying alot of words makes him a good fci remember a time him doing his infamous warp in warp out be aligned tactic and whittled his own fleet down from 30 bs to like 3 and was still telling them warp in warp out with over 60 hostile bs on fieldyou should be publicly executed in a station when ambulation goes live and your biomass displayed on the bar
according to the battlereport posted on shc they got the pos password from a local member who mailed it to a fleet member then they proceeded to warp into the tower at the nyxs position with the password so they entered the shield and bumped the nyx out
please read this
as much as this looks like a massive failthread i sort of have to agree with the ops broader point pos bowling was declared an exploit years ago but without gamemechanic changes that needs to be enforced pretty savagely in order to actually be a meaningful rule im in favour of rules enforcement
agreed with hersch ops rep is less than stellar at best but the point is valid none the lesssupported
youre welcome to focus on my belief that i was ddosd instead of the facts it just illustrates what you dont want the attention to be placed on  the manipulation of a well known and documented exploitas i said on shc i accept that i could be wrong about the ddos though the connection issues and timing were suspicious i like how the spin you and your chronies have been using is that i made bad decisions that day pretty hard to make a bad decision when youre sitting inside your personal pos at 0km from the tower no
the irony of this post is i mentioned no alliance names no specific incidents i kept it on the broad view specifically for that reason i want rule enforcement because to date there has been none tri outted themselves on that incidentanyone who knows skrypt knows hes done some very crazy things in that mom and should have lost it quit a few times i wont defend his loss because there are factors that were legit that played into it dieing that could have been avoidedwhat i do not want to deal with is pos bowling in any form short of a pos pw change by the tower operators the only bouncing mechanic that should be legal is manual normal speed bumping anyone who knows me knows my number one rule is fair play i dont mind ass hattery i dont mind meta gaming so long as its within the boundaries of fair play when people go outside those boundaries i dont tolerate itthe insurgency guy laugh
since someone else already posted the mechanic one of the 3 forms of bumping currently possible is as followsset a warp point in or behind the shields warp in at the appropriate range during warp change the pos pw again on your ship this creates an immediate ejection from the tower of the ships warping in at the high speed velocities youd expect if the tower owner had changed the pwthere is a mechanic the devs added to game to prevent this from happening it is why you cannot change the pos pw once you are inside the shields if you read the exploit rules the most apparent part is that you cannot use unintended mechanics that prevent the victim from any sort of response to said actionif tri had warped into the tower and manually bumped out the player or had the tower pw changed there would be no arguement for the bowling
the title mostly says it all im proposing that the entire production pipeline of eve online becomes transparent so that we can see exactly what features are coming how they are prioritised how they are discarded or moved up or down the production pipeline etc etc this will have several effects1 itll decrease the feature suggestions a lot because i suspect a lot of features that are being suggested are allready in the pipeline anyway2 itll make more clear to the playerbase what direction eve is going in on the long run and players will be better able to anticipate on those changes and plan ahead3 itll make more clear how and why plans change or get canned and what the overal design philosophy isccp has always made it a big issue to be as transparent as possible and i think im not the only one who really likes this about them its not only very educational it also creates a very human bond between the players and ccp as a company i can understand that marketingwise opening up the production pipeline completely appears like a big can of worms but i really think that the community can handle it well ccp has been quite forthcoming with upcoming expansions so far and i think it could be taken to the next levelim sure there are cons im overlooking but by all means tell me about themnote that im not saying that making the production pipeline transparent means players should have more influence over it just that they can see whats going on
nope ccp blizzard valve and many other companies have 0 obligation to do this its called a you do not get to talk about this feature until we decide you get to paper sorry forgot the name want this changed good freaking luck its how businesses have always been run edit btw how much more transparency do you want ccp is incredibly open with what they are releasing and look to the player base for comments suggestions and more but this is still not enough geezisaac
4 wordswhenpigsfrakkingflygot it goodwhy do you think they call it capitalismplease go take your pipe dream somewhere else
so regardless of how unlikely it might be would you like to see it happen
maybe but im not wishing for it id rather that ccp focus on releasing quality products than worrying about those that are buying it isaac
the real question you need to ask is why we dont give a rip in the first placein truth i dontim content with what i havegettingccp is doing fine its the yahoos who go emo over the hint or suggestion of some sort of change without much thought or thinking who have the problemgranted there may be some glitches or bugs but so far ive not had any earthshattering omgwtf problems in the game my experience has been mostly positive since i started playing eve as far as customer satisfactiongranted im not saying 100but im not going wackoape either
im not saying ccp are doing things wrong far from it im just interested and would like to see more of how and why they do things to learn from making the production pipeline transparent isnt so we the players could correct anything its just intended to give additional insightyou may not give a rip about it because your interests arent the same as mine and why would they be though would you lose anything if they did make the production pipeline transparent
me this has nothing to do with meim just a paying subscriberthis has everything to do with ccppeople tend to forget that ccp is in charge and at large when comes to evethey choose to disclose or to not disclose they choose to listen or to not listenthe only power you have is whether you pay them or notyour so called freedom ends right therewhen you take that prespective youll suddenly realize that demanding anything to do with eve online that is not rationally within reason is pointlessthe csm for example people keep screaming disband because they are useless they are shortsighted and refuse to accept the fact that ccp chose to pick a select few people to listen too on top of the thousands of players in this gamethey didnt say the csm would have any power to do affect changes they just get a front row seat to chat but it stops therepeople cant be content with that they want moar so they can complainwhinegripe about any number of thingsthose who report bugs and exploits are never satisfied due to the fact that everyone has an opinion on the matterfurthermore transparent production line to what end to complain more about stuff that may or may not get in the gamedo you even have an inkling of an idea of how game development worksits much like trying to build something from scratch your going to run into a ton of mistakes failed ideasand other garbagedo you really want to add that kind of fuel to the epic failness that tends to clutter up the boardsi apologize if im harsh but like isaac over yonder some of us thinker trolls grow tired of breaking of baseball bats when people gripe over the most stupidest thingspoint and case the titan rumor a rumor no ccp dev logs no posts in the eve forumsjust a referenced article that could have been painted or spotlighted to look like anythingand things can change rapidly in eve we have no right to judge or predicttransparency would tempt everyone to become a serious pain in ccps sidethey have enough stress to put up withthey reserve the right to hide the greater intent of there plansand dont kid yourself they are in it to make money and they know that ing off there clientele as a whole not the one idiot in every crowd is not a good ideawe got plenty to complain about as it is ccp will not open pandoras box for satisfaction of full disclosure
stop allowing trial account characters to post links in local and npccorporation corp channels then the spammers will need to activate the account before they can start spamming or they will face cspa protection either way they will go broke in minutesif the trial character will try to post a link where it would be blocked the eve client would display a notification window stating that the player may not post a link there before he activates his account and informing him that he can pass a link by opening a private converstation with a player he wants to send a link to or he can send it via evemailthat way we ensure no pilots will be harmed only the new players who would insist on sending a link to large amount of people sounds like a description of spammer to methis issue has been kinda brought to csm over a year ago here by pilot named adonis 4174 who saidpilot named tarminic then repliedand i agree however www dot asshat dot com is not clickable so it is much less effective for spammersi also believe ccp devs and qa will make sure that replacing a dot with something will be impossible or extreamly hard so also extreamly ineffective for spammers
while this solution is not perfect nor fool proofit will make things a little more difficult for the jerkssupported emphatically
case 1 undercutters arent willing to undercut by sizable margins and just fight for 001 because its cheap in this case the status quo is fine  do a big undercut and sell your stuff case 2 undercutters dont much care about the price and will follow any undercut you make in this case this proposal wont actually help you in practice its of course a little bit of each but if you want to undercut and sell your stuff fast and find that you cant its not the current game mechanics preventing you from doing so its the fact that you havent undercut far enough to drive out your opponents a mechanical change wont help you
after having to think about it more i think that this could actually spell the death to almost any kind of margin trading at least on more expensive itemsyoure just moving the problem from the winner being whoever last lowered the price by 001 isk to the winner being whoever put the price low enough so that one tick lower would be the buy price might as well just start at that price and now marginal profit is cut down to the price of the tickof course thinking that through all the way and many marginal traders wouldnt stand for that would leave trading as a way of life maybe eve and what youve effectively done is cut down maybe you would see that as a benefit but cutting out competition would actually be bad for the marketsanyways its all my speculation
i dont want to sell my stuff fast i want the market to move and current game mechnics at least hinder that because the effect of a supplydemand imbalance is soften by the possibility of 001 underoverbids instead of requerig meaningful underoverbidson a side note very interesting that almost anyone speaks specifically on selling stuff and unercutting beleive it or not i was pesterd by pennying mostly on the buy side
dretzle by marginal trading do you mean a trading strategy where you buy something quickly as a best buyer and then attempt to be sell it quickly as a best seller if so please consider the followingi mentioned in the op post that i expect the bidask spread to become narrower and that is a benefit to everyone you are right i was not exact here it is beneficial to all real buyer or seller as opposed to speculatorsnow i agree to the extent that the narrower ba spreads ruin the profitability of a marginal trading strategy however any speculator can easily find other and much more profitable trading strategies as the market also becomes more volatile  supposd he is willing to do a bit of thinking cf the last paragraph of my sep3 post for an idea side note a marginal trading strategy is not only not profitable but also quite risky in a volatile market the market can drop 10 percent easily just as you bought the goodsone of my main goals with this proposal is in fact to create a market environment where speculators has much more possibilities to profit than in todays market this can even attract more player towards eve
ok this may be a small thing but when you create your own topic why should you support  you already created the topic in the first placealso you shouldnt be able to use your alts to support your own topic too 
well interesting thoughtbut the supports dont really mean much basically you are telling csm that you also like this idea if only one man and all his 30 alts post all in support of a topic even if they choose to consider it ccp or csm will really only endorse it if it passes through their filters as wellyou dont need to do an extra post to support yourself you already did by your topic your extra post is because you like a thumb under your picture alts giving thumbs up also means little this is really a tossing proposals to csm channel not a democratic the most thumbs up wins channel
how can you tell the difference between an alt and an accountgranted most are obviousbut some arent
ironically i support my topic loldamn i hate that 5 minute waiting come on 
the thumbs thingy and multiple alts support the topic could also influence the subject or matter in question someone with enough knowledge with the public can bend it however he likeslike i said minor problem but i feel like this should be addressed this means 1 account 1 thumbs and thats it
this is a game breaking issueplease fix it
oh cry me a river you people wont support any changes to afk cloaking why should we bother with a petty detail like this working as intended suck it up
afk cloaking is a sensible intended mechanic being decloaked by incorporeal beacons is not
me takes tears from said whiner and dumps into fuel tank for cloakkeep it coming keeeeep it comingsupported
sounds like youre the one crying
not working as intended good to fix
still all this support and no one has gone and looked for the beaconits there if you show all a little teeny box with a couple antenna sticking outunless ive been flying into different asteroid belts than everyone else i dont get why youre all claiming the beacons are invisiblebut i do agree cloaks should only be affected by larger more substantial objects
this is the real point whether it is actually there or not i havent yet had the time to log on and even try to see people just agree that warping to the center of a belt with only the teeny tiny beacon near you should not decloaki dont think anyone really cares whether the beacon is visible however if this is ccp intended game mechanic then they wont change it so no harm
you dont care because you havent had the problemits there there are always beacons at any warp to zero point in belts missions and other various thingsthey just tend to not be on the overviewive never had the issue as i tend to warp to a different distance as opposed to 0 that or a bookmarkbut im not going to deny the potential pitfall it presents
please reread my post my first sentence might have been misleading but i was referring to the part of the quote that i boldedi do care i do fly cov ops and i would like this changed what i was saying that i dont care about and i think others in this thread dont care about is whether the beacon is visible and hence why would they bother logging on and looking for it
simple realy like the corp hanger i would like to see the station hanger have tabs that can be labledcurrently to seperate drones ammo modules and so on is to use station vaults and the sortby tabbing the hanger you could make a tab for every type of object you want to store in that tabthis would make searching ur hanger that must faster and easier
this is a complicated issue and really needs to be looked atgriefer corps get to wardecc industrial and mission corps looking for easy kills and big loot quite often against targets who to be honest are simply not capable of defending themselves this is lets face it legalised piracyi am not against piracy in fact my main is a full on 10 lowsec bad bad man piracy is a perfectly valid career path with enough drawbacks to make it actually quite a hard path to walk and rightly so no pirate i know would have it any other way we earn our reputation by being dangerous and hated and wear our 10 with arrogant pridepiracy is in fact not very lucrative we dont do it for the iskhowever and here is the problem a bunch of wannabe and to be frank often fail pilots who are afraid of targets who shoot back form a grief or in their words empire wardecc corp they then have complete immunity form any sort of sec hit or drawback related to piracy and yet that is quite simply exactly what it isits gonna be a difficult one to solve but i think the people on the recieving end of griefers who randomly attack non pvp corps deserve some thought here
no they dont deserve any thought until they cant evade wardecs without reprecussions either this might be looked at as a part of an complete overhaul of the wardec systemi also dont see why do you bring pirating to this you seem more like a pvp player who takes pride in a low security rating then an actual pirate to me pirates attack others to plunder them and make as much profit as possible that is why they often try to ransom people instead of destroying their shipspods wardeccing a juicy highsesc target seems exactly something a true pirate would doyou compare wardecs to legal piracy and in a way that is true in sort of the same way that taxes are just extortion money paid to the government or how murder is bad but murdering people who have been judged to be guilty is okay that 10 rating isnt there because you killed people and looted them it is there because you disregarded and broke commonly agreed rules that govern such actions and as a consequence you are outlawed since you showed your inability to abide by those commonly agreed upon rulesfrom my perspective i dont see a problem to be solved or at least i dont agree with you what the problem is i dont see any reason why certain corps should be exempt from wardecs just because they dont focus on pvp or arent looking for a fight at that particular time when you have to fight only when it suits you or only fair fights we are talking about a sporting event not a war do not want
im not saying anyone should be exempt from wardeccs i do think however that wars should be justified in some way or failing that there should be some sort of consequence for what is essentially piracyit makes a mockery of the idea of concord etc that a totally non aggresive corporation can be legally attacked without consequence for no reason other than to pirate it either for the loot or for an easily filled killboardthe only reason i brought up the fact that i also have a pirate is so that no one can say im just shedding carebear tears this is about consequences not about stopping the possibility
hire mercsfight back or learn to fight backwelcome to eve where you man up and fight for the priviledge of doing something against other players
what i am essentially saying is there should be no room for legal piracy and yes war evasion shouldnt be possible a legal war should always stand there should be the possibility of illegal wars being cancelled the wardeccers suffering standingssec loss or something like war crimes basically if there is absolutley no valid reason to have wardecc a corp then it should be a war crimelike i said it is a difficult situation but at the end of the day you get this kind of scenario someone pays their sub spends all their time building a totally passive indy corp gets decced by griefers loses everything poss isk everything and so quits the game that is basically a loss to everyone except the griefer who suffers no consequences whatsoeveri am all for pvp including piracy but piracy should be where it belongs outside the law
its not outside the law it isnt piracythere is always a reason for a wardec you looking like someone that isk can be extracted from by forceif you dont like it go and play another game that doesnt allow pvp if you find such so distressingat the end of the day ccp have already given you the tools to defend yourself if you choose not to then well you are going to die a lotthe problem is with you not the game
ey check out the touchy griefer look i wasnt talking bout what is game mechanics i was talking about what makes sence and what doesntclearly i am in fact a pvper quite a successful one actually i am just making a statement on here about a mechanic that i think is geared towards making griefers who actually cant fight a real fighthave an easier time of it than people who want real pvpso dont be touchy about it mate just grow a pair and do some real pvp against other pvpers yes the op is my altthis is a forum for people to actually aire their views on things they think need looking at i think the wardecc system needs looking at griefing indies isnt war its griefingso unless yo have something constructive to say rather than resort to insults i suggest you go read cp
you sure your a piratebecause it sounds like your a carebear who cant stop cryingseriously if your such a badass pirate why the hell are you whining about something you already know the answer tooyes wardecs are broken but whining about it is not a solution now is it
this is exactly the placed to bring up things that you think need changing or it was perhaps now it is just a place for the forum warriors to vent their frustrationnever mind maybe ill just change the thread to what is the point of the csm since it is clearly now just a place for forum trolls to take their ignorance for a walkso since there isnt a single relevant answer on here it may as well be locked might as well lock the whole csm system while your at it
your not very bright are youdid you even bother to read research do your homeworkor is it really you being the so called hated forum warrior whining about somethingyou know most people who post here have solutions to the problems they point outyours is just a side of cheese and crackersman up for crying out loud your patheticif youd bother to search previous wardec threads youd see your just repeating every other sorry excuse of a whine threadhow about some solutions to the problem eh
got to laugh i just took a quick look across the csm forums and you are on pretty much ever thread i looked at drake and guess what its an insulting post on pretty much every threadi reckon someones overtired got school in the morning better ask your mum if you can have an early supper and glass of milk oh and stop whacking off over anime pics too it isnt good for you dont worry mate eventually maybe after puberty ends you might get to kiss a girl then you can join the adult humans that confuse you so much we all know an angry teenager when we see one
do you see me throwing a carebear fit over wardecsdo you see me acting like a total child claiming to be some hot shot pvper and complaining about getting greifedwho is it again that is wasting time here again i seem to have lost track of thathell i should be the one complaining im the one getting greifed right now in a wardecbut you dont see me complaining why is thatif you cant figure that out you dont belong here
back to the topica you define griefing wardecs as those that are made against a corp that cant defend themselves highsec industry corp for example also there is no reason for these wardecs other than griefingcounter argument 1 without doing away with the war dec mechanic completely there is no way to tell if there is a reason for the war decs here are a few examples that would look exactly like a griefing war dec but are actually not  industry corp a wants to reduceremove competition from industry corp b a hires mercenarypiratepvp corp c to war dec b  industry corp a smack talks pvp corp b war dec  industry corp a sleeps with girlfriend of friend in corp b war decespecially the 3rd situation there is no way to tell any of the above situations apart from a griefer war dec not enforceable means not doable2 any industry corp should have a plan for war decs this is an intended part of the game some options are 3rd party mercenary corp part of larger alliance to help combat wing making yourself not appetizing for a fight if it is not profitable or the other corps cant get their kicks from blowing up your fancy ships they wont do itb these corps have no drawback to their war decscounter argument1 there is a cost to all war decs you might argue that the cost is too low that might be a different thread but there is a cost in iskc as the other posters mentioned pointing out and discussing what you think is a broken game mechanic is for the other forums on this forum at the very least a solution should be suggested though in the opinion of many here it would be a solution in search of a problem as this is an intended game mechanic
solutions weve found in the past that worked 1 become difficult to pin down they get tired of waiting for hours on end to kill someone2 gather as much intelligence as possible other corps are likely hunting them if your not able to hunt backultimately the popular solutions are 1 rookie frigate attack for lols2 wait a week or 23 join an alliance4 leave and stay put in a npc corp frowned upon but still in use today  we try to avoid thisi dont debate much in wardecs other than blowing away the opossed sides because people forget there are 2 sides to every debateif you dont reach middle ground you will never reach a rational conclusion to this
t last and rational replies thank youi have never posted here and to be honest havnt really read the huge amount of posts but a quick look showed up no thread on wardeccs maybe i didnt look hard enoughanyway thanks for the replies yes i did get a wardecc in another corp i also ceo a 2 bit bunch of griefers that we camped into their stations for a week what annoyed me was they picked us from our recruitment thread and thought us an easy targetturned out we basically won with 1 bs loss and pod to their side we lost 1 mining barge some pvpthe argument is basically it was attempted legal piracy it failed but nonetheless i feel it wanted addressing there should be some sort of penalty to wardeccing a corp just to try and get easy killsi posted it here to try and get ideas out there about it not to cause a n argumenti apologise for any insulting sytatements made i just wanted sensible suggestions
well i believe there is a problem with the wardec system lots of holes in it my thoughts on this is dont patch it the wardec system just dump it and start a new onehere are some facts that doesn make sense to me1 start a wardec for no reason  just pure fun let say 2 the price of the wardec from corp to corp 2m  what  lol thats way to cheap for a corp of any size3 you can keep the wardec going log off log in to pay it so you continue log off again and continue that for a whole year and its legal to do so whats the point of that 4 you start a corp 1 day old and you can get wardecced by let say a merc corp i name noir since there really good at it and its legal   wtfsolutions i could name a few changes here and there but its not going to serve any purpose here since the op just mentionned there a problem and peoplpe greeted him with a gunshot in the balls my point is to name the problems and facts with my experience in case someone loses some of it in time the ops point is to point out the problem so that someone else can find solutions or at least acknowledge there is a problem
a solution to a majority of high sec war decs would be if people did not talk in local all the war decs i have ever talked my ceo in doing or having one be extended has been when someone mouthed off in local it is not my problem if they are a nonpvp corp if they say something we find objectionable it becomes their problem
for once i agreemore stupid reasons to add to the list 5 wardec ends  24 hours later they can reissue the same dec wth6 neverending wardec potential as already listed but my specific pet peeve is there are no conditions or such things setas to the fixes hard to gauge considering most will argue that wardecs arent supposed to be restrictedproblem is such a freedom is severely abused
uhhh lots of wardec in high sec not all of course are activated because they think there weak or a potential target weak fun choose yours not always because someone mouthed
lots of war decs in real life are also because the target was determined weak fun or because warring a vastly weaker target provided the warring countrydictator with a feeling of pride or some kind of richesthose real life wars youd also label griefer wars and rightly so yet they happen why try to prevent such in a game such as eve that doesnt even have lawsmechanics against scamming
this is eve online not real life
granted hence i gave my no in eve online terms in a post above this was my random hey this proposal also doesnt make sense even for those that would want to try to compare it to real lifebut ill forgive based on the 99 probability that you couldnt help yourself and thats your knee jerk reaction to anyone that mentions the words real life on these forums
ill take that as your oops i forgot post and leave it at that
supported nothing is so obviously wrong
no nothing is so obviously a troll
this would actually be even worse on lag than the old system id wager most people dont mash the scanner for five minutes at a time if you want to address this problem have any attempts to scan too fast just show a little timerlike a module instead of forcing people to constantly reclick
you know we could just have no d scannerunlessyou fit either a midslot module tachyon sensor arrayor a electronics superiority rig tachyon sensor clusterif you have either of those on a ship you have undelayed dscanner in the old styleif you dont you have no dscanneroh wait thats a bad idea just like the one proposed in this threadlimiting the dscanner was just feathered the nest for those that want to avoid pvp and punished roamersroamers need to use the d scanner multple times in a very short time interval in a time critical enviromentfarmers in ravens miners haulers and anyone generally risk adverse in 00 only need to click it once on 360 degrees and then they warp out before tackle has managed to narrow down which belt they are in
funny thing about these threads support doesnt really matter you need a csm member to raise the thread whether you have one thumb or a thousand find a csm rep you expect to be sympathetic toss them a convo and ask for them to raise the issue
unban lark
supporting the unbanninationlarkonis is p cool
all my alts support unbanning
lark for president
free larkonis trassler
havent we all said or done stupid things while under the influence of one enjoyable substance or another early parole supported
supporting this because lark ran on a pirate platform to give a voice to the low sec players this act is just his way of staying true to form and remaining grounded with his constituency no ban for lark
confirming that i will be receiving the isk donations for the free lark fund
bunch of hypocritescry foul about t20 and go soft on this scumbaghe should be perma banned and legally prosecutedccp should make an amendment on the nda that breaking it would result in a 5000 fine
i think its a shame that after he allready got lucky with just a 30d ban he now even pulls a show here with his alts  friends it shows he doesnt feel sorry a bit
are you ridiculing those with a disabilityi do not think that is apropriate behaviour
please keep the discussion here
ok wiseass how do you catch an afk cloaker thentake your timei suppose you could reason that i didnt originally say afk cloaks are completely infalliable but im not completely stupid i know cloaks can be broken easily in combatgate camp situations just by flying towards them or locking quickly however youd think the afk cloak aspect could be reasonably inferred from the topic at hand wouldnt you
supporting to offer constructive criticism and alternative solutions i dont know about tachyon probes it just seems like it would be the preferred probe of pirates and defeat the purpose of cloaksi suggested this idea below in another thread similar to this one1 how about an anchorable device that needs to be anchored at a pos but not inside this device when activated sends out an omnidirectional pulse that decloaks everyone friend and foe in the system this device also consumes fuel of some sort and has a 30 min cooldown to prevent spammingif the enemy cloaker is truely afk then hes going to be in trouble soon if the player is at his keyboard or at least keeping an eye on his monitor all he has to do is recloak2 another suggestion is to allow directional scanners to pick up cloaked ships3 and my final suggestion is for cloaking devices to consume a  of cap each cycle instead of a fixed number obviously that percentage would have to be very low and dependent on the meta level of the cloak device the ship type its fitted to and skills of the player
isnt it getting boringyou are in lowsec or 00 it is meant to be dangerous be prepared to fight00 carebears shudders

youre basing the entire argument against csms on dust 514 we still dont know enough about it to make any educated decisions one way or another regarding dust 514 changesim no fan of the csms and the csm process but this argument does not hold water
the minutes are being written as we speak have done nearly nothing but that today theres about 40 pages of notes to go through and format in a readable and concise fashion bear with me here
the best meeting minutes prerelease edition its all you need to knowpage 1
uhh since you left out brunch and break i sincerely believe that what you all are doingps whatever your doing in real life keep doing cause you suck big tim at drawing lol well you would rock as a caldari design engineering team though
look at it this way if someone starts a wardec i really think they should attack if they dont after some time i really think it should be logical to think they dont want to fight with this why the wardec after a certain time i do undertand the point of station huggers and all and i do know this game well but there has to be a limit somewhere thechnically speaking as long as the wardec pays the fees they could go on for months without almost no logging in and no attack  this really makes no sense to me 
bump
i support this issue and suggestishkur 5 drone damagehp per levelenyo 5 hybrid rof per levelharpy 5 hybrid rof per levelhawk 5 missle rof per levelretribution 5 laser rof per levelvengeance 5 rocket rof per leveljaguarwolf 5 proj rof per leveledit thanks for the update zastrow
well then by that logic afs are the only t2 ships that only have 4 bonuses and hacs recons css etc have 5 bonuses 5th being hidden thats allgive assault frigs their missing 4th or 5th p  bonus 
technically thisbut yeah still supportedhowever a rocket boost should come first then those utilizing them can get a range bonus or something
10
signed
i dont particularly care what gets done to the other afs but i do care about the jaguar and wolfif everything is getting a rof bonus then fine were simply adding dps and not addressing specific issues i dont want my acs firing faster i just want them to hit better sure i can drop my speed in orbit essentially giving up the only thing a minnie af has going for itand please its been requested for many months now swap the optimalfalloff bonuses already
fully supportedthe amarr assault frigs  especially the one that lacks midslots are really badalso i love my harpy some extra ship speed  tracking is neededbut not just that like wang says there the only t2 ships that dont recieve 4 bonuses and you have to remeber the assault frig is quite a lot of peoples first taste of t2 ships at least it was mine so you want to let them leave the ship feeling it is actually well worth the extra iskies and training
what is this argument with the caracal anyway thorax it is missing bonuses to its drone damage gallente weapon system rupture it is missing bonuses to its missile launchers and drones minmatar weapon systems hurricane it is missing bonuses to its missile launchers and drones minmatar weapon systems cyclone it is missing bonuses to its missile launchers and drones minmatar weapon systems stabber it is missing bonuses to its missile launchers and joke drone minmatar weapon systemsi could bring up a wide array of other ships all of these dont see a complete 25 boost from lvl5 skills for the hull on their weapon systemsas already lined out kinetic missiles is the caracals caldari weapon system nothing wrong with it getting the bonus for these being able to use missiles of the other races is an added bonus nothing more
again you are comparing damage type switching weapons systems to range based weapons systemshybrids are stuck with thermkin lasers are stuck with emtherm missiles are stuck with low dps at any rangeeve combat is based on more than just damage typesome weapons  lasers  hybrids  are range basedsome weapons  missiles  are damage type basedsome weapons  projectiles  are a mixture of bothi fail to see how a range based weapons systems inability to switch damage type has any bareing on the relevance of damage type specific bonuses for ships fitting damage type switching weaponsa comparable situation would be a range based bonus on a range based shipie a bonus that only gave extra damage to  radio  microwave  crystalswhen i have mentioned sac i have done so to point to a ship that currently has nonracial missile bonii to try to assertain the answer to the question would rof  dps bonii make a ship overpowered as it would get dps bonii to all damage typessac is short range for sure so compare it to other short range boatsis a sac overpowered compared to other short range boats would rof and dps bonii overpower cmbs for a long range example use the ravenis a cruise raven overpowered compared to other battleships by answering these questions you can start to see that rof and dps bonii on cmbs would not overpower them
no i think a cmb that curently gets a 5 kinetic bonus  should get 1 bonus out of either  rof or dps  not both and the 5 kinetic should end up in the trash can where it belongseg a caracal should have its missile speed bonus  complementary  and a rof bonus  damage  a omen gets laser cap use  complementary  and a rof bonus  damage yesthe 16 value is calculated from 5 per level  the number of engagements where kinetic is best damage choice and therefore the damage bonus is used doing this calculation converts ammo specific damage bonus to a dps equivelent16 per player skill level is the extra dps a cmb will do over many encounter thanks to its 5 kinetic bonuslasershybridsdronesproj where bonused get bonuses to dps  rof or damage  so you dont need to do any maths on teh number its currently stated as dps
emphasis added let me illustate the issue another wayyou are comparing apples and oranges for the most part first of all you are comparing missiles to turrets there are 3 types of turrets in the game with 2 subtypes long and short ranged each however missiles is its own type the difference between launchers and turrets is that turrets are varied and have distinct drawbacksfor energy the limitation is emtherm damage only in fact it is always mostly em no matter what crystal you choose the crystal adjusts range and cap usage there is no parallel for that in launchers how would a range combat tactic become equivalent to a damage type combat tacticfor hybrid the drawback is that is uses both capacitor and ammunition furthermore damage type is always a combination of kinetic and thermal rather swapping ammo only alters effective range a further drawback is that the long range hybrid turrets are very long ranged while the short ranged ones are likewise extremely short ranged it can be suicide to enter a situation with rails or blasters and not have missiles or drones to fill the void hence the caldari and gallentean tendency of turrets with missiles or drones respectively how would a range combat tactic become equivalent to a damage type combat tacticfor projectile turrets the falloff is long they require constant reloading which decreases dps and the artillery are very low dps due to low rof the benefit of projectiles is that they take no cap but this is further balanced out by honestly how much suck they are the only reason to use projectiles is if you absolutely need cap and cant afford other turrets in your layout sure projectiles do different damage types but they all come in fixed ratios with fixed ranges the only way to switch damage types with projectiles effectively is if you can control range since your damage type would dictate the effective range of your turrets also there would be a 10 second reload time while you optimize for your opponent which wouldnt be much of an optimization anyway since you still do a spread of damage typeshow would a spread of damage type combat tactic become equivalent to a focus of damage type combat tacticnone of these compare well with launchers which take no cap do great alphastrike damage are equally effective everywhere within their range and can be focused into one damage type only out of all 4 damage types just as quickly as projectiles can be converted into a slightly more efficient spreadtrying to compare the rangecap versatility of freq crystals or hybrid ammo is apples to oranges trying to compare the damage type optimization of missiles to projectiles also fails miserably since projectile ammo is always spread and cannot be optimized launchers already avoid most of the drawbacks of turrets which are each a unique combination of advantages and disadvantages which give them character  not opnessno one is arguing that rather we are pointing out that the damage type spread of projectile turrets cannot be focused into one damage type only but you come closest with explosive anyway and that allowing launchers to do that without the range and tracking issues of turrets would be ridiculously op particularly since ammo swapping for most turrets is a range changing mechanism that launchers never needed
its not just about the cara dude i have quoted cara in some instances for making an exampleand its not an argument its a difference of opinion its my premise that the ships in the op are underpowered in general compared to there class equivelents in other races especially when it comes to solo  small gang pvpthis i attribute to the poor nature of the damage bonus they recievekinetic missiles are ammunition the weapons system is the class of launcher concernedcmbs recieve there damage bonus to an ammuntion type kineticthere class equivilents in other races recieve damage bonuses to the weapons systems and through that any ammuntion they choose to fireusing missiles of other raceswhat you consider an added bonus others including myself would consider a vital combat tactic especially for small gang  solo workthe vital combat tactic of switching to appropriate ammo means that a cmb recieves no damage bonus to anything what so ever  in 2 out of 3 fightsyou can talk forever im sure about bonuses which ships dont getim more interested in bonuses that ships do get  and whether they need replacing with something more appropriate
supportedi fly caldarigallenteminmataralas i dont think youre going to get a lot of supportand to those people repeating the same mantra you can switch ammo type you can switch ammo type you can switch ammo typewhy should i switch ammo type if it completely negates all the time and money i spent on training cruiser v battlecruiser v command ship v soon as i switch ammo type i lose the bonus to be gained from those levelsyes i do switch ammo type depending on enemy resists but it makes me cry
and i cry every time i shoot something tanked for thermal ogre ii quitcherbellyachin
rottan quote sorry to much to quoteplease read the op  follow threadi know there is a lot thereapples and oranges  good phrase and you are quite righti have not started any subthreads in here comparing the merits of different weapons systemsi have attempted to answer any subthreads in here comparing the merits of different weapons systemsbut as you say there apples and orangesyou have gone on to start a subthread with about 25 different parameters to considerthe purpose of the op is not to compare weapons types to one anotherthe purpose of the op is to ask the very simple questionis it appropriate to have a 5 per level bonus to a specific damage type  kinetic  on ships that use damage type switching tactics cmbs 
i somewhat ran out of characters so this one might be a bit shorter perhaps since damage bonuses are all youre interested in the following would be more appropriateshould be changed toamarr damage bonus is not compatable with damage type combat tacticsgallente damage bonus is not compatible with damage type combat tacticsminmatar damage bonus is not really compatible with damage type combat tactics due to damage type spread inherent to ammo used and how ammo alters optimal range caldari damage bonus is not compatible with damage type combat tacticsso no real problem there
answer yesanswer ships do not use tactics players do some ships are more efficient at certain tactics than others when a player uses a ship outside of a stereotype they can set themselves up for a phenomenal fail or win
so do i but last time i checked all my drone types benefit from my drone damage per level bonus
thisdude i so knowgallente hate us  and would bite out there tongues before admitting there might be a problemminmatar are too wrapped up complaining about there own ships that they might for a second consider others have issues too they want there own stuff sorted firstamarr might occasionally throw us some support  but dont like the fact we get multiple damage types75 of caldari just shoot scourge and get on with itcaldari dont complain nearly enough on these forumsi have loathed this bonus for 5 yearsit made me train mini i hated it that much
ah but in case you havent looked at their stats lately the different racial drones have different damage modifiers thermal being gallentes damage type of choice ogres have the highest damage mod by far why should i train heavy drone operation v only to use ogre iis when there are 3 other damage types that should be equally viable its the same argument as yours and you dont see me complaining
ill say i tried to quote you 6 times but the brower couldnt cope with char limityou certainly had a lot to say on comparing weapons systems after chiding me for comparing weapons systems  which i hadnt even initiated if you bothered to read the threadare you sure you wouldnt like to change it further to amarr damage bonus is not compatable with damage type combat tacticsluckily for amarr  amarr dont use damage type combat tacticsgallente damage bonus is not compatible with damage type combat tacticsluckily for gallente  gallente dont use damage type combat tacticsminmatar damage bonus is really compatible with damage type combat tactics due to damage type spread inherent to ammo used and how ammo alters optimal range luckily for minmatar  they get rof and dps bonuses which grant more dps to any damage type they fire at whatever range that ammo workscaldari damage bonus is not compatible with damage type combat tacticsscrew the caldari  id rather eat my tongue than see those squidies get a level playin field
im afraid i dont see it as the same argument it would only be the same argument if the bonus wasdrone damage per level to thermal drones only
if damage type combat tactics means using whatever damage type your opponent has the least resistances to then the innate spread in damage types that is inherent to all projectile ammo denies the ability to specify your damage type sure you have all 4 available to you but you can never do less than 2 damage types i dont see how this makes something impossible by game mechanics really compatible furthermore any attempt to change damage type to find resistance holes will alter the optimal range of your turrets therefore any ship flown which attempts to use these tactics must also be fitted to always control range in combatalso im not sure why youre bashing me so harshly for bringing anything that i consider relevant into the discussion if you think it is irrelevant please show me how otherwise you are flaming me personally something that you slammed lili lu for earlier in this thread and yet have commited both to her and to myself honestly if youre really looking for change id suggest considering that the people with the power if they read this thread are going to read it in its entiretyi dont see how the differences between turrets and launchers is irrelevant to a bonus to missiles a bonus to all frequency crystals ie all laser turrets has to do with giving a bonus to the whole spectrum of range on the other hand all missiles of the same category have the same range and damage type is what they modify instead the correct counterargument instead of gallente drone bonus should only be thermal drones which brings a 3rd type of offense into play would be that certain amarr ships should only provide a bonus to infrared microwave and radio crystals while others provide a bonus only to miltifrequency gamma and xray crystalsto repeat what i just said but perhaps a bit clearer is that the ship bonus should modify the effect that changing ammo has to make all other faction ships come in line with caldari thus amarrian and gallentean ships have bonuses that apply only to short or long ranged ammo not the whole spectrum and minmatar ships have more specific bonuses that apply to ammo based on a combination of range and damage typesbut that certainly isnt very feasible or well thoughtout now is it after all targets closer than optimal range are penalized by tracking and targets farther than optimal range are penalized by falloff so there is no need to further penalize ships for mounting turrets based on ammunition on the other hand launchers are not like turrets in this regard and thus their ship bonuses are not required to be as selectivei think im done for this thread based on reading it i think you are being purposefully bullheaded and no offense meant by that its just my honest opinion which stems partially from your vehement and mocking replyscrew the caldari  id rather eat my tongue than see those squidies get a level playin field
by joe i think we have a viable alternative
introduce new split damage missiles that do 50 kinetic and 50 other damage would make the kinetic bonus useful while still retaining caldari kinetic racial damage flavor although your idea is faster and better
this is what ive been aiming to say and apparently ive been missingyou cant compare a bonus on one ship to a bonus on another ship without comparing the ships the weapon systems and all of the ship balance considerations together and you cant compare those assuming that a player will do one thing or another thing balance in eve is an insanely complex web and at this point i dont think there is anything inherently unbalanced about a bonus to kinetic missiles only on some caldari ships
its really simple to compare one bonus to another you just have to convert the bonus to be of the same typeeg convert a kinectic bonus to a dps bonusdamage and rof are easy to convert to dps5 damage is  to 5 dps5 rof is almost  to 5 dps  you do have to take into consideration  reload time for a kinetic only bonus you need to make an assumption as to how often the bonus gets usedif your using kinetic in 13 engagements then you take the kinetic bonus value and divide by 3people can waffle on endlessly about trackingoptimalfalloffdamage types or lack of themrange and whatever and before you know where you are your completelly lostso keep it simple theres no need to worry about the difference between guns and missiles its all irrelevant when you just want to compare bonusesmini damage bonuses are 5 rof  5 dps  and 5 damage  5 dps amarr damage bonuses are 5 rof  5 dps  and 5 damage  5 dps gallente damage bonuses are 5 rof  5 dps  and 5 damage  5 dps  and 10 drones  10 dps caldari bonuses are 5 kinetic  16 dps  and 5 rof  5 dpson the further question of balance there are ships out there allredy with rof and damage bonuses to missiles  they arnt overpoweredso correcting this inadequate bonus on cmbs is unlikelly to create any hugelly overpowered shipsand if it does they can allways be tweaked afterwardsmissile have been nerfered so many times now  its about time missile users got some love to help bring the ships up to parthe kinetic flavour of caldari would be better placed on the ammuntion itself  in the same way that the damage flavours of the other races are appliedthen cmbs can have decent bonuses they dont lose during combat  and people who have trained up levels in these ships can benifit from that training
there is a damn good reason for it not getting a damage bonus and that is the convenience of being able to switch damage types freely its the same with projectiles if you want to use different damage types you lose base dpslets take the caracal again say you are shooting a thorax by switching to explosive missiles instead of going against a 58 kinetic resist you go against a 42 explosive resistall level 5 skills 100 base dps for easy mathskinetic 100125042  525explosive 1001058  58the simple fact is you dont need a damage bonus your bonus is being able to switch to offrace damage just be glad you have that ability at all tbh unlike gallente and amarrflying caldari not supported
well im glad you can see the issue  even if you dont consider it an issuelevel 5 pilot 58 dps  level 2 pilot 58 dps your numbers sir  on which other races does this happena level 2 pilots doing the same dps as a level 5 pilot i meannot an issue you may not care about it  but it is still the issue with cmbsno other races lose there training time when in combat why should caldari 
no not an issue as they are deliberately choosing ammo types where the bonus doesnt applycaldari doesnt if they use the proper ammo typeon the other hand no race can freely switch damage types on their primary weapon system without penalty why should caldari
in your exampleif a level 2 pilot chooses his ammo expthen the level 5 pilot has no way of doing more damage than the level 2 pilotwhatever ammo he chooses25 days training for a bonus that does not work minmatar can switch damage types without losing even 1 percent of there bonuswhatever ammo a mini pilots chooses a level 5 pilot get 15 more than a level 2
if he chooses kinetic he gets his bonus again not getting a bonus to damage types other than kinetic is the penalty for being able to switch damage types freely you are supposed to use kinetic missilesthe bonus does work if you deliberately choose to not use it its your problemand if you want to compare with minmatar damage switching ability caldari dont even need to train a skill to get the full benefit from a different ammo types thats an oversightbut to pick up your concern here is my proposalconvert bonus to a 5 rof which is still a damage boost compared to a dmg bonus and add a 20 damage penalty to em thermal and explosive missile damage to all the hulls problem solved pilots with lvl5 skills are better off and the racial damage is preserved

wanna max 03 sec
guys bring everyone you know to support this lets make 100 pageswe want our lag back and scanner too
remove it entirely or turn the button off for some fractions of a second ffsfffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
bump
oh no you dont this is one change that has to be reverted
sigend fix it as fast as you can
right thingspam the guys to change this anit pvp politik first the incredible sec los and know thisccp only want carebears
signed
i lost hope i am pretty sure that at this point this accurately represents ccps stance on thisi would be happy with a grayed out button in lieu of an annoying error message
so perhaps we should take this to general discussion as ccp seems to not read this section of the forumseveryone repost there doh and this change is less than optimal obviously doesnt take a brain surgeon to figure that one out
i actually got a reply from a gm about this whole ccp not reacting and he said the issue should be written down in features and ideas discussion because this gets actually monitored by the devs and to raise it to the csms if someone would open a good thread in faid it would be cool  i wont im bad at writing
i see this is by a csm and i think oh sht but then i realize that he is a goon and i am like damn i just got trolledthe sad part is ccp probably thinks that probing is a viable option to using an inty to search belts
just poasting to say the csm and its attendant forums are about as effective as they have ever beengood luck with the initiative
either improve the directional scanner so that we dont have to click multiple times to find our target or remove this 2 second limit to improve it you might want to add markers on the 360 circle relative to the ship scanning this marker needs to be updated as the ship is warping these markers indicate what is appearing on directional scan
why isnt this on page one im still for this idea even if it takes an entire expansion to do it666anyone got some holy heavy water to cleanse my pod
pos are a buggy mess and thats why ccp is moving away from them for sovereignty mechanics in dominion i can venture to guess that with their removal from a central role in sov they now can be tinkered on without massively impacting alliance warfare furthermore it sounds like the infrastructure hub that was mentioned in the most recent dev blog thread is going to incorporate these ideas
probably saves more server load by not having to scan filterlesslyunless its the client that does the actual filtering after getting all results like with probesif not wttin the 2 second dir scanner delay for this one
supported
i think enough if not see the probes on overview but will be finean option which put probes to the directional scanner alone
i dont believe that folders are preserved across multiple installations of eve yet the bookmarks themselves do reside on the server i used to make folders for them and stuff but then one day my hard drive crashed when i reinstalled eve i found that i still had all several hundred bms but they were all lumped into one big folder  not organized into the many folders i had taken the time to put them into since then i havent bothered to try again and my places window just gets slower and slower or maybe this was just an isolated incident
anyone that actually not support is doing exploration or live in wormholes if they were temp bookmarks no one would make you use themobviously supported
ah hadnt seen that before thats not goodi dont use wormholes yet either but i would have supported those wholeheartedly if i had been around i just think theres a better solution than temp bookmarks for his problemi just didnt think they would be useful based on the problem lobster man was trying to solve in his main post folders work betteras he pointed out folders dont work if your hard drive crashes apparently but theres got to be a better solution than temp bookmarks for that just mho
lobster yes bookmarks are stored on your hard drive yes its ed might i suggest deleting most of those hundreds jpc2 i do exploration and wormholes im not hardcore about it but i do fully understand why you would want this i just dont think its the right solution to the problem  like i said time created would be much better imo
supporting it because options are good options help those who would use them and they dont harm those who would not i personally wouldnt use this option i turn my old exploration bookmarks into safes
you are vey wrong1 even if setting temp bookmark is as much cliking as the deleting it  its so much better to set up proper bookmark at the beggining and dont bother with it anymore2 time created table would solve nothing some bookmark are usless just after finishing sites some are usless after several hours  wormholes  or unfinished plexes you want to dofinish later you would have to spend time thinkin  is it done already  it this wh gone etc it is as much pain as it is nowbtw some bookmarks are static fe insta undock  those are good for foldering not the temporarly ones
i am aware of all of those things this is why bookmarks have names  bookmark sites with 1 2 etc and clear them out in order and use descriptive names for anything longerterm and time created is just fine  yeah it doesnt differentiate the stuff you were doing an hour ago but it means stuff from three days ago you can clear out easily that gets rid of most of the bloat and given that the proposal was for a 36hour timer on temporaries thats all this proposal would let you do anyways nothing automated is going to read your mind and clear out the bms you dont care about so youre either going to have to clear them out by hand or use some sort of simplified rule and if youre using a rule time created is the same thing without all the my bookmarks disappeared whining from idiots clogging the petition queues
theres an idea ive had when adding my own personal bpos into the corp hangarit would be nice if i could join a corp and share my bpos with corp members without the ability for them to be held to ransom should i decide to leave at the moment the only way to do this is to allow them to be locked down in a corp hanger and hope that the ceo doesnt go awol or decide that hes not going to give them back to mejust a thought for when this is finally given some dev time
cant support itpersonally if tracking were added to sentry guns id consider that a more proper rebalancing  i still have reservations about that as welli knew when i started flying gallente boats that sentries would engage my drones if i had gcc  it has yet to stop me from flying them
if youre a gallente pirate and say you arent severely hindered by sentries youre full of it the whole global aggression system needs fixed period why should two pirate corps in rr bs gangs fighting each other get sentry fire and lose drones anyone against this is a carebear sick of getting killed because they suck
support is welcome
youre right and i mistakenly got titanium sabot in there as well shows how often i use tremor because i seemed to have tremor in memory as being weaker than nuclear and proton i dont know why
yes
i recieved a reply from one of the csms omber zombie he stated that ccp was in fact looking at projectiles and minmatar ships he felt that he thus didnt need to bring it up as an issue at the csm meetingi replied essentially that i certainly hope so however if they do to the minmatar what they did to fleet issue tempest
i think it should be brought up regardless otherwise were going to see a 50 clip size for artillery  all done i seriously doubt ccp recognizes the severity and depth of issues that projectiles have  some of their posts re tempest and vagabond really makes me scratch my head
the hugrapier isnt effective in any way against anything better than a t1 cruiser and a few of them cause problems the huggin cant fit ranged damage without lol gimpfit  its powergrid is a joke so needs to web and close getting into enemy damage range theyre good at dealing with a solo frigate speedboat but with the web nerf  so many escape its more or less pointless unless you put yourself in harms way ie scram  damage range or they coast out of range  they can barely deal with one ship that theyre meant to deal with  it cannot do this on multiple targetsthe huggin is not effective against every shiptype alone and only effective against one shiptype really against multiple targets as a force multiplier  lol  totally and utterly useless
supported
when ccp introduced the nanoweb nerfs i remember them saying something about how they were thinking of doing something to the rapierhuggin but sadly they did not it is about time they did something although i dont know if i can honestly see ccp boosting a minmatar ship even if the whole forum supports the topic ah well worth a try click
add the percentage of kills too against the losses as profit that would help account for bad luck
just do like lots of other mmo out there you click on log off and the game makes you wait 10 secs you have to wait that time while doing nothing and then boom you disapear and get out of the gamefor the disconnection ccp could log these things very easily i presume i think they can make that difference if you click it it gets logged if he didnt click on log off then the game registers it as an accidental disconnection my wife running her truck over the fiber optic cable cause shes sick im playing this game lmao
and how would that keep players from just unplugging their network cable for a second to get a quick disconnectbesides if you drop with network issues you already have a pretty long delay before the server even notices the client is gonein fact in laggy fleet fights ive had it many times that the server didnt even realized i dropped ship was still where i left it even targets still lockedthats kind of the problem imo the current mechanic favors the logoff on purpose but doesnt really help if you have network issues in the heat of combat
you presume falselyyou cannot possibly detect a disconnect from a log off in any form of the mannerand as its already been pointed out just unplugging the network card or shutting off your modem would be easily accomplishedits not a matter of getting the signal its the false positives that are the problem
i may not be an expert on this but i believe that 500 people made up number could be more or less logging on in a short period of time will actually make the server lag so by creating some kind of log off and log on delay mechanic should help this lag that may be why your getting deconnected from the game cause of an  or more disconnecting either on purpose or notand for the 10 sec the delay if it disconnect before 10 then its clearly not timed from ccp
that is already in place it is called login queue ever tried to login after server crashes
note added the exploit rule that is broken
ive seen this exploited too often its really stupid
giving support for this seeing it time and time again being abused its sad
its sad when people have to do this to get themselfs out dieing its a game who cares about dieing
this topic is in serious need of attention
i have to agree with cheeky here what should be underlined here is the fact of rendering oneself invulnerable through the abuse of game mechanics
supported this bug is unacceptable as it is hard to prove though anyone with half a brain can tell when it is happening
this has to be taken care of the problem is not the initial emergency warp out the problem is yet another and another with every log out probing ships with the new mechanics is already sucky and the multilogonoff trick is mocking a persuing fleetyou dont even need to really wait to see if anything lands on you  you just open multiple clients and hit the login button on the extra whenever youre half way through entering spacethumbs up
 thisi have been caught at least once after dc i logged out because my computer froze during a major fight died petitioned because i tought i didnt warp at all as i should logs showed i did it was my mistake they killed me fair and square using probers i have no complaints about this the person that logged off  crashed is still lockable and its possible to kill him using multiple clients logging into same account to gain invurnability is the real problem
characters using this bug to exploit their way out of losing ships really detracts from the enjoyment of the game when you have a player logging in and out 4 times for instance and probe them out immediately each time and are invulnerable to scrams and bubbles and target locks the game is no longer funthis needs to be fixedqft1 exploitsan immediate permanent ban of an account may result if e a player renders himself invulnerable through the use of a bug
well this is a problem in my opinionfurther its curious putting your usage of a questionable mechanic as a proargument for it sure you travel far away and just log in the hostile territory on the slightest danger because its safe this is exactly the point and suggestion for change in this concernyou will have to either come back from your roaming to safe regions or simply die if you cant chasing the enemy must be rewarded roaming into hostile space must have higher riskslogging in space safely where your ship magically disappears is just ridiculous
these are related issues just saying there is more to fix then only the mentioned logoffexploit
ships should return to the point where they first emegency warped before being able to do another emergency warp
off course randomly entering from a different spot is fine but s long as they reenter the same location as they left

cnd  8 launchers and a black paint job pleasebecause i want to fly thembecause they would be uberbecause they are currently mia navy frigs v  navy cruisers v  navy bc x  navy bs vwhy not 
of the reasons you list above the only one that even applies is because they currently dont exist leaving a hole in the ships supplied by the navy that doesnt make any kind of logical sense of course by that logic we should get navy destroyers toothat said im not sure theres enough justification for bringing them into existence what kind of role are they going to fill in the combat capabilities of the navies that a nonnavy version doesnt lets face it the current battlecruisers fill that combat niche fairly well without creating navy versions of themim going to go with a no on this unless somone can come up with some kind of role to justify their existence besides theyd be cool to have

if ccp had been on the ball these would have been the rewards for the l4 epics instead of seven pieces of vendor trash and some godly pos lab that retails for a third of a billion i dont say that because theyre especially necessary but they are something people want and they do have the benefit of being balanced across all four races seriously though i think ccp is waiting to release these they know we want them they know what theyd look like they just havent had the right occasion to bring them out game design isnt always about bringing out every cool idea right away  sometimes you have to leave stuff in the bag

already have a navy drone boat in the vexor do want navy brutix
near invincibleyeah rightno one is invincible not even a cloaked shipsecondly your going to get flamed to hell and back starting with the wormhole space folksnever mind low secnull secregardless odds are by the time you see a probe your not guaranteed to escape in time thats not including alignment time and warping offyou still are fully capable of ambushing regardlessthis would make the hunterkillers near invincible in this case and guaranteed to get gank kills without chance of losing there prey with no warning what so ever they have a guarenteed shot unless they are a total idiot and most pilots arent when they are intent to hunt and killargument or not you wont get support for this aside from blood thirsty pvpersthis is a classic pirate vs carebear argument and we all know where those go
i disagree yes it will buff pirating on lowno sec systems however the smart carebear will adapt quickly by doing things like moving off the warpin beacon or pointing their ship in the direction of a celestial without moving towards it to reduce align time if they do need to warp outagain i think this change should be paired with a much needed buff to lownullsec rewards give people a reason to go to lowsec and theyll find a way maybe itll mean doing things like ive suggested above or maybe itll mean traveling in larger more protected groups but at the end of it all it will mean more reward in exchange for more riskto me its not a question of how safe you should be in your safespot or how easy it should be to gank someone in their safespot its a question of what probes are there to do and i believe their function is a covert tool to get a warpin on your target
you know probes are limited to the unfiltered directional scanner view already pain in the a from the start you can easily overlook them with some wrecks or so in space and now you want to remove them fully and buff ganking
this proposal makes me snicker
i agree that the current system is dumb either you should be able to addremove them from your overview  dscanner or you shouldnt however that doesnt change the fact that i think the system as a whole needs to be changed
your suggestion makes no sense i would rather recommend you bump the thread with adding them to the overview
im not sure whats confusing you dscanning for probes is by far most commonly used by lowsec mission runners and 00wh plexers lowsec00wh are supposed to be dangerous places anyone good at dscanning for probes is for all intensive purposes invincible because they are near invincible there is little to no additional risk in lowsec just more work in watching your scanner like a hawk i believe that in the current system the rewards and the risk of lowsec00wh space need a buff
 dscanning for probes is by far most commonly used by lowsec mission runners and 00wh plexersuh yeah so people can not be wtfbbgpwnd all the freaking time lowsec00wh are supposed to be dangerous placeswho said they werent to begin with
and what kind of intel method would be left for the mission runner vs a gang of recons good probers already get a bsbc in less than 30syour workarounds with align out and leave warpin beacon dont always work
again to put it simply yes this is a nerf to insecure space im not claiming that its a buff i am however saying that were this change to take place it should be paired with a major buff to the rewards of insecure space versus highsec mission runningdrake my argument is that its silly to force yourself to spam the dscanner button every 2 seconds i believe that this nerf to insecure space as paired with a buff to insecure space would improve the game would you not agree that its stupid to have to spam that button i think that insecure space needs to be buffed to the point where people have enough reward waiting for them to outweigh the risk of not seeing probes coming their way
spamming the directional scanner button and removing proves from the directional scannerprobing sensor grid is a completely unrelated and totally different mechanichell at that rate you should take the frakking ds away all together because thats what your really shooting forthe ds will still pick up ships and even then most smart pilots will use cloaking devices to shield from prying eyes nevermind that the ds is utterly useless as its limited range wont let you pick up much other than the immediate vicinity and not solar system wide with your proposed changes they wont even use it anymore at that point which means theres no incentive of a slight chance of survival in low sec00even if the ds was buffed with a 32 au range or some such this idea is ludicrousim sorry but its warped beyond all reasonand with that i will argue no further as your just flat delusionalthread
not supported using a directional scanner whether for survival making sure not getting probed down or for hunting is part of lowsec life
exactly lowsecurity and nosecurity space is not meant to be secure it is meant to be a place where theres no safe place to hide but the station on the flip side of that its meant to have comparable incentives that encourage people to enter the dangerous space by offering great rewardsonce again with the game the way it is this change wouldnt make sense i am proposing this change under the condition that lownosecurity space received a major buff to justify the new dangeragreed it is part of lowsec life and it should be youd still scan for ships though the real counter to this dscanner nerf would be better protecting yourself in the first place the point of lownosecurity space is to be dangerous if you want to run a cap recharger fit on your navy mega and not get killed by a solo pilgrim do it in highsecurity space if you want more rewards for more risk take a few friends to lowsec and run level 5s with cap transfers and rr so it would take a large pirate gang to kill you
hey herschi think i found your problem
theyre called interceptors
trollstfu and wait till ccp says it before you cry
rephrased from something someone said in another threadmake a convincing argument for why titans as they currently stand are funthen come back here and say they should be kept as they are or lol buffed
dont come complaining when bad people show up every time with a few hundred for regular systems and up to 2k pilots for important system once the threat of mass losses is removed pno other factors stop a blob than this really big risk  big losses not cost not time not even an opposing force of approximate or similar numbers tbh just think of it for a moment ccp is restricting cyno jammers to station systems every other system every cyno they use every bridge they use every move they make is subject to both conventional and capital hotdrops theyre glass cannons now one group of players throw them around in increasing numbers because they are afraid of risk and will do everything to mitigate risk the other group of players does use them conservatively in specific circumstances even but still uses them as glass cannons  it takes a normal non capital fleet under a minute to melt one and under 30 seconds to catch oneboosting hitpoints is not going to solve anything no siege mode idea will let these ships stand up player populations increase and evolve in capacity and capability removing the area effect dd is counterproductive it takes away the only thing which stops blind blobbing but there has to be a limit privately i am surprised ccp have not used the solution already present in the storylines granted player titans are smaller then those of the empires but the same danger of gravitational drama and planets going belly up exist
buff stealth bombers amirite
i was thinking roughly the same thing actually blobs do need a counter but wether titans should be it i dont think so bombers are much more accessible and expendable and the article did mention something about a new class of fighterbombers having a cheap antiblob mechanic would do far more to combat blob frequency than the titan ever would
not really it remains a problem of scale a fighter bomber wont in all likelyness one volley a fleet battleship that would be really unbalanced as it would open up the door to excess once more would becoem hilarious to just stack hictors all over the places and for the rest just remote assign from a pos such risk bombs well yeah those are really effective in engagements of 400 to 400 i do not like the concept of the doomsday a lot i have to admit but in scenarios of 00 where the risk should be high as the rewards are rather very plenty and where solid organisation is a key instrument on every level it is not a big problem to overcomeits the deterrent element of a doomsday that works cause most of the time the pilots using them kinda suck and miss
save the titans kill the titansthey are annoying like sht and should be removed from the game entirelyfffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
the doomsday is the single worst thing to ever happen to the game yes a single doomsday can easily be tanked by a bs but only scrubs ever fire a single dd anymore its always double and triple dds now the inherent problem with them is that they completely wipe the floor with the opposing fleet and are rarely on grid for more than a few minutes literally the only way to kill a titan as it stands right now is if the titan pilot makes an absolutely horrible mistake it just doesnt make for very compelling gameplay either over the course of the delve war we ended up missing out on a lot of potentially entertaining fights when an opposing gang would get doomsdayed you cant justify something like that just because its expensive everyone has money and titans are becoming less and less of a big deal youd have to be a ing moron to think that things are going to be fine the way they are as everyone and their grandmother gets their hands on a titan
overviewcurrently when fighting in heavily populated areas whether that be in highsecurity trade hubs or 00 posbash blobs the loot often goes to the person with the fastest internet connection who is least involved in the fight since they can focus on snatch  grabbing loot while the people fighting have to pay attention to their own shipsissuethe players risking their ships in pvp combat or pve for that matter are often missing out on rewards that should go to themproposed solutiona short timer the length to be determined by ccp probably around 1 minute to coincide with the aggression timer should be introduced this timer starts as soon as a ship player or npc is destroyed during this timer the only people who can loot from the wreck are those in the corporation of the player who gave the final blow or those in the corporation of the player whos ship was lost after that appr 1 minute timer the wreck is fair game all the while the same looting aggression mechanics are in play i do think that looting the wreck of a ship ive destroyed should flag the looter to me but thats for another threadsummary a kills b for the first 1 minute the only people who can loot bs wreck are members of as corporation or bs corporation that way we still allow scavengers to loot  salvage but the people who went through the trouble to kill the thing get first dibs
no learn to salvage faster
no the wreck is owned by the person who died so logically you should limit the looting time to them and their corp not youonce ccp also gives you some kind of ownership which implies loot thieves get flagged towards you the timer would also block youthat said  i dont want to wait 1minute to loot when the scout already shouts reinforcements incoming  not supported
why the  would someone be interested in the loot in the context of a massive pvp blobb in 00low sechell id be more interested in surviving the damn fighti seriously doubt anyone is going to be interested in loot in a fight such as thatand in case you forgot there are no bloody rules or mechanics to stop you from shooting back regardlessnow in high secit already exsists its called can tipping wreck  cansalvage its been clearly indicated by ccp that wrecks are free for all even if stealing the wrecks are considered theft to the majority of the populationall this mechanic is doing is making something a hell of alot more complicated than it isand in 00 its pointless as you can do whatever the hell you want when it pleases youlow sec same thing just get dinged by sec hits
this proposal was referring to looting not salvagingnot sure i understand so basically youre saying that because under the current mechanic the wreck is flagged as owned by the corp who lost it you dont think it should be flagged to the corp who kills it for 1 minute i can respect that under the current mechanic it wouldnt make sense but im arguing also that the wreck should be flagged as owned by both the killeds corporation and the killers corporation if that mechanic were to be changed would you support this proposalspecifically there is nothing stopping a random passerby from taking your hardearned loot the problem is most prevalent in highsec where i can kill something open the wreck immediately only to find that the loot has already been taken by whoever had a better connection than me should the people involved in the fight not get first dibs on the loot again were talking loot not salvage
under no circumstance i would support it i just had lots of fun looting wrecks in lowsec from people chasing each around around in a few systems dthey even tried to shoot me from time to time speedy punisher for the win
prime example of why i made this proposal if the wrecks are abandoned sure youre welcome to the loot but to take from them in the heat of battle when other people are working for it just doesnt make sense
well you get the right to shoot me to get your stuff back must be enough
if its a gang member doing this and not shooting an assigned target he should be podded and kicked from his corp if its someone else neutral shoot him if your that worried about it as previously stated
1 i cant shoot him unless it was my corp members ship that was looted in other words if i kill someone and a random guy loots it im not able to shoot him2 even if i was able to shoot him nothing would keep him from docking up jumpimg out of system or warping away before i had the chance to shoot him
noits not your stuff its npcs stuff and should be free to take for every player instantly the only issue there is the npc loot is assigned to any player at all
me laughs at tortugans whine about ninja lootsalvaging
god no  too many rules with salvaging  looting allready the last thing we need is more
ok but why should the wreck of something ive killed belong to someone else if you went out hunting and shot a deer would that deer go to you or some random homeless guy who comes out of nowhere and grabs it before you can get to it youd want to at least be able to shoot the guy for being a douche wouldnt you 
no it shouldnt belong to someone else and it doesnt it belongs to nobody now certain kill rights may apply in systems with certain levels of security but beyond that its a you snooze you lose situationyou can take steps to protect what you see as yours  just realize that the universe is harsh and cruel and if someone gets to your stuff first its up to you to respond dont expect the game to do your work for you
im not going to flame like half the rest of the thread is doing but i will say that locking the can is not the right solution the only one ive ever heard that i like is the idea to flag the can to both killer and victim but thats been brought to ccp and rejected iirc preventing looting is a bad mechanic no support
lol  people who didnt read it and assumed its a ninja salvage whinei do not support because i believe loot is first come first serve i do however believe that a thief should be flagged to the person that killed himif any lag is thrown into the equation thats called ccp fix t3h lagzz and they do seem to be doing a fairly good job with that
reasonable would you consider pairing this flagging with a 1 minute aggression timer during which the looter cant dockjump
no because i dont really see the need for aggression just for removing something from a wreck or can i do support a nerf of intan though
um no if anything all wreck ownership should be removed looting should be freeforall same as salvage
that would be why we see them all the time come on at least back it up with a little more than a one linerwhats does in own in and why i dont see it use full in pvp rook  falcons are way better and for rattingmissons well i dont do many but i cant recall the last time i killed one in a belt so i dont think it is much used there either
your all young all s and you dont use drones periodto hell with the hud thing could be a good idea but its not enough i say we go with shortcuts i even want one that i can scratch my ass with serious i can get drones back to bay but not out  wtf wheres my scan shortcut  i want moar moar moarthe hell with the menus inside that drone ui i want to assign buttons for all my drones to work with and assign shortcuts to itthats itps i had a bad traffic day sorry your my victim today mwhahaps your all young cause for all of you who didnt think of shortcuts you dont know what dos ispss your all scause i said sopsss you dont use drones cause if you did you would agree that something as to be done and its not that complicated to fix
an option could be to combine the two ideas where my original post would be the basic variant and the extendedadvanced would allow for choosing the number of stacks  the size of each stack
i would definitely like to see a more intuitive mechanic for splitting stacks
id support this as something for a dev to do if they need a break from a larger project to clear there head to come at it again fresh
you can already add this column to the overview by opening your overview settings however i do support adding this as an option to the dscanner
no you can display ship type that says raven you currently cant display ship class that would say battleship
i wish ccp would dig a hole to put your posts in
your logic is seriously screwed upyou say changing the pos pw is a part of the trickthat assumes someone is in power and responsible for the pwby that train of thought that is not an exploit that is abuse of power and that is under the metagaming mechanicthat means someone put someone in charge of the pos that shouldnt havecourse assuming your even telling the truth to begin with ccp may think differently but if i was a game admin and thank god im not id have to say the guy responsible is obviously the one controlling the posnow i could completely be misreading and that might be but your words taken literally is a bit hard to misread
you understand the mechanic wrongthe ship pilot enters the password they enter warp they change the ship password again creates a bowling effect the reason you cannot change your ship password inside the tower is to prevent this effectedited previous post for clarity
alright retracting my previous argument then
so basically the plan here is to use a known pos pw for an insane set of angles luck and guessing instead of just mwding at them and bumping theme removed some of the pyramid
would it be worse if you tossed 30 caps at the problem rather than 1 or a titan if you do it if it works even if it doesnt but you tried it there needs to be some banning look at the gm thread 1 complaint is consistency of rules this is such a prime example of that argumentbumping is only as good as the bumbers are and sadly logoffskis can prevent it bumping gives the pilots time to react bowling does not hence why it was deemed so awful as so many goonies were blissfully ejected from shields and rightly doomsdays so many times in the past i chuckle at the fact that those same people play the double standard nowinsane angles dont matter in the end tri proved that last night from twinks battle report not too many ways to make those speeds happen in game
well for what its worth i wasnt talking specifically about the incident this thread seems to be related to since i know almost nothing about it besides whats been posted was more just trying to make the point that bowling with a known pw doesnt seem like an enormous issue since you could just as easily use a different and equally effective bumping tacticthe big issue with pos bowling was that you didnt need a password to get people out of what is supposed to be a safe area as far as im concerned if you have come into possession of a pw then it ought to be fair game according to precedents like titans with pw dding inside of the shieldbowling without a known shield password would be a different issue thoughjust my opinions anyway not representative of corpalliancewhatever ofc
agreed
karmas a 
its pretty fun until someone does it to you huh yaaycry more
one of the main problems is stolen ideas although there are very few sci fi mmos out there it still doesnt prevent other mmo developers from stealing core concepts and tossing them in their games case in point blizzard blizzard steals just about any and every idea other mmos conceive of theyre not good at developing original content only stealing and improving content from other games
i think what you want is to run for csm
ok so ingame at the moment the tempest fleet issue is half shield tanker and half armor tanker it has so much different fits to it that its the most unique faction battleship which is the only reason that people buy the ship i have bought this ship for its amazing shield tank capabilities but the changes ccp have anounced for it made me go abit green lets look at the current chang ccp has installed for fleet pesttempest fleet issue new slot layout 8 high 5 med 6 low slots 7 turrets 4 launchers fittings 577 cpu 17050 powergrid dronebay increased by 25m3 bandwidth unchanged speed 10 max velocity and agility increased by 10most people will say whats wrong with thatwhen in reality there is so much wrong with it first why add extra high slot i mean id rather have the extra mid than a extra high woundnt youatm to me it looks like a miniture macherial after the speed nerf big useless but can do great pve i propose this as a change than the current idea ccp hastempest fleet issue new slot layout 8 high 6 med 6 low slots 6 turrets 2 launchers fittings 640 or maybe to 700 cpu 17050 powergrid dronebay increased by 25m3 bandwidth unchanged speed 10 max velocity and agility increased by 10basicly i gave it 1 med slot  1 turret slot 2 missles slots and alot more cputhis means the fleet pest still has the option to armor tank or shield tank depending on what the user has trained for the 1 turret and 2 missile slot gives the ship a balance of 6 guns and 2 missiles to fill that 8 high slots or they could go with 6 guns and 2 nuetsnos or 6 guns and salvagestractor beams or 4 gun 2 missiles and whatever you want in lows basicly it keeps loads of ideas going for the mids giving the user and opponent if used for pvp thinking about what it might be a shield tanker armor tanker full proj with nuets half proj half missiles rest rr its endlessit might seem overpowered to most people which i must admit does seem abit to me but might be a good start but in my view the fleet pest only needs a cpu boost to fit a proper shield tank to it dand oh yea they need to fix projectiles pflame away d or give your views on what it should be used for p no stupid ideas internet spaceships are serious buisness
or put in other words dont change anything except speed and agility well apart from a bit more cpu for versatilitys sake shield tanks are horrendous cpu hogs
so you want to take a ship with more lows than mids and give it an extra mid as the faction ship bonus slot thats kind of crazy really if you wanted to propose giving the t1 tempest 7 turrets and the faction 8 i might be interested but this no
you do know the current fleet tempest is 866 right and its fine as is
thank you for that i was at work at time so couldnt commentthe fleet pest will allways have more cpu pgu and other extra bits and pieces you dont relise
yeah i know always seemed crazy to me
when you launch drones you have to drop down the drones in space  uh widget for lack of a better word  so you can look at their damage statushowever since theres a little delay between clicking launch drones and them appearing in drones in space you cant immediately drop down the menu so you end up waiting two seconds doing nothing instead of activating modules taking care of range control  overheating weid like to see it dropped down automatically when drones are in space so that as soon as i launch drones i can start worrying about sthing else
better drone ui coming soon to an eve near youi hope
you can actually expand the folder of drones before you launch them if you want to see their hp in space instantly i do however think the drone ui could do with a major redesign and improvement along with the rest of the ui
you know you can expand that widget before you launch drones right first thing i do when i undock and warp off in a ship with drones the status quo is fine i think
im glad its not automatic because my drone interface is close to my mods and will cover them up  id have to reconfigure my screen  but im used to it how it ison a side note i had wondered if the name roland deschaines had been taken i read all the books and used the name in another game awesome character
internal network address sure you can ban 192168100104 from the forums since it is a non routable address nothing will happen the forums never see that addressas others have mentioned nat proxies and dynamic ip addresses all turn this idea into a complete fail it simply doesnt work you will wrongly ban more people than intended and the desired effect will fail for many other people have tried this in the past and it simply doesnt workwouldnt it suck for example if your friend came over jumped on your machine posted some crap on the forums and had your ip addressed put on the ban list hmm you know that sounds like a great idea im sure that goonswarm can do something creative with this people who support this topic including the op simply dont understand how tcpip worksim sorry that the forums make you feel sad and angry and hurt your feelings but this isnt a good way of fixing that problem
is this really an issue do you guys really care if someone who got banned from the forums enables himself to keep posting or is this some i wanne be forum mod when i grow up contest 
me applauds anything that will stop isk sellers
haha ahh mate your spelling is pretty bad as for the idea i have allways thought there should be a ship bigger than a bs but still sub capsomething thats a nice transitional ship from bs to dread i mean getting to a bs is easy enough but then from that to a dread is a bit of a waitalso i would love to see t3 assault frigs d or even t3 battlecruisers moarrr ships please
i recently decided i would like to play eve again and reenabled my account for a month i attend the local python programmers meetups and every once in a while eve comes up originally i played on one of my laptops sadly i cannot read any of the text in the game on my current setup my situation is fairly different from most people however i have played a lot of mmos and games in general on this setup this is the only one so far i have had this problem withmy setup is a 60 hd tv running slightly less than 1920x1080 for overscan reasons i dont even have this problem with really old games its only evemy vision has been tested previously above normal2015 most people have trouble reading things at the distances i can the eve font is nowhere near legible on my setupas a developer myself i am going to call out laziness in the dev team or possibly graphics content team this is not a game mechanics need to change complaint its a the interface sucks complaint if people were complaining about something being to hard to do i could understand the devs ignoring the complaints i would respect that however this issue is a known issue and nothing is being done about itedit the only other possibility is the dev team is too small but if you look at every piece of content ccp hastheir site the eve site etc its all at about 10pt maybe they just have an idiot designeri will not continue to pay for something i cannot play i will be canceling my account and probably not return if the devs put a eta on this that isnt too far out within the next 2 weeks i may remain an eve customer otherwise i am going to voice to anyone who mentions eve about how ccp drops the ball on something so small but critical
ok i have to add my own request as well the wife and i have been playing off and on since the beta we reactivated our old accounts from 2005 just this month as 12 of us from my websiteforum have all gotten together to play plus my wife and our roommate and a few others the biggest complaint i have about the game the only complaint really is the font size yeah we can change the font size in chat but the ui font are just too darn small wife and i and roommate all have 1680x1050 22 widescreens 12 point expanded font barely makes anything more readable every single night all 3 of us as well as most of our forum friends have eyestrain headaches from trying to read the  font in the ui windows moving up to 24 or larger will only make the ui font smaller which means more headaches we are all 4eyed nerds who wear glasses so theres not much more we can do except take a lot of tylenol and limit our playing time please ccp you made this game when crt monitors and 1024x768 resolution was the king but this is 7 years later and almost everyone now has 19 or larger widescreen which means incredibly hard to read tiny font please please fix this at some point please this is such a great game and keeps getting better and better theres a reason why my wife and i have begun playing again for the fifth time since beta but the fontplease
of course your no supposed to use it where the hell is that written are mini supposed to use fusion are gallente supposed to use iron charges  are amarr supposed to use radio crystals whatever race your flying your supposed to use the best ammo for the situationyour argument here is the bonus is ok because incompetent pilots or inexperienced one will always use it it still makes no difference a level 5 pilot  using his bonus or not  has no way to outdamage a level 2 pilot  who chooses the right ammo  in 23 fightsyou conveniantly overlook this everytime you postfine as long as you apply it fully to all racesgallente get 20 reduction in the kinetic they do from blasters20 reduction to emexp  kin dronesminmatar get reductions of 20 to the emkintherm components of proj ammo20 reduction to emtherm  kin dronesamarr get 20 reduction to thermal from laser damageand 20 reduction to thermkinexp dronesif your going to penalise non racial damage  do it to all races not just caldari
fully agreed missiles are missiles after all they are solid matter thus would always have a kinetic aspect to them i think a minimum of 25 kinetic damage would be appropriate it would keep the ability to change damage types based on engagement but also enforce a kinetic disposition towards the missile weapon system
dav varan i think your posts are well thought out and bring a very good point up about missilesi honestly believe missiles need a buff of some sort after messing about with tps and webs the other night i was getting into plenty of situations where fitting a web gave more damage than using the tp its crazythe other option is to give some caldari ships bonuses to tp effectiveness this has the advantage of ewar being useful but the disadvantage of making a target balloon even more to everyone else shooting at it perhaps tps could have a hybrid based bonus say 75 sig radius  25 tracking bonus of whatever  it currently offers i suspect splitting it like that would actually lead to slightly more dps for missile users but the tracking wouldnt help other fleet members heck you could also make it scriptable like dampsanyway im blabbering i support this
who leaves a low resist at default in pvp these daysi dont know anyone who flies without fairly even resistsswitching ammo also takes time often time that youre being shot at and cant shoot back further hurting dps output thats without even considering travel time too of the missiles
signedthis needs looking at ccpand with some priority how can you bring in new features when a core feature like sound is broken
i am an audiophile
sort this out please maybe down to one second without the stupid announcement
totally support this give me back that lag that i never noticed because eve was more fun back then
2 seconds is way to long for waiting to scansigned
signed
signedthis feature is nothing but a nuisance remove it please ccp
that would be utter win just saying but poss themselves still need to be fixed
disclaimer i havent seen this bought up elsewhere but if it has then oopsas things are the bracket on your overview and hud for a battleship is the same size as the bracket for a dreadnought or even a titan for easier identification of capital and supercapital class ships in the heat of battle its hard to make out those black silhouettes on black backgrounds could the brackets for these ships be made slightly larger
seems like a sensible suggestion
minor but sensible
id be the first one to point out the supercaps sheer size would be enoughbut if your in a massive furball of ships in the middle of a warzone yeah might help to have a more defined indicator for those classes of shipssupported
yeah i agree honestly i do understand that they painted themselves into a corner and that itll be a bear to get out of it yet it seems that every suggestion gets things worse almost like they are over thinking the problemyou know this is starting to act like they are at the dawn of doing a major rework on the entire minmatar design philosphy classically minmatar have been active shield tankers and the minmatar specific certificates bear that out so for them to force an armor tank on a fleet tempest is probably indicative that some major mind resets are going on same with the new fleet typhoon as well as the republic firetail none of the old rules are being followed by ccp very closely though what rules they are using seem to be pretty hazy or hazy from our standpoint
really no one uses them flying my muninns i quite often use the longer ranged faction ammos instead of tremor the tracking penalty on tremor is prohibitive in my view i only used tremor when i needed the range it gave i guess in my mind a greater chance of tracking the target and hitting was better than a tad more damage if you did hit with tremor at the higher ranges 100km its less of a problem but under 100km i tended to use faction nuclear in the midranges and then of course faction phased plasma in the lower ranges
got my vote
ive always been minmitar and i like this idea ive got all the base and complementary skills to fly vagamunin and already fly a maelstrom so im definitely ok with some changes
supporting this
supportedall the bladedot members need to speak up and say quite explicitly that ed titan pilot jrela used this exploit repeatedly
if you decide to put your expensive capitals in a pos that you know is likely to die you should pay the consequences
also it should be possible for client to detect quitting the game by using ctrlq or throught the menu opposed to quiting by client crash or losing connection that would probably lead to exploiting it by killing the eve process or unpugging the net cable but its still a step forward
indeed which is one of the reasons why we now are spamming that this needs to be solved a titan that has literally 20 bubbles on it should not be able to log onoff enough to magically get out of them then cyno out this is broken and i think deep down everyone knows it
well since the idea of the whole emergency warp is to get you out of danger when you log offdisconnect for various reasons and then get you back in that spot when you log init isnt supposed to be used as a way to move a ship from spot a to spot b while being effectively invincible
seen 2 titans escape from a bubbled down pos using this recently
what really makes this sad is that it shouldnt be so hard to fix just put a timer on the logout warp once the game warpsondisconnection it wont trigger again for a few minutes people can still log out it still offers some protection from disconnects unless you play on a really bad connection and if you enter pvp on a bad connection you dont deserve protection but lametards cant exploit it to make themselves invulnerable as for the people who exploit this im not saying we should cut off their genitals and force them to eat the icky bits but you gotta admit that it would be entertaining
would add flavor flavor is good
add navy carriers to the list
navy harbinger signing in
yeah lets have navy bcs but make then navy versions of the tier 1 bcs just to  off the carebears drooling over the thought of cn drakes
navy titans navy motherships
and carriers and dreadsor in more words just that there isnt any doesnt mean that there has to be
support
why do we play eve speaking for myself i would say entertainmentinternet spaceships may be serious businessbut its ok to ask for something you want as long as its not going to ruin the gamethe role they would fill would be the same as the role filled by cnrs etca slightly more pimped version of the standard ship for a priceme i want to pimp one out and spin it round in its hangar while going oooohhhh
ill support this if there are no more probeable scans as well balance and all that
supported to oppose drake
not sure i understand if youre saying that probes should no longer be able to probe out those using the directional scanner because of balance id argue that probes actually require a good deal of specialization of skilltraining to use whereas the dscanner can be used by anyone any time
if you arent moving it doesnt matter where your ship is pointed towards so it certainly doesnt decrease allign time
not true most of alignment time is spent aligning straightening your ship so its facing the direction of its warp getting up to speed is part of align time but a smaller part than actually aligning for most ships try it out if you dont believe me 
well for this to be balanced youd have to introduce a new kind of probe the cloaked probe much lower scan strength to balance it out
i am utterly amazed and amused by your lack of understanding of this game and the scanning mechanicsthe thing with the old scanning system was that no probes really could overlap each other and also you had less chance to actually get a good hit on a ship now the new systemone can deploy 38 probes that can overlap to find a ship that is hiding you do not have to warp to the probing points but just move the probes to the preferred scanning vantage depending on skills you can deploy scan and retract the probes from the designated area within a time frame of 7 seconds so the scanning system had a badass buff we all know that but to balance that badass buff they made it possible to see the probes on the d scan the probes are accually an object yeah they are dont argue about it and we can see object on the d scan and also a probe is sitting and collecting data and probably sending out some serious radiationif you removed the ability to see probes on d scan youre actually promoting highsec as in ppl stay there no i cannot support a change that only benefit players searching for other playersand uh btw are you an afk cloaker
when your ship isnt moving it effectively has no direction it is pointing in obviously when you are going the other way it takes more time to allign but when sitting still it doesnt matter at allbut for some weird reason i actually decided to try it out we have a kronos with ab running largest ship i had available without clone jumping so plenty of allign time to keep measurement inacuracy limitted 1 measured time between hitting button untill i got message ab shut off due to warping kronos alligned at opposite direction from warp going 1ms took 1963 seconds before i entered warp2 same measurement now alligned with 1ms towards destination took 1955 seconds before i entered warpthat difference is well within measurement inacuracy and i would advice you to try it out yourself too passive alligning does not work
i disagreeprobes in space is the fastest way to get the system in an uproari often go into lowsec throw out a handful of probes and move on just to freak out the local mission whores
and i thought i am the only one nice one 
what a ridiculous suggestion i agree that the dscanner is terrible but what defensive options does your suggestion leave1 stay permaaligned lets hope you werent mining or gas harvesting or even need to move in a direction that has nothing to align to in it also you are no longer allowed to use shortrange ships or actual piloting because thatll take you out of alignment and you are provably wrong about direction affecting alignment when stationary2 dock or safecloak whenever someone enters local there goes any trace of interactivity between you and other players in lowsecwhat do they have in common theyre really boring if im not running highsec l4 missions then im placing the interest and excitement of lowsec life over optimal moneymaking raising the profits wont matter if you remove the interesta dscanner reworking or a more interactive hunter  prey system i could get behind that but for your idea im with this guy
i think id rather wee myself than support this proposal
what defensive option do you have left how about actually defending yourself in insecure space once again my argument is that insecure space should be buffed to the point where the rewards are worth being in danger of losing your ship
mighty big talk from someone who mostly lives in jita it seems station hugging for the winlowsec and 00 is dangerous but you shouldnt die to any gang passing throughyou should have an option to get out all your talking about alignment doesnt work neither does every mission allow you to use a pvp fit ship to do themif the gang has a competent prober they can get the hit before the other guy notices the probes remember he has to do more work than just spamming scan button if not  they might not get the killstop fighting in jita live in 00lowsec before judging this
youre assuming that because i fight in jita currently thats all ive ever done ive lived in 00 on 3 separate occasions once in fountain and twice in nc space ive also been a 10 pirate and before that i was a carebear in solitudesyndicate which is mostly lowsec and 00 ive done just about everything there is to do in eve now other than highscale manufacturingpos work though i did have a research pos in solitude at one point point being i have plenty of experience in insecure space and its a lot of fun but at the end of the day its supposed to be insecure and i think that given the role of probes to find someone covertly it makes sense that they should be able to find someone without being found themselves lowsec00 is supposed to be about risk and having to fend off pirates not about how quickly you can spam a button and look for probes if you dont want to be shot at you shouldnt be there
absolutely notyou can already get a ship down to one or two scans with combat probes through using the dscanner before hand to get a very good idea of their locationif you need probes removing entirely from the dscanner youre using them wrong
im surprised to hear that some means of differentiating hardwiring doesnt already exist
definitely supported just double the required skills nothing times zero  nothing and jack up the speed a lot something like this would be awesome for autopiloting across empire also let it fit 8x strip miner iis but give it 00mUFFFD cargohold like the pod
id support this if it have a jump drive range of 50 light years could fit doomsday devices and was immune to webbing and all forms of electronic warfare
you forgot the jump drive that doesnt require a cyno and takes 0 fuel with a max jump range for 3000 ly so you can reach those pesky wormhole systems and the mini doomsday
fsck the titans ddds are the antifun module and the sooner the push butan receive kms is gone the better the jump bridge power alone makes them worth having especially as cyno jammers are about to get massively nerfedif titans cost 200m iskday worth of npc tradegoods in upkeep and there were less than a dozen in game then yes fine now that there are hundreds of active titans they dont get to be that special there are probably more active titans now than there were dreadnaughts when titans were introduced
i think its safe to say that we all agree on this one thing ddd or not there shouldnt be hundreds of titans around make them scarse enough and even a ddd is acceptableif so there are several options1 make titans very exclusive through some gameplay mechanic2 make only the ddds very exclusive through the same hypothetical gameplay mechanic3 nerf them to kingdom come in which case we may need to wonder about what role they will serve
given you lack to give arguments why the ships need work  funny anywaytry this one
the kronos is the crappiest marauder and is usually outperformed by a simple t2 fit raven you know
ok i saw kronos rocking in pvp and pve already can you please explain why you think it is outperformed by raven
youre terrible at this game ankwhateveritssaid
i thought that was the vargurkronos gets the equivalent of 8 blasters a tanking bonus the regular 5 damage bonus and a statis web strength bonusthe only downside to it is that being a blaster boat forces it into tackle rangestill the kronos gets 90 web which on top of the 100 and 5 damage bonus means it will generally blow you into tiny little pieces very quickly
vargur rocks for missions with 800mm ac and barragethere are also some pvp videos involving the vargur and it seems to rock there aswell
it got one more turret than the meganavy mega zero over the hype the 90 web bonus is not awsomethe 99 was in pve with rails and sentrys it is simply a poor example how much qr gimped other blasterships vargur is trash for the exact same reason you typed down for the kronos  omg but in pvp and ccp decidet to heavy prenerf it serius how many of this ships are used in pvp 3 2 1 even less
i think we can all agree that eve is a great platform for organized tournaments every part of the alliance tournament from the teams ship combinations and fittings straight down to the maneuvers and actions in the fight itself make for exciting and dramatic matches there is a lot going on before and during every match and theyre almost as much fun to watch as they are to participate in ive watched a lot of esports in my time lol nerd and in my experience an eve match is much more exciting than your average counterstrike match on hltv watching some dude camp a corner with his sniper rifle unfortunately for us spectators the only match broadcast with streaming video in the alliance tournament is the finals for all the other matches many of which are grudge matches between alliances with a rivalry we have to be content with audio streams while the commentators on eve radio do a great job there is just too much going on to accurately describe in audio the matches need video to really capture the action there is just no way around it i realize there will be some cost involved for ccp to do this and i would not mind at all if they had to advertise during the matches through banners or even commercials to pay for the streaming just show us the action if youd watch alliance tournament matches over streaming video support this topic lets show ccp there is an audience out there
this is a pro idea you are the second greatest csm to ever exist
i certainly miss the live video broadcasts and discussions in between and would like to see them make a return
while the idea has been tossed out several times it once again gets my support
ive been trying to keep up with the tournament but sometimes i just cant stand the announcer and its really frustrating to not be able to see whats going onoh yeah and we lost those two ships a few seconds ago sorry i was busy relaying a story about this one time i was traveling through rancer
streaming 1 day out of 6 is not enough theres a lot of drama missed and its not exciting to watch the postgame videos after you already know who won
id watch
i too would watch
supported
yes please
i think from ccps perspective advertising isnt going to cover their costs which was calculated in the millions if the recent everadio discussion on this was accurate so perhaps the right question to ask is how many players are willing to pay for it
yes show it all many of the lower fights are more intresting
i would like to be able to watch my own team since we are horrible and go out so fastafter the fact youtube is meh
yes free us from the obscurity of the lower brackets
a great proposal have my thumb goon sirthis is true zastrow is a pretty good csm but hes nowhere near jade constantine
please show us the lower matches

do you know why they arentcost labour needed the only way its happening is if people day some many dollars a day for watching it

excerpts from ccp soundwave during the pre round 2 chatter in the at forum140957 ccp soundwave  you know what would be the most interesting area to reivew and balance ship pricing141018 ccp soundwave  im not at all kidding either141041 ccp soundwave  i think a paladin is like 12 billion141046 ccp soundwave  what the 141102 ccp soundwave  its not an amazing ship at 12 b141140 ccp soundwave  the fact is that you dont get 12b performance out of a t2 battleships theyre not the only ship class with that issue141140 ccp soundwave  the fact is that you dont get 12b performance out of a t2 battleships theyre not the only ship class with that issuestraight from the horses mouth argue with that

ah yes assault frigates
i have never had a problem remembering ships and their respective roles but it is a nice ease on the already steep learning curve supported
my mistake i couldve sworn that was an option maybe it was removed a while ago in any case it should be an option both on the overview and the dscanner
my favorite one is yaay ratting in a carrier in imk and getting said carrier ganked by beagles with 5 minutes warning they were coming comedy goldas for the topic at hand sure ill support it
arazus are better suited for this indeedbut the rapier has a 600 bonus to web range whereas the arazu only has a 100 bonus to point range with rs veach ship has its own pros  cons all i can offer is my condolences im sure a small part of you died when you found out that the rapier isnt the omgwtfpwnmobile of eve
that is one way of getting to see ccps inner workings up closewho knows i might do so
go ahead and run ill probably vote for drake before id vote for youill take my desire for eve to be unique over my desire to know everything theyre working on any day dont want to see some other game try to rush in a feature that ccp told us they were thinking about and screw it up so badly the the playerbase goes completely up in flames to the point that ccp has to drop what might have been a really good idea
well way i see it if i ran for csm it wouldnt matter what i wanted the game to be i wouldnt be there to convince ccp of my own ideas but of the playerbases ideas that appears to be what the csm is for from my perspective they are after all the players representatives not their own representatives
that i didnt expect
if the faction was givin all 8 turret slots to projs then it will basicly be a expensive version of the mael without the bonus to boost amount p
and with 2 dps bonuses 1333 effective turrets might be capable of some pretty impressive numbers id wager
current you must pause skill training to plug in new implantshardwirings then resume skill trainingproposed when plugging in new implantshardwirings the client pauses training plugs implants in then resumes trainingjust a small issue but it would make life a little easier
1 ui improvement
yup
an option in the client to remember or not the last state of the drones window would be helpful i nearly always expand the dronesinspace thingythis is also applicable to other windows such as the character sheet if people are training 30day skills it makes sense to think that theres another reason for opening the character sheet other than to view skill training progress
me facepalms  didnt know thatroland deschain is the real name and that was taken roland deschaine too so i went for roland deschaines great character indeed
 bluesbtw anyone who thinks they could fc effectively a 200man fleet where their allies appear on overview are kidding themselves especially people suggesting having a list on a webpage with standings on themusing reds to mean blue is easily fixed by making it impossible to remove reds from overview
just for such a wonderful comment you have my vote in the next csm election if you want it
you do know that you dont have to fill all the available slots with blues
what hacks me off in eve are people who stay in stations after theyve been taken over and artificially inflate the market in real life youd drag them out of their ship give them a kicking and throw them out of an airlock ok im not saying eve is real life no really its not but this could be a good use of wis to be able to forcibly eject someone from a stationz
added linkssmurf and dear trollsthe csm is a valued partner of ccp in discussing matters of the player base and getting early feedback on design decisions which ccp is about to make you should keep in mind though that this experiment is new and unique in the industry  as such please allow for some time of accomodation on both sides ccp and the csm i mean look at it this way  ccp is teaming with players has them sign a nondisclosure agreement in order to discuss matters long before public press releases  you dont want to go full throttle here from the start given the possible damage that can be done we are only one year down the road and i can assure you that the csm gets full attention by ccpas to your complaint about issues not being addressed in this forum  the assembly hall as well as jita park are csm territory and ccp is relying on us to process them  this is a sign of trust and not of ignorance ccp gave that part of the forum to the csm exclusively if you take some time to read into the available documentation about the csm you will quickly find the issues which we have and will discuss with ccp in evelopedias issues in process category this also lists your gm issue which even received an extra slot during our iceland facetoface meetings  and we had the full team of senior gms including the head of internal affairs sitting there listening to our complaints does that answer your question so far please read the minutes on the csmccp meeting as soon as they are available they will be linked here on the homepage as well as in the evelopediaas to the issue resolution you should bear in mind that csm is an advisor and the final decision which is also influenced by business constraints the csm is not able to comment on remains with ccp the csm does not design the game for ccp and you should not be so full of yourself to assume that anything any player trolls in the forums gets immediate attention the channel which ccp has opened to the players via the csm is very active and of great importance the questions and answers feature is further window which was opened also by initiative of the csm would you follow the csm minutes you would see a lot of the assembly hall issues are being addresseda gratifying number of players also uses direct conversation to his and her favourite counselor in order to bring issues to their attention
please read the bolded sentence it makes no sense how does the aggressor have a legitimate grievance
seriously get over your carebear tears if they dotn attack then why do you care they are wasting their money and honestly its not the innitiators fault that noobs will hide in a station and not do anything till you go away please actually learn the game before you start talking change
if i may ask what was the process used to prioritize the issues
we awere all supposed to number them 165 1 as most important 65 as least i think only 4 of us managed to actually do it tho we did get through all the items on the list while in iceland tho as well as a couple of others that we decided to talk about on the spot
so it wasnt directly based on the number of support votes those issues got on the forum or something like that
definitely yes fonts are hard to read on hires displays
being caldari centric you apparently dont realize that tps are the minmatar ew and a pale shade of ecm anyway but sure cladari ships should get bonuses to tps makes perfect sense with the backstory
my goodness if the caldari want to swap ecm for tps please give it to them well even trade the pure damage types of the caldari for the annoying split damage types we currently have
yes or they can have gallente damps but you realize we are talking with people who started making money sooner than everyone else carebearing in their drakes and ospreys dont train other races for perspective found some limitations with their racial ships and weapons but want it all nowan across the board rof bonus for missiles would mean they have no drawback they would do full damage at any range against any resists then caldari would get two great ship bonuses meanwhile amarr get one because 10 cap use only makes the weapons useable and matari get one again because 5 rof makes artys not totally put you to sleep and barely ameliorates the ac falloff deficiency the gallente standard 5 hybrid damage bonus is nice on blasters but then they are very short range and again just makes up for the volley damage deficiency of railsi crosstrained to caldari and quite enjoy the drake and rokh in carebearing and cant beat a rokh for range or ecm boats for ew in pvp they are appropriate if not superior tools for their jobs but due to perspective do not think the missile ships need any buffsedit btw dav the range ammo argument misses the point that ranged gun ammo loses damage with gaining that range meawhile a missile does its full damage at the entire range of its effectiveness which is often longer than gun range the gun user is losing some benefit of that 5rof or damage whatever for their split damage ammo due to range the kinetic missile will do its full damage at the extreme range of the gun which had its damage bonus subsumed in the range ammo damage reduction the racial weapons system bonuses are simply different and either all should have drawbacks or none a 5 rof on missiles does not have any drawbacks and as i said would mean caldari would get two wholly beneficial bonuses while everyone else would get one compensatory and one beneficial bonus that is not balance
no one is asking for 2 damage bonuses just asking for 1 damage bonus instead of the kin bonuscmbs get compensatory bonuses as well  i am not asking for these to be changedfor instancecara currently gets 1 damage bonus  5 kin  and 1 compensatory  missile speed omen gets 1 damage  5 damage  and 1 compensatory  cap usage after the change cara would have 1 damage  5 rof  and 1 compensatory  missile speed missile systems have drawbacks  gun systems have drawbacks all fine and goodwhat dont have drawbacks are the damage bonuses5 rof is 5 more dps in any given situation for any weapons system5 damage is 5 more dps in any given situation for any weapons systemthe 5 kin bonus has the drawback that it only gets applied to one type of ammuntion that can be fired it gets lost if different types are used this is very true  it is not currently the case hence this post
yes lets destroy the whole caldari racial history of kinetic damage and add another nerf to gallente ships whom are already very underpowered in comparison to caldari and amarr caldari are fine as it is any problem with caldari comes from missiles

this annoying bug has been abused way too long by many many capital pilots that didnt wanna lose their ships get it fixed asap
after the not having a titan kill due to this exploit i wholeheartedly agree with cheeky
i lost 2 tian kills 2 obis one thanny and some other small  due to this bug get it togeather ccp
i agree that something has to be doneit cant be that the intent of this game for capital pilots is to abuse possible gamemechanics wich have nothing to do with the actual feeling and gameplay of the game you cant log off your own life and back on and off when the police try to stop you for speeding neither can youthis should not be a valid way to get ships out imo
raising my thumb over this
i support this
props to cheeky down with the glitch
needs a fix csm get to it
support changing this bugexploit
i agree with cheekything ban the cheaters and fix the bug
all those blade tears collects

represent it seems titans wont die unless they actually want to
indeed this is seriously lame
i seriously dont think that the game was designed to alow this 
yeah i cant tell you how frustrating it was to lose out on even the chance of titan killing due to this

updated to go along with the above idea with a thumbs up

because in a pve situation defending yourself is a mugs gamethe attacker has all the advantages even down to what damage type to use on you and npcs wholl help them out due to moronic ai dont forget exploration sites are not deadspace any more so dropping a decloaker by the warpin point doesnt workperhaps if i compromise my ability to run the site or mission i may stand a fighting chance against one enemy and as we know pirates are honorable sorts who will always fight one on one like gentlemen if tackled by competent attackers the mission runner or explorer is going to die sooner or later so all defence in lowsec focuses on getting out of the danger area the second a hostile appears on the overview or soonerheres what i suggest you domake or support a seperate buff lowsec thread because thats a cause i can get behind when that is implemented then start this thread again i think a lot more people will support a lowsec buff alone than when its mixed up with another proposal youre trying to argue for two different things at once and only confusing your own message
i will keep this short and simplewhen someone swears on the forums instead of turning it into a  turn it into a smurfthis serves many purposes two of which are posts being funnier and people no longer being able to guess what swear word was said because it doesnt say how many letters are in the word nowex someone on the forums says what the insert f word here the forums would censor it as what the the new system would censor it as what the smurf

considering the labor of trying to determine the status of a target i vote we introduce a mouseover that gives us a percentage of the targets statuschiefly pos shields its a pita to know how close the shields are to reinforced since we cant see total or remaining hp you can mouse over crystals to see their damage while theyre loaded why then can we not hover the pointer over a target and see the percentages of remaining shieldarmorhullseems like a pretty simple introduction that will make things loads easier
a simple solution for you lock the ship
the first one does second and third they kill a lot moreand you did kinda write off almost every subbattleship ship class there but thats all right since doomsdays do the same thing in play sucks if you want to help your alliance and cant afford a tripletrimarked sniper bs but thems the breaks right
get your titan today at titans r us 999 exclusive offerno seriously the game is heading to this burn them
what if the only way to own a titan is to be donated one by the empires if you win the alliance tournament meaning that there are going to be very few of them around
root titan in place for 35 minutes after ddaying unable to warp or jump keep the aoe damage
well that would suck donkey balls as this is supposed to be a sandbox game and 00 is where the players make all the rules i would much rather see a system where palyers can make as much ships as they can afford and use them as they please within the games mechanics ofcourse balance the titans any way you want as long as such hard limits arent put into the gameregardless it is irrelevant at this time since there already are hundreds of them did you plan on leaving the existing ones in the game like t2 bpos and just stop any new ones from being created maybe steal the current ones from their rightful owners there just arent good ways to roll back the clock on titans so they should be redesigned so their destructive power doesnt get so overpowered with just a few additional titans at your disposal the situation is bad now and will only get worse so some change needs to happenif someone wants to add some antiblog weapons provide something that the little guys have access too since they are the ones that are going to need it the most having antiblob weapons being mainly the sole property of large blobs never made any sense to me
well topic name says pretty much everything i guess my argument is quite simple if we can repair our damaged modules with nanite paste why cant we do it with dronesactually theres no way to fully repair your damaged drones while youre in space and nearest station youll be able to dock is 15jumps away in my opinion its very unfair to drones they want to be repairable toobut seriously having healthy drones instead damaged ones can decide on victory or not especially if youre using boat relaying more on drones than gunsmissilesit would need few changes to drones interface but not that big right it needs to have added some healtbars for drones inside the bay or at least info if its damaged or not and rmbondrone click option for repairing with nanite pastehow do you think imo it would be very lovely little addon
except nanite paste repairs modules not shields armor or hull and that is all drones have there are also remote repair systems that allow you to repair drones nowsomeone proposed a way that would allow you to slowly repair drones in your dronebay it would allow drone maintenance without allowing you to repair them effectively during a battle something like that would be a much better idea than this a module or rig or something so you would have to make a sacrifice to gain the ability
it is called remote armor repairer have one fitted offline on one of your ships i know asking to fit a remote hull repairer is a bit too much but welloh and armor maintenance bots not supported you already have an option to repair your drones for roams you want to have some kind of remote repair in your fleet anyway use it
support personally i missed the detail about them not being live broadcast sigh i really wanted to see that iac vs aaa game live
i assume it is cost but it would be nice failing that i can live with ultra quick upload to youtube but live is still hmmmm live

hi guysgals i have redone the proposal integrating as many of the features that were discussed and cleaned up the proposal to better explain the idea the original concept has not changed too much but definitely has expanded slightly to incorporate the other suggestions that were brought upplease let me know what you think
i like the idea and in my eyes it should be executed as a box you can tick to activate a second stack number textbox to keep it nice and simple
is not the one time i got confused was hearing someone with a thick accent say eris rather then ares but it would simplify a few things so yes
actually it happened to me and i dont recall doing it to anyonebut for what its worth i found it pretty funny
put simply the purpose of the csm is to make it so that the devs dont have to wade through all the idiots on the forumsme points upthread to find out what players want they hold an election find nine folks to represent a good crosssection of players and get them to filter out the bad ideas and raise the good ones
funny thing those ships have existed for close to two years now look at the skill reqs on t2 battleships  marauders give you the reqs for siege modules black ops give you all the fancy jump skills and both get you bs 5 if you train the pair and have the support skills to use them properly youre one long skillasc 5 off dreads
no that gets the issues to csm who then vote on whether to take it to ccp or not
well that makes sense
in this forum any eve player can raise an issue for debatethe best and most supported of these issue threads are picked up by the csm for debate the issues that pass debate are bought to ccp and if ccp consents the issues get implemented into the gamehow it worksin order to raise an issue simply create a new thread in the title write a brief description and in the body give as many details about your idea as possible any person replying to the thread can check a box to show support for the issue which provides ataglance on the thread listing how supported an idea is if a csm member wants to raise an issue in a meeting they are only allowed to select issues arising from threads in the assembly hall and only threads that are at least a week oldwhen a csm member selects the issue they must create a page in the eve wiki condensing all the forum input into a solid idea that can then be voted uponout of all the issues that pass the csm brings them to ccp who removes all the issues that are moot and talks with the csm about the remainder at this point a relevant employee in ccp is assigned the issue and asked to do some research on it is it feasible is it a good idea such answers are found and returned to the csm during the csmccp meetings online and in iceland issues that pass are added to ccps backlog that is their todo list for implementation in the gamehow can i get involvedby simply raising issues in the assembly hall try not to raise issues that are repeats of old ones if you are in doubt use evesearchcom and search the assembly hall forum for similar threads also search the eve wikilink at bottom to see if it has already been raised by the csm and what became of itif you support an issue be sure to reply in a thread and check the box giving support you dont even have to say anything in your response if you dont want to this helps the csm because we can better see at a glance what issues are the most supported by the player baseif you want to give feedback on an issue try to make your feedback as constructive as possible dont say your idea is stupid tell them why their idea is stupid the assembly hall is more then just a complaint box we can use this forum to make the game better for everybody so lets try to keep discussion as constructive as possible4thcurrent csm links for links to information for the 3rd and previous csms please see my post just below thislist of all issues raised by the csm4list of all issues raised by the csm everissues that have passed through the csm and are waiting for a response from ccpif you are interested in finding out what happened during a specific meeting go to the jita park speakers corner there is a forum thread created for every meetingedit more information on the csm see my next post in this thread this post is full

i play on a 24 at 1900x1200 and although i can read it the text is truly tiny and painful the ui in eve is one of the games worst points but the fonts should be trivial to fix unless the devs did something really stupid like hard code the font sizes in several different places or even worse make the layouting engine not able to scale
this font walks into a bar and ask the bartender for some whiskeyccp if you wanna hear the end of this joke just change the font please
as some one who released some of the tweaked fonts before they were locked away  i support this motion cant see how the ability to clearly read the screen is an exploitccp could always put the font file back from whence it came and allow us modify it again save ccp having pay for a new font  go on you know you want to 0lly
yes please
yes pls 
i absolutely support this topic it should either be rof bonus or damage bonus these things should not be tied to a specific damage type
not suported amarr and gallente always doing the same damage even if you use iron or lead conflagration or radiominmatar have all kinds of damage but more balanced a explosive missile agains gallente is more dangerous that emp l for example the first damage in cadary is kinetic if youre going to fight agains a minmatar t2 ship change you ship
if you let your race which can shoot from any range and always hit even if it is a small amount of damage get this bonus then you must give the other races bonuses tooright now gallente only deal thermal and kinetic damage arguably drones do all types of damage so its not fair but look at drones i think the most damage you can get from drones is 475 dps or so and thats with thermal drones so that point is moot also saying that you can use iron and lead and  doesnt mean anything since they are longer range we have to switch ammo just to shoot at the same ranges you guys do without having to switch ammo but less damage still same 2 types of damage effectively we only have a bonus to thermal and kineticminmatar can deal all sorts of damage but with damage drawbacks for switching around i think they also get drawbacks for range im not sure about this but minmatar has not so stellar dps which makes up for their damage spreadamarr can only deal em and thermal kinda like gallente they only get a bonus to em and thermal since they cant shoot other types and dont even have the option to shoot explosive or kinetic damagecaldari can hit anything up to your missile range yes it may be a small amount if youre shooting at the wrong ship size too fast etc every other race has to deal with tracking and range problems with smaller ships that they shouldnt be shooting atcaldari can also pick and damage type to shoot with no apparent drawback you just get bonus to kinetic you are not missing out on damage for thermal em and explosive missiles you are getting bonused for kinetic
picking this one out as it illustrates perfectly where your idea went wrongyoud first need to make all the minmatar t1 ammo base damages the same like they are for missiles and while you do that also remove all the range penalties and change them to pure damage typesas it stands minmatar already get a penalty for switching damage types you have to go with lower base damage if you want another damage type which makes damage type selection pretty much impossible apart from rf emp  rf pp  barrageagain understand that kinetic is the caldari racial damage type and hence they get a bonus to that being able to switch damage type without penalty is too powerful a feature thats why no race including minmatar gets italso missiles are missiles not turrets and not drones turrets apart from projectiles with serious drawbacks cant switch damage types at all drones can be destroyed and cant change their damage type onthefly
the penalty for projectile to switch damage type is built into the ammo not the race if missiles had the same damage output as they do now but with 25 of the damage being kinetic it would be an acceptable tradeoff to changing damage types imo

make it possible to toggle overload by clicking the middle mouse scrollwheel button or shift alt or ctrl  left mouse button on moduleof course we can use popup menus by right clicking but in the hard fight where overloading we especially need we must to do a lot of other actionshitting this tiny little green thing is so hardeve aint firstperson shooter where we need aim for the head
a better interface for overloading would be good
yeah a keyboardbased solution would be nice for this  no more clicking on the wrong part of the module to overload it give us something less prone to doing the wrong thing

yep and decrease all matar ships speed and increase their signatures too also make projectiles use as much cap as hybridsplus increase autocannons fitting requriments
hmm naomi knight trollscore 110reason noob corp old and discredited arguments clear lack of attempt of any original thought no reasoning as to why failed attempt at sarcasm because of complete lack of effort in reading
nah i say decrease amarr ships pg and slots so they can only gank or tank then decrease their optimal so they are dependant on falloff in every fight then split most their ships so they have to use missiles and lasersedit dang i bit didnt i lol

i was thinking about my factional warfare experiences and more often than not a fleet is a big blob that fires at anything with a red star on it with a few tacklers and scouts in it organising the fleet in a more strategic way is virtually impossible when working with a randomly collected army unless the tactics have been premadei was thinking of american football as an example they have attackdefense strategies memorized and each person knows what to do if a fleet commander in eve could load a battleplan where the program automatically looks for ships fitted to fill in the required roles and show primary and secondary target on the fleet members huds then an unorganised blob with only one tactic turns into a more organised blob with multiple possible tactics this might make blob warfare more interesting the battleplan program would ofcourse also work on smaller gangs but they are much easier to organise to begin with so the gain isnt as much as with a blobidealy the battleplan program could identify enemy shiptypes on the field and assign targets according to the tactic specified by the fleet commander this could be as simple as choosing to eliminate certain shiptypes first but could also be more elaborate where ships with ecm are automatically told via the hud to jam specific targets while logistics ships are told to repair specific friendly targets via the same system the hud target assignment being the most important part of the system second being that the fleet commander can execute complex tactics more efficiently

empire pos warfare it is a complete logistical nightmare to try and take down a large pos in empire space simply because the cost of resources and the amount of time it takes i propose 1 of 2 things happena remove the ability to anchor large towers in empire space research monkies use them to anchor 10 labs there is no reason why they cannot use a mixture of medium and small poss to get the same job done this will require large poss to be located in either 00 or lowsec and vunerable to a capital fleetorb introduce a minidread that can enter highsec designed to do more that bs damage yet less than dread damage this will discourage people from using them on a day to day basis in lowsec and 00 but allow more options when sieging poss they could be t2 tier 3 battleship hulls that get a damage bonus when deployed yet their tracking is so low they cant hit anything that is moving similar to how current dreads workboth options are very good but i am sure they are full of holes and flaws these are just general ideas and suggestionssaithe

overhaul the corporationalliance wardec systemthe current wardec system works however there are some major flaws in it i have been reading around other ideas and have written up this post of proposed ideas i would like to present for discussion and hopefully csmdev recgonition1 corps can jump into and out of alliance to dodge a wardec currently if a corp is wardecd and joins an alliance the wardec carries over to the alliance i believe that it should follow the corp solely for the duration that the dec was paid for after that its either the alliance or nothing a corp can also leave an alliance that is wardecd to dodge it i believe that the wardec should follow the abandoning corp for the duration that the dec was paid for then its up to the corpalliance that made the initial wardec to dec a particular corp that jumped out of the alliance or notthere has been alot of discussion that i have seen where people believe that if a corp leaves an alliance that is decced then both parties are able to shoot the corp this would not be right as the alliance that the corp has left has not paid for a wardec on the leaving corp2 active wardecs currently anyone is free to dec anyone and retract any war they please whenever they want provide they make the payment i propose a few ideasa if 2 corperations are involved with a wardec and a corperations pos gets sieged somewhere the wardec cannot be retracted until the pos comes out of reinforced unless the wardec gets invalidated by concord due to nonpayment this would prevent people from watching their pos get steamrolled to reinforced only to retract the wardec and laugh at the assaulters a possible flaw i see in this is someone going around and sieging poss just to keep the dec going however this can be easily identified and ccp can void the wardec as per exploit termsb when a corporation makes a wardec mutual that was placed upon them by anther corporation and the corporation that placed the initial wardec tries to retract it then the option to pay for the wardec should fall immediately to the corporation that made the wardec mutual there should be a 6 hour timer or so on this something short to disallow exploitation yet enough time so that someone cannot try to sneak it through without a director onanother option to wardecs would be a little trickier however provides a more fluid motion in easily getting surrender terms this would be the current contract system and is explained as followscorp a wants to dec bthey set up a declaration of war the costs being the same as they are currently with requirements of surrender detailed as we can currently do with an item exchange contract the duration of the contract is 1 weekonce corp b fulfills the terms of the contract be it isk or items the war comes to an end in 1 hour if b does not fulfill the terms of the contract in the 7 day contract period a can simply extend the contract or change it altering a war declaration contract can only be made during the 24 hour termination period at the end of the contract duration with a mouseclick and paymentcorp a can allow the contract to end and the war terminates 24 hours latercorp a can retract the contract at any time ending the war in 1 hourif the contract is made mutual by the declared corporation an option available within the first 24 hour period of the contract before the war goes live the contract timer halts until the mutual agreement is terminated by the declared entity once the mutual status is terminated the timer resumes until the end of its natural durationonly the declared party can establish or rescind mutual war statusmore to post ran out of space
if a tower is put into reinforced during the war and would come out of reinforced only after the war ends its active state is retained ie if its at war with a when it goes into reinforced then it retains war status for 4 hours once it comes out of reinforced mode irregardless of war status if it is engaged the target corp has full license to return fire per aggression rulesthank you icarus starkiller for this inputi would greatly appricate as much feedback as possible on all these ideas rip them apart tell me how they suck then tell me how they can work how to make them better the wardec system desperately needs an overhaul almost more than the current sov system that is being worked onsaithecoexec heretic nationps i really hate this 5 minute timer crap really bad

i have some ideas i would like to propose about solo mining yes i know there are multiple comments out there about how people are supposed to be in groups or other lame things that im supposed to be do with others because this is an mmo sorry but mmo means that there are other players around not that i have to always be in a group if i wanted that  i would go play ff11 i dont see on the mining ships any way to be able to take on any player pirate ships especially without a significant loss of mining ability so how about some mining pvp options then or at least giving dedicated miners a chance to fight back ideas 1 jet can mining is dangerous  another play can take all the stuff from it or just destroy it so why can i put in something in it like a largesmart bomb loose 10k m3 space and if another player pops my can itll trigger the smart bombs to go off too yes i might get hurt i might not it may or may not destroy them but im willing to take that chance i also might not be able to toss out another jetcan for an hour an acceptable trade off too imo 1a there are multiple ways to go for counters and then to counter those would be fun to slowly have this escalate hacking to try and get around anchoring to prevent it etc 2 if a direct increase for giant can doesnt happen how about some cans that you can have either be secure or anchor either you can protect it by not letting them have access to your minerals or they can get in but not take the can itself 3 a bounty system that works on can flippers ok player pirate flips my can and i dont have skillsships that i can take against their brutixthoraxmegathron fine  can i pay a fee to somebody to take my kill right on them and have a designated party go after them and offer a bonus if they actually can prove they killed them  3a how about being able to pay concord 5 mil to go after somebody for can flipping but with that theyll go slowly and only if the pirate gets in their face 15 mil  concord will actually make an attempt to shoot them down 50 mil  concordll go ape on them and the timer stops if the pirate hides in a station im sure other people have other ideas but id like to see some options to be able to go after somebody while im in a mining barge or exhumer or at least give them some retribution
1 not supportedget an hauler alt or get an orca like everyone elsehowever ive always wondered how much fun it would be to employ a booby trap system for things like cans and ships and other thingswrong password  kaboom2 lol no get an orca3 no bribing concord to do your bidding would result in exploitationno offense but uh as a seasonedexperinced miner this is not an issueand mining solo is not as profitable as doing so as a group if you refuse to go there dont expect it to get any easier
agree
they can nerf titans into the ground for all i care make them pure logistics even a long time ago the dd had a place in eve now with 20 titan conga lines destroying everything at a whim they just suck what little fun is left out of big fleet fights
perhaps this might work what if you can only fire a dd if there are no other dds in the system some interference bull could explain it
adapt or die
yeah instead of nerfing them ccp should remove all titans form eve alltogetheradapt or die
the issue is that the titans themselves are fairly balanced ship the fear of the titans though are overpowering and people tend to fear engaging their fleets because of titansnot engaging fleets is bad it leads to less pew pew less fun and general unchanging situations in 00so the titan will be changed if its made a remote ecm burst sort of thing itll just be plain sadif it can just keep hitting dd and pwning subcaps with something like a 30second or 1min cycle thatd be nerfy but fun you might see titans in subcap battles with dreaded fear of capfleets as any of those subcaps could cyno and you get bubbled anytimeif it can pwn 1 dread per hour cycle then titans will hit and run or at least try for capfleets which will be awesome because it speeds up the death of capitals which is also goodultimately those last 2 changes lead to soooo much more destruction and death that itll be grate fun
all the new pirate battleships get a pirate bonus for example the rattlesnake gets a 50 bonus to torp and cruise velocity seeing as these battleships are from pirate factions these pirate bonuses should only be applied to pirates eg those under 5 sec statusthis will stop a need breed of carebear gotry with these awesome new ships and make them fit the role of pirate battleships properly to be used in pvp
supporting
since when did all pvpers have a 5 sec statusidiotic idea
today must be the day of stupid pirate suggestionsif you want to limit them they should only apply to people with good standings towards the relevant pirate faction have fun grinding guristas standing
pwn3d
since the power of faction love can magically improve your ships performance you might as well make the bonus vary directly based on your standings
yeah thats what i mean but having full bonuses from 10 standing to the faction might be a bit hard so if you wanted to go the route i would make 5 the limit for max bonuses basing it on sec status is just stupid
it should be all of their bonuses
does some rattingsuddenly forgets how to fly her dramiel
50 damage taken from sentry guns for each and every pirate faction ship
shouldnt that be 50 i mean since the gunners would be out to shoot pirates more than other people that being their job and alland faction navy ships should get the same bonus
nah 50 would make far more sensepirate scientists have spents years developing electonic warfare stratergies to reduce the impact of empire sentry guns on there shipsteh bonus would only be of use to people using pirate ships to do pirate thingshaving thought about it for just one moment admittedley maybepirate frigs 75 sentry damagepirate crusier 50 sentry damagepirate bs 25 sentry damageevery pirate ship would be guaranteed a unique role in game
this not signing this crap i pvp in my nightmare and vindi and yet i dnt need to be 5
doesnt read threadlooks stupid
ok an alternative you jump in a pirate faction ship you instantly get become flashy to all players its not a gcc duh and faction naviespolice dont shoot you but anyone can attack you in highsec without getting gcc or sentry fire in lowsecthis wont affect 00 pvpers nor outlawshang on did i say alternative haha of course i mean to say in addition
s u p p o r t e dlol
lol  people lacking perception skills for recognizing disguised whinesflagging salvagers  boosting mission runners  begging for more isk  whine
just no the loot should not magically be flagged for the aggressor loot still belongs to the victim if you have a problem with your internets connection i suggest you get that fixed or upgraded or if you want loot magically flagged for the killer then go to wow this isnt a problem much less a problem for ccp to fix
except that this thread has nothing to do with salvaging its about looting try saying that when you get looted out of several billion in factionofficer mods by a guy who had nothing to do with the fight if it was so much as a corpmate of the guy who lost the ship i wouldnt mind but i dont think its fair that anyone can grab loot and it becomes a game of who has the best connection
it sounds like the problem is with your isp get a better connection problem solved the game shouldnt be changed because you have a crappy connection

no i dont have this option unless as you said i will waste hislot for offlined remote repper and as you said drones hull still wont be repaired for example putting 4 combat drones and 1 armor bot into 25m3 dronebay ship also sounds like a great ideayou can rep your modules anytime anywhere if you can use nanite paste without any additional modules anyways it seems noone really liked the idea of drone repping feature with paste so we can end discussion i guess

good idea
so yes you may know me im a terrible piratebut last night i had a wonderful eve dream and i brought it up in the hellcats channel where it was suggested that i post it here in my dream the faction warfare had sucked the empires resources all the furthest systems had fallen to lowsec status making it very hard to find a highsec route into another empires space most routes required at least 1 system of lowsec to be traversed former lowsec was now called fallen empire and was unconquerable 00 space given over to pirates and other lowlifes there were missions there too some of them for pirate factions or local warlords some of them for the navy of the empire that used to own the system most stations were in the hands of local powermongers with little care for any empire you could pay money and modules and minerals to the station owners to get access to the services of their station if you paid them enough cash or otherwise gained their favor by for example accepting a bountyhunt mission from them the stations guns would no longer fire on you as they were your buddies there were also random navy npc spawns little fleets with interceptors covert ops and battleships representing the empires attempts to get their space back in check they would hunt pirate players sometimes chasing them through several systems until the pirate managed to lose them should you marshal a pirate fleet and kill them they sometimes would drop navy faction modules which makes sense doesnt itso there you go that was my wonderful dream last nightthen i woke up logged in and was promptly shot at by gateguns 
seconded
i concur
i like this dream tell me more sweet thing swoons

there are spectre unicorns actually theyre going to candy mountain candy mountain spectre
correction chribba gets all the veld we get at most the scraps from his veldspar coated table for which we must beg borrow plead and occasionally resort to scandalous tactics to snap them up before our competitors dowhile i would love to sup directly from the glorious well of veldspar like the prophet chribba alas this is not to be for his is the titan and the glory foreveramenalso all your idea would do is bring trade between the empires to a screeching halt rp wise the empires would never let this happen since they tend to depend on trade among themselves at least to some extentalso let me rephrase trade wouldnt come to halt but moving products between the empires would become inordinantly time consuming and expensive which combined with the increased risk would substantially reduce the traffic between empiresim not against the idea of giving people reasons to want to go to lowsec i think its something thats long overdue but the idea that if the people will not come to lowsec we should take lowsec to the people isnt going to help that much
ccp doesnt love us ruin everyone elses gameplay to boost mine i expect that crap from idiot carebears but pirates are supposed to be a bit tougher than that the tastiest tears are pirate tearsseriously while id love to see more people in lowseci ran two csm campaigns on that idea breaking empire into four pieces is not the way to do it you cant just say hey throw lowsec into the middle of things to make people go into lowsec  it might give you more fat stupid targets though in practice it probably wouldnt but itd bugger up gameplay for 75 of players to make 5 feel good there is no way i can support this proposal
the idea is there will still be bridges of high sec between the empires but the shortest routes would incur riskmeaning you can be 100 safe but that comes at the cost of travel time
oh hellcats and bastards dont have enough to gank anymore collects tearsas in the old thread suggesting the same not supportedcrap is crap

since it seemed that ccp allowed people to pay for ff tickets with plex maybe they could rig up an ingame way to redeem a plex for the ability to watch all 6 days of a tourney i would suspect that a plex for a tourney should cover their costnot that i really care that much the rule changes since the 4th tourney have made them boring and not worth my time since
umfly more t1 ships only buyfly nano hacsrecons that dont die oftenits already been said 500 times in the thread but if you stop buying t2 cruisers then the prices will come down i agree that the prices are out of hand which is why i simply dont buy them anymore there are a ton of effective and cost efficient t1 ships that you can fly
lets give drones an actual ai so that they would in aggressive mode attack a prior specified ship type and when in defense mode they will jump back in your drone bay and out again to loose lock for sentries or break off the target and move with the most optimal transversal to avoid damage when attacked also if you put more drones then you can control in one group when drones from that group fall beyond a specified hp threshold they will switch with another drone from that group on their own as a bonus introduce market drones whose sole role will be to decrease my sell orders by 01 isk within specified parameters
i think i see what your saying you mean that if i click on the split into multiple stacks checkbox it will automatically bring up the second number for the number of stacks possibly defaulting to the number that would create xx stacks with xx items for examplei select to split a stack of 48 blocks into stacks of 3 then that number would default to 16 for the total number of stacks of 3however it would allow you to change that number to say 10 so youd end up with 10 stacks of 3 and 1 stack of 18 kind of thing

other races allready get this bonus  rof or damage your bringing up the argument about drones and then saying its moot  i agree this post is about cmbs and cmbs dont have drones bayscorrect minmatar ammo that does less damage does so because it has greater range  its nothin to do with what damage type it does  the most damaging type emp does lots of em  amarr  some  caldari  and some  minmatar  all races damages recive increase in dps when using minmatar ships and weapons through rof and damage bonusesyes i know we are getting bonus to kinetic thats what its says in the op how does stateing the obvious form an argument againstwe get damage only when firing kinetic  all other races get bonuses to all damage types there weapons can dothe problem is ccp has borrowed stolen the damage bonuses of cmbs to give caldari the kinetic flavour
omara otawanyoud first need to make all the minmatar t1 ammo base damages the same like they are for missiles and while you do that also remove all the range penalties and change them to pure damage typesif you want to balance mini ammo do so in another threadi have no intention of trying to balance mini ammo  there nothing wrong with it and yes i use it plentyomara otawanas it stands minmatar already get a penalty for switching damage types you have to go with lower base damage if you want another damage type which makes damage type selection pretty much impossible apart from rf emp  rf pp  barragewrongminmatar ammo decreases in power due to increasing in range just like every other kind of gun ammoyou cant argue that changeing damage type decreases damage what if you start by firing depleted uranium  0 range  most mini like damage types  exp and kin you can then switch damage types and get and increase in damage amount at the same time by switching to empem  which is not mini racialkin  which is not mini racialexp  which is mini racialomara otawanagain understand that kinetic is the caldari racial damage type and hence they get a bonus to that being able to switch damage type without penalty is too powerful a feature thats why no race including minmatar gets itwrongsacrilidge is not an overpowered short range vessel even after getting double damage bonuses  non racial  to the most damageing type of cruiser missiletorp raven is not overpowered firing torps with a rof bonus those ships if anything are still outperformed by there gun toting equivelentscruise raven is not overpowered firing 150km range cruise with a rof bonusno cmbs have been suggested to be overpowered versus t2 minmatar who have a kin holewhat you should have said is im having a knee jerk reaction to a post suggesting a slight buff to caldari because i havnt bothered to look for examples in game as a reference pointomara otawanalso missiles are missiles not turrets and not drones turrets apart from projectiles with serious drawbacks cant switch damage types at all drones can be destroyed and cant change their damage type ontheflyi am not trying to compare one system to another and say 1 is betteri know that guns are favoured these days for pvpso any argument about missile ships getting a buff therefore making them op is mooti am trying to compare the bonuses5 rof or 5 damage is 3 times more powerful a bonus than 5 kinetic missiles  which utterly sucks
dav you have 142 replies and 22 supportsyou may feel strongly enough about this to type wrong in caps but the rest of eve doesntif you want to increase the damage of a drake then its a fair trade to lose some of the tank that can be achieved by modules rigs and implants already available in gameyou have a horrible isk loss ratio of 41that stat says more about how amazingly battleclinic ranks people than your ability to fly a drake
supportedseems unfair that gallente get a damage bonus 5 turret damage bonus per level instead of a thermal bonus 5 thermal damage bonus per levelwhile caldari are limited to 5 kinetic damage bonus per level
dav you are attempting to change game balance without examining the necessity or consequences of doing so just a handwaving argument about life being unfair that makes this a stupid thread and a waste of everyones timego away and come back with a proper analysis of the balance of missile boats and the khanid and caldari bonuses in relation to other weapon types and resist distributions of common pvpfit ships in situations where missiles are commonly used
the vast amount of replys are not from a vast amount of people  probably half the posts in this thread are by me i can only support this topic once 30 of the rest have been from a few other people who have brought forward half arguments that try to turn this thread into a discussion about the pro and cons of different weapons systems and flattly refuse to look at the value of the bonuses which is what this thread is aboutdrake  there are 17 ships affected this isnt about drakes
there is a necessity for game balancethe consequences of achiving game balance is a better game imo with more variety and option for players to utiliseif you consider cmbs to be resonable balanced compared to other ships then obviosley you will be of the opinion that i am trying to make a fuss about nothingif you consider cmbs to be out of balance then you might consider supporting this boost cmbs through better bonuses threadpeople are used to the idea that the kinetic bonus is there to give caldari the kinetic flavourwhat most dont stop to consider is the value of this bonus compared to rofdamage and how it adversely affects ship balancebelieve me when i say that if i thought cmbs were balanced  however much i dislike the kin bonus i would not have bothered starting this threadfor the first 3 years that i played this game i flew mostly cmbs  i never liked the kin bonus but i never complained about it either mostly due to the facts1 missile were a lot better in the past before the nerfs they have recived2 i had little experience of guns to compare them toosince i have now cross trained to projectiles i have come to appriciate the woeful current nature of missilesi found myself doing more dps with t1 projectiles with skills mostly at level 3 than i ever did with missiles even with maxed out skill in missileslook at the line up of cmbs can you point to just one ship and say it is best in its class for pvp especially solo taking the 12 combat orientated vessels i would be of the following opinioncaracal best in class vexorcerberus best in class vagabondhawk best in class ishkurkestrel  best in class incursusdrake  best in class hurricanenighhawk  best in class absolutionastartephoenix  best in class revmoroscondor  best in class atrononyx best in class broadswordcrow best in class taranisrook best in class curseleviathan  best in class avatarerebusi dont have huge experience or evidence to look at forgilacaracal navy issuewormbut i somewhat suspect phantasmvexor navy issuesuccubusif missiles boats are balanced correctly with gun boats then it is reasonable to expect that at least 3 of those ships would be best in class just by pure mathematics15four races  375 round that down to get 3this would be done by ccp if the issue gets raised by the csmthe best i can do is point to evidence1 do minmatar constantly complain about caldari doing op damage against there kinetic hole   missiles get 25 dps against mini t2 2 is the raven an overpowered battleship  short or long range    raven has rof bonus 3 is the sac an overpowered shortrange vessel   sac has rof and damage bonus to heavy assault i find myself saying nono and no to the above which is why i draw the conclusion that rof and damage bonuses would not overpower cmbs but would be just the boost they need to bring them up to par compared with there class equivsif kinetic flavour is important for cmbs then it should be applied through the ammunition as is the case with other races haveing the kin flavour on the ammo does not cause the issues stated in the op

yep bad user interfaces probes not on overview are no way to create gameplay
i support this ideathere must be a reasonable chance of a skilled lowsec mission runner seeing probes on a directional scanner result without having to hit the scan button every 4 seconds click scan scroll list repeat there is no time to even run the missioni like the idea to put probes on the overview then the mission runner only has to click scan with a properly setup overview settingif the above doesnt work what about having probes leave an echo for 10sec after a scan the echo would be picked up on a directional but the prober wouldnt be effected as the probes would act just as they do now
im so supporting this
wowat least theres thought and logic to those ideasid actually enjoy flying my native race again
1some projectile and some minmatar ship need little changes because they are very weak compared to some other ships and weapons

without going into the pros and cons of the logoffski thing this argument brings up a valid side note and potential solutionlet supercaps dock and take out the ewarp mechanics for all shipssome of you are going to cry foul on the supercap docking thing i know but think about it you can have an unlimited number or dreads carriers freighters etc dock in the same station and no problem while supercaps titans especially are the size of a dozen or so dreads nothing stops a 50ship strong cap fleet from docking at once there are even modules already in game that can store supercapsso my suggestion allow all stations a certain amount of space for ships to dock make that number big enough that one or two supercaps can dock though presumably to the exclusion of space for many other ships in that station and allow as ccp is apparently considering multiple stations in 00 space systemsyou could still camp the station hosting the titan of course it might allow the supercap pilot more time to wait you out but it would also stop a number of ewarp abuses
lol lies the titans alt even posted in local afterward about how happy he was for messing up our day by exploiting and getting the titan out happy camping
as for the scan them down thing you have 30 seconds to scan them down before they login again and repeat the process generally they are not agressed so they disappear after 30 seconds
support it is abused to much players cant have nice things
this is barely related and they can dock you just need a capital sma you just shouldnt have super caps if you cant hide them in a sov 4 death star
curiously is the logoffski used more when someone is escaping someone hunting or when a guy gets in a system and theres a gaycamp i mean gatecamp 
ok heres the problem it is extremely easy to catch some sure but how often do you have that scan probe launcher ready on top of that you find the person you warp ur team on them you have what 2mins to kill em its very short the person logging off has to log off with agression in order to get the full 15minson top of that lets now say they are a freighter 2mins to kill a freighter is fairly longpretty sure darknesss current nyx survived using logoffski i have an old vid of tyraxx thorks aeon logoffski pretty sure anywayfrankly the system leads to less destruction of ships as a carebear who profits from destruction of ships i dislike this

god yes i want this i want it so much
no good reason not to have it
mmmmmm no
i never said it couldnt be done in fact we just sieged a large tower in empire space i thought of this while we were shooting it though
so you basically prove that your suggestion is not neededthank you now lets move on to something else
no
current large pos in empire would be allowed to remain but if taken down or destroyed cannot be erected againcheck agreed after besieging a large pos with nothing more than bs i 100 greei disagree with this optioninstead introduce a siege and triage module for battleships same requirements as capital siege mods dumbed down a little for bs use essentially does the same thing for bs guns as they do for capital guns this will vastly increase the dps needed to engage large pos lock the besieging vessel in place and cut its ability to engage subcapital ships dramatically even missiles would have to be adjusted in siege mode to do little or nothing against a bs sitting dead stillthe siege module would not increase the battleships defense values so itd be a sitting duck if the pos rallies defenders or they lack the logistics to handle concentrated pos gun fire triage modules would increase the logisticsdefense capabilities of the bs using it as currently enjoyed by carriers but extends the range of remote logistics to a comperable range 2040km topseither could be fit on any battleship
they are overhauling pos entirelyso this issue is moot
why would you limit that large towers are supposed to be hard to take downfurthermore it is often easier to anchor one large tower and have multiple labs on it than having to keep the corp standing up so you can anchor more smaller towers to anchor more towers when the demand growsfacepalms no those should be limited to cap ships you already got logistic cruisers with a rep power that largely exceeds the a single bsand for more dps fit more damage modsmay i ask did you siege that tower with like 10 people that you bring up such a cry out on this 4050 people nuke the tower into reinforce in like 2030minutesmaybe a bit longer with hardeners on the tower
the fight began with 20 bs and several bcsafter 8 hours the average number of pilots was 13 bs and a couple smaller shipsthe hostile corp onlined 9 shield hardeners after pulling it out of reinforced they anchored 18 in total it has zero guns and 30 ecm arraysa dread fleet of 20 would have difficulty cracking a nut like this in 00 even though none of them would be destroyed by the pos itselfi argued against this proposal when it was discussed but after wasting a day pounding on the stupid thing i am more than inclined to agree large pos are simply untenable for a mere battleship fleet to engage in empire there are not many corps that can willy nilly dedicate a fifty man heavy fleet to a single attack that would take hours of pointlessnesssmalls and mediums are still plenty tough and can deal with the average fleet of bs in empire if managed with any care at all a single pos gunner can near destroy a bs in a salvo or two of small pos gunsas some other rube in assembly hall was whining about capital ships in empire too much ehp to suicide gank large pos simply have far too much ehp in the face of anything subcapital to be allowed into empirecouple that with 36 hour reinforcement timers and wardeck dodging renders them almost entirely unassailablea little insider information herethey said they were changing 00 soverignty dynamics nothing was said about changing poss
hehe resistor pos dthey are even pain in 00 but well a well defended pos should be hard to kill you got competent enemies there be happy about itbut not every pos in highsec is like that

what the heck does my battlecliniccom record have anything to do with this proposaloh your trolling never mind then
what exactly does his battleclinic and pvp record have to do with his ability to recognize which ideas suck
my statement may have been misleading if you did not read the full statement i intended to state that the current wardec system allows corps to dodge wardecs i do not propose this or endorse this in any way shape or form and i am proposing ideas to fix it
 i apparently took stupid pills today and all my posts have been 100 suck factor i apologize an interesting idea it would be nice to see wardecks overhauled as they are pretty bad atm isaac
we already have a strong dynamic and very functional contract system porting the war declaration process over to this exact system or a separate war declaration contract system should not be a terribly difficult taskthis will establish terms of surrender that the declaring corporation can put in place yes the terms can be pointlessly out of reach if the declaring party chooses make them so the declared party should also be able to place their own counterconditions that the declaring party can meet to end the war prior to the end of the war period counterconditions render contract termination closed for the declaring party  they either have to see the contract period through or meet their targets terms of surrenderonce the terms are met by either party the war ends almost immediately 1 hour so that the surrendering party can get back to their normal operations in a timely manner and begin repairing the damage theyve sufferedif the terms of surrender are met the declaring party cannot choose to not accept them it is a function of the contract and as such is a binding agreementalso if the one party surrenders the victorious party cannot reinitiate another war contract for a period of time 7 days to a month or some other feasibly logical period other parties are not prevented from declaring war howeverthis would go a very long way toward making wars more for lack of a better term functional and logicaladditionallyas saithe said leaving an alliance should not end the period of war for the exiting party unless the declaring party chooses to let them end the war exiting an alliance during a war creates a subcontract that can be modified by both the declaring and exiting party to establish their own terms of surrender ending the war in the aforementioned 1 hour period once metfurthermore war flags all members of the declared corporation the moment the contract is issued before it goes live and that flag is retained if they exit their corporation they can freely join other corporations and their war status does not carry over to the new corporation the war flagged target can be assisted by their new corporation without concord intercession should that pilot come under attack with the attendant aggression rules currently in place
yes replying on an alt ok now thats out of the wayyou seem to have missed all the real issues what about jita pvpers docking as soon as the alliance they decd arrives what about the exploit of using neutral logisticsi would propose the following war aggression would generate a 15 minute aggression timers during which time you would not be able to dockjita rens and other key trader hubs would not be included in the wars targets could be engaged anywhere else but camping jita 44 undock would not be allowed logistics repping ships engaged in hostile acts will be concorded unless they themselves have an active war dec against the target shipthoughts
please stop that peace and love in jita stuff right nowif so people will never leave jitaand this isnt the game we want eve to bejust think about it during 2 secondsi agree that the agression mechanics are a bit broken but your idea is so bad i dont even want to take the time needed to list all the reasons whyim sure a couple of forum trolls here will do it for me after reading your idea
true your ideas sucks and its badvewy bad we should wardec your corp just because you thought about thisbut anyway i guess thats your price to pay to wardec an alliance that doesnt want to fight or a corp that doesnt want to fight there probably in high sec or something come join the big boys down in nullsec and wardec of those guys im pretty sure they be happy to kick your ass if you wardecemif you got the balls in the first place not all pvpers like this cause wardeccing an entity in nullsec is usually a bad ideathey shoot backthey shoot back big time
id like to support some of the ideas put forth in this thread1 if an alliance is wardecd leaving the alliance should cancel the wardec for that corp please keep reading i explain the reason for this is because wardeccing the alliance could be a valid tactic to try to break up the alliance the wardeccers may want thishowever if a corp itself is wardecd then the corp should continue wardecd regardless of joining or leaving the alliance2 i like the contract ideas for wardecs makes these like treaties however any contract as far as a war goes should be optional for example you may place terms in the contract valid terms may be corp x leaves the alliance the alliance pays us x amount of isk we kill x number of ships in the alliance etc however even if these contract terms are fulfilled the deccing alliance will have to go into the contract and accept and cancel the war or have an autoaccept option that cancels the war immediately within an hour if the terms are reachedthe reason for this is we wouldnt want to mess with the current system which mirrors real wars in a good way in some ways where even if two sides agree to the treaty you can still break your treaty thats just my opinion though either way some kind of treaty or contracts for wars would be nice didnt the devs mention something about fully functional treaties in the blog maybe they could touch war decs too
additionally they need to fix mutual wars so that both parties have to agree on terms of surrender before the war can end
all the highsec capital ships are in violation of the rulesrules here3 you may not use your capital ships attributes to gain any sort of advantage over other players while in high security spacean attribute of capital ships is a massive amount of ehp which literally cannot be suicide ganked no other ship in highsec is capable of this undocking in a capital ship is a violation of this rule as it uses the capital ships attribute of high ehp to become immune to suicide ganking
me screams with nigh hysterical laughter at the piratesuicide ganker sob thread
accusations that i am a hacker or exploiter is quite inappropriateas the implication that i am a pirate or suicide ganker with a sec status of 59 suggests thus
yeah pretty much this those capital ships in high security space are there because ccp allowed them to stay if they thought ehp was a problem my guess is they wouldnt have done thatif i cant suicide gank them is your best argument youd do better to have this thread locked now before the flaming gets out of hand
hahaha i never accused you of hacking or exploiting how silly of youand if you arent a suicide ganker or pirate i cant understand what is possessing you to whine about how hard it is to suicide gank capital ships
chribba didnt want that veldspar anyway

well i dunno where storefront went how about apply this terrible system to corp hangars where the system wouldnt be totally bustedcorps could set it possible for people to see what is in the corp hangar the person then does the sort of create contract storefront buy orders of what they want then directors with proper roles could accept buy order and give out those items which makes it possible for newbs to get fitted ships out of the corp hangar get out there faster and get into the pew pew
not sure but they once talked about this last year if i remember right but the patch didnt get this feature out so my guess is that theyll probably wait for walking in stations for this to happen first probably so we can have a las vegas commercial district style well something very flashy everywhere they were suppose to release manufacturing of named items as well on the same patch last year but they didnt do thati hate them just for thatbut on your thing yeah i support it cause contract last for 2 days and i didnt see any way to put an order for corp members only
pirates could have good standings to certain factions aswell do antipirates get the same kind of bounty
not supporteda concord doesnt pay bounties for killing player pirates as bounties are created by players in the first placeb the bounty system is flawed and doesnt work in the first place which negates point a doubly soc not all players can be killed in high sec unless the standings for sec rating is below 5 and even then most pirates wont be flying in high sec with that kind of rating for a obvious reasonuntil you resolve the above your proposal is one sided and encourages greifing on a grand scale without counter balancing the systemif you want to get paid to kill positive sec rated pilots with very bad standings to factions in game then we should get paid to kill you folks likewise from concord or empire factions as well for breaking the law if you willa ying yang affect is what we need to achieve here
what a ridiculous idea no
so what youre saying is that shooting your friends should make you both large sums of free money no
not supporting this because all your doing is whining over not getting paid for criminal actionsuntil you acknowledge that people who are targeted get fair shot at said bounties by ais and not players dont expect anyone to support this except those who greif and gripe over not getting isk
looool poor you
well think of it this way redhow would you feel if carebears could get paid bounties for blowing up anyone with a negative standing towards concord regardless of bounties as in an additional bounty paid out by concord even with 0 isk bounty placed on anyones headthe only obvious thing that would happen is you guys would be going after each other by the time your bounties got high enough and then when do they stop issuing bountiesyou got a ton of holes in your proposalits vastly unbalanced and has a serious lack of foresight
theres a reason players dont have bounties like rats its because then players will just sit around in shuttles or t1 frigates or free rookie ships and mutually kill each other back and forth for massive profit
finally someone caught on to the elephant in the room
not supported
you know im going to go on a bit of a limb here i think the idea has more merit than people are giving with their straw man defense if it were done in such a fashion so as to only reward bounties to people who have aggression flag against a pirate faction ie missioning or ratting in lowsec and was done as a dirivative from how much the person had in bounties on the reward period factored against the ship the person killing the rats was flying it could be workablejust to give a hypothetical unmathematically sound examplejohnny 101 is ratting in tama and has collected 14 mil in rat bounties in the last 14 minutes while in a caracal redsplat comes and pops johnnys caracalnow johnny has a 7 standings to guristas and is flying a cruiser therein guristas would reward redsplat 07x140000004 2450000 not a huge sum of money but enough to give a small enough incentive to cover repair costs and still prevent abuse of the system
if if i was going to support this without a counterbalance i would only allow it in low sec and 00not high secbecause we us high sec folk even tho im moving to whs have no defense against this
i think itd have to be implemented in everywhere save wh space simply because from a practicality perspectiveplayer a is killing guristasplayer b kills player a either saving guristas or avenging fallen onesin either case if the person gets themselves flagged is at war etc it doesnt change and miners worried about rewarding suicide gankers should remember that the average belt spawn would make any reward pitiful in highsec
i can see it now tens of thousands of petitions for getting ganked without concordreally you seriously cant be that dense
you just lost respect points for ignoring the obvious
pirates should get a fraction of the ships value as a reward for the killthis does 2 things1 its no longer profitable to buy cheap ships and farm your alts2 makes piracy and counter piracy a little more viable as a careerwould be even better if we got a fraction of the total insurance if someone has had a ship for a long time and has had multiple insurance contracts the killers would get multiples of said bountyi should contrast this proposal from the op and say that i dont really see the point in making this npc based as pvpers generally dont have high or low standings with any npc corp makingit npc standings based just makes it more of a pick on carebears thing
its worse than that all i can see happening is an endless supply of isk for killing various ships without restrainti mean ive killed so many angel cartel rats in high sec they practically have me at 10 for all intents and purposes i dont particularly like going into hyperparanoia mode because im a potential isk cash cow while flying my maelstrom or an orca or an hulktake that and multiply it by the population of jita sudden smart bombings even with getting concordd or not would get things totally out of controlas ive said before the idea is intriguing but leaves open a gaping can of wormslack of foresight and counterbalancing is not a welcome thing when it comes to changing the systemeven the smallest thing has a major impact in eve
even if the stupid thing is ship type based people will just kill each other in their rookie ships get the bounty and then they get their free rookie ships when they dock this system rewards players for engaging in zero risk activitiespilot a hey man we both have really crappy standings with insert pirate corp name lets get in really cheap t1 frigs and blow each other uppilot b ok ill startpilot b blows up pilot a receiving bountypilot a ok let me go dock so i can get my free rookie shippilot a docks and gets his free rookie shippilot a my turnpilot a blows up pilot b and gets a bounty pilot b then docks and gets his own new rookie shipwash and repeat for hoursoh and itd be a cool new way for isk sellers and rmt traders to macro make isk on trial accounts brilliant idea

ours was a 27 titan conga it was there more or less to prove the point that there are way too many of them we even doomsdayed a carrier to death it was a beautiful thing to witness but i wouldnt want to go up against it nobody would thats why the nerf has to come in titans are becoming so heavily proliferated that its not uncommon for roaming gangs to get nailed with a doomsdayanyone whos ever been in 00 knows theres a problem its about time ccp got around to addressing it

support why is it so hard to change something back to the old thing
i support this product
the problem with this is simple as i posted earlier in this thread as wellthe other t2 ships with the exception of the equally underwhelming eas get a total of 5 bonuses if you count their resistances that way af get 4 so counting resistances does not make the problem go awaykrum
situationas it stands currently carrier and mothership pilots only have two choices when it comes down to repairing their drones and fighters either they deploy all drones and start repairing them with repair systems remote rep or repair drones or they go into a station and repair them there not even to mention trying to repair hull damage in spaceto me it seems odd that carriers are not equipped with an installation on board which can repair their drones without putting them into a dangerous situation or forcing the carrier to be dependant on a station installation especially since carriers are mobile logistical bases but the designers somehow forgot to put in a maintenance baymain proposalgive the carrier class ships the ability to repair their drones when they are docked inside the ship however this ability should not be able to compete with the remote repairing abilities provided by the carriers capital remote repairing systems the repair should be slow so that it is most effectively used after a large battle when the carrier is out of the heatthis is primarily aimed at drones taking hull damage as many people will not have a capital hull repair system and carriers are supposed to be mobiles bases which provide logistical support and not dependent on stationstldrgive carriers the ability to repair docked dronesextra ideas formed in topic maintenance deck to which you move your drones for reparation should not add extra capacity some kind of fuel usage for repairing revised to make it more balanced faster repair rate to motherships have an active triage mod unlock a faster repair mode making this option viable in combat have the option to use a faster repair mode at all times on the mothership however make this consume fuel as well make it as effective as a normal carrier repairing drones in triage but make it use much more fuel due to the lack of the triage mod revised since motherships changed possibilities of new skills related to the maintenance deck
motherships maybe carriers no
why should supercarriers be the only ones with this ability
they cant dock and it would give them another strong point to field them
this is like saying you can launch aircraft from a modern aircraft carrier but you cant fix them when they come back damagedi support this maybe give motherships a boost like 100 to the repair rate over normal carriers representing more adavanced and comprehensive repair facilities  or even just additional warm bodies able to perform repairs at the same time but they should both have itsupported
give carriers this ability only when they are in triage dunno about the supercarriers 
the logistical role of the carrier makes this suggestion seem almost obviousthumbs upo verys
2ndd
and supported 
yes and you better make it so you can queue repairs on multiple drone types

ccp advertises the game as a cold ruthless game not for the weak of heart it is a sandbox where literally anyone can do anything eve is not forgiving and it will take everything you have earnedyet they kill the core of the game that makes it ruthless and cold piracy they boost sentry gun damage they take away warp to 0 they increase the aggression timer before you can dockjump they removed the old style probes and add new ones and now they add a timer to our directional scanner i swear to god this game is going downhill and turning into carebears online hey ccp we have a game for carebears already its called wow if someone doesnt like that they lost their   them thats the way of eve there are not a million quests and npcs to guide you and hold your hand through the entire game no you download the game and get thrust into the middle of a universe with nothing but your reaper and 5000 isk stop taking away what makes eve itself the core contigency of it piracy cold dirty ruthless bastards that teach the ing carebears of wow that convert over that this is not wow and they will not have their hand heldi mean  after almost 5 years pirate faction ships are finally getting looked at for a possible buffrantsigned turn this game back into eve online before myself and every other pvper quit and make this game carebear online ii  space edition

i would happily live with the supposed lag if you put it back to how it was please look at all the votes
agreed its kinda funny when i dont want to overload i seem to magically hit that tiny button instead of turning on modules and when i want to overload i cant hit it for the life of meand the context menu is just a bit too clumsy you dont find the option quick enough imowhat about just making that overload button a big strip on top of the module bubble where is it written the whole thing has to be roundcould as well have the strip indicate heat damage on the module that circle thingy isnt really easy to read either
supportthis sounds like it could be an awesome idea anything to stream line combat is a plus in my book with t3 out and overloading being a more viable option for people this would help out greatly

i think something needs to be done about thisa game mechanic was put into place on purpose get key activate gate key goes away you run the complex and take your chance at death or gloryproblem is some people find ways around this keys are harvested and folks get into an instance that you got the key for or they sit there for hours in the last roomspawn locationwhatever and waitthis is not everquest or wow this shouldnt bethe solution is simple at least to memake the keys expire after a set amount of timeim not sure what can be done about folks camping the last room of a complex maybe have the complex shoot peeps out when the spawns happen like a pos forcefield and do it far enough that they cant warp back inim just throwing out ideas but somethin should be doneskan
supporting investigation of this issue the hilarious solution would be to make stronger and stronger guys spawn the longer you stay in a plex so at some point your af has to kill a fleet of 10 bs in that 210 plex which only despawn if you leave d not actually suggesting that but it would be hilarious
and then i let it spawn such big rats and wait cloaked until someone else warps in and gets toasted besides most af can easily speed tank ratsprofit
plex keys have the effect of making plexers invincible unless someone can come up with an earth shattering observation in the remainder of this thread im going to raise this as a csm issue
if your going to make keys expire after a certain amount of time then make them reuseable within that time periodreasoning  some players go in and get the crap kicked out of im or they cant salvage or whateverplexs being one way turn me off  o p
oh and making keys expire is probably not going to happen because they will have to code in a new feature for itremoving keys altogether and making the gate usable when the boss in the current room is currently dead or some repeatedly achievable objective that doesnt lock out the next guy is probably a better idea
so i just read the new dev blog pretty impressed by the new super carrier which as long as ccp lets them dock and make them cheaper seems goodthen i read thiswait what nerf the moros whythe moros is currently the weakest dread fielded in todays cap fleet as the nag got a boost to its tanking with its extra mid slotits only benefits are that it can be use as a station dread for hitting station camping ships which i might add requires a complete refit from your normal dread fitalso that it has the highest dps of all dreads on paperhowever this is not true as gun tracking in siege is so lame you get light hits on a tower even though you are within optimal and at 00ms seriously ccp fix that already and that drones cannot hit over 60km without rigs and the high slot module so in normal siege encounters where you are at about 150km range from the other dreads drones will be uselessi want a serious answer ccp what crackpot came up with the idea that another drone ship needs a nerf fix the crap in the game rather than ships that dont need fixing if you add this into the next game people will quit and the moros will be never be use again as it will be next to uselessgg ccp well done for being moronicrantas you can see not happy with that one change the rest is goodeditgood new everybody they kinda listened then stopped then turned around and laughedso as per my post in the thread this is just another kick in the teeth
ffs let me direct your teary eyes to these posts tissue
nah im good just outraged that they suggested that just boost the guns remove the massive drone bonus simple but didnt see that part feels stupid
heh
bye bye to all the low sec mission runners who use moros to do nongate missionsi love gallente and welcome this change perhaps when the change hits sisi you should help out with testing and give constructive feedback to keep moros balanced with the other titans
moros  titans  oh well yes
confirming i have a titan
actually its 30 seconds and the problem is those 30 seconds you are invulnerable due to the nature of the abuse
that solution solves no problem lol it just makes their new warp point take longer to make plus you dont need a new solution the emergency warp is designed great its just bugged we need to make that distinction people i feel that emergency warp is there for really when the player is logging back in for the people with the slower connections they wont be having their ship appear in space before they can control it the emergency warp gives you time to log back in while your ship is already known to the serverthe bug is a new destination is created if you log out during the emergency warp the solution would be to check was this person in emergency warp when he logged out if so dont change destination else change destination point
i propose to boost at the minimum carrier drone control range because its ridiculous that an ishtar can control drones further away than a carrier class ship which main purpose is logisticsdroneboat currently maximum control range for nonfighter drones is 60kmin other words give carrier either a static bonus or per level one5075 control range  static bonus  boosts control range to 90105km 1015 control range per level of carrier  leveled bonus  basically the same for the upcoming nerf of moros this would be great for moros to have static control range bonus as well  or even all dreads 
i support the looking into of this issue not sure if youre solution would be the best option but its certainly sensible 
supporting my own topic well these changes maybe are not the best but would be better than it is now

i can think of a use there is only one navy issue drone boat the vexor i would much rather a navy version of the myrmidon than the vexor drone ships dont get much love as it is and they definitely didnt get any love with the navy issues but there are plenty of missile projectile boats
it seems this idea is well supported what happens now just let it sit here and hope that a developer reads this and gets inspired i am pretty new to the process here any suggestions on how to move this idea forward will be appreciated
it was fixed you returned to original log off point no matter how many times you ctlq not anymore just tested and its as described you get a new ewarp point when you ctlqbug rep it get an answer from ccp why this fix didnt make it to apocryphaedit this also works with cynos and was heavily exploited in the past you can bridge a whole fleet in and ctlq them
this is a tolerated exploit works perfect for bots super caps and everything else i totaly support what your thinkin it is cheating can show you picks from selfmade emergency warping super caps out of dictor bubblesin general i wouldnt replay here but i just had it again raven unlockable in belt due the selfmade emergency warp feature  but hey luckily he warped another one in before he ctlrq 4 other ravens p was somehow to emo and forgot to do a selfmade emergency warpya your right you cant get killed in empire lowsec and 00 with a passive logout you can break camps in wardec situation in whatever ship you are cause the fekin aggressor doesnt even get a lock on this ship no question about emergency warping but a selfmade one is just gay still have fraps lurkin around from selfmade ewarps away from 3 pointer npcs slowboating out of my dictor bubble somewhere in 00 hammering tha button to get a lock on his ship but you know it is not possible meanwhile do the selfmade ewarp feature he lost aggro from the ratz instalock on me  stories over storiesdont know my whine whine conversation with devs ended with the feelin like you in it easy to change it is ploitin and glitchin like in other gamescodin isnt ccps best one you know p

already been raisedi believe ccp intends to implement this
i like icaruss idea of the ability to fit a siege or triage to the battleships and having them affect the ship just like they do the dreadcarrier alternatively make them smaller to not give as much a damage bonustracking penalty or as give as much bonus to rep rangecycle time
we took down a large shadow two days ago you just have to have the right equipment in place with the right people on station the funniest thing happened while we were repairing the mods and weaponry to take with us a local in a bestower showed up and tried to time the unanchoring so he could take the mods so three of our pilots got in their very fast ships and played bounce the bestower it was hilariousi laughed so hard i almost peed my pants i have never seen a bestower do 3k ms before
you had been nice to the guy noir just suicide ganked everyone who tried it 
ok now let me ask you something how long did it take you to plan this how long did it take for you to put the pos into reinforced how many members did you have shooting it how long did it take to get everyone on at that time to start shooting iti am not trying to argue that taking down a large pos can or cannot be done if i had the time and patience i could take down a large pos by myself solo thats not what i am arguing for or against i am trying to suggest alternate means of pos warfare for empire space to give everyone an equal chance to take on large towers in empire space and not just lowsecwe all know theres 1 person in a corp that would love to sit at a large pos in a dread in lowsec and siege the  out of it running the risk of getting hot dropped lets allow the same thing to happen in empire space only with a new flavor of battleship it would make things more interesting and i am sure a fleet of 50 battleships will be cheaper and cost less than a fleet of 10 of these new mini dreadscarriers
what you really miss do you have the slightest clue how much work it is to maintain a large tower i dont mean such failure as yours in bosbogera large tower is supposed to be work for both sides maintaining and killing if you want to kill it faster bring more ships if the challenge is too big for you leave the pos alone the others win if you really want it gone you can also try to keep them from fueling the toweranyway still not supported the more you post the more it looks like whining because you had to work for something
i feel that field command ships need a boost at the moment there is no real reason to use them over battleships the reason for this is that active tanks currently are no way near as effective as ehp tanks only the abso and nighthawk are viable ehp ships another flaw with commandships is that pretty much everyone is packing a neut of some type these days which is not good for commandships especially when trying to take on battleships a possible fix for commandships could be to reduce the effectivness of neuts on them but on a size scale so battleships using heavy neuts wouldnt be able to neut or not very well be able to neut this would still enable frigates and cruisers to neut commandships making for some epic killmails or what ever i think that commandships should be brought to the attention of the csm as they require a bit of a boost
nightmare is a commandshipi like the bonuses from commandships a few gang links can help a gang quite a lot not to mention vulturedamnation as baitsespecially field command ships are meant to be tough nuts to break so a fc can sit in them and survive through out the fight
heh allways mix those two up i think you got fleet and field commandships mixed though still there really isnt that much of a reason to fly a cs over a battleship which will do the job other then bonuses etc they are still much too flimsy in the current nature of pvp and everyoen fitting neuts in spare slots
either your doing it wrong likelyor you have never seen a command ship in action propperly very likelynot supporting
i have never seen a command ship in action no please tell me what i am doing wrong sleipnir and astarte can not ehp tank that well while still doing dps and with an active tank setup one heavy neut can end them
i have the minmatar one in fact and they do a beuatiful job in there own rightive also recall seeing a pair winning a round in the alliance tournament some time back also minmatar varianti dont think command ships are used in solo fights they tend to be used in groups or gangsfeel free to correct me those who know better that isi think you should do a bit of research before you push your proposal any further at this point
well most commandships should have enough buffer to burn back to the gate and deaggress and imho the gang link bonus is the reason to bring the commandship no matter if fleet or field commandship if you dont want to bring it for the bonuses you still have more agility and speed or just bring a bs if you feel better but they definitely got their role i dont see a need for a buff

lets keep this topic alive the war dec system needs fixed badly
this isnt about peace and love in jita its about lame ass war decers who never leave jita or rens stay within docking range and dock as soon as the alliance or corp they decd turns up for a fight we all know who i meanyou are right that empire pvp is broken but there are many ways it is broken not least of these being a belief that sitting at 44 undock ganking people who havent loaded can in anyway be called pvpthe reason i suggest banning camping in these systems is to promote roaming pvp you know like everyone does in low sec and 00 now surely that is a good thing and provides a natural progression into lowsec and even 00
but what it would actually do is make these areas a safe place andor move the campingganking to another area theres only so many ways into jitain eve a war is meant to not be safe anywhere if people abuse it and war dec people in jita to try to get legal ganks you could appropriately not go to jita or find a way around them or haul with backup if you make it not worth it perhaps they will avoid decing you and your corp in the future
screw that if the lame ass wardeccers are not leaving jita and other market hubs then they are not somewhere else theyre not in the alternate hubs we all know who you are talking about here privaqueers they wardec any alliance thats bloated and large and rich they are simply there looking for the s that undock their shiny expensive ships and getting the easy kill so they dont have to do any work whatsoever ever notice how fast the scatter when you show in in 3 or 4 numbers to fight them hell i scared 14 of them off when i was in curse alliance 2 years ago in a crow a lone crow scared off 14 privaqueers if they wardec you and you fight back they will think again about deccing you a second time
no the only real war dec ive ever seen is the ed one man corp who war decs an entire alliance and demands 20 million a week to leave them alone dodging war decs by leaving an alliance seems like a perfectly valid tactic to me i think war dec griefing by people who never undock maybe should be addressed first
goes both waysgreifers who war dec to just to greif and kill for no other reason than to kill force those who dont know how to fight back let alone could never win to never undockthis is a 2 way street hence why you dont see me participating in these discussions as so much because both sides of this age old argument frankly suck assand until i can say something constructive i dont want to beat the horse to dust as its already long sense dead and broken
technically speaking any high sec capital can be suicide ganked it is just much much much much harder to do sogo recruit 5000 torp raven pilots to suicide gank chribbas dread that should be more than enough to pop himbut seriously nice troll attempt
who the hell would wanna pop chribba chribba holds lotteries we all love chribba because hes so awesome and he gives back to the community and all that insert further denunciations of any and all sickos who would try and pop chribbas high sec veldnaught
want to suicide that titan bring friends a lot of them
and youll need to bring a lot more friends to suicide the people who will be parked between you and that titan weve had this discussion already even the goons use chribba to sell their capital ships iirc youre not going to get many takers

cause you always have the chance to get attacked anytime thats the purpose of a wardec anyway attack anytime well after the 24h ofc i never said it was their fault in the first place the fact is that i dont get is was do a wardec when they dont attack whats the use of the wardec thenlike i said before doesnt make any sense when i look at it this wayalso instead of saying please actually learn the game before you start talking change please be more constructive and turn on your brain cells it works trust me

to be fair there is nothing missing just a few things that could do with updating such as why some items were turned down by ccp i just wanted to see if a csm member would put the time and effort into looking and updateing after all whats the point in a wiki if the main people csmccp dont update it with all the information it is the csm part of the wiki afterallits one thing to make a nice thread and get glue applied its another to keep what that thread links to uptodate i wasted my time into looking for an answer that should have been included within the wiki when the data was entered it was not and as you correctly stated im bloodyminded enough to point out that all the nice formatted threads in the world mean jack if they point to incomplete dataill await a visit from the internet spelling police again yawn
good points wellmade theres a difference between the effort of keeping things up to date as events unfold and fixing an omission where somebody says its wrong find the error that i wont tell you about and correct it nonetheless your cautious pessmism that it will turn into yet another incomplete thing on the internetcan it be incomplete and still useful yes the csm part of the wiki has been useful to me in satisfying my curiosity about certain issues if nothing more mazzs sticky is well constructed and even though 90 of idiots always ignore stickies on forums will probably help keep the assembly hall more organised even if it is polluted by idiots like me going off at a tangentid have capitalised the initial to omitted the e from updateing inserted a space into afterall and hyphenated uptodatei put more effort into the things that im good at and do for free than the ones that im paid for this is probably an unwise longterm strategy
put up or shut up i have no idea what things are missing and im not going to know until you tell mewhat issues were rejected by ccp during the iceland trip is not released yet because the guy that is supposed to do the release hasnt done it yet so its not there and it wont be until he does
emily oh it is very usefull  and many thanks for the spell checking  i always sucked at thatmazzilliu since you linked to the wiki i assumed you had done the backend work my applogies for assuming that the csm kept there part of the wiki updated with your input i now know this to be wrong so thank youhowever to be helpfultake this oneincresed sisi skill training speednotice that there is nothing in there except the proposed issuenow take a look at the last post yet no offical answer from ccp has been inputted and since its submission date 102008 one would assume that answer and reasons would be documentedill assume that it will be updated in due time via the people who have the information and be on my way
its not my business to go and edit past csms wiki issues if you have an issue that is screwed up with the current csm i can help you therefor that issue though i am confident that the answer is no
i know the answers is no but as csm can you please prod ccp to get an offical answer somewhere anywhere would be nicethank you
im not going to
didnt think you would
i support this especially the retribution upgrade it should have at least two mid slots if not 3 take down a low slot and add the mid slot if it wont be balanced if need be but only one mid is ridiculous
this seems entirely reasonable
sounds good to me
supported
sure why not
makes sense wont enrage carebearssomeone raise it
supported seems strange that carriers dont have this already as it sticks out so bad just make a new bay called maintenance deck or something and have the dronesfighters repair xxx amount of hp per minute could even make a new skill book out of it called deck gang for example which improves the repair rate per levelmake this happen ccp supported
id support this implementation only if the drones in the maintenance deck cannot be launched directly into space otherwise youre just increasing the drone bay sizeso you would need a right click  move to maint bay and a right click  move to dronefighter bayand in this case the supercarrier bonus becomes obvious  it gets a bigger maintenance bay so it can repair more dronesfighters at once
supported nothing as dumb as the scooprelaunch as drone shields used to be but a slow passive repair feature would be very useful
since this makes complete sense i support itas someone said real carriers can do it there isnt much difference except for that whole space vs water thing
theres so many things fundamentally wrong with the idea and frankly its just another thing after the ambulation nonsense for years that makes me question if the management knows what theyre doing
i find it quite strange that ccp doesnt realise the potential for this mmo if it would be released on pc there are quite alot of pc gamers who have been waiting for a revolutionary mmofps since planetside the game being released on consoles only is in my eyes nothing else but a backstab but you knew this already before announcing atleast create something entirely seperate from eve if you want to try out the console market and dont backstab your fans like this

personally i havent had any trouble with this so far so if it reduces lag then im all for it i would like to see that this delay is reduced slightly to 1 or 15 seconds though so its possible to do some decent scanning while warping in an inty

im going to say it like i promised i wouldlets remove csm term limitsokay it isnt going to be that simple we need protections against jerkwads who are popular online but get no work done within the csm but in the long term were going to need continuity along with fresh ideas so i propose three simple changes that should fix this problem and i will follow it up with my reasoning1 remove the 2 term limit instead no more than 4 incumbents are allowed on the csm at any time incumbent is defined as someone who has already served the 2 terms and is running again what this rule will mean is that when it comes time to tally the votes if more then 4 incumbents are on the csm the 4 qualifying incumbents with the highest votes may stay and the rest are disqualified from both csm and alt status2 upon application for all incumbent applicants ccp should look closely at the past contributions and decide whether or not its worth paying for all the airfare to get them to iceland ccp can arbitrarily deny any incumbents application if they think that their contribution to the csm will not be worth the financial cost3 partial termssuch as when a csm has to drop out and an alt steps up to take their place do not count towards the term limit if the partial term did not include the csm iceland summit where the majority of the csms work is done specifically this will mean that this halfterm does not count towards isslers maxso anyways here are my reasonings1 a significant portion of the csm are people elected by the same voting blocsgoons goons northern coalition specific eve forums pandemic legion  renters  the girl vote preventing the same individual from stepping up means the voting bloc will choose someone else to represent their interests so partially removing the rule as proposed will not necessarily cause a huge change in the long term continuity is going to be important because the 2term rule essentially means the csm will eternally be filled with csm noobs and anyone really qualified to serve is disqualified after only two termsalso because of rule 2 i do not think that this change will result in abuse2 the csm is basically consultant work for ccp their payment is the free trip to iceland and all they stuff they buy you and you need to submit satisfactory work in return3 i dont think what is happening with regards to isslers situation is fairfor those not in the know issler has already served once and was an alt this term before she was bumped up to full csm status after the very important iceland csm summit so shes riding out the lameduck end of this term and it currently means she can no longer get elected
the t1 and t2 ships in eve have fixed slot numbersthats so boring and an expert pilot know what can do against this ship i have an idea for change thiswould be create 2 modulesship body augmentor mid slot module passive moduledevice upgrade augmentor low slot module passive moduleship body augmentor could be add to ship one low slotdevice upgrade augmentor could be add to ship one mid slotresult ship lost a mid slot because fitted module but gets a low slot or vicaversa one single module useable on ship only simultaneouslyskill requirement ship body augmentor mechanic lvl5 hull upgrades lvl5 1x rank 1 skill and 1x rank 2 skilldevice upgrade augmentor mechanic lvl5 engeenering lvl5 electonics lvl5 3x rank 1 skillcant use if the ship reach the maximum 8 module slots in same row like low or mid 
i like the idea but why not have one for highmid and highlowslot conversion as well would be reaaal nice for those of us fond of ships blessed with utility highs
signed
this wouldnt change predictability at all  youd still know the common setups for various ships and theyd still be fairly standardized all youd do is make ship fits even more samey  because really whats wrong with a geddon and a hyperion having the same slot layout youd destroy intended limits that have been used to balance thingscf retribution and ship fitting would continue to be equally boring in most cases youd just make things more complex to add a bit of flex not supported
great idea why add new ships when this could allow new variations of fittings on all the old onesand while they are at it why are scrams and webs mid slot items and not high slot they are weapons are they not  and nos and neut are correctly highs major permanent shield tank nerf there shield tank ships generally do not have as many mid slots as armor tankers have lows already
i support the idea not the implementationbetter would be is if were a rig that exchanged a med for low or low for med and also had drawbacks say 10 velocity from medlow or 10 cap recharge from lowmed
this is a better idea than the ops and fits within the current game mechanics tbqh
this should be restricted to t3 you want to modify your ship get a strategic cruiser
no this is not truethis shift make just a small flexibility on ship and you cant change the all attribute of ships as t3you can change just a 1 slot not all
i agree but i think these widgets should work like rigs in the sense that theyll be destroyed if you remove them and they dont drop if you destroy the ship but still be fitted in the mid or low slot and actually i dont feel a low should be possible to convert to mid only downgrade and only one step at a time iehigh  mid  checkmid  low  checkhigh  mid  low  check using 2 modulesmid  high  faillow  mid  failand there should be a limit to how many of these widgets you could use on one single ship maybe two or threesupporting the general idea but with some modifications
i like this idea better than the op this feels like a more natural fit of how rigs work
i must be missing somethingbut how do the keys make someone invincableoh and being able to reuse them on the same instance would be nice so you can go salv cuz you dont always have an alt or buddy to come withskan
what if plexes simply moveafter the plex is devoid of npc rats it moves to another location in the system and the player ships are left behind forced to start the plex from scratch
that works tooskan
have people able to hack the gates and gain entry without a key using the codebreaker module and the hacking skillanyone hacking their way into a plex gets no bounty for killing rats and there is no possibility of any loot drops for themin short the only reason to hack your way in is to kill that sob hiding in the plex
yeah tis a silly system
the problem isnt the mode of entry it is the fact that you can harvest keys and camp the last roomcamping items should not be a professionthere are folks around where i fly that have it timed down to the minutethe only time anyone else gets a chance is if there is a random dtskan
if plexes move around and have to be scanned down again there is no more problem right

the moros has became a unique ship class of its own people trained all the way up to gallente dread to be able to use it in that role they invested lots of skillpoints and theres no real reason for this nerf i dont see any complaints on the forums there is no real reason to nerf it and frustrate all that moros pilots especially those that use this ship not in its dreadnought role the nerf is a mistake i hope ccp will reconsider it and leave the moros as it is

ok thats pretty encouragingfailing that evemon shows a mere 95 days for my gallante capital alt to respec to amarr so v0varchon  thanatos anyway
the change wasnt really called for and current moros specs are as if drones are considered a capital weapon on it this is the same as the dualweapon system on naglfar drones dont even come close though dpsrange wise unless they also introduce some new type of siegedread drones and boost drone control range for drones
just train amarr
fixed that for you
all the dreads have been weak at times lasers used to do next to nothing torps used to do  to moving target less so now dont even ask about the nag time for the moros
i agree ccp needs to fix how hybrid turrets dont hit or as hard as other weapons used by other races fix this problem and the drone bonus while in siege only will be a non issue implement the siege change without fixing hybrids and you are screwing every moros flying character in game the problem with that is they spent at least 6 months to a year of focused training to get into the ship and to turn their hard work into rubbish would be a slap in the nuts by ccp
supercaps should be a major risk eve always has had a risk vs reward system and the risk of a super cap is that it can be camped into its home starbase that starbase could run out of fuel or could be destroyed making a supercap dockyard strikes me as removing the risk from an inherently risky 60 bil investmented has weaseled their last titan out of danger fix this now ccp and also move an avatar and an erebus into cl1 planet 5 moon 12 and make sure it has no fuel in its fuel bay and cant moveand is officer fitted screw you ed for being s and not taking your titan losses like men

i would like for people to watch market trackers for the basic construction components of all rigs typically that meanstripped power circuitssmashed trigger unitsfried interface circuitsburnt logic circuitsetcnotice every one of them peaking and then declining to near or lower levels than pre patch announcement 3 months agothese are the most basic building blocks of all rigs small medium or large if demand over time really went up rather than an initial spike due to a flood of ship reserves needing to be fitted shouldnt those prices continue to go upconsider this its only been 3 months what will happen at 6 months when this has had more time to normalize to the new settings rig prices for the most part have returned to near pre patch levels and most are still on the decline even more the most pronounced ive found so far is the core defense extender line the larges have declined 33 from their pre patch levels due to the mechanics of building by all the logic listed in this thread that shouldnt have happened if the prices of mediums would drive up demand on all the drakes in game since its much harder to track id love someone who frequents the faction markets to comment but per the example i listed pages agocenti ctype small armor repairer has seen an increase from 8 mil average to about 12 mil average since the patch corpum medium armor repair appears to have increased by about 10 mil averageamarr navy energized adaptive nano membrane has gone up by around 80 from 2225 mil up to 4143 mil all of this i miraculously predicted as the simple shift in funding from rigs to other gear to get the same type of edge that people claimed was class warfare in rigs 31709you cant solve that problem with the patch that was implemented
the faction warfare system disagrees with you and it is essentially a pvp training ground for people ranging from newbies to long time players that never learned pvp there are plenty of people flying around in things that are smaller than bcs because at 35 weeks most people cant afford to lose a bc every few dayssimply put the cost of a rig for a ship should be relative to the cost of the hull itself you have yet to explain why that should not be so or furthermore why it shouldnt have been that way all along ccp either didnt think about it or didnt have the mechanics to implement it originally but now they do i realize that you want rigs to be expensive things that make the owner feel like a unique snowflake but thats not what is best for the gamethe skills for rigging arent particularly expensive or long to train it makes sense that newer players should be able to afford the rigs since they can afford the skills beyond newer players though it makes sense for a rigged t1 frigate to incur a loss of a few million when its blown up instead of 50m or so if i had 50m to blow id fly an unrigged bc or cheaply fit bs which would be far more useful than a rigged frigaterigs are not magical super mods and they shouldnt be priced as such
your assessment of what the rig patch did and then your claim that it is therefore bad is a pretty huge jump with pretty much nothing in the middle to explain how you get therei understand the power creep issues and we were talking about that in iceland if i remember right it was agreed upon that rigs did create new balance issues and introducing yet more mods to alter ships is probably a bad idea past this point but the rig patch itself it was a boost to everything not a battleship or a capital it provides me with more options to make my frigates better in certain ways that i wouldnt have bothered to do otherwise and i think its great
currently we are allowed to refuse any one mission in any four hour time period without loss of standings this is put in place for good reason to prevent isklp farming and standings grinding however the kind of delay for a level 1 mission should not be as long as a level 5 mission what i propose is an exponential increase in refusal time allowance that makes more senselevel 1  30 minuteslevel 2  1 hourlevel 3  2 hourslevel 4  4 hourslevel 5  8 hoursthis will allow newer pilots to enjoy the game while still keeping reasonable caps on the isk faucetsdiscussedit doubled cooldown times
reasonable seemingly well thought out might need a bit more refinement though no arguements from mebeats waiting 4 hours for my level 2 agent to let me refuse another mission because he has a fetish for gallante bodiessupport
i think you need to keep level 4 missions with a 4hour timer the problem is that there are certain missions which are trivial to complete take very little time and have great rewards level 4 recon 1 of 3 and 2 of 3 for example and a character who may not otherwise be able to complete level 4 missions could just cycle through his agents until receiving this mission2 hours is just not enough of a penaltyon the other hand id love this change so i could keep doing those two missions as often as possible doing no work and gaining lots of standings and lp
i think this is missing the main issuejoin one of those alliances filled with gms i will not mention names and im sure your petitions will be answered much faster
supporting op as i have had several petitions where the gm clearly did not even read what i wrote as in would suggest something i said i did in the first post i dont even petition stuff anymore  like when that unexpected downtime happened i had about 12 a mining mission done and when i got enough stuff the site wasnt mined out so i couldnt complete the mission i just mined the rest of it because i didnt want to deal with a petitionalso this is probably old but one day i was reading the stuff on how bob was cheating and how they treated banned the guy that exposed it it made me sad
tier 2 would be just overkill tier 1 maybe but no navy drakes

we beg a csm member to take notice and bring up this issue at their next meeting
specifically how is that done who are the csm members where do we beg
great idea having a different icon for what sort of subgroup the implant belongs to would be a good idea too like armor
thumbs up
practical simple and a bloody good idea
i support the ideabut if this is such an issue for you why not buy a few different small containers sort them how you will amongst the containers maybe you have 5 spare sets of implants so have 5 containers each with a spare set shouldnt be too prohibitiveanother idea put the sets in your backup ships this might not be as good since you might lose a ship without being podded but if you do lose ship and get podded you hop into your new ship and plug in the implants in the cargo
title says it all it seems there have been several old threads and no reply from ccp that i could find
3 domis with damage controls hull rr and hull repair drones why do i see this bieng just a little overpowerednot trying to yell at ya but i dont see this working nice idea though
i was thinking about what other shiptypes eve might need and came up with a destroyerhull projected cloaking ship needs good name stillthe basic idea is that it can fit 3 of these modules in high slots each can cloak another ship it can fit covert ops cloak itself and 4 guns meaning it has 8 highslotsits projected cloaking devices can be deactivated by the recipiant ship act as a covert ops cloak meaning no targeting delay but cannot be used in warpthey would be primeraly usefull to bring ships close to their enemy before becoming visable to them ships like blasterboats and tacklers would benefit from it a lot the ships need to be flying close to the projected cloaking ship for the cloaks to work but outside of the range where cloaking stops due to proximity so the max projected cloaking range should be about 5km
the idea sounds nice but it should have the following limitationprojected cloaks only work if the ship it self is not cloakedusing both at the same time is a no go
i think youre right although destroyer hulls are paperthin perhaps them being uncloaked makes them too vulnerable unless you use a cruiser hull on the flipside since you cant tell what ships this one has in tow people would think twice before engaging it they could even bluff their way out of some engagements perhaps almost like playing poker which projected cloaker has the better hand
an anchorable cloak bubble would be much better
why is it better
just like the title states if anything i would like to see the ability to train 2 characters at the same time on the same account i would even consider the possibility to get rid of the 3rd character slot to be able to do this although the 3rd would be nice even if you cant train in it i understand ccp is interested in making money and this might make that profit less however good customer service goes a long way and enabling this would be great customer service especially with the dust 514 leering its ugly head at us hinting at even more game expenses if you want to take part in that im curious how ccp will work that out hopefully well see some sort of package deal and hoping its not a big stiff one anyways can i get a yay or a nay i say yay
you already brought up the argument why ccp wouldnt do itless subscriptionsand imho if you want to train more than one char pay for a 2nd account
actually i have 3 accounts and my wife is going nuts over it lol like i said sometimes having better customer outweighs more profit in fact the arguement of saying ccp will lose money if they allow this is not proven and could be psuedo intellectual for the sheer fact that just the prospect of having to pay for another account in order to train another character effectively could actually cheese someone off enough that they just cancel their subscription period im positive that has happened i propose ccp to give it a try and see how it pans out they can always revert back to the old way if they lose too much yay or nay
following your example you would mostlikely close 1 account and move the toon to one of the other 2 accounts you prove my argument no
no
dumb idea theres no other mmo that lets you simultaneously gain xp on multiple characters on one account why should eve
pretty much this just be glad eve doesnt require you to actually be logged in to trainbattleships 5 would really suck then
there must be a con to balance the pro of two in training 1 char training  100 training speed2 char training  both train at 50 speed same sphour just spread across two characters maybe even disable the skill queue or implants this would still encourage multiple accounts to get faster training on both characters but if for some reason you only had one account and really really wanted to you could train two i still dont see this happening
why no merge accountslets me explain on mine little englishmerge account 1 whit 3 characters whit account 2 whit 3 character now you have a account whit 6 slots and giving you a profit a train 2 characters but paying double for iti think ccp didnt want lose money and this idea is good for both parts
somehow i dont see ccp going for this instead how about somthing akin to what was posted before training 2 chars but 50 or 60 training speed maybe even paying to be able to train 2 cars on the same account for a price 2025 a month for double training instead of the 30 since you cant log on the same account twice
i agree with this id pay extra to train two characters on one account the problem will then become people farming characters to sellid propose a special kind of account which costs extra as suggested already and does not allow character transfers  ever
however it takes less time to lvl up in other mmos than it does with eve thats a fact
you are only looking at one part of the whole if implemented yes people may get rid of accounts and just transfer characters to less accounts looking at the bigger picture getting new players and retaining them in my opinion would be more important are you ready then read this you missed it the last time customers quit playing eve when they realize a how long it takes to level a character up compared to other games b you have to pay for extra accounts in order to level up various characters in a reasonable amount of time not all customers obviously quit but there are those that do now before your head starts spinning like a possessed teenager girl watching the jonas brothers it is good to compare this game with others since the others are the competition and may actually pick up these lost subscriptions of eve simply because they dont take forever to level up or what not so really this is geared towards those lost accounts sure ccp will lose accounts but they will retain new accounts that are started thus negating the initial effect so i bet youll say well why dont you go play wow which totally condtradicts your arguement of ccp will lose accounts if implemented and show that you really dont care about ccp or this topic altogether in that case go back to doing your high school homework and shut up we need to improve the learning in game it is in my opinion too slow i think the timed learning is excellent and im glad that i can train even while away from the computer that is awesome for people who dont have a lot of time however people who play the game more should gain xp faster than those who play it less i would like to see bonuses to learning time to make it go faster while playing the game like anywhere from 50100 faster while playing once logged off your training slows back down to normal speed its all about customer service ccp probably wont do it and people like you guys will never ever understand why this will actually bring in more money because you are too stupid to understand do you want proof of this look back to the regan days where we practiced trickle down economics and a major boom in business and capitalism compare it to now where you have the liberal fs who with their greedy tax policies keep tacking on tax upon tax but yet have no money to support their agenda and ultimately the programs they implement for ths country fail and consequently kill the economy as we know it trickle down economics operates under the theorey that you lower taxes more businesses are able to stay in business because they can afford to stay in business thus enabling them to hire more employees who earn money and spend it in the economy if ccp were to cut back on the cost of playing the game more people will be able to afford to play the game thus actually increasing the volume of players playing the game in fact they may actually then activate another account if they want either way ccp will earn more money and you are all nubs
supported as one small step on the path to cleansing empire of the towers that defile the holy space
i am sorry but i really can not see any reason to nerf high sec poss as they are fine as they are and yes i have taken out a large pos in empire beforenot supported
i personally managed 6 personal large poss in 00 when i was in knights of the southercross so dont tell me i dont know how hard it is to manage the pos i had 3 mackinaws mining 247 when i wasnt doing anything else to get enough ice to last i also did the math and sorted my fuel properly to make sure i always had 32 days of everything in the posso i know how hard it is to try and manage a large pos i am not whining about something being too hard or unfair i am asking for balancing since thats what ccp seems to be doing balancing the gameplay and since you can use dreadscarriers in lowsec00 against poss yet capitals are banned from empire due to the hp and  it only makes sense to introduce a new module or type of ship to perform like a dreadcarrier and be vulnerable to bss and  while not being able to jump to cynos
and thats exactly the point the pos is vulnerable to a bs fleet so there is no balancing issue here at all
then i want you to wardec someone and get 15 people together in battleships and shoot their large pos tell me how much money you spend on ammo tell me how long it takes tell me how many hardeners it has
1 armageddon2 plain t1 crystal3 fit some rr4 profit
i think its ironic that this thread has gone on so long after csm mazzilliu has already said no
he said that they are fixing poss and that this issue was moot we asked for info and noones replied so until then i will keep this thread alive for balancing purposes
what she meant is that since pos warfare is going to be dramatically altered by the expansion theres no way ccp is going to make one of the 2 dramatic revisions your suggesting in the meantime
did it occur to your thick skull that discussing this is a waste of time because ccp already made there minds up on the pos situationif they already have an answer no csm is going to bring this forwardtime to call it a day and wait for dominion
i propose a frigatehull shiptype that can use a module which can pull another ship along in its warp the pulled ship drops free midwarpthe idea behind the ship is that it can be used to pull large capital fleets apart dispurse them so you can quite liturally devide and conquerthe hijjacker module can only be used on these ships and have a maximum range of 2500 meters so the hijjacker has to approach lock and warp before the capital ship can lock itthis has another effect that capital fleets would do well to have a support fleet of smaller ships which can lock fast and warpscramble the incoming hijjackers think interceptors and the likethe reason that the hijjacked ship drops free midwarp and not endwarp is that in the latter option its too easy to trap the hijjacked ship in a bubble or otherwise trap it cant possibly get out of making the hijjacker too powerfulli propose a fitting somewhat like this2 high2 med1 lowthe hijjacker module would fit on a high slot leaving it one spot for a turret or missle launcher this is not ment to be a combat effective shipin the med youd often find a mwd or afterburner or both because these ships need to get really close to their targets before their targets can lock onto their small signature radius this also makes these ships mostly uneffective against small ships with faster locking speeds big capital ships are its prime target though they should also be usable against small gangs but this should be harder
no especially since you didnt explain why
2 reasons to make small ships usefull in capital ship engagements to be able to disperse large blobfights into smaller engagements an antiblob tactic that doesnt depend on the soon to be gone aoe ddd
small ships got a role in cap fights1 kill support and dronesfighters2 tackleyour split battle in many smaller doesnt make much sense imhonot supported
well think about it this way what other ship could temporarily take support ships or ecm ships away from the battlefield taking a minute or perhaps less to get back in the battle also if the warptug defeats scrambling then perhaps it can be used to pull a friendly out of a warpscram if the hijjacker isnt warpscrammed itself
no other ship can do that and im not sure why we need a ship that can
well how is having more diversity on the battlefield a bad thing
have you ever tried to command a fleet these ships would make that basically impossibleany ship the hijacker managed to pull away would be essentially dead hijacker  covops  a few dedicated bs  anything that is tackled being dead does this seem overpowered to you
the reason a hijjacked ship pulls free midwarp is to prevent it from being dead for certain

yes i am a covops can have a scan on something and be warping within 510 seconds if it has probes outlock time is negligible carriers can take time to align warp
fair enough how about this a hijjacked ship is automatically alligned to warp back to where it came from better
we need a ship that can spit out a huge shockwave of millions of dps which could wipe out entire fleets perhaps 3 of them at the same time could wipe out an entire bs fleetoh wait
not supportedseriousobvious lack of foresight and experiencenot to mention requires a vast overwritechange of warp mechanics to one ship class
it would help if you could elaborate on the foresightexperience that is missing
it would help if you actually listened to the people who responded to your op in the first placei dont need to repeat what has been said
apparently any understanding of how eve pvp works and just how ridiculous including this ship would be
sick of corpalliance spamwhy not make topics in those 2 categories work like forums eg when someone replies it gets added to the current topic instead of a new one
it should work for non corpalliance mail too a decent evemail client would so rock djust a stupid thought  now that we get a decent igb how about a web based mail client as part of cosmos that way you could check evemail outside of evejust my 2 cents
thumbs up on both  eve mail needs some loving
and how would you choose the topic you want to reply to you would flip some kind of check box just as easy to click over to a different chat windowso why not have another chat or two for your corpalliance it would only be a matter of discipline to restrict the players to use the different chats for different topics the same matter of discipline it would get to get them to use the different topics that you proposenot supported as this functionality already existsedit i misread i thought he was applying this to chat yes eve mail needs some lovin
evemail is supposed to get overhauled as part of the cosmos expansion

well no kidding the police try and catch criminals seriously what the hell did you expect and since this post isnt a suggestion but rather a cranky stupid rant im gonna report it and watch with deep satisfaction as ccp deletes it
alright so i was on irc last night and someone had the idea of a battle recorder for alliance tournaments this could potentially be used to record battles by the end user but thats way out there lets keep it simple for the momentinstead of actually capturing video using some method such as fraps ccp records the information the server sends to the client and vise versa as its only the information all rendering would be done on the client side this should make for both small grid recorder as its been dubbed files as well as making it nonprocess intensive to record it should be even less process intensive as its being recorded server side by ccpccp uploads these files and a special eve playback utility is used to play it it would use the installed eve files to render everything the difference would be that it wouldnt necessarily have to go online everything done locally and that you wouldnt fly a ship the camera position would more than likely be fixed on whatever recorded the battle originally but you could look at and move the camera round user overview settings to view ship speed and distance get info on shipsplayers etc just as though you were watching the battle in eve as i said everything would be rendered locally so you would be limited to what your machine can support as far as graphics if you really wanted to get fancy you could introduce slowmo and pause rewind etc featuresim sure someone will bring up the point that as its only recorded information someone could mess with these files to produce false battles as its an offline file though this isnt really important you can make up a fake battle but it wont affect anything in game if you were really worried about this then ccp could encrypt the file before putting it online for downloadnow i dont know the exact technical limitations of what im talking about so now is the time for everyone to point out to me where im wrong however other than the difficulties in programming a grid recorder and playback utility i really dont see how this would be a problem the information is already read by the server and client and i would imagine is written to some form of file even if temporarily you just need to put that information into a format readable by the playback program which could be done after the battle has finished at a later date and build the playback program itselfsolinkage to original post
you know i actually brought up the same idea informally to one of the people working on the tournament and the response was something like thats a lot of codingsomething ought to be done to improve the visuals though at the moment its mostly just looking at pretty ships the average person doesnt know whats going on maybe ccp should hire john madden and get his markerboard that he draws on the screen with that would be awesome
id like to see it and i can see it being useful for things like tourneys if its as much coding as mazz suggests then its probably not worth it but i can support asking officially instead of unofficially see if anyone comes up with an easy answer for it or something
personally when i hear that i hear we dont feel like it im sorry i normally stick up for ccp because i know making games like this keeping them constantly running and relatively bug free is a huge task and not one im arrogant enough to think i could do however no proposal should be tossed aside because its a lot of coding anything in this game is a lot of coding i dont think there is one thing that wouldnt require a lot of coding certainly the major patches that are released every 6 months to 1 year are a lot of coding i feel this is a pretty poor excusenow if the problem is technical limitations which i dont really see and have been told other games have overcome to implement this idea anyway or simple time too busy working on other stufflow priority i can see which i hope is what they meant by a lot of coding but yes i would like this brought up in a more official capacity and some thought and real response given by ccp i think it would be a lot less coding than say walking in stations which we havent seen yet but ccp has talked about doing for years now and this would be much more functional and useful to the players
as a programmer i can certainly vouch for this interpretation of thats a lot of coding they want to spend the majority of their time on the stuff that will have the biggest impact im not saying this shouldnt be brought up in an official capacity but give them the benefit of the doubt that would be a lot of coding for something that doesnt functionally improve the game which is why im not supporting this proposal only because theres so many other things they can work on that are much more needed and important cosmos or some kind of communication improvement at least dominion 00 sovereignty stuff more t3 etc
code costs money its not an issue of laziness its an issue of resource allocation the alliance tournament creates a lot of hype and so forth but in the end doesnt bring ccp a lot of money especially after broadcasting costs and running eve tvits a lot of coding is a perfectly good reason to turn something down

gavens solution is definitely better what the hell is the point in seeing it on the list if it doesnt need repairs
they work well solo and in groups just depends on the balls of the pilot massive dps in a package faster and less clumsy than a bs
well when i said i dont think they are used in solo fights i meant the ships original intended design was to command fleetsnothing is to stop a clever pilot from wtfbbpqpwning some hapless target in the nether regions of spacecommand ships can easily do this but only in trained hands much like any other ship
yeah i dont know wtf their ordering system is at present but whatever it is its ugly clean up the big important devsonly board please i dont care if you do it this way or if you make posts stickies for a fairly short period of timecouple weeks then remove the glue or what but make it so that we can actually find things in the sea of name vaguely related to topic  a new dev blog from ccp unpronounceable
im not sure if you have checked the weight of a corpse recently in eve but we are all getting fat i think we need the exercise
im not sure if this is the place for it but i was thinking that the market place section could use a new sub forum for services offered rather than having to wade through all the buy and sell items ie shipping services corp creators stuff like that well thats my 2 cents sorry if this post is not in the appropriate place but it was the best place i could find for it
probably wont be there due to prior commitments ie having to be awake a few hours after the meeting starts to get on a plane
there needs to be an extra tickbox or the wording changeda lot of things are absurd but in the right direction so you can make a post and suggest adjustments to original posters ideaissue but the current format only allows agreedisagree with originaleither add a tickbox saying i support this topic with the caveatsexceptions mentioned in my post or change the current tickbox to mean the same
yer sure
this again since it seems to get lost in the 4th bonus which i fully support in case of confusion discussion
i kind of like the current retribution it has lots of damage range and tank  it has purposewould be awesome to have tackle but fear it would jump to the top of the pile in the same way the zealot did with the 5th turret tackling retributions would be immensely powerfulgame has evolved a lot lately and more options are available adding a bonus following the old scheme tracking damage tank etc is easy but uninspired and quite frankly boringthere is currently a push to add an ab bonus to all the assault frigates which will likely end up invalidating all but three of them with the jaguar being supreme against everythinga better role bonus for the class which would benefit all of them is to borrow the heat resistance bonus from the t3 hulls and perhaps add a bit  afs would gain speed tank damage and longevity without obsoleting any of themmake them special in a good way not the deliverance way until then this does not have my support
i kinda find it a pitty that the amarr have the choice between an af which cannot tackle but does good damage or a heavy tackler that does no damagejust the mere fact that the retri has only 1 mid slot turns the amarr race into the race with the most inversatile af roles around for my playing style anyway

thank you for all the responses so faryou say this would be a strong point to field them thats nonsense if you read my proposal i say that they are slowly repaired over time this means that its by far less efficient than tossing them out and repairing them with your remote repairing devices its meant as a small addition so that they can easily recover when out of the heat of the battlenobody would field a mothership because it gets an added addition which will make no difference in battle itselfi believe they should always have it however it might be interesting if there would be a bonus towards this mechanic if triage is active i like the idea of having them put out of temporary use and put inside a separate deck as a ways of repairing them this would be much easier than having to individually select which to repair but i dont believe such a skill would be neededo cs
ok just to save myself for the record ive never flown a carrier into a large fleet fight so maybe i just dont see your point of view on thiswhere is the logic in your proposal though you want to be able to repair drones for after a fleet fight when its out of the heat i dont see the logic in this if the carrier is no longer in a fight why not just simply dock up and repair your fighters you said yourself that this would be most beneficial for after the fight is over this is why im wondering
picture this youre flying a carrier as part of a fleet that has been deployed deep into hostile space there is no place to dock and repair your fighters you just finished a large fight and most of your drones are either destroyed or badly damaged what do you do you cant just jump back home repair and return that would be a logistical nightmare even more so is the fact that a mothership supercarrier cannot dock what nowthe ops proposal makes perfect sense it can be applied into real life situations as well just use the above situation that i mention and change it into a rl one a carrier jet has engine damage are you going to bring the carrier back on what could be a 10000 mile16000km round trip to fix itim not even a carrier pilot in game and i understand the proposalsupported because the idea makes perfect sense and is common senseedit just thought about this as well your carrier is in a wormhole how are you going to maintain the damage that sleeper rats have done to your dronesfighters
make it some kind of ability that you can turn off and on also make it so it costs some amount of cap or resource and i would support it

make it so
the triage changes are coming into effect but why not ill say yes
i would also like to see cap booster charges smaller than 800 get a bonus to cap booster cycle time ie cap 400s get 50 bonus 200s 75 ect this would keep the cap per second boost the same but allow you to recieve the cap in smaller peices spread out over time instead of one large boostalso i would have prefered to halve energy neut ammount to bring them in line with nos instead of boosting the nos
original and well though stuff
wait what the active tank changes i can see the reasoning for and think i like but whats this business with nosses i really dont follow your logic there also reload times are locked and i dont think can be changed without an inordinate amount of work on ccps part change the cycle times if you want them made better or the overheat bonuses not the reload times while i do like your idea on how to make active tanking relevant the rest of this proposal looks like a hash to me is there some logic here im missing or what also lol adam ridgway

prescriptive game play is bad ccp greyscale says soalso try a nightmare with tachyeons or any amarr ship with tachs and report back to me about how awesome acs or even artillery are for missions quite simply there is no excuse for limiting the vargur to autocannons
corp mate flies an 800mm ac vargur in missions with me barrage for long range targets and emp for things that manage to get close pretty nice ship i have to sayi currently train for a mega pulse apoc but it will take a few more weeks 
say for him try it in pvp dac and matar bss sux now you just can using them in pve or you will die fastneed projectile and ship changes for them
excellent work by pattern as usual not that interested in changing the phoon but the rest of the stuff is solid gold get these goodies in
nobody uses marauders for pvp because the faction ships do that just fine and will do it even better after dominion
supported
imo will not do much ac will still be gimped as the graph is comparing ships with kinda different configurationseg the tempest in you graph has double dmg bonus on 6 turrets  2 siege  3 dmg mods and is still lower than a 7 turret mega with 2 dmg mods add a 3rd dmg mod and the curve will be alredy bad same if you add a tracking enhancer not to say the mega will track 375 better than the pestthe comparsion and balance between various weapons should be done keeping in account the weapon stats then you apply it to various ships with similar fittingsyou are building ac and the ship togather to get a certain curve maybe you can balance it out but what about all the other minnie ships that have not 2 dmg bonuses or 4 low slot to spare to put in dmg modssame goes for arty that doesnt just need some range or tracking it need huge dps boost try to compare a naked rail with a naked arty the graph is extreeeemely interesting and really show how messed up that weapon is
turret per turret the results look bad as they should  as i explained this is to prevent acs being from defacto turret of choicealso remember that the void ammo featured in that example is the boosted 7 damage onehowever this isnt just a tempest fix or a acs boost combine everything the new target painter bonus additional ac optimal range the tempests increased speed its new slot layout the improvements to 1200mm1400mm tracking along with the 1650m and the synergistic way they fit together and i think you have something that provides a refreshalso its a fairer comparison to compare shield tankers with 1 damage mod because fitting damage mods on shield tankers has a lot lower impact on overall none snipe performanceim looking at the raw stats only for a sanity check most of the work relates to what role the ship accomplishes as far as im concerned the only minmatar ship left out of the charts was the typhoon and most consider its performance pretty decentplease reread the section on artillery
the weapons look bad because are not balancedthe problem of people using ac is just for few ships that have not proper dmg bonus for the racial weapons and so use proj but this is kinda a special situation for ships whitout a racial dmg bonus on turrets and imo is not something bad by itself a mega pilot maybe will use proj rather than hybrid if ac had better dps maybe yes but is going to lose a base 25 of his dmg so there is still a trade offif we dont want to allow ships of different races to use weapons from other ones the simplest solution will be to restrict them to such weapons that is also kinda logical and in this way we have not create gimp weapons for the fear of other races using themnow about the ac graph as said the fitting are extremely different in the first graph the mega pilot have 2 slot advantage over the pest one and on top of that 375 better tracking tracking what is the tradeoff for thatrange 1 tc and range will be quite similar and he will have even better tracking and 2 more slots advantage thats not balanced at all the curve as it is looks ok but doesnt take in account other factors like tracking or mod used cap and so onand note that is true that neuts use cap but also minnie ships need to load lot of ammos expecially if in a situation like the graph one with a pest using torpsproj and have quite gimped cargo bay so they use less cap but also can carry less cap chargesfor the second graph is kinda similar the mega with rail do same dmg as the pest again double bonus vs 1 bonus 6 turrets vs 7 but the mega have waay more range and tracking due to its second bonus so even if the dmg is similar the hybrid weapon have some great advantages over the projand we should consider too the base range of minnie sensors is another story but imo have to be considered to assign a range to artiesif anything imo the balance should be made so that slotwise the things should be balanced ok i need 1 more dmg mod so that 1 of my gun do same dmg as 1 of yours but then you will need 1 more tracking mod to be able to track as weel as mine and so onif you get such an huge disparity of mods used you will not achieve a good balance as said you can get a graph that look good for some particular ship and with some particular fittings but that is kinda a subjective graph if someone doesnt fit the weaponsmod you envisioned here that the balance go offbtw i liked some of the things in your post the big gun phoon with 5 and so on but imo to touch proj should be something to do on its own not to fit a certain shipfirst get the weapons balanced then apply them to the ship and sdjust to rebalance them
firstly large acs just gained 250 more optimal rangethat separates them from the point blank higher dps blasters and puts them in its own clear damage bracketsecondlyraw dps isnt everything there are so many factors to consider that simply pointing at neutron blaster throns and saying he has more damage than be doesnt really get anyone anywhere you build a model describe roles and niches for your weapon systems and ships as so that you avoid conflicting issues simply giving acs blaster damage would only result in gallente pilots wanting capless guns in the next seasonthirdlythe tempest under these changes is no longer the fleet sniper of choice that goes to the maelstrom yellow however with the bonused target painter and the improvements to 1200mm and 1400mm tracking the tempest becomes considerably better purple at antisupport than it once was green at the same time proving a tracking bonus to all ships engaging its targetfourthlyyou talk about comparing gun for gun then you throw in the megas ship tracking bonus whilst leaving out the hyperion for example all i can say is that this has been a pretty long process with alot more considered than just this final outcome
err  maybe look at the videos of darknesss and bulldogroheimbulldogroheim even uses a vargurnice try though
wait im not just speaking about dmg cept for arty that need lot of it p im speaking about all the stats is why i bring up the problem about tracking about mods used and so ondmg is a component but not the only one my point is that there should be a tradeoff if a weapon do so much dmg that another to catch it need 1 bonus1mod then there should be something tracking range both who knows p so that the other weapon need 1 bonus  1 mod to compete with that one in these departementsthis is not happening in the first graph and is why i spoke about the tracking bonus of mega and the slot used and if it was the hype nothing had changed as it had still a free bonus over the pestimo is risky to compare the dps graphs of various ships to balance out the weapons as actually we are not comparing 2 weapons systems but 2 different ships with an envisioned fitting of course it is usefull for the overall balance but before that the main weapon balance should be dome mostly comparing just the weapons and their performancesas said i think you did a good job some ideas are nice and about the ships i mostly agree with everything but for proj i think the balance should focus on the weapon only and the kind of result you want to get the ships come after that
supported well done defining a core concept for the tempest pattern all the changes provide a distinct roleset of capabilities for all three minmatar bs and large projectiles as well perhaps reduce voids tracking penalty a bit as well or just remove it the cap use it causes is quite a penalty in and of itself
supported
aye my summary of changest2 ammo  still wouldnt use hail for example void which is boosted in this proposal has less penalties optimal is 075x whilst hail is 05x with the new optimal for acs a change to the optimal penalty would go a long way in changing my mindvargur  yes i have no idea why only the vargur was given nerfed pg due to dont want it being a pvp ship with nosneuts in misc highs yet all the other races can fit themtyphoon  yes yes yes give it the flexibility it should have being minmatar plus you get a bit more benifit from damage mods if you fit 5 of a weapon rather than 4fleet issue typhoon  might actually be worth the isk unlike the current design of ccps which has really poor upgrade compared to the other racestempest  actually a reason to fly it now long gone are the flexible role days when there was only 8 battleships and no rigs to further specialize for a rolefleet tempest  yeah although id consider a 8th mid hard to say without testing the proposed tempest firstmaelstrom  improvements dont really help appart from arty fits for new 1650s so no problem with itlarge acs  god knows they need something and this will do hit quality reduction just screw acs due to minmatar fight in falloff stuffarty  yes long gone are the days of insta popping stuff with 6 gyro arty pests in prepreboost hp level days that were the reason for giving them lowest range and tracking
summary added
void is not a minmatar ammo furthermore hail is always the wrong choice unless youre shooting a stationary dread at 1km your changes dont really fix that and nor do they fix emp and other problem areasit already got a role bonus the right answer here is to lower arty fittings or boost vargur fittingsagreed because it helps take the edge off of wtfskills requiredi agree with the extra mid i dont agree with the extra launchera 70km target painter is useless i would rather strongly not want to waste a bonus on that and yes it is a waste by making it suck because you dont fix the guns and now waste a bonus to help everyone else in fleet yay i always wanted to waste my tier 2 bs on having a ew bs fly a zealot 4srsly this is not a battleship rolei dont think this would make the ship worthwhile to use when there are so many better ships out there and about to be out there its a decent attempt and better than what we have i think but doesnt fix any of the core problems with itnice you manage to completely miss what makes the maelstrom frustrating to use a lack of agility i realize youre trying to redefine the role but noracial flavor we didnt need that anyway blasters we didnt need those either artillery will still be far and away the worst long range platform even with the new tracking and 60km target paintersthe maelstrom is already the main minmatar sniper its that much better than the pesttldr your changes dont address the core issues that must be addressed they further remove the race from what brought me to it in the first place i would sell my minmatar pilot and buy another amarr pilot if these changes went live your changes dont affect eve that strongly and they dont address active tanking
i had a nice read over the changes and i was about to reply when i saw liang already did it for me pretty much represents my opinions with one reservation id rather the phoon get increased fittings than a 55 split  but thats just imo
completely agree with patterns suggestions please make it so
changes to large projectiles are long overdue i believe patterns proposals are well balanced and retain minmatar racial flavorspare dronebay capacity is something many minmatar drone ships need recons pestmael cyc cs but not hacs or cane additionally all minmatar ships also need an ammo bay though the need is direst for bslatest sisi navy typhoon 848 is preferable to patterns bring back the 55 hardpoints however pleasethe tempest definitely requires a fix but i am on the fence whether this is it pattern has also left out the panther i think both suffer from a lack of options for the minmatar utility high slots panther especially since it has no launcher hardpoints it would be a good minmatar boost to bring some ew capabilities to our utility highslots whether ew strength mods paint web or reduced efficacy ew mods tackle paint
although i do not fully support all these changes would love to see a viable armortanking sniper but i guess i cant boost to minmatar  bc and the tempest in particular are long overdue placing acs optimal around disruptor range is a nice touch and 1650mm arties on a mael would make alpha strike viable again
50 bonus to target painter optimal range per level no ty gtfoand basicly you made the pest into a shield tanker which carnt shield tank
marn prestoc like i said in the shc thread the changes to ammo are just a band aid t2 ammo in for serious design reviewliang nuren who said void was mminmatar  this is a damage increase to blasters change artillery so that the vargur can fit 12
agree

where can i sign
i am bringing this back up to the front of the line again especially since the proposed changes to the navy tempest and the new navy typhoon are not very good and in the case of the navy tempest is just unbelieveable how bad of a idea this is
much needed change
fast forward 5 yearsthe same 4 incumbents have been the same 4 incumbents for 4 years with any new firstterm members not having the votes to break their alliance backed hold on those 4 slots same 4 members from same 4 alliances every year as a standard getting more and more entrenched and suffering from greater and greater depths of hubrissomeone new comes along and tries to shake it up ccp pulls the plug on them everyone screamslong terms in office are just as poisonous for organisations as they are for the egos of the people involvedafter 810 years in rl office people start to think they might be caesar
personally id prefer a simpler system if after your 2 term limit you cant serve consecutive terms ie serve 2 next invalid serve 1 invalid and so on as for issler i was under the impression that this term didnt count towards the term limit
the alternative is that its filled with csm elites who rubbish the csm noobs stalling the process and blocking ideas that dont come from the entrenched membersfreshness and enthusiasm is much more desirable then creating a group of people who are essentially in for life
yeah that would be simpler but the rule in the op would guarantee a constant supply of csm 1 or 2 term newbieswho will be in the majority guaranteed 5 members minimumi talked to issler a while ago just when it was happening and that was what i thought the situation was if there was some official response later on i missed it if the point is moot then i can remove that tooalso battlesmith is in la la landedit if the majority of the csm likes my idea or ombers idea more whichever one i will put in the wiki page to get voted on
this is exactly how it starts man this is how dictators get into power first they start by abolishing presidential term limits i see what you did there  im on to you senator palpatine
nope not a chancecsm has demonstrated well enough that it is entirely useless and should simply be scrapped
very much not supported the csms not a reward for getting a lot of people to vote for you and other people with fresh ideas need to be rotated through
linux time schedulers are a cool thing that can be applied csm terms for exampleno more than 5 incubents2 former 2 cms season membersno more than 4 incubents3 former 3 cms season membersno more than 3 incubents4 former 4 cms season membersno more than 2 incubents5 former 5 cms season membersno more than 1 incubents6 former 6 cms season membersor something elsei do not support the solution described in the first post but i support the core idea a good solution will probably emerge after discussing this with ccpsomething must be done with issler being disqualified its just not fair
not supported all elected offices should have painfully low term limits
hmm keep the term limits but dont make them permanent serve 2 terms and be unable to serve again until 2 more terms have passed just make it so the time in officetime out of office after you hit your term limit
we have a constant stream of new people wanting to get in to csm and the old corrupt officials need to be booted out to make room for the newcomers if at some point we cant find enough new people who are interested in the job we can scrap the whole thing as people have clearly moved on
this is the part where i say not just no but hell nolets face itemove term limits then the largest alliances will always be garunteed a seat not based on the merit of their candidates but based on the number of members in their alliance thats rubbish to be quite frank and its a crappy ideaat that point you dont have to care about the larger player base only about keeping your alliance members happy so theyll vote for you en masse next electionso thank you but no thank you
agreeing with this spend the money on better servers or something so we can have the directional scanner back
what do you honestly think the odds are of the csm voting to disband itself
hellno
fail for thinking one csm proposal not being implemented yet meaning that it is entirely useless no matter the support ccp has final say and have they even been able to bring this up to ccpi think a max of 2 overtermed incumbents should be allowed to stay provided that there no incumbents currently in their first term that are running for their second
1 this is a silly restriction that makes less sense than the current one by far youll be disenfranchising thousands of voters with this and buggering up the elections totally no 2 arbitrary exclusion of viewpoints ccp doesnt likeisnt this what the csm was originally intended to prevent hell no 3 yup fully agree with this bit 3 is reasonable but theres no way i can support this as a whole
do you honeslty think that if ccp decides to disband the csm theyre going to bother asking what the csm thinks about it appearances aside this is still a dictatorship ruled by ccp which is as it should be being as its their sandbox
we know the evil in the detailswe just need to find the best solutionwould be 2 slot for one or other solutionsjust talk a littlebit what is the best
i agree with this idea
its a needed change station camping moros are stupid and another example of why the eve player base cant have nice things
its a idiotism the redock time need change after aggressing at station want to figt  do it but if u got criminal flag u cant docksimple but this bllsht ruined and nerfed an another shiptypes because ccp made it an unlogic 4560 docktime after agression when the station sentrys shoting the target lol who invite a criminal inside his house who shot outsidenobody but ccp leaves it problem is the redock time not the moroswe want more fight not to lurk make the play better just regulate properly the timers and cloakersproblem with the huggers you told but just they will make moros nerf  why  just an moros can do station huggin  no can do 50 other ships too just one or two ship need for that a support ship and a damage userso dont nerf the moros use brain and solve the original problem which create this
fyi the moros nerf never made it to sisi while all other changes have happened moros needs to be left unchanged
greetingsi raise this issue as i consider an important factor in faction warfare as it stands now npcs inside a warfare complex do not fire on person who has too good standings towards respective factionwhat this means in practice is that pirates or hostile militia can enter warfare complexes and in worst case npcs stand idly aside now this might have some roleplaying perspective about navy ships being afraid of capsuleers but i dont buy it npc pirates quite happily suicide their frigates against capsuleer battleshipseven more worrisome is the attitude of certain people namely excsm member ankh who are happy to continue using this bug and saying it works as intended to capture complexes without actually doing any actual work for it such as killing the npcs defending itthis has been a problem since start of faction war surely it would not be so hard to correct code that npcs inside would automatically shoot everyone who is not a member of friendly miltiadamar rocarionbrigadier general
the only reason id disagree is because it sounds like people are wanting this to get easy kills hell if ccp decides to do this i want my orca back to the way it was i dont need an ore bay
going to keep it short notoo much advantage for the enemy too little for the defender covert ops cloak ships will be ftom forever that about sums it up
ccp want more people in 00 not less and theres precious little reason to leave the level 4 highsec hubs as it is without completely eliminating 00 pve as a viable optionno
remove local and replace with constellationsigned
how about this in low sec they show a number at the top for how many people are thereand replace individuals with corp logos and tickers so you can see how many people are afoot and what corporations they may be fromand in oo change it so you can just see corp logos and tickers but no numbers at the top this would let you know wheather or not the system was empty also would let you know if your wts are hiding there but not which ones or how manyin wh space keep it like it isblank unless you talk in itand last but not least in high secgroup all members from the same corp together under their corp logo and tickers so with numbers at the top and listed on the ticker for each corp so when u left click it opens the corp and u see all the wts i mean people from that corp grouped together and when you r click it gives you the corp info this would clean up high sec local and make scanning local easier in say high traffic areas and on top of that it would be much better public exposure for corporationscomments
oh yeah also with this idea of mine when people talk in local the talkers char name would still show up in the chatbox same as it does now just the listing on the right hand side would be affected by this changewe wouldnt want to make life hard on spammers and we dont want to ruin the actuall friendly interaction of people just trying to have friendly conversations either  i think this idea would help everyone even the miners with or withought the scanner nerf its ussually somone with probes that you really need to worry about as for miners they will just rush the belts anywayso alltogether cloakers get a bonus miners get to keep their run for the hillz local and fleets will know if their wts are present its local streamlined comments
not supported sizing the rigs where the most sensable change ccp have made in agesnow do the same with all 1 sized modulesand people stop ing because you lost some isk on a balance that was clearly needed
you do realize recon 1 of 3 deals insanely high dps righthowever you do have a point level 4 missions might still need a 4 hour delay i would not be opposed to doubling the time cooldowns but the point stands that the cooldown for lower level missions should not be as high as higher level missions
when did that change last time i checked you didnt need to take any significant damage engaging the rats is optional
this seems fairly reasonable i think nobody is worried about people farming l1s and it helps new players while keeping the status quo on the relevant ones
makes sence to me
as long as the navy harbinger doesnt have that ugly greenish hue like the apoc
i want navy freighters
the navy apoc just got nice darkish platings see sisi
first apologies if this has been raised beforeas it stands now getting banned on sisi for violating the rules has effectively no serious repercussions however whatever actions resulted in the ban are usually a significant inconvenience to the other players affected eg voogru et al i believe that interfering with people attempting to help improve the game for the benefit of the broader community should be more heavily penalized i would like to see a ban on sisi be automatically accompanied by a corresponding temporary whatever period is deemed reasonable  2 weeks 1 month ban on tq
it was my understanding that any misstep on sisi results in an immediate permaban from sisi a little too harsh to apply that to tranquility as well in my opinionin fact if your motive is for the game to be improved through testing i think the very threat of this possibility would be enough to make many potential testers not even set foot in sisi for fear of getting their tranquility account banned i know i wouldnt and im a respectful pilot that i dont think would ever get banned from sisi
this seems incredibly draconian id favour better enforcement of rules on sisi but tq punishments for sisi violations is far too harsh
the cancer has hit sisi so badly so many people who simply havent read the rules are getting on there who then break the rules bh then issue threats in a fast moving local channel to stop most people arent even watching local half the timerules broken sure banned from sisi sure add on top of this its fairly easy to get people banned ill just leave it at thatsisi is meant to be a server people can go test on this leads to bug fixing if you ban people from sisi then there are less people to fix bugs the caveat youre banning gomers who only impede testing for example gomers who sit at the pf gate and kill peoplethe balance is questionable hereif you add in the factor of draconian banning rolling over onto tq that would mean not only a drastic reduction of people on sisi as i certainly wouldnt be going on there it would also means a drastic number of paying customers who may or may not be contributing to make eve better are now going to leave the game entirelythat isnt good business for eve
itd be like doing exactly the same thing with armor except with lower resists and vastly worse rr anyone who did that would deserve the horrible death that came to them
above poster is rightthe idea is good and i thought about it too 
do we really need to make it harder to scout for gatecamps
if you see one of these ships around a gate you know hell have upto 3 ships cloaked with him so you know if a gate is camped if you see this ship with the previously mentioned anchorable bubble idea there could be any number of ships under there that seems overpowered
how about this anchorable by covert ops only 4 convienient sizes sml med lrg xlrgbased on ship size detectable by getting within 99km reactivation penalties and can locate with high lvl scanner and probing skills to within 150kms warpable and comes in hand with new probes and drones used for the purpose of scanning it to 150 and then sniffing it out xlarge can hide a small pos for predetermined time could cloak missions and sites dont forget it is trackable with good skills and the right probesdrones command modules will work in cloaked sitesmissions etc but not for ships hiding just inside the bubble itself anchorable in all secs making it usefull for all kinds of thingscomments
now heres possibbly the scariest cloaking idea in eve 3 indestructable modules from an ancient extinct alien race more pwerful than anything ever seen before found in wh space for some reason it cannot be stored in any npc station cant even dock with it on your ship but seems to fit just fine in pos and any other destroyable object cant be sold or traded only jettisoned or left from the wreckage of the previous owner and whats worse it has a mind of its own if it stays dormant for too long it returns to wh space and has to be found and fought for all over again what is its adzact ability1 can fit on any ship with a high slot2 ship fitted with the device can target while cloaked and recloak imeadiatly after firing can re cloak when targeted as long as its not disrupted webed or scramed nosd nueted receiving any kind of remote assistance etc and can operate any nonweapon while remaining cloaked3 host ship recieves bonuses acrross the full spectrum of command module bonuses camparable to the leadership command modules being trained to lvl 5 and can still recieve aditional bonuses from a command ship etc 4 the best or worst part via the r click menue can cloak any targeted ships while remaining cloaked itselfcausing them to be remain cloaked until they target or activate any modules meaning they can bump into things and remain cloaked also meaning an entire fleet could be cloaked no matter the size or nuber of ships including pos even when the target is under attack5 mining vessels cloaked by the host ship can target and use all modules while cloaked 6 ships cloaked by this module recieve speed bonuss comparable to covert ops lvl 5lets face it thats what we really want now what reason do i have to think this would be an acceptable demon to release on the world of eve beacuse according to history somthing this dangerous was released on the real world once and any army holding it was considered invincible the ark thats why i am proposing 3 or possibly less of them to be in existence not only will it give the possibility of a fleet just decimating everything but since eve is a real world market it would be pricless and we all know the back stabbing that would come with it could possibly rip alliances to peieces from the inside out any pilot can use it and its possibilities are endlesswhat would this eve abomination be called how about arc alien reconissance cloakand heres how the discription could readlolgaurded by the fiery sword of heaven the gate is impassable to the wicked only the pure of heart my pass the golden box awaits the lions return resting under the watchfull eyes of the angels only the holy shall remain to ask and recieve the truthlets say its in a dead end wh but to get to it you have to pass through a class 6 or say 7 which is nothing but one big site and then at the end of that you have to go in your pod and jump through or the gaurdians will destroy you with their tech x sword and then u must face the oracle and if you dont answer the silly questions right your pod jumps back to high sec withought the answere but if you do answer right she allowes you to board a nice t3 cruiser of your race and enlightens you as you board by maxing out all of your skills just for fun this enlightenment would only happen for the person that found the device in the site not anyone that obtains the devise afterwords they would just get a bonus to learning skills while they we in possession of the object aka it was in their assetsbefore i say comments i will let you know i know this is redicoulous i just think it would be funny to see the look on ccps faces when they read it lolcomments
if you feel the new dooms day mechanic itself 1 shot killing most other ships is way out of balance and will lead to a total imbalance in the game support here
if you feel like im down should read the dev blogs on how doomsdays are going to be completely removed as an aoe weapon in the next expansion post hereseriously now that that ccp has stated its intentions to totally overhaul titans the doomsdaywhine threads can probably stop
actually i just edited to clarify it means the new dd proposal
so youd keep the old aoe dd over this new oneno get on sisi and check out how awesome it is for yourself
its a pretty terribly worded op reallythe old dd mechanic is terribly terrible but this isnt a whole huge amount better rather than blowing up 100 bs at 100m each and once every hour it can blow up caps at a rate of 12h at 15b each with absolutely zero chance of friendlies getting killed assuming the titan pilot is not edthere are so many better things the titan could do to influence a fight which doesnt involve direct effects such as instant damage dds and which are much less prone to exploitbynumbers a targeted dd is not the way to make the ship supremely powerful without being overpowered
thread
my proposalrequire 2 accounts to be able to train 1 character additionally make training 3 times slower than current
an unnecessary change that will end up decreasing revenue for ccpbetter to let the allow the skill queue to look at other characters so that if main queue runs out it starts on the alternates queuewill still reduce revenue but not as much i think
im going to support this simply because id really like it not because i think it has a chance in hell of happening
you do realize that eve is such a good game like it is because of the amount of money ccp makes rightno thanks im not risking my favorite pastime for something as trivial as thiseditparagraphs
right as you have to play actively in other games to level up at all the only thing that gave eve a chance for me was the skilling while being offline
and you are failing to realize that a paragraphs exist and b ccp wants to lose the accounts of people who are put off by the skill training but does not want to lose the accounts of people who actually like the gameccp are coding a game that they like and we like they dont want to make it wow if their players would rather play wow because of leveling up that is fine go play wow just dont ruin our game
paragraph listen lets be honest here with ourselves two characters training at the same time on an account will not ruin this game nor will a 50100 bonus while playing the game ruin it even with a 100 bonus it may seem a lot but it isnt really of course there will be people who will try to sit idle at a station all day while they recieve bonus but that could be worked around yes people will go into space and cloak and hide all day but that could be worked around as well oh yeah paragraphyour end of days talk is really just fear of change however you fail to realize that when you started playing the game you were told that the game would change i dont care if you even played this game for five years your sense of entitlement to anything just because you played for a long time means jack st it still doesnt provide a good reason for this game to not improve upon it self many people that i have talked to who play this game that arent going to quit feel that the learning system is lacking lets improve on that i knew some jerk would direct me to wow i find it funny how someone who disagrees with anything in here is told to go play wow i mean sheesh if i wanted this game to be like wow id be asking for ugly neon colors to be emanating from the ships while they wield ugly flamey looking swords and it would also be cool if we could find some hot pants for the megathron to prance around in because nothing says more about your leetness than a megathron in hotpants the dominix lets just put a paper bag over it and call it good i would also like to see the falcon cast mage spells or maybe that would go well with the guardian or the scimitar nub
what about a variation on this idea say the first toon trains at normal speed 2nd toon trains at 110th speed it certainly would be nice to have a little scientist or trader as an alt
ok so its the exact same as the one ccp have made butbecause the gun send of such a big charge i propose it makes a smalllarge smartbomb kinda idea when it hits the ship targeted inflicting maybe a quarter or a half of damage to sarrounding shipsits not perfect but would be better than the hit one target untill gun cycles p
because one shotting capitals isnt enough it needs to be aoe again riteno shut up
you know they have actual usable weapons on titans now right no need for hitting multiple targets this way i think
signed
no
thank you for you well thoughtout constructive counter statement as to how this idea would not work i look forward to your further responses
you seriously dont see how insanely overpowered this would be
i can see that it would change pvp combat a lot but if i look at how people can adapt to counter this ship its not that hard you fly with a destroyer escort and this ship is toast i mean frigate hull has to get really close to hijjack its quite counterable people will change their tactics to accomodate this ship also note that if you bring a wing of these than those pilots arent flying dpsboats instead so you sacrifice something in the end players adapt and it ballances itself out or atleast thats the goal if it doesnt meet that goal how would you change the design so it does
just a thoughtyou would need to apply the current bumping mechanics mass behavior esp to your idea it would take your hijacker frigate ages to pull anything larger than another frigate up to the speed for warp warp mechanics have to apply aswell of courseso you have a frigate size engine that tries to accelerate a cruiserbscapship size mass to its own warp speed lets say 250ms which is a reasonable frigate base speed given it should work as kind of a tackler and has to move itself quickly through the fieldwith all those problems i dont see a role for it you want to eliminate ships from the field shoot them makes them gone for much much longer
well looking at it that way the ship has more applications a few of these could tug a larger friendly ship outside of a warpbubble for instance or if the pulling force isnt enough to pull a ship into warp itll still move it a fair bit for instance back out of blasterrange think of bumping a ship to prevent it from docking but more effective
this would make a perfect lol shipi can see all the people raging as their ships are pulled away from what they are doing i could see this mechanic abused to oblivion just for the lols i can see ccp facepalming thinking what have we done as the forums fill up with yet another bunch of whiners and the griefers trolling themnot to mention the new vids popping up with benny hill musicsee where im goingnot supported while it is a freaking hilarious idea it doesnt make sense in the battlefield if you want to move a ship bump it
i feel like pvp is fine as it is your ship would be just a ridiculous complication that would  people off
if you are a fan of the new sisi 1 shot kill weapon and potential it gives titans heres your chance to show support
back upim still looking for a proposal or an issue in your op
simply no no more bonus of any kind to pvpers which weakens pveers even more
not supported me podding you must hurt you if you dont lose anything all my fun is lost  no tears from you no satisfaction for me   i quit eve i have wow around the corner
explain to me how you would be able to retain the implants i mean when youre podded the corpse floats around in space looking pale and all perhaps it gets blown up in a area of effect or someone miss clicks and destroys it point is you cant have them implants teleported to youand if im not to much out and drinking i cant even remember any information pointing to that the pirate fleets officers are flying in pods
eh its a pvp centric game not wowhow do this weaken pvebut to the point i do not support this idea magical implants seem stupid
i propose that certain features be added into evemailfilteringtime stampsfoldersthis will allow people to catagorise and sort through their email in a more efficiant mannerthank youbjon
yesand outbox would be nice too
i can understand how its used for npc stations but please let directors free unused researchmanufacturing slots which have been canceled but are still in use
imho that part of the mechanic is shared between npc stations and pos labsi think we should expect some level of responsible behavior for people doing industrial worknot supported
thats really good news cant wait

the tourney is getting close to watchable for noneve players a little more spectacle in the camera work and id be able to get friends to watch more then 1 matcha battle recorder would buy millions of dollars worth of advertisingmachinima and very well cut corp adverts would proliferate across youtube at a greater rate then they currently dobeing able to postedit and toy with camera recordings would give these people the ability to create better content promoting evethere are several professional edits on youtube which are of a higher quality then what ccp produces inhouse for trainers more of these could only be goodedit of course spend time coding better evemail and allowing pop3 access first p
i agree with this interpretation of events imagine being able to record a battle without the lag that fraps causes and still having your overview basically recording without worrying about risking your ship trying to get good angles or something later you turn up your graphics quality turn off your overview slowmo portions of it get the right angles all without lagvideos would be everywhere it would be the biggest and some of the best marketing ccp could get also im no legal expert but i bet sense the footage was taken from ccps game they would technically own it no matter who did the final editing and would be able to use it for their own commercialsadvertisements maybe im wrong but lawyers could make a good argument for this and even if im still wrong the free advertising aspect makes up for itagain i try not to underestimate the extreme amount of work that goes into this game i didnt mean to imply that it would only be a couple hundred lines that they could finish in a week only that it would be less work than many other projects theyve tackled in this game walking in stations complete sov changes  dust creating wormhole space yes i agree that there are more important things that need to be done first pos redesign comes to mind but i dont think that those things should mean that this idea gets tossed out it would be better to say this is a great idea but it wont be accomplished until after x y and z are just because an idea is great doesnt mean it should or has to be the very next thing implemented but it also doesnt mean it has to be tossed out or perhaps never if thats what ccp decided in the end to get that answer though i think it need to be brought up in an official capacityedit for formatting
didnt get much attention would still love this
this idea was within a portion of my consolidated account security proposal and already brought to iceland and discussed with ccpi dont remember the exact response they gave though on this particular point i think they were interested but youll see their whole responce when the meeting minutes are released
i have one of those the physical version is a vasco digipass go6 rebranded with the blizzard logo it uses des 3des or aes to generate a onetime pass code that is valid for something like 30 seconds to 1 minute the pass codes expire after being used and include an internal clock as part of the hash input it also apparently uses either the serial number or another input linked to it as a unique perkeyfob identifier theres also a cellphone app version last i heard the iphone version was the only one released in the usthe physical fobs use a 6 digit numeric code and the phone app ones use an 8 digit numeric codeit requires the additional code to log into anything including account management and after i ed at them about how easy it was to remove they made it require an additional two codes to unlink it from the account once youre logged in to managementif you lose it you have to call up and get the third degree to get it removed if it just stops working it might be easier as youd have the serial number
well you see its difficult to give feedback on an idea if i cant read the damn thing if you are on a computer than writing in standard english isnt all too hard now if you are texting people on a mobile then fine
blame your teachersbut i think you are just lazyplease quit eve and life
get this moved to the assembly hall also read the assembly hall sticky if you are confused
isnt huzzahs alliance logo a weed leaf
yep google dope leaf go to google images the first damn image that comes up is the one they used to form the logo
and by soon they mean  they saw a continent drifting and asked it where the fire was
this was brought up with ccp and the issue is being addressed 
thank you dierdra and ccp
supported questionwhy do they call these carriers and motherships at all they arent they do not fulfill that role in any sence of the word instead lets call themt2 frieghters i jumped a carrier on sissy with a smart bomb rokh and decimated his first wave in moments he nueted me but i learned about the nuet from the try before and had cap booster 800s when i was done it was a freighter pathetic i say lets talk them into making more realistic carriers and motherships counter proposal carriers are floating cities they should be fully capable of repairing anything that can fit inside them they should have 4 bays drone fighter if you really want to call automated drones with no ai fighters frigate bay capable of holding up to 20 active piloted frigates or a mix of frigs and destroyers repair bay capable of repairing ships up to destroyer class and capable of slowley building drones up to destroyer class as long as ther are all the proper materialsbpcs available in the cargo bay and usable by fleeted ships as a fitting bay cargo bay big enough to hold materials for building formentioned items and repairing themlets face it that is what a carrier should be when a frigate pilot say in a bomber decides to dock to it he would do it the same way he would dock to a station then he would just get a orbit cam of the carrier and a undock button would show up in the lower left hand side of his screen or if its not to much to ask they could even make a carrier docking bay screen for when u dock it would look like a station only heavilly condenced pilots could enter the fitting tool there and get in line at the repair bay is that overpowered good thats the whole freaking idea behind a carrier as for motherships same general idea bigger capacities but able to build and store 1 built ship in multiple bays exept frigates and fighters which would automatically move from the build que to their respective launch bays anything destroyer size and above would have to undock before another could be produced they should be able to build anything up to a hyerion and would probably need an aditional bay to store at least 2 hulks so they could continue their mission even if they are lost deep in wh space because a mother ship is suposed to be a capabillity not liabillityand maybe instead of nerfing good ships try making the ones that stink better they could start with the cormorantcomments
also wanting to add to this that hull damage is one of the most annoying things to your drones especially as there are no hull maintenance bots and fitting a capital hull repair system is a waste of a high slot as you will rarely use it over per example shieldarmor remote reps drone control units smartbombs etc
good idea i support it
brilliantsupported
bringing this up for the next csm meeting
it is ironic that the second class of ships a noob will encounter using standard size progression cannot be fit with hisher skills it takes solid support skills to make the thrasher work at all and maxedskills to make it shine of the catalyst coercer and cormorant no amount of skills seems to enable them to perform adequatelydestroyers badly need a rebalance ship bonus powergrid sig radius and cpu at minimum fun fact i actually had to look up the name of the amarr destroyer ive not actually seen one in use in years and had forgotten it
possibilities to fix destroyersas i see it now destroyers are papertanked drone killers that dont even fulfill that role effectivly because if the enemy fleet has one missile module between them your gone no matter how good your range is destroyers suposedly were intended to massaacre frigates but my kesteral will walk right through a well tanked destroyer withought letting off the ab and fly through the explosion so how about thisproposalglass cannons aproach make it so they can all fire effectivly from 030km range no fall off and better tracking than any other smaller ship and smallest guns no rof penalties damage increase to make it hazardous to t2 frigs and t1 cruisers if ignored and good base resists across the board to make them less brittle against frigates keep the sig rad how it is so bs battlecruisers and med drones can still dispach them easilly in short make these 4 scenarios happena a cormorant warps into the middle of 5 t1 frigates locks them and blows one of them away before his disrupter and web has even activated another blows up just before entering warp another escapes leaving the pointed target to the destroyer 4 dead 1 escaped minimal damage done to the destroyer if they stay and fight they all die and the destroyer might have hull damageb a harpy attacks a cormorant althought the cormorant recieves significant damage it wins with 30 of its hull still intactc five cormorants jump a cruiser although they are doing amazing damage at first the cruiser manages to tank them for the whole minute it takes for it to blow them all away with its heavier firepower the cruiser heads to the repair bay with 15 of its hull still intact the pilot just glad he didnt take a bio break now opts for a change of underwear and a smoked 2 oposing fleets of say 10 to 12 collide durring the battle a destroyer slips in unoticed at first and begins tearing through a moas shields by the time the moa realizes it being killed by a destroyer and not the harbinger which is only hitting him with one gun for distraction while focusing most of its firepower on a primaried drake it is too late he cant target him fast enough and hit him hard enough before his hull is ripped to shreds the primaried drake however did fianally notice and after he pulled all his highs of the harbinger fired a volly that reached the cormorant just as the moa popd blowing whats left of the destroyer to bits and whats worse 2 more destroyers just came in and are wiping your fleets drones out in short order as soon as they start geting targeted they switch to attack your frigates and whipe out 3 before they are finally silenced unfourtunatly you loose the battle due to the loss of dps this would make roaming gangs of destroyers possible and even dangerous with the attachment of falcons it would make them able to decimate drones and t1 frigates hold their own against 1v1s with t2 frigates and make them valuable in a fleet and possibly even earn them the honor of being primary not because they are weak but because if you dont exploit that weakness you will regret itcomments
hopefully ccp will tell us a bit more about dust at fanfest i too love pc based shooters and dont own a console and since dust is being developed with the unreal engine a pc version shouldnt be technically difficultunfortunately i fear this topic falls outside the scope of the csm since it is more about the business side of ccp rather than the game and technically isnt even about eve but about a different game alltogether
1 i have made a thread to gather all ideas for sound improvements this thread is not there to collect bug reportssound faults
out of curiosity how do you pinpoint a ship by spamclicking the scanner since youre warping and spamclicking im assuming you werent using the 5degree angle scan since you wont have any directional or distance info all you know is that ship x is withing scanrage y of my current position which doesnt give you nearly enough information to engage a targeti may be missing something here but i am pretty sure youre missing a few steps between spamscan system and kill target yes scanning probes take a little time to set up but you can cover an entire solar system with them once they are set up and warp to targets immediately instead of having to figure out what exact location they are at not to mention the directional scanner is useless against safespots
you are indeed missing things some call it spaming i call it fast scanningscouts with the knowhow about quick scanning are valuable and belive me it isnt just simple spamming of the scan buttonyou are also wrong about not being able to pinpoint target while warping and scanning i did it all the time even while warping and using 5 degree scan scanning celestial objectsknowing if target moved within parts of second is vital sometimesanyone suggesting probes can replace good inital scouting of a system need a reality checkthe explanation that this change was neccessary to reduce lag from clicking scan button is ridicolous everything we do in this game causes lag will ccp introduce timer on every button there is in game  there are things used way more then scanner they too cause lag improved graphic causes lag every action in game causes lag but we can live with certain amount of it and we can definitly live with lag that is caused by scannerif ccp wants to reduce lag they should be looking at other sources to minimize it
entering a system while hunting requires multiple quick scans the faster you are at this the better your chances for catching preyavoiding troublein addition when engaging solo in a crowded place like amamake ive generally got my range set to two million kilometers and spamming scan during the fight this is my only warning if others are warping in and my only chance of avoiding blobsperhaps ive missed something please explain how scanning probes can be utilized by a true solo single account rifter seeking targets in amamakei understand ccps need for the change ive seen the graph depicting the beforeafter server load but the current fix makes combat more difficult and solo combat much more difficultperhaps if ccp refuses to budge on this it would be advantageous to develop a new scanner mechanic which cannot be so easily abused yet is able to get important information to the player
i would like to join one of these csm probing tutorials too lolno question about pickin a crashed carrier in hughe blob fights or lowsex thingysthis leads me to following questions50 celestial objects in incoming scangrid letz call it beltz all beltz are seeded around 360 and one vessel in your directional scanner1 how long is shortest possible timer with directional scanner and how highor low is it with probing2 how high is the chance in total to get a tackle with these new featuresplease note you dont have to calculate ctrlq and emergency warp casesthats math for a ya i think 10 year old kid and no you dont can do crosses heredo not forget you have directional scanner delay from 2000 msnexttime we do it with aligntimer warprange including acceleration and dropping out scanres distance from vessel a and vessel b in scangrid from victim vessel b excluding lag rollbacks and other sexeh features
come on you know you want it let your voice be heard and support this thread
i think youve just highlighted the two most annoying things about drones
if the infrastructure hub is indeed a modular type stationthingy then yes this is what we are looking however i personally would like to see ccp do a phased conversion of poss as well and specifically say in info that they do not affect sov i am also waiting for ccp to post on dominion page as well as put out more dev blogs would also love to see a dev have an ingame or otherwise conversation with this group as after reading the minutes admittedly linked ones were from a while ago it seems like ccp is going with a preference for small incremental adjustments i would have no problem with that if we had an idea far in advance of devcoders schedule cause while the funny movies at fanfest are great if they are taking away from dev time that is a disservice to your customers btw this is the first post ever i have made and after playing the game for near two years i can say this topic has my fullhearted support
please read this topic start carefully before replyinga bit of background on this we the csm talked to ccp about sound in eve ccp is aware of the bugs and has solved many of them already with the recent hiring of a dedicated sound engineer they are putting more emphasis on sound development for eve besides the many problems sound in eve currently has which you should petition eve doesnt really use sound much in a functional manner that is what this thread is aboutso this thread is not about current problems with sound if you have problems with sound create a petition for itccp asked the csm if we can give them more ideas for functional sounds in eve  which are sorely lacking at the moment ofcourse this will not be the only source of ideas for ccp but they are very interest in what sort of functional sounds are desired by the player base this thread is here for you to post ideas for better use of sound in eve while i personally think a lot can be improved for functional sounds if you have nonfunctional sound ideas you may post them here too again this thread is not here for current sound bugsproblems it is here for new ideas on how to better utilize sound in eveexamples of nonfunctional sounds often just used to enhance immersionwarping soundatmospheric noisesgunexplosion soundsexamples of functional soundsthe docking request accepted soundbeing targeted sound
suggestion notification sound beep or similar when receiving a fleet broadcastreceiving a fleet broadcast currently means only a tiny part of an often cluttered user interface lights up and flashes for a second this makes it very easy to miss a specific unique sound when receiving a fleet broadcast will make it much easier for pilots to recognize when they receive a broadcastsuggestion warning notification sound when overheated modules are about to breakbeing able to hear when you should toggle overheating off instead of having to watch tiny bars would be a nice improvement this would have to give a warning before the next cycle burns the module out so you can deactivate in timesuggestion warning notification when shield armor or cap goes below a certain care should be taken that this doesnt create sound spam when being remote repped and the talk hovers around the threshhold percentage also could be applied to hull however since hull tanks are made of fail there usually isnt much you can do at that point anyway
warning sound when a warp scrambler  disruptor is activated on your shipdistinct warning sounds for other types of ew being activated on your shipcontinuous warning sound while modules are overheated with an indication of the danger level to the damaged modules eg sound changing in pitch as modules receive damagewarning sound when capacitor level drops below 28warning sound when a module deactivates without pilot order eg due to not enough cap or mwd deactivating when scrambled or mods deactivating when your ship cloaks etcwarning sound for proximity alert when your ship is cloaked and there are other ships within a predefined distance say 6 km
warning sound when you get noses or neuted tooreduce the difference in volume between the quietest and lowdest sound this is much improved from the past though with the warp sound finally quieted but turrets are still loud compared to shield transfer for examplejust about every tactically important event in eve ship combat there should be a sound for itthere should be some sort of sound notification when you are in a warp bubble like maybe some sort of not annoying low humming noise any easy way to tell when you are inside and not inside would help combat a lot
i think adding sounds for all these things is gonna clutter the game up too much i do support the idea of adding more functional sounds though just not for every single thing thats happeninginstead id welcome a customizable user interface of some sort if you look at wow yaya i know depending on your role in the group you install some plug ins and get visual notifications of varying intensity of most of the things that are going oni think graphics can go a long way here you just need better notifications than a tiny little icon on the very right of your overview or a blinking red circle around your modules which only increases in 20 steps
as for nonfunctional sounds i usually view my ship from a distance of 75km at that distance the combat sounds are practically nonexistent that seems to be a regression from the situation prior to apocrypha now with apocrypha one needs to be viewing their ship from about 5km in order to hear much of any combat related sounds i dont wish to force my preferences upon anyone else but that change harmed the audio experience at a minimum the range at which combat sounds are audible should be configurablesome might think of certain functional sounds as endearing yet there are a couple i can do without they are 1 those items are not stackable and 2 your door is ajar just kidding number two would be i cant set a waypoint for the same location twicei suggested to csm3 member meissa anunthiel that extended trial accounts be offered to the manufacturers of discrete audio cards and audio accessories not being an audiophile myself those people might have some better ideas about how eve online could be enhanced to the point that gamers actually wish to acquire rather than remove audio equipment to enhance their game experience if such manufacturers or vendors can be signed on as sponsors for fanfest 2010 then that will be a sure sign of progress currently i dont see that such vendors would see such sponsorship as being of any valuethank you for progressing this far with the audio concerns
functional sounds a sound when someone new comes onto your scanner preferally different sounds for corpmembers enemies and unknowns a sound when a wreck has been succesfully salvaged warning sound when capacitor is getting low also a subtle sound to indicate when your capacitor isnt stableadmospheric sounds the sound of metal bending when the ships armor or hull is low dopler effect on engine sounds of ships passing by
computer games can only access two of the five senses sight and sound given these limitations it is almost criminal to ignore options which more fully immerse the player into the game world or communicate to himher what is going on in that worldrather than go through a list im just going to tell you what i want the professionals at ccp will know better than i what can and cannot be done i want all audio accessible to me no matter how close im zoomed into my ship it is clumsy and irritating to utilize zoomed views to modify what i hear i want audio to assist me in knowing what is going on there should be a distinct brief immediately identifiable audio cue for any action i take against a target and any action another player takes against me i should know if someone is scramming me i should hear hits on my ships hull but never on my targets hull i should hear a multitude of klaxons and alarms as i enter structure plan it out ccp sit in a mock battle close your eyes and tell me whats happening when you can do that youre on the right track i want audio to assist immersion in the game universe when i approach a station i want to hear the buzz of background traffic comms i want to hear more than just docking request accepted i want to hear station control tell me they have assumed command of my ship for docking maneuversin a like manner if im in a ss in the middle of nowhere i dont want to hear background noise unless its the blind hiss of background stellar radiation use the audio make me believe im in spacei along with others did a great deal of brainstorming along these lines on a couple of space sim projects space is certainly one of the more difficult audio experiences to communicate but done correctly the audio can have a massive effect upon immersion happy to provide more detailed lists if needed finally i want the ability to customize what i choose to hear to a high degree audio cues needed by pvpers may just irritate those running missions in empire and vice versa players must be able to configure these new toolshope that helps and glad ccp is looking into this most neglected area of the game
the proposal is simple really since plexes have been such a success ccp should add character transfer and portrait change tokens as well that people can buy and trade ingame with the same ingame restrictions with plexessuch as the inability to remove them from the stationi think that theres an untapped demand for these services from the poor irl but rich ingame market and i think its financially worth the cost of coding in
coolhonestly with cloning tech the way it is in game there is no reason why we shouldnt already have this optionjust make them transportable like plex should be
and name changing buttons as well please 
good idea bringing this up next meeting 
i think this has been brought up before but might as well do it again given the overall no replies to training multiple characters on one account what about being able to queue skills on both characters and have it automatically switch between them one runs out other starts training this would make alts less of a pain in the ass that it is currently thoughts
there is nothing unreasonable about this proposal acctualy good ui improvement but might be difficult to implement since characters on same account arent connected with eachother in any way ingame through some sort of uinever the less supported
there is honestly no drawbacks to this its legal within the boundaries and mechanics of the systemit should be implemented
supporting my own idea yay timer edit as for implementation they are linked by the account name so the server would know what to train next just by looking at the queues if you have 3 characters it could possibly go by which queue has the least time on it
nice idea  though it does beg the question  is there room for bigger brackets
make em bold for example theres lots of ways
i think someone put it simply that neuts could be nerfed to half the effect because of there effect to active tankingalso reload times are not hardcoded to 10 seconds there set per module  every amarr pilot knows thisthey have only been made to scale with the overloaded duration decrease eitherway the reload time specifically isnt a deal breaker but it would be nice
done and done im not entirely sure about the necessity of the capital nos or the cap booster reload duration change but the others are excellent ideas on how to increase the utility of active tanking setups
would also like to see a reassessment of the penalties associated with active tanking rigs  one of the benefits of an active tank is supposed to be that you dont suffer the speedsig penalties associated with a buffer tank slapping on a nanobot acceleratoraux nano pump kills your speed and is a disincentive to active tanking especially on blaster boats which need all the speed they can getit would also be nice if the core defence capacitor safeguard were not stricly inferior to a ccc or smc the cost difference is meaningless so it would be good to have a more significant cap use reduction
a return to active tanking has been one of my petpeeves for quite some time so hats off feeling the same way critique  the suggested numbers for repairers are far too low the actual dps an overloaded rep is able to mitigate is more like 3040 above normal even if the repairer itself is operating at higher sa single marii on a cruiser is easily overwhelmed by a t1 frigate  boosting overheating also does not prevent buffer tanking from being superior in almost all circumstances attaching it to overheat only serves to give people with the skill character and player an edge over nonheaters unneccessary distinctionalternative increase fitting requirements for all buffer modules by 50 2 plates rather than 3 actual sacrifice if buffering already have nonstacking rigs to boost further decrease nonlogistics fitted rr efficiency by 50 you want to live better have local tank to augment up the rr increase repair amount on all local modules by 50 increase all npc damage output to compensate rattersmissions use active to begin with so pure number crunchingtogether with rigs heat and decreased buffers this will make the gallente repair bonus worth while again and let hyperionsbrutixes do some good againit will give value to cap warfare and dampening both of which are outclassed by ecm as rrbuffer is better than local and unless you neutdamp an entire gang it has no effect compared to the jamthe tanked ship will once again have an edge against the one but still fall to the many no changing that i fearpoint is buffer tanking has such a massive advantage currently that active tanking will only be viable if buffers are decreased and reps increased especially when rigs are factored in actives buff rigs stack buffers do not
what he said
comments the nos changes seem unnecessary it seems that in the best case they become yet another required module to active tank it is also a huge nerf to the amarr recons requiring overheating to make active tanking viable also seems unnecessary increasing the heat damage seems to work directly against the only situation in which active tanking was actually useful sustained engagements your suggestion does nothing about one of the bigger reasons that people dont active tank its hell on your fittings your changes barely change the break even point for when its better to active tank vs platepassive tank more on this below  youre suggesting boosting cap boosters yet another required modulei appreciate that youre suggesting improvements to the game but im not sure this is really the right way to go about it imo any first step would have to address the fittings disparity between platepassive tanking and active tankingconsider a cyclone meant to be active tanked theres two ways you can do it with a large booster or an xl boosterconsider the large boosterlarge shield booster 165 grid  115 cpumed cap booster ii 165 grid  25 cpumed nos 175 grid  16 cputotal 505 grid  156 cpulsb can be overheated for 130 for a 660 dps tank once you include cap your changes would mean that it could overheat for 1 minute remember 100 damage and a faster cycle time requiring more capacitor and damaging faster and tank 912 dpstake said cyclone in a fight against a buffered brutix the brutix deals 830 dpsbrutix ttk cyclone 60 29729831517  154 seccyclone ttk brutix 102 sec2 brutix vs 2 cyclonesbrutixs ttk cyclone 1 29729  8312  912  42 seccyclones ttk brutix 1 51 secso even in bcs which are far and away the most commonlikely solo and super small gang ships in eve we see that a second item on the battlefield utterly nullifies active tanking even when you have an active tank bonusliang
instead of overheating why not require a scriptalso double the amount repaired while doubling capacitor use with reduced duration might be ideal i support the idea of active tank discussion but the exact details are lacking
not supported ill explain why first it would be great if we could help through tutorials everyone regardless of their language im a big fan of more new players in the game  eve needs this to be healthy however translating the tutorials is not a trivial task with everchanging tutorials and a big question is if you want to have tutorials in language a while everything else in the game is in language b assuming were ok with having specific localized tutorials and spending developer time on it should spanish be one of those languages sure it is the fourth after mandarin english and hindi most spoken language in the world  but does this apply to eve as wellthis devblog of the most recent csm elections shows that this is not the case according to the devblog see the list of voters by country then  of subscribers the 10 most spoken languages in eve are1 english us  uk  english part of canada 78  australia  new zealand  5832 german germany  austria  9393 russian russia  5444 french france  french part of belgium 50  french part of canada 22  395 dutch netherlands  dutch part of belgium 50  266 danish denmark  217 swedish sweden  28 norwegian norway  1359 finnish finland  1110 polish poland  08in fact spanish spain  parts of latin and middle america is so under represented that none of the top 21 countries speaks spanish this also shows why only english german and russian are the officially supported languagesso while spanish is the fourth most spoken language in the world it is only spoken by an exceedingly small part of the eve population it would be more likely and reasonable to include a french or dutch or even polish tutorial than it would be include a spanish one
until we see the changes that ccp makes to projectiles and the minmatar ship lineup i will push this back for everyone to take a stab at it
while i think your point number three is valid and should be passed your larger point about removing term limits i disagree with for two reasonsthe first it puts ccp in the position to be accused of playing favorites whatever their reasons for denying a trip to some and not to others may be no matter how valid or reasonable those reason really are they will ultimately not be able to escape charges of favoritism in their choices and so are left with either accepting all or rejecting all csm incumbants which negates your system checksecondly there is the question of the delegates themselves let me quote a poster from another sectioni think that future csms are the biggest risk as far as corruption goes however they are not required to go undercover like ccp employees they are usually alliance leaders and they are not expected to step down from their ingame positions during their terms and they cannot lose their job because of whatever they do that is they have all the incentive in the world to be corrupt with only the penalty of getting banned if they arent subtle enough and get caughtreturning the same delegates to office repeatedly would seem to increase the risk this poster believes is already existent
to mazs idea i vote no it is way too complex if nothing else not to mention the fact that continuity hasnt shown to be a problem so far from csm3 only 3 pilots will not be able to run again vuk lau omber zombie and myself so there are 6 people who can run again and i have a feeling at least a few of them will which ensures continuity  without getting the council to become an old boys club with the same 4 blockvoted players over and over as tempting as it is to think oh dont worry im the right manwoman for the job the csm needs constant fresh bloodand while voting blocks may always get a seat at least that seat will go to a different person every 2 terms if not sooner which has already proven to be a good thing i wont name names here not to mention that it is highly dubious to pass an issue law that gives yourself more powerwhile ozs idea has merit i think it should at least be a 2 term sabbatical so after serving two terms either consecutively or not youd have to wait a year to run againas much as id like to be chairman for life  i dont think this is a good idea for mazs idea im voting no ombers idea adjusted for a 2 term sabbatical period maybe
dont nerf the moros out of siege drone bonus stop the equalisation of weapon types and ship classes dont encourage the fotm culture
boosting the damage of a moros guns might fix the issue of its damage compared to other dreads but then were just trying to make all dreads the same no the moros did something different something interesting which is one of the main reasons people trained it it was far from being the best in siege but out of it the moros reigned supreme that was its advantage one which admittedly compares to that of a carrier so all the whining about a moros being a station pwnmobile while completely ignoring carriers is just sillydont nerf ma moros woooooooooooo o

no no and nolocal is a very much needed tool for anybody traveling through lownullsec by your logic that local is a concordprovided service or whatever then ccp should also remove stargates from nullsec no if its that important to you to make this a realistic internet spaceship experience then imagine that the local chat system is integrated into the stargate networkif you want to go somewhere without local chat go check out wormhole space that place has no stargates no communications network no humancontrolled infrastructure or connection to the settled regions of the universe whatsoever its also a place thats scary as hell to be in especially when you launch your probes and find poses all over the place you never know if youre about to be hot dropped by a cap fleet just for the hell of it even nullsec is while lawless still a controlled areastrongly oppose so much so that if this plan is implemented i will cancel my subscription
if the stargates are the ones provideing the information of who is in a system they must have great scanners to know that a carrier fleet just jumped in but i like the idea that they are bassically giant bean counters because the jumps are all acounted for in the starmap under jumps in last hour24 hours etcthat being said soon the new soviernity comes out so the gates will be in control of the players i think the players owning all the gates in their system should get to choose wether or not they have a localcomments

supportin cuz op is straight as a circle
awsome and understandable
you do realize that you could do recon 1 of 3 in any t1 frigate with an afterburner right i typically use an assault frigate because im overly cautious and every once in a while i get hit once or twice i wouldnt mind scaling as long as you dont buff the level 4s i noticed the op has been edited to double the time i didnt have a problem with short periods for level 1 15 minutes and 2 missions half houras someone else pointed out i dont think anybody is concerned that level 1 or 2 missions will be farmed nobody does them long enough for it to matter unless theyre just starting the game in which case we should let them have fun by picking and choosing so that they stay with itedit to add support and agree 
this arguement is moot its really easy to get around that timer anyways1 grind faction standing to the point you need in order to access all agents for the chosen faction2 find a suitable agent3 cancel any mission you dont desire4 ignore the warning about standings5 6 profitnever the less i support this idea i think another option could be to have a list of say 45 missions to choose from and remove the option to reject missions imo thats a much better solution

ok so i was in leadership for running a 00 alliance i have had lots of dealing with lots of peopleid heard lots of stuff about the gms ive made lots of petitions generally speaking they have been good and straight forward afaik 910 have led to we will close this now and do what we do so i cant exactly verify anythingi have heard massive amounts of improper punishments being placed on playersfriend who generally trades got gagged for 24 hours at around the 25 hour mark the gm responds saying it was totally inappropriate to gag him and that he will then ungag him but the gag had already been run out anyway so he got entirely punished for doing nothing wrongthere are many other situations where gms give bad information for example i have 50 sec status someone sees this and petitions to find out how to do it without asking me gm responds that its impossible to have over 50 sec as thats the limit that anyone who has over 50 would have to be a gm or an exploiter the person who originally made the petition probably didnt drop my name but said person then when i got labelled exploiter he contacts me saying im an exploiter and hes getting me banned the result wasnt very gooddespite all this i still hadnt lost hope in the gmsjust now broke that for me i was on sisi but the cancer levels of sisi are at such high levels so i start playing red faction guerilla that starts crapping out so i get into eve i post in 1 channel and only 1 channel jitabros pc kronos iow someone in jita pricecheck kronos i never did get a response 45 mins later i get global account gagged for the reason of because jason edwardsthis exact thing has happened to so many other people now gagged for no valid reasonsomething has to be done to fix this situationallow public publishing of gmccp convos i think will be the first step toward this tbhyou may not publish private communications from ccp their agents or representatives or eve online volunteers without authorization this should change it is without a doubt the cause of such a fog of war of the issuei think the system has become so poisoned that many people are making bad petitons in protest of the situation which is what leads to so many more issues
not supported aside from removing the only thing low sec00 explorersmissioners have against pirates it also goes directly against my recent suggestion to ccp to add probes to the overview settings  allowing them to be filtered on your scanner results

eve is all about balance and for every new offense tactic or module their is a counter tactic or module today i lost a onyx in 00 by a corp that hot dropped no less than 8 carriers on me although i felt flattered that it took that many to engage and kill me but reflecting on my loss i realized why it sometimes is getting harder for real pvp one on one or so people will not engage if they know they will by hot dropped on so how can this be counteredrecommendations 1 a cyno scattering module  once activated in the proximity of a active cyno it randomly scatters the jump destinations to various areas even in another system the more ships the more the scattering gets spread out an ew ship would be the most likely candidate and of course the obligatory drawbacks would have to be applied for balance2 a mobile cyno jammer that can be fitted on a ship that can block all in coming cynos as long as activated the mobile cyno jammer could be based on a range of jamming per level a level 1 can only cyno jam ships that are within 20k were as a level 5 could block and entire system the drawback would be of course to keep balanced is that this jammer would be a power drain that would not last forever3 same name as above mobile cyno jammer but instead of blocking incoming cyno ships it prevents ships from leaving as long as active this way if 9 carriers hot drop into a system for a lone ship or two they may not like the idea of being trapped by a mobile cyno jammmer ship that is calling his friends inagain eve is all about balance and being able to move and counter move please let me know if this can be improved onflame away

prior to the apocrypha railguns had an awesome recoil animation after being fired now that animation is gone and has been for some time its only a small thing but it would be really good if this could be brought back with the recoil it makes the turrets seem quite powerful but now it feels like they just peashootersmight be nothing to a lot of players but this is just bugging me nowgive railguns some love please ccp
with the last few patches things have steadily been getting tougher for pirates and the dominion patch with the af changes will be a massive issue for an already beleaguered playstylei ask that gate and station guns to be altered to no longer target drones this will open up the proper usage of a good number of ships that are currently stepped over because of their drone reliance it will also allow pirates the same defences against smaller ships as everyone else is allowedthankyou

your idea is even more overpowered than the original posting
your idea is even more overpowered than the original postingim guessing your talking about the serious one about the anchorable bubblesyes i totally agree the diference is that the original post is 90 in favor of ganking and mine has massive potential to be used by carebears and gankers alike but the almost 100km cloaking distance and inabillity to anchor next to stargates tips the scale towards carbears signifficantly and to reverse ganking would be gankers it is about buying time and creating safer working condidtions for non agressive players while gankers get possibility of harder to find ss for their command ships and miners get safer places and more warning for their 12 billion isk orcas and expensive rourqs on the flip side this added sence of security could tip the balance to well equiped gankers feeding off of the sence of security the bubble provides the occupants some of them possibly afk as for the cloaking of pos it as stated wouldnt be a permanant thing or even as long lasting as other deployables such as disrupter towers etc making the job of keeping new cloaking bubbles expensive and ungainly it would mostly be useful for putting them up withought them getting detected before they have their defences online after that if somone were to bm it and go to atack it their bm would be well within the decloaking range and the station would as always be in imeadiate trouble but even with the idea of a 99km bubble i know an interceptor is more than capable of govering that kind of ground in short order so yes it is extremely overpowered but in enough ways to cover a broad spectrum of possibilities for gankers and carbearsthe only way to even it out for the gankers would be to make it smaller and make warping from cloaked sites and cloak bubbles impossible until x amount of time after the bubble has colapsed forcing the poor rourq pilot to watch helplessly as say an interceptor and covert ops frig systematically scann it down possibly just meters away from decloaking it so once more i tottally agree with you but open your imagination to all the possibilities of a device like this from all perspectives and instead of just shooting the entire idea down at once do it point by poit so we can see if there is a posibility of a device like this one or the original posters because simaler devices have been used in games like homeworld with great usefullness and im not even proposing one like the homworld version which was simaler to the interdictor ships with their mobile bubbles and were used to sneak ships right up to the mothership and decimate the enemy before they had a chance to know what hit them imo its the oh no thats overpowered quick grab the nerf gun attitude that is holding this game back instead of lazilly nerfing the few ships and mods that stand apart from the others why not take the time and bring the stragglers up to parcoments
i would consider this proposal to be the very definition of overpowered the fitting of a cloak is supposed to detract from your ships offensive capabilities and this is nothing short of a clever workaroundnot that ive not wished for it myself on multiple occasions it even makes sense in a roleplaying way your ship is deploying a fuzzbuster which scatters signals from outside sensors as long as you stay within range youre hidden as a solo smallship pvper id just about kill for oneunfortunately it offers far too much power to the aggressor and also removes a very important factor in eve ship design balancesorry cant support

something along these lines sounds like a reasonable compromise basically i just dont think carriers should be able to cycle drones in the heat of battle without any kind of drawback
as a carrier pilot i support this idea it would of course need to be balanced to ensure that if it is a separate bay it is not just adding capacity to a carriers drone bayas for all the carrier yes mother super carrier no people if only one gets it it should be the super carrier if you were designing and building a ship that could not dock and a smaller version of this ship you were designing could do it why would you not implement the same feature into it personally i think both should be able to do it if anything the moth super carrier should be able to do it better then the standard carriera complex overly complex and not needed if you ask me but hey a possibility is that carrier pilots would be able to view a que of all damaged dronesfighters in their bay and prioritize specific drones or fighters either individually or by group group being fighters heavy drones etc that is if repairing is not instant but again overly complex and more sever load cause we need that panyways enough talk i support

remove the pointless rof nerf on destroyers fix done nothing else needs to be done to make them tougher or whatnotwhen destroyers were released ships had 60ish less armorshieldshull than they do now rmr armor boost and another subsequent one in a later expansion and new ships always seem to be tougher than the ones that came beforein exodus a destroyer was a credible threat to an inty or af much more a single t1 frigate tanked or not and that was iwithi the rof nerf now a single plated rifter extended merlin or kestrel zippy imicus can laugh while it rips an autothrasher or blaster cormorant to ribbons and walks away smiling
when destroyers were first introduced they were two t1 frigs shoved together to make a gun platform they were not glass cannons the changes that have occurred in eve since they were introduced has reduced their usefulness in everything except as salvagersi had some of the most fun pvp ive ever had in zerg dessie fleets before they were nerfed into uselessnessdessies need some love
not signedmostly because as was mentioned before theres too much of a disparity between console gaming and computer gaming that would give computer gamers the upper hand vs all but very dedicated console gamerslook at games like halo 3 immensely popular despite being consoleonly i think ccp knows what theyre doing with this one
this is a nice onedifficulties i see on the implementation side as we already discussed with ccp that bookmarks as well as other settings should be stored serverside they are on the client currently and ccp was quite reluctant  in fact they said they cannot do it currentlyas a consequence while i will raise this feature request i only see a realistic chance of implementation once the serverside storage of settings has been implemented lets celebrate this on fan fest 2010 
i am thinking that ccp is trying to move away from spam clicking in general i cannot think of any other eve activity in which your effectiveness is determined by how rapidly you spamclick a button well other than pod warping after ship kill and thats just to get around ship death lag rather than fixback the scanning i would rather prefer to leave the current scanning system as an antiquated whats around me button and apply energies to fixing the hunting other ppl issue that this scan fix creates
its not just spamclicking a 360 degree directional button as long as you dont have scripts running doing the spam for you it really took skill correctly using the scanner to quickly find an object in spacepeople not using the scanner or not knowing how to effectively use it should not post heresoloroamingscouting has become a real pain and i have not done much pvp since that patch except for the usual gankingstuffi seriously hope that there will be some fix to that reduce delay to 01 put in a good substitute no probing is not its too fkn slow whatever just make it possible again to effectively get a clue on whats going on in the system and wherethanks
thisi cannot believe that the csm is blowing this off 55 pages ppl get real and get your head out of your ass you were elected by the player not the devs
this although it really does seem the csm does not know a thing about directional well other than the 360 spamming and waiting for something to appear scanning
no its still fineyou babies are just looking foolish at this point
this represents the communityall hope is lost
both of these would make life much easier
nice little idea me likes
how about a drone repair modulemid slot item repairs a light drone from smoking ruin to combat worthy status in say 2030 seconds 2 minutes for a medium 5 for a largesentry or fighter low slot version does the same but half as quickly they will work in conjunction if you really want to gimp your ship that muchit wont instantly recharge shields but itll give those poor droneboats an option when theyre working 12 jumps from a dock in the crap end of 00
there is already a high slot item for that it doesnt have the arbitrary time frames either signed on op though

not supported makes using my brutix on gates harder no drones to soak up sentry fire is baaad
i agree
not supported i wouldnt even support this if i was still a piratei like how you gave the reason of giving neuts a better chance of killing pirates as they would engage more but all this is is giving lazy gatecamping pirates more dps and gankage to kill their targets find a new day job if you cant hunt your targets
current situation penalizes drone userswhat said drone users are doing it irrelevant as they can just come back in something that isnt a droneboatif anything this change might hurt pies its fairly common to spam flights of tech 1 drones to distract sentry guns
supported making drone carriers more capable would make low sec more diverse yes besides if a pilot has to take his ship to a station to move drones from cargo holds to drone bay drones may as well function as a temporary dps boost on gates like overheating making ships that rely more on drones for dps then say insert typical fleet bs hereless capableand the current aggro system doesnt just effect pirates it effects anyone who is out in low sec and wants to get some pvp experience

dear ccp please give us the players a settings option that will turn on the permanently showing of pilot names and ship types near their boxes in space not only in overview columns so we will have no need to move mouse cursor to different points on screen to just know ship typealso it will be very useful for next alliance tournament  observers will show which ship is where without locking it or moving their mices
support this
you mean the info that comes up when you select something in spacethats an intriguing idea i think it would help people make better tactical decisions i think ill raise it as a csm issue if there isnt some big reason why this is a bad ideamy thoughts for the system when a ship is selected press some key combination to keep the selected info up but make it look a little different then when you normally select a ship maybe put a border around it or something if the ship gets selected again make sure theres a visual indication that its selected and not just another ship thats being watchedand of course add a key combination to remove a ship and another key combination to remove all ships from being watched
yes i think it can be a bit a less of info  just pilot name and ship type more info can be shown if this ship is selectedthank you the point of this idea is to make space view part of screen more tactical  so fleet commander be able to know where is enemy ew or tacklers and where his currently overview allows just distance measurement  not position display relatively to other ships to do latter currently you have to move your mouse all around to just know pilots name and ship type  drawbacks of this is clearly shown in alliance tournament recordings when to thirdparty observer there is no understanding which ships are where on battlefieldyes it is a perfect upgrade of my proposal
you guys are insane they need to remove pilot names from the grid and overviewin empire space and low sec sure ruin that if you like but 00 it should be the other way around where the pro players want to play a hard game
no way how would you know where the celeb or fc is to kill them early
obviously there would need to be an option to turn it off for those times where there are 100 ships on grid but the idea is pretty goodmaking people jump through ridiculous hoops to do basic things like find out who theyre shooting at has nothing to do with 00 pro players haha jesus christ did you really say that or a hard game its a basic failing of the ui
excellent ideaeven better customize what you want shown and let users pick from a list of options add this to a very long list of interface changes

not sure if this has been posted in another thread but i did not see it here and since this discussion is on going with or with out me i may as well chime inwith the changes in dominion remove local from 00 by default then when an alliance controls a system make it an upgrade deploy something in system gain access to the sensors from the stargates since you will apparently be paying for their upkeep anyways if no one controls a system no local if some one does then they are the defender and can consider it an advantage if the upgrade is free and requires no workcost then every system will have it but if it requires effort to get and is something that can be destroyed by an attacking force then hey cool hahaha even better only let the owning alliance talk i local most one sided smack talk ever p something along these lines could really be considered though maybe only controlling alliance even has access to it although that seems a tad bit unfair attacker wondering how many people in local while 200 people assemble to kill his small 10 man ganganyways just an idea
supported it will help make lownull sec much more interesting read fun for both pirates and nonpirates
would be nice if something similar would replace drone hitpoints bonus on moros

for pos defense modulesusing the ships tables from the overview you can drag ships up or down in the que to set the targeting priority for pos gunssimple effective badly needed
how will the furthest bits of space be viable for alliances with current logistics its impossible to get there without intermediate pointsthis means you will either be a petrenter to get space deep in the universeto me it looks like the further systems will be rental space for the big alliances that will take the space that is logistically viableso logistic ships like jump freighters would need to get a huge boost in jump range to be able to get to and from empire for logistics
if they make the cost to construct these guns a bit expensive then they will not unbalance the game they will be just another service a corpalliance can offer to its mining divisions sort of like a temporary pos as for the pirates they will have to adapt and travel in larger numbers andor adopt new tactics but they will be rewarded by having a large number of targets in one place that are taking advantage of the protection the guns offer and once the guns are defeated or tanked then there will be enough rewards on hand to warrant attacks on fortified asteroid fieldsi am in favour of this idea
this could also provide a slight balance to the nerf ice miners are getting from pos not being needed for sov anymoresome thought into balancing would be required but i like the basic idea
in case you havent noticed barges and exhumers have drone bays and really since barges shouldnt be a combat match for someone in a combat ship security is necessary

theres many people in eve with hundreds of billions of isk do you really want characters floating around with 300mil spnot to mention thats about 1mil spweek for your regular missioners see where this is headednot supported even if it was 100bil for 1k sp
someone brings this topic up about every 2 or 3 months and everytime they do we laugh at them hystericallyno
quit while your ahead nooblet
me facepalmno
facepalm korean mmos are that way not supported you really really miss the point  sp are one thing learning how to use your sp aka player skills is the other one and with buying sp you skip big parts of the player training
omg are you crazy
the math of the op would need to be adjusted but id go for this
how to convert isk into skill pointsa buy some 5s b dont get podded
c train rank 3 learnings to 5
shield transporter transfers shield from your ship to the target without any with very low energy cost but not 100 efficiency that way passive tanked ships can remote rep there could be few types of transporters the higher th speed of transfer the lower is efficiency current modules could be renamed to shield inducers the will be left the way they are they use capacitor energy to induce shield on another shipmodules could have similar fitting costs would help passive tanked ships a lot
a shield transporter as it is atm helps passively tanked ships already rr drake gangs are fun i dont see a need for a change
pos defenses currently are pointless against drone swarms indeed they do not even target them because of past exploitsthere needs to be a few new batteries specifically designed to target small stufflight missile battery point defense pulserailautocannonsame fitting reqs as a small gun uses small ammo or light missiles but targets only drones damage multipliers in line with other primary systems of the same typerepairalso pos need a repair facility of some sort either a passive system that targets ships only within the pos shield and remotely repairs them or something you put your ship into similar to the maintainance array and select repairremote repair would only work on one ship at a time with about the same efficiency as a bs fitting four or five remote reppers but spreads it across all areas of the ship hull armor shield so each area receives the equivalent of one or two large repairers not terribly fast but far better than nothing also repairs overheat damage cargo and drones after the ship is at 100
1 kill the ship controlling the drones2 logistic ships carriers rr on your bsnothing left to be done here all you want is already there
there are 20 of them which one is controlling all of those dronesand if theres no one around to pilot such vessels if there are no such vessels even present if your entire fleet is in system theres not a lot of people willing to just sit somewhere in a repair boat just in case you get a boo boo there needs to be a box of bandaids in the medicine cabinetincorrectall i want is no where to be foundsupporting myself of course
you kill them one by one start with the later a down to z for exampleif you come to pos defence without any rr on your ships you failed alreadynothing will locally tank a fleet that can take down your pos put one remoterep on each ship you got and you got a pretty hefty rr tanki hope i helped you to see that the stuff is already there
and then we will see all drone boats happily gank peopleno
currently non drone boats gank people and drone boats dont so i really dont see the issue with allowing drone boats to do what every other boat can already do in the gamebesides of course the unique factor i mean we dont want every ship to be the same but right now drone boats are sorta crippled against camping and not to mention moros nerf we might as well buff something about drones since the suck enoughedit supporting and sort of buff nowadays especially for drones
bonused drones can still survive quite a bit
actumarius please check this issue on the evelopedia sentry gun aggression and drones which was already submitted to ccp and agreed on lately if it caters for your suggestion
please delete this issue is covered here
it was an old idea i posted supported by the csm and proposed to ccpits in their court now
i think a great idea for eve would be if you could repair yourself with your own maintenance drones currently this cant be done because you have to be locked onto the target to give the order to repair it my idea is that when you right click on the drones in the drone window there should be an option that says something to the effect of repair yourself
eve is a multiplayer game get some friendsnot supported
just for the record i am currently playing with two of my friends but i am not posting to argue this pointif you logically think about from an engineering standpoint if a drone can repair other ships then there is no reason it shouldnt be able to repair your own ship
agreed but im still stuck on the fence with this one
minutes have been finished and sent to ccp as far as im aware
added wikicorporationbookmarks
i agree i dont even fly capital ships but i loved that effect it saddens me that it was changed
can we at least get some indication that this is coming in dominionor that youre even working on it or that you even read the post and acknowledge that literally everyone wants this
i agree completely with this topic
i support this cause  post
i realize this is already being looked at but 7th page is unacceptable 
thats really a hawk issue tbh the real problem with rockets is to do with the metagame rockets are basically ok in terms of the  damage dealt to a webbed scrambled target  theyll do full damage or something vaguely close to it the problem is the webbed and scrambled bitit requires that you fit a web which many frigates dont have the slots to do and it requires that your frigate target is not afterburning which many frigates do particuarly afs to this you can add low base damage and excessive fittings for that damagethen the hawk suffers even further with a horrible noncaldari shield boost bonus and doubly horrible cpu all while having less base dps than a kestrel
clicking for my support
meh im caldari just used rockets in a frigate vs frigate tournament in my alliance this past weekend and they did pretty good only reason i lost in my opinion is because i wasnt prepared for ecm and got locked out when the enemy was almost goneanything that gives me a boost in the game though i guess ill support
i support this cause  post
for the sake of buddha allah jesus and any other deity you wish to pray tocan you get rid of this id rather see the keylogger spam than deal with this bs this is much more annoying than the capcha crap you tried and got rid of you added the big red warning about going to a noneve website let darwinism take its course after that if the idiots cant survive the forums we are probably better off without them in our game anywaysidenote i tried to post this 4 mins ago but you know what happened
i on the other hand would not
for the 100th time i support this issue use the captcha code please im going nuts hereps time flux detectedyou are going too fast wait five minutes and try again
and were supposed to believe ccp play this gamesigned
this new scanning thing is crap the 2seconds difference in seeing an enemy gang appear on scanner could be the difference between your fleet being able to setup to fightget away add that too not being able to quickly pinpoint and narrow down targets whilst roaming heh
agahghahgahgh
look its a nerf not much of one to 99 of the people but enough to drain the tears for 55 pages of the 1get over it like you do every other nerf or gb2wow adapt or die
even this is good enough a reason to revisit this change and the csm really need to up their game if they dont understand the ramifications this has on more advanced pvp
daily bump to address this issueedit first on p 56 woot
everything i have to say has already been said
like the idea
both good ideas
for those of you that dont know ccp has a department called internal affairs ia for shortcreated following events such as t20 that had a detrimental effect both on players and ccps image but mostly the laterits intended function is to ensure that ccp employees are beyond reproach and events like t20 do not occur againand its second intended function which is to assure players doesnt occurall is not well and ia remains an empty suitevents involving ccp staff that damage the companys image and relationship with its customer continue to occurso far this year we have had controversial issues with scrapheap challenge a 3rd party forum that is operated by a ccp dev acting on privileged information available to him outside the context of the gamemore recently it was uncovered that members of the isd and bh team were releasing data regarding eve players ip addresses to an unsecured party allowing them to link eve players to out of game resources as a result many players now suffer an increased security risk that has thus far lead to at least one known attack further unknown fallout in game with the release of this private information is expected
if it helps ia audited all of the csms accounts probably multiple times
that time of year eheven tho i havent been affected by this its still a huge amount of goty and a breach of users privacy
ccp should never agree to release private information to nonemployees regardless of the proposed intention or rational
too much stuff like this has been going on over the years with the ip addresses and personal data and it needs to stop
someone working on behalf of ccp harvesting ip addresses before passing them onto a third party is a breach of the trust we put in ccp relating to the handling of our private datathis needs to be addressed urgently and publicly and with the full inclusion of the csm
top o the heap
enable the use of sound profiles similar to the overview settingsatmospheric soundswarning soundsweapon effects soundsno soundsetc
i recall bacon being deliciousfor those of you who dont remember bacon was a thirdparty tool that played audio notifications for enemies entering local it was incredibly controversial though to this day i really dont see why  its information you can see easily it just gave it to you in a better format
sure why not
very good compromise im all for this idea props for thinking it thru mate
agreed a straight ui improvement is all this is if its not too difficult to code then id like to see it implemented
if they implemented this and skill injection without requisites and took the 24 hour cap off the skill system would be perfect
this would be nice
go go go
people keep saying this versitile stuff but how is it versitile its damage it mitigated by both the raw speed of its target and its transversalsig due to the actorp split plus the drones weak points the other three have to also deal with in practice its damage is normaly lower than a pure gun or torp boat what makes it versitile its not the fitting for sure since its grid and cpu are nothing special could it be the acs since they suck so hard dropping one or two acs from a phoon is no loss but answer me this which of these is the versitile ship8 highs 7 turrets each turret has 74 base damage each turret saves more fitting than the ship below8 highs 4 turrets each with 58 base dps and 4 launchers each with 92 dpshaving 4  weapons is not versitility having weapons with more complex engagement envelopes is not versitity and you can fit neutsrr to any bs gunship in the game a high with a turrethigh without a turret
don like the tempest change loss of alpha strike and dps is too badchange to 10 damage per level and we can talk that woudl make it a snipar
read the op before you post thank you
poor troll attempt minmatar rely almost exclusively in pvp on our opponents lack of understanding of how minmatar actually works which is a horrible system to have to fall back upon its a pretty sad state of affairs when it just plain makes more sense to fly battlecruisers as a matari and let the battleships sit and collect dust because they are such underwhelming performersas to pattern im not sold that this will fix it but at this point any matari love is better than none at all supported
my my pattern clarc i appreciate your penchant for name calling and personal attacks it really adds a lot of weight to your arguments to immediately start insulting and personally attacking your opponents who rightfully point out flaws in what youve said now on to respond to the rest of your commentsre overboostingnowhere have i said that i want an overpowered tempest in fact i think if you had bothered to search over my posting history or know anything about what i have asked for youd know that i do not want any particular ship or race to be overpowered in fact id really appreciate a bit less of the roundrobin balancing approach that ccp seems to have taken a liking tore your posting styleyour post is almost incomprehensible because its simply a rapid fire set of responses to responses can you please give some idea of just what topic youre responding to when you respondre voidhail fixing void has nothing to do with fixing minmatar and it isnt even a major balancing point furthermore your changes to void do not really go far enough to make it a useful ammo over fed antimatter your fix for hail does not address that it is an utterly inferior ammo it is virtually never a good idea to use hail l when not fighting capital ships because of the other penalties cap penalty be damned  you cant outdamage rf emp even with the extra base damage note that this will apply to void above as well there is no reason to tackle void individually from other t2 close range ammore vargur and artillery the vargur already has a role bonus it doesnt need two role bonuses so either fix the fitting on the vargur itself or fix the fitting on artillery yes the paladin can fit 4 tach iis and have room for a faction lar this is an immaterial fact to this discussion because the paladin does not have a second role bonusre phoons 6th launcher yes a 6 launcher rr fleet phoon would be less unwieldy yes a 6 launcher rr fleet phoon would utterly invalidate the raven this is a point that you have repeatedly neglected to addressre the maelstrom i was simply stating that the maelstrom is already the minmatar main fleet bs  so theres no change to be had because of the new 1650s continued lianged shifting stuff about
re tempest painter ew bs support roles and the zealot my mistake on the range of the painter however at 11260km its still effectively a useless bonus to have on a sniper bs antisupport is not a bs role while i might appreciate it i think a better solution would have been a raw tracking bonus instead of a painter bonus think muninn yes the painter would be nice to any torp ravens you had in gang with you but it wont be changing that your dps is much lower than it used to be  and in fact is much lower than any bs sans the scorp the zealot will have better effective dps because it has a much higher sig res  which translates directly into more effective dps the zealot will have much better agility than your proposed 4 low slot tempest your proposed tempest will not be able to keep up with fast moving hac gangs which is the only place that it might have been an actual asset your tempest takes the already anemic damage from autocannons and lowers it even more  with no return your tempest takes the already anemic alpha from artillery and lowers it even more whats more is that it lowers the overall damage output and increases the ammount of ammo that youll use all of this for no return your tempest wont be able to take part in rr armor bs gangs with only 4 lows and it wont take part in rr shield bs gangs because they dont and wont exist your tempest wont be soloing because it has even less agility and dps than it does now both things that are sorely lacking your tempest changes are terrible its not just not boosting to over 9000 its a direct slapintheface nerfre not fixing the guns racial flavor and ac falloff hit chance also affects hit quality this is one of the key problems with projectiles this trivializes the range advantages projectiles have drastically lower amounts of actual damage on the ammo than the other races this trivializes damage type selection there is a module called a cap booster which is a required module to fit which trivializes cap use this trivializes caplessness i think we agree on the above three items high optimal autocannons might help alleviate some of the painful damage reduction that we see but it would utterly eliminate the racial flavor of minmatar  that they operate in falloff they would simply become carbon copies of blasters just with higher optimal and falloff i would say that its ok to see high falloff weapons in the same sense that its ok to see high optimal weapons increasing tracking on artillery is a welcome change but doesnt change the fact that theyre essentially useless in fleet combat as you said tracking generally becomes a nonissue once everyones at 200km increasing clip size by 20 is just this side of a useless boost fleet utility is calculated in terms of ehp and dps  and in the average case you seem content to very very minor increases in dps a slight tracking boost and a very slight clip size boost really this fix is more of a nod to that its incredibly frustrating to reload that often and lose that much dps than a fix for the problem the 1650 artillery sounds like a really great idea until you read the subtext alpha as it is presently known is simply not a viable mechanic in this day and age it would take a really big increase in alpha to make it viable which is really the core of astros suggestion higher alpha at the cost of overall dps sure its not good for fleet snipers but it really excels where artillery is presently passable smaller gangs the other weapon types especially lasers atm have answers for any advantage that projectiles might have brought to the table your changes help mitigate some of this but these problems should probably be addressed at the root before they are addressed by radically changing the way projectiles workliang
i definitely like some of the ideas but 50 to tp optimal per lvl would be the most useless bonus in the game
cant other bs rr what breaks a gate camp it isnt the guns it is a larger fleet or real life issues perhaps make smart bombs not hit stargates and turrets would balance it out a bit betteri actually think this would be a nerf because drones are used in gate camps as damage soakers low sec needs more incentives id love to have some of the low grade null roids to be there definately not mercoxit

i only say that you lose players for this reasonmost of them only speak spanish and dont understand english
can i get arabic hindi tamil bengali how about welsh farsi is an important one too and for the doctors and philosophers how about latinisnt there something in the rules about talking in english
too many options and i dont think it is correct to have this changed by just csm3i think its too soon there were yet just 3 terms in council of wich many did their second term nowlets wait another 3 extra counsils
messy wasted votes what if youre on the fence about two candidates one of which may end up being disqualified after the votes are tallied thats an unclean solution to something that i dont even see as a problem not supported  keep the term limitsabsolutely not supported the csm delegates are accountable to the player base i do not like the idea of ccp the entity that the csm was intended to be a balance on having the power to simply veto somebody because they didnt like the work they didsignificant reform is needed in this area from what i remember issler wasnt even aware that he she had been put on the csm until the devblog was published source she was never given an opportunity to say no that rather absurdeditone further point i am rather disturbed by this part of your commentthat seems like a broken mechanic the duration of your term is spent not in iceland i understand that having you lot in a room with some game designers is efficient but this indicates to me that you lot havent got any ears or pull for the rest of your termnot to go veering off topic but does csm  ccp communication and action need some improvement
if they are good they should be allowed to stay for as long as people vote for them i support thisit means people like vuk can stay on for a long time but it also means poorer former csm members like ankhesentapemkah can reapplyoh well
this is a good way to implement it and fits in with the purpose of rigs too
the reason is simple twits in moros sitting dead on stations in lowsec completely unassailable cranking out near capital ship damage from drones that can hit subcapitals for full damage which is something no other capital not even carriers can doabout damn time imo and ill sit back and laugh at the ing station huggers while they weep
supportedand it needs a 75 or so damage bonus instead of just 5 to bring it in line with the other dreads even if it was left unchanged it would still be quite worse than other dreads in tasks such as sniping or just give it a huge sentry drone optimal range bonus that works too
whoa they are deagressed if they logdc and get time to think about dying fine as long as they didnt fire onkill you they should not be scannable or scrammable but hit them with stacking time penalties for multiple intel relogif they aggressed ship scannable for 15mins no invincibility period they chalk that dc up as a loss if the enemy brought probes if they dont relog in 15 they dont get to relog for an hour they need to fix their connection anywayrelog relog relog safety  thats an exploitsupport for relog fix which is simply make sure ewarp 1 has to complete before ewarp 2 no hopscotching through space while seeing enemy force and being invulnerable
i fully support this idea all other alternative idea posters in this thread can shove it
logoffski needs to be tended to a ship that disconnects in any way should1 be scrammable and not ignore scrams as they sometimes do when logoffski during gatecloak2 not disappear from space if they are agressed ie you are being scrammed or shot at3 warp to a safespot 1 mil km away and nowhere else regardless of amounts of loginlogouts and always warp back to the exact same spot they left if you log back in even if you instantly log out again you simply land in your original location and then the game initiates a new emergency warp with align and all that jazzthis would lead to that a logoffski that is agressed is screwed regardless a logoffski that does get away has no way of warping to several spots a logffski that logs off and on and off in order to make a new warp will find himself back at the origin point pirates or whatever before doing another align and warpthat would solve it for logoffskis without hurting people that legitimately disconnect or log off in space for the end of a gaming sessionthoughts
2 things first its a bit hypocritical to raise this as an issue just because you missed your titan kills and second what happens when youve logged off in a pos in 00 and due to rl stuffwhatever you log back on after 23 days and the friendly pos has being replaced with a hostile pos how in any way is it fair to the person who logs back on to not be able of taking any other action but being warped to the spot he logged off the warptosafe and disappear exists since this is a game and people should andor have a life outside of it
erm if youd taken the time to read the thread youd understand the fact that this is an exploit as it makes your ship immortal so firstly we didnt miss the titan kills we denied them by a flaw within the games designsecondly if you log off in a 12 bill destroyable pos in space while in a 70 bill ship your an idiot any decent titan pilot has a alot of friends b sov 4 c warps to an off grid 300au safe to log offeve is not fair it is cruel get over it 2 titans should of died but they didnt because they choose to start use an exploit that they know is a grey area with ccp thus will do nothinghence forth we are trying give them an easy programming solution that will fix the problem so that logging off wont make you teleport around while being immortalso i understand that being moronic may fall hand in hand with people who sympathise with blatant cheaters however all ive asked for is reasonable why make a big deal against it hmm
supported this shouldve been called an exploit long ago
reposting this from here i suppose i should have posted this thread in the assembly hall to begin withoverheating is the catalyst to my decision to make this post overheating is great i love it and it represents superb contentbut the interface for overheating is cludgy and irritating  in short it is poorly designedhere some of the problems the little button to overheat a specific module is small making it easy to missclick during a fight  the activation light is green the same color as the glow of a normally activated module making it somewhat counter intuitive to determine whether a module is overheating or not the green light which indicates an overheating module does not turn on until the module begins a fresh cycle with overheat enabled this paired with the small and easy to missclick nature of the overheating button makes it difficult to tell whether you have actually overheated a module prior to the module starting a fresh cycle you may missclick the overheat button and not realize it until the module begins a fresh cycle the heat damage measurement is visually ambiguous perhaps this is intentional yet moving the mouse over a damaged module displays a precise  of damage while the visual meter represents only an ambiguous measurement this is irritating and makes overheating even more finickyproposed solutions we really need a modular hud this has been a long time coming a more complicated hud grouping overheating etc only makes the current restricted hud system even more restrictive the current hud is simplistic and frustrating making it modular would help rectify this  the user should be allowed to choose the color indications for module activity currently green imminent module deactivation currently red module overheat currently a small green light and module damage the ambiguous red ring if a user could change the overheat indication light to say purple the hud would be a lot less frustrating off the bat the user should be capable of choosing the nature of function buttons such as overheating for example allow the user to assign a full modulesized slot on the hud to the overheat function assigning it to a specific mod a seperate full sized button for the overheat function would remove ambiguity and make it easier to tell what is going on allow the user to determine the size of the module buttons some people might want them smaller and low profile others might want them three times their current size others yet may wish to change the size depending on the fitting and activity which they are engaged in create a more user friendly hotkeyassignment system we should be able to quickly and easily assign hotkeys to for example overheat the module in the f1 slot give the user control over all of the readouts in their entirety we can choose to have numerical absolute and  readouts for shield armor and hull hitpoints why not for module heat damage or rack heat buildup  make it possible for a player to change module notifications to suit their taste the little light currently used to indicate overheat could be reassigned at will to indicate module activation the greenred rings currently used to indicate activation could be reassigned to indicate overheating the user could choose to have a color overlay instead in the color of their choice hot pink anyone the user could adjust their hud to taste to insure clarity and ease of use in this regardsthats about all ive got what do you think
just replying to give these ideas a thumbs up particularly the point about having a less ambiguous indicator of whether a module is overheating
just wanted to dump in my ideas on this from a year agolinkagecj
i approve this a thousand times over
shamelessly supporting something that most likely wont happen sigh
inspired by an irc rant by my greatest fan go maz im going to post this thread and see what complaints there are right now about contractsheres what i got so far100 item arbitrary limitno easy way to tell if you are at 100 items or not yet until after you do the time consuming part oh entering a lot of items same with damaged itemswhen you sort by quantity in the contract window items with stacks of 1 and assembleddamaged items all show a quantity of 1
ammo being removed from guns when you contract a ship  allow ammo to be removed from guns but added to the same contract as separate itemsbroken crystals making it impossible to contract any amarr ship larger than a cruiser  give option to remove damaged items from a container during the contract processno warning contracts button flash given to contractor when a courier contract is completed successfullymainly the damaged items one and the  of items limit without any warning of how many items youve actually added are the most annoying
i hate trying to contract hulks and forgetting i had cystals loaded having to jump 514 systems back to fix that sucks
courier contracts cant be split into smaller and more manageable containers 1 for the contracting damaged crystals idea they should automatically be removed from the contract
yes and for the love of pete let me disable that stupid are you sure you want to cancel the contract dialog box its terribly annoying especially when i accidentally click on the create contract buttonand please dont tell me that eve is a cold harsh place and that i should see that stupid dialog all the time because its harsh and cold
so i can contract my frigate size is irrelevant
actually its not because you can put anything under 120km3 into a courier contract which doesnt care if the mods  crystals are damaged and then break the contract package
hmmm i didnt think of it that way fair enough
you can do the same with cruisershacsbc and above you cant
great idea as long as a constellation chat replaces it and b directional scanner is beefed up
im pretty sure what i stated was that the rig patch made no sense based on the claims that it would help balance rich vs poorive furthermore provided statistical evidence that my claims on the economics behind their change based on their stats and everyones assumptions were wrong but we are merely at the midpoint of what i was preaching i was just building up the platform for 3 months from now when i revist the market stats once morethe point i made and will continue to make is that by making rigs availible to everyone the only real change is a loss in diversity of ships now as predicted ships have become less uncertain to gauge before a fight because you can be certain they have rigs rather than need to guessfurthermore for those who claim it was an issue of weath ive attempted to show just how the faction markets were impacted by the rig changes i would love to have a statistical analysis of how much more faction loot has been purchased per player since the change but for now i can simply go off pricerigs didnt help anyone out can you fly a frigate better absolutely but the standard of fit for every frigate has been raised not just you personally about the only impact this has had positively is the balance of frigate vs bs in combat but when comparing similar class warfare its deteriorated there is no longer as wide a gap between potential as their once was if ccp wanted to achieve more balance while not doing everything ive and apparently at least a few others have fought against they could have made all small medium and large rigs available to all ships but with diminished bonuses and cost for smalls that would have lowered the gap but also the reward for spending less similar to the meta scale for gear currently in game its hilarious when people always toss out the money arguement to me in game ive never met a player yet who couldnt fit rigs prepatch if they so desired with 2 or 3 exceptions that were extraordinarily overpriced due to demand it was a choice of performance vs economics which is exactly how it should be if thats not the case should we remove tech 2s distinct advantages next and reduce the cost so that everyone can afford a zealot or nighthawkor for that matter should we remove meta levels so that all new players can afford the best neutron blasters and solace large rrs for their megaive accepted the changes at this point because theirs obviously not any going back all my aim is now is to show the mistake its created so that in the future maybe just maybe the devs will actually think something through more than their 30 minute brainstorming sessions they apparently currently use but then again we have the new dd changes so my hope is diminished
stop being a damn drama queenget over yourselfthe patch has not broken the game rigs are now a little more affordable and making the game more challenging is not going to ruin your already overweight egoseriously give it up already
yaayyou are missing the point rigs were implemented incorrectly in the first place and this was the fix every other t1 or t2 module in the game that can fit multiple sized ships was priced low because the components to build it were few and common hardeners rechargers weapon mods ewar the list goes on and on they are all cheap when rigs were introduced the opposite was done the components were many and harder to come by the result was that rigs were priced higher and were not cost effective to use below the bs levelnow they could have fixed this two ways the first being what they did already the second would be to convert completely to the model that i mentioned above the existing model of one size fits all equals cheap imo that would be worse because it would mean bss could fit triple trimarks for around 5m isk so lets be glad they did what they did in this casethe rig market has a solid build cost floor for prices sometimes people will sell below the floor to get money now but they do so at a loss in general this market is controlled by cost the faction market on the other hand is 100 supply and demand there are no hard line costs for the top or bottom any price increases youve seen there would have to be due to an increase in demand or decrease in supply the change in rig prices could certainly be responsible for people having extra cash to burn now but thats not a bad thing in fact it was the point
this weekend was the perfectin my unbiased opinion end to a great alliance tournament but there were a few things that could be done better so lets figure out what those things are in this threadthe biggest issue for me was the visuals most of the time what you saw on the screen was pretty ships shooting each other important information like where they were going and who they were shooting was not always very clearly conveyed due to the nature of trying to communicate something 3d on a 2d format its going to be difficult regardless of whatever technique you use to try to show this information one improvement i can think of is giving the commentators the ability to draw on the screen much like they do in american football to show whats going on i remember a few moments in the tournament that were absolutely golden but never mentioned in the commentary and probably not apparent to people unless it was highlighted for example when the camera was centering around some pretty ship shooting another pretty ship a blue square in the background was approaching a wreck or when my alliances train minmatar fleet was charging the opponent in the semifinals you could see one ship getting in their way and visibly getting shoved outmy point is the commentators should be commenting more on what we the viewers are actually seeing not just on the damage bars and what ships are generally used for doing what or saying that this or that team are looting wrecks or something when we cant see it there is little value in a visual stream when the visuals are meaninglessteam leaders should be given the option to concede the match and keep their remaining ships there isnt really any good purpose for dragging out matches longer then they need to and right now players have no incentive not to i dont think it will impact the fairness of the tournament but it will increase the production valueccp need to get advertisers onboard the next time around you already have a ton of people watching and they are going to tolerate seeing commercials instead of an animation of a red flag i know the tourney costs you a lot of money and putting dish soap advertisements or something on isnt going to drive us away it will definitely increase the odds of there being another tourney the next year toothere needs to be some thing to encourage people to stop using the same general setup over and over again usually the setups were 2 battleships 13 battlecruisers a logistics maybe a couple recons or t3 cruiser and maybe small ships to fill out 10 slots i dont know if it was a lack of imagination or a fear of taking risks but things honestly didnt heat up until the very last matchesmaybe we should ban logistics ships and t3 cruisers with logi setups tracking disruptors and jammingyou guys should show action replays of exciting moments of the matchand you guys should also release the studio commentary along with the matches on youtube people want to hear what they say about their alliance in the studio between matches if they missed it i know i would
as far as the rules go they were much better than last year and i almost wish they stay the same the 1 glaring ship thats the most used is the logistics ship its really quite pivotal and can skew what should be very close matches pretty badly when both sides get down to roughly the same amount of ships but im not sure how to counter this and i think that id just leave it in and chalk it up as it exemplifying one of the 2 basic things in pvp 1 of which is doing dps and the other tanking that dps it should be mentioned that there were some extremely good setups without any logistics whether or not they were fieldedas far as points go t3 need to be 1 or 2 points more bs need to be cheaper they were so horrible in most cases this time around although faction bs may need to stay high with the massive buffs theyre getting but having t1 bst3 at 17 points would make for some really hard choices as well as moving cruisers to 9 points and bombers maybe to 78 because the more you encourage the use of bs the more valuable a bomber will beall in all i think nobody really got a monopoly on setups this year even pls setup is easily countered the speedgank team is rather resilient to most things including bombersdamps and tbh thats fine to really be able to counter that you should have to go to really specialized setups and thats what we sawso ccp claw should prolly just adjust points for a few ships to change things up a bit and keep the basic rules the same and that should provide a very entertaining tourney for next year maybe even allow boosters that would be very very interesting though there are some sick combinations of boosters then again i guess most of those revolve around bs
system for applying for tournament was utterly ed
i think a couple of good ideas were discussed by the commentators more granularity in points it would be useful to make smaller distinctions between ship classes such as the points for t1 cruisers and tier 1 battle cruisers more but still limited number of same ships to be flown i think raising the number of ships allowed to 3 or perhaps 4 per ship type would allow more specialist setups to be created creating more diversity in successful tactics while still not making the entire team look the samepersonally i also dislike the use of ecm in the tournament because of the chance base factor some teams got a number of lucky jams and went through while others didnt and failcascaded perhaps the randomness of it is fun to some but i think it makes judging pilot and fc skill very difficult something that would make the ecm ships and modules less pervasive in the tournament would be much appreciated perhaps by buffing other racial ewar
these are part of tq pvp strongly disagree with thisallowing 3x ship hulls to open up more varied setups eg drone setups would be nice along with fixing the hac and cruiser points cost to something more reasonable
yes it was the best alliance tournament so far but some things could use improvementid like to see more alliances in the tournament and maybe some way to differentiate or prohibit the sale of slots just because you own space that is safer than motsu or 10 newbie starter system doesnt mean that you should get automatically incruiser point cost must also get ajustedfrom the commentators pov id like to see more profesionalism this tournament was a big step up in that aspect because of the presence of kil2 lets be frank about this you dont want as a commentator an alliance grunt who only flies in fleets because he doesnt know all of the ships classes effects or fits  nor do you want someone who flies only 1 racethere should be a ban on personal opinions for commentators i dont think i need to give examples there has been enough typing about iti am all for for the option to concede the matchthere needs to be better advertisement i liked how fast the vids from the fights ended up on youtube in hd so mad props to ccp for thatwhatever you do mazzilliu you will never be able to stop ppl from using the fotm so whatever the general all purpose setup for the next tournament will be that is what will be fotm i think this tournament end showed how fotm played less of a crucial role most of the teams switched and adjusted setups in the last few matchescompared to the last year there were more nailbiting fights too under no circumstance ban logistics but the rule of having only 1 ship with rr was a very nice ideea 
i was pretty happy with the rules just points costs need to be adjusted  bombers cruisers faction cruisers hacs etc
i end up saying this after every tourney but they could really do some simple things to increase the information viewers get particularly now we have the hd stream and the text is readable ew icons by each target bracket showing which ships are successfully jammed  dampened  tded  webed  scrambled  nosed  neuted velocities displayed  some simple measurment of position eg distance from centre marker leave target brackets of dead ships on screen for a bit so we can see what it was that just died suddenly maybe other icons like weapons  drones  remote reps  transporters  energy xfers if it can be done without it looking too cluttered match timer and ship point counts destroyed so far  full alliance name given once on each side then get rid of the tickers by each shipthe red  blue bars were a great addition this time but for many matches they werent onthis stuff would help not only viewers but especially the commentators it was much better this time but in past tourneys it got really frustrating when theyd wonder outloud why a team had given up trying to do any damage to the other or had bad discipline cos it wasnt focusing fire when it was obvious they were all jammed or damped i dont blame the commentators they gotta talk constantly so they cant be expected to think too hard at the same time they need visual cues to whats going on and the ew icons plus ranges etc would help them pick camera targetsangles better too several of them mentioned that it was hard to get good spatial information in tournament mode ui
in a way alliance tournament slots  64 so far can be compared to a rare commodity more and more ppl join the game more and more alliances are made the alliance today is something a solo motsu lvl 4 mission runner can have personally while 2yrs ago the appearance of a new alliance was almost immediately noticedone alternative to all of this is to increase the cost of getting in which is something that i think they tried this year but still so many alliances joined that it was still close to 5050 to get in just increasing the cost next year wont solve the problem because it will just increase the problem that is the making of alt alliances and applying with all of them to get inthe only viable alternative to this is to increase the entry slots to 128 add another week to the tournament and get a few extra commentators for the coverage  offc this might also mean that the quality of commentators might go down
certain ships are used almost as by defaultt3 cruisers tengurooklogistics although the choice between a tank or a rep logistics makes it not so badthis could be lack of creativity but also a to low point cost especially for the t3 cruisers this seems to be the casebs are to expensive especially t3 active tank but this could be a general pvp balance issue between active and passive tank maelstromget rid of the commentators they are awful hardly any relevant comment is coming from themalso show more shots where we can see the relative positions of the ships to each other i know that hurricanes are awesome
the informations were too repetitive like brooke shields colgate commercial on youtubesoveregnity system  same informations several times per day both saturday and sundaysame old crap videosthe last videos were again same stuff that was already told beforethe worst part its same stuff from devblogsi dont blame the eve tv team couse its not their fault  im blaming the people who were in charge to approve the content couse they should approve more variations and dont restrict the eve tv team that much the result is it was good team with crappy content
presentthe one logistics only rule made a lot of difference they can be good but not moreship hull limit also did a world of good much more varietyfuturespatial awareness for the viewers is nonexistent as mentioned definitely something to look intomake a hard limit based on racefaction as much as the all minmatar amarr caldari teams can be fun to watch they decrease variety cap it at 3 ships from any race andor 3 faction ships
tbh there isnt much that needs to be changed about this tourney but there is a few things find some way to get extra funding for the tourney so that we can ditch the radio coverage this is 2009 and having to listen to the tourney via radio is not acceptable ads are fine or even charge people to watch a stream during the qualifiers the random entry system is total garbage if there is no other alternative then just go back to first come first served it shows the teams dedication to entry if they apply really early and any screwups that occur like mm in tourney 6 are not ccps fault to add to that point the way ccp claw changed the entry rules with only days to go is not good he failed to predict the mass withdrawals of alliances that gained entry and as a result had to create an emergency second reserve list this is another reason to ditch the random system commentators need more tools to work with some suggested being able to draw on screen i think that is a great idea points need adjusting not really t1 cruisers as this tournament is not about throwaway ships but maybe lower hac points and increase t3 cost i also think faction battleships need a points reduction ban faction ammo regardless of how much isk your team has access too faction ammo is a complete ripoff and often costs more than the ships themselves
a couple of points from memaybe have a playback option for each match in a similar fashion as guildwars has implemented into their game linkif that is totally not feasible which i doubt although it might divert ccp resources away from actually improving the game how about having a small stand alone tool that will show the positions within the arena of each ship during the match that must be some really basic 3d geometry information for each participant and there must be loads of amateur programmers who can make a good looking tool for something like this especially if there is some knowledge on what positions corresponds to what type of ship at what point in time etc this tool could be used in a small corner of the eve tv videos so that it will show current fleet positions relative to each othersomething that might make it easier to grasp whats happening have a structure close to the arena so that people can use that as reference to the actual arena the structure obviously should be outside of the arena walls though some people suggested the arena to be close to a planet but i dont think thatll improve referentialityand maybe a more finetuned point distribution list for ships ie max of 1000 with bs being UFFFD180 points instead of 18 shamelessly stolen from some other idea thread somewhere cant recall whereall in all i did enjoy the tournament and although i somehow agree with this being 2009 and eve tv would probably be a good idea to have in both qualifier rounds i did enjoy the radio commentary bear in mind though that radio commentary is very different from tv commentary and the two qualifierweekends were done through radio but with the knowledge that the matches would be shown on video too would be nice to have a proper radioamateur with knowledge of eve pvp be involved in the first two weekends and see how that worked out
the commentating was sub parin some cases it was clear the individual didnt know what they were talking aboutedit is there a reason spectators cant be allowed on grid but muted in local and with the ability to convo people blocked1000 immobile pods on a reinforced node isnt going to effect competitors in terms of lag and pods marking the play boundary would look rather cool
quoted for hilarity i have flown a logistics for a few weeks it is really silly that i get gcc when i rep people that dont have it a quick question if i rep someone that has a security status of 10 that has gcc do i get gcc then id assume yes why not just keep that mechanic you rep someone with gcc you get gcc and the same sec status hit they get its bad enough that if you fly a logistics you dont get on the killmail
i agree 
you are just to lazy to ratjust to check if someone attacks a blinky he can be rred without taking a gcc basicly allowing you to aid an outlaw against a sec pilot without a gcc need less of this noagression rr stupidity not more
massive support if you rep an outlaw you shouldnt incurr a gcc unless he currently has a gcc repping an outlaw should however work the same way as repping anyone else  agressed towards any people he is agressed to
id love to see this primarily for rp reasons but also because diversity is good and factional ships provide nice shiny toys and if made available solely through fw have the added benefit of fostering pvp
the number of characters allowed per bio is stupidly smallplease start a petition to extend the length by alotit annoys everyone who uses the bio feature when even a list of damage types and security status kos info is to long let alone any other infoshow your support by adding a post underneath say supportedwith the planned expansion into a true social eve network the use of the bio space by players will increase as they choose to add details of where they are in the cosmosthe present size restrictions will prevent players from adequately detailing how others can contact them on and in the new proposed social aspect of eve for the new connectivity via the new proposed ingamebrowser to achieve full functionality it makes sense for the first port of call for one player to see about another is the players bio where links and info can be detailed amongst other prevelent info to all places the player might wish others to go in the cosmos
people should be using the notes feature and eve mails hell even offsite forums and google searches to do that kind of crapnot biosmaking bios longer will tempt people to write shakespearean sized bios making things laggierno thanksill pass
no thanks jade const style novels in every bio is unwanted
no thx most bios suck this would make them suck so much harder
i want to be able to put in a 16 page doctorateesque background about my character and his likes and dislikes
in case you havent been playing for the last couple years ill just point out that carriers and dreadnoughts are utterly conventional ships these days if you want an unconventional ship try a destroyer
why just to have fun try out the maxed capabilities from ships and stimulatelearning pvpwhenjust a couple of weeks a year spead out in between patches so that is doesnt interfere with testing
transferablelong overdue changesall
no first of all you failed to explain why and the only reason i can think of atm  no
yescontract them all to me and for e sakefix this
among other things could boost bounty hunting career 
you really need an explanation mr mclever i think your name would suggest the opposite unless its one of thoose ironic names you know like a big 4ss mofo gorilla with the name tinyanyho yes please want this
sure the tournament is fun but honestly i would rather see another type of tourny heres the ideaget to mine 1m veldspar or something like thatget 2 teams to do itget them to use any ships they want with the current tourny ruleslet the fun begins lolso if that wasnt clear then theres 2 team in 1 huge pocket if you warp off your disqualified the first to mine and get it in a can with an ammount of 1m veld or so is the winner both team can use mining and combat ships you can shoot anyone just like the regular tourny rulesps i think that was proposed before but last year i think
it looks like team b is making a go at team as hulks team as defense fleet seems to be interceptinghmmseems interesting but tbh 1m veld is very very easy to get in a few hulks in 10mins or less
this has already been done at the fanfest afaik
as long as the two teams are allowed to shoot at each other then yeah although it still becomes a pvp tourney rather than a mining tourney the difference is a different goalinstead of just laying waste to the other teams ships your goal would be to lay waste to their miners however the opponents defense is laying waste to your ships and also going after your minerswould be a more interesting battle as you have to balance objectivesthough on second thought that would probably just become a lay waste to the opponents fighting ships battle whoever wins that destroys the opponents hulks to win faster
the point of all this is to mine the x amount of minerals not the fighting so in a way the goal of this tourny is to mine and protectnothing else you could destroy everything in team a but if you dont have a mining ship leftyou lost like in a tourny if you lost your ship your doneand yes that would be interesting tourny lol
indeed and it wasnt much fun to watch as you had no idea until it was over who actually won as you couldnt tell who had got the most minerals also with ships warping in and out constantly it was hopeless to follow
except that a tourney that only mines x amount of minerals and no interaction of with the other teams like blowing their ships out of the water would be vastly boring to watch pretty boring to participate and is already decided at the beginning based on the characters skill levels save for minor differences based on the fits of the hulks
right now on your api keys page you have 7 days worth of logs available to you where you can see what page of the api was accessed using your key what ip address accessed it when what time etcits a great feature for finding out if your api information is being misused but its kind of ridiculous that this option isnt available in your account management as well such account logs should log the following eventstype of login ingame websitesuccess or failure of loginpassword reset attemptsuccessful password resetand include the following information for these eventsdatetimeip addressthe logs should show more then just one week of activity though it should show as much as technical limitations can allow to prevent the servers from putting forth unnecessary effort people should be required to click to go to the next page if they want to see more then a few days of activityi think if players are given more tools to control the security of their own accounts they are less likely to get their accounts hijacked
i dont see how it can helpif your account got hijacked the first thing their gonna do is change the password locking you out offc if you owned it from the start your gonna get it back but do you honestly think they would do such a thing without using a proxy the only way this could help is if your managing accountsharing and that is prohibited by the eula  so i am left to wonder why would a csm from a large spaceholding alliance with maybe close to 20 titans would ask for this in the eve of the titan change that will make it viable as an anticapital weapon 
its all a csm conspiracy so that i can pass issues that somehow mysteriously give me a huge advantage over you
basically everything else in the world does this already
good suggestion i approve of this i would be interested in this information myself
a log of who tries to log into the account when could be a good security measure  give you a hint of whether someone is trying to guess at your password logs of successful password changes seems a bit pointless as a security feature though if the password has been changed youve already lost i wont comment on possible nefarious goals for this change but a loginattempt log seems a good idea
anything that gives a possibility of not getting to that point where they hijack your account is a step forward such a log would alert you if your account name has been compromisedi also asked ccp in iceland to let us change our account names right now there are no gm tools to do that
also rss
at first i was going to say that is going a bit overboard but now that i think about it that is an excellent addition to this proposal
please
sweet new graphics fast warp speed no fittings
hi everyoneattribute implants are a barrier to pvp for many pilots out there particularly noobies for whom an implant set makes a significant difference to their training time and for whom losing out on skillpoints is particularly painfulin light of this i would like your feedback on the following proposal give everyone 5 to all attributes remove attribute implants from the game but keep utility implants improve the selection of combatindustry implants keep them in high demandinstead of forcing players to choose between higher attributes and more pvp fun let them risk utility implants which can be just as expensive to lose but does not force them to lose skillpointsthe end result is more pvp and more fun but retains the riskreward ethos particularly for noobies for whom every sp countsthoughts
idea so dumb i dont even need a reason to say no
while i agree that attribute implants are just as fail as learning skills this would be the wrong way we have jump clones already only problem is that you need to wait 24 hours to hop between them probably to prevent jumping all over the universe in secondsso the real problem is in the jump clones timer in my opinion a solution might be to allow jumping from one clone to another without restriction but only if the jump clone target is in the same station as your current clone
thanks for your input gthe more time spent without those 345 budget willing the harder it is to train if a pilot wants a career as a pirate and what noobie doesnt jumping to an unpluggedclone means taking a skillpoint hit which for new players is doubly painfulforcing players to choose between more skillpoints or more fun is silly and can be easily resolved with some better game design the end result will be more pvp more fun  still forcing pilots to put their chips on the table when it comes to combat
this is more or less the same argument ive heard to get rid of learning skills it didnt move me then and it doesnt move me noweve is at its heart a game of choices you make your choice and you take the consequences oddly i dont see hordes of people avoiding faction war and pirating because of implants
no
i pvp for about 3 years in eve and until today i lost about 6 3 implants if you are restrained on pvp because of such small isk values then you are not going to pvp anyway because ship losses usually are 2 order of magnitude larger than implant lossesjust be smart and have 1 jc for each 2 atrribute combination using 3 implants
id be dead against this were it not for the fact that implant loss tends to be inflicted by lag more than anything else the sole other cause being bubbles in lieu of a better solution i find this proposal quite reasonable besides anything that removes a dissuading factor for those considering pvp or contemplating braving the hazards of sub 05 sec for the first time is worth more than the blatant disregard shown so far
you dont see them because theyre in highsec running missions until they grow bored after 37 months and quit
wait you want to take away the 5 implants i spent all that isk on and give everyone the 5really
i think it would be a good idea to just have faction police in empire instead of concord or all together get rid of superresponsive npcs that magically probe out offenders within secondsthis would fixninja salvager whines  you could shoot themthis guy is hiding in an npc corp whines  you could shoot themhisec macro miners whines  you could shoot themwardecs are broken whines  you could shoot themlowsec is dead whines  carebears no longer safe in hisec would prefer lowsec or 00 for better rewardssolo pvp is dead whines  more people would be in lowsec or 00 doing pve activity or hunting pve pilotstldr whines  you could shoot them if we got rid of concordedit more fixes
but everybody else would whine
but everybody else would whineonly the highsec missionrunners or miners who already whine whenever one of their ships blow up because they did something stupid ie engaged a loot thief or ore thief i have never seen a my ship got violenced thread where the victim had a decent pvp fit and where they were aware of the incoming enemys approach until several minutes after said enemy has landed in their mission pocket or flipped their jet can those of us who know the least little bit about pvp mechanics know that you can see incoming ships on the dscan well before they land and that you can see probes on scan well before the probing ship is able to warp to you the people you mention that would be potential whiners would be forced to learn how to fit their ships properly just like everyone else watch their directional scanner for probes just like everyone else and not fly more than they can afford to lose just like everyone else
op translation make all of high sec into low secso how do we get rid of the why cant i shoot them here whines
why cant i shoot them here whines do not just come from egostroking pvp enthusiasts how many ninja salvager whine threads have you seen where the op of said thread advocates being allowed to shoot at the ninja salvager for stealing his salvage that he worked to create how many gank whine threads have you seen where the op of said thread wishes he could get back at the guy but cant cos the guy stays docked up during his 15 minute gccafter which the op cant touch him the way you get rid of the why cant i shoot them here whines is to allow everyone to be shot everywhere
i meant your whinehigh sec was designed for a reason and it wont be changed it may get rid of the whines you post but it will also cancel many many many accounts from ccps user base destroy empire trade and make much of the game nonfunctional based on said destruction of empire trade and the resulting vast increase in prices and loss of ability for goods to move to needed areas
seriously are we having this whine again your argument basically boils down to you dont play the game the way i want you to so ccp should change the game and force you toquit being so selfcentered
go to a lowsec or 00 system open the market are there things for sale are there some things for sale in such quantities that an industrial or a freighter must have logically been used to bring them there do market hubs exist in these areas if so then your argument is invalid im not whining about wanting to shoot people i am a carebear but if eve is supposed to be a cold harsh place why am i so safei dont recall making an argument maam all ive said is a proposal get rid of concord and what it would fix
i agreeeditit wouldnt affect me as i live in low sec so why not
seriouslyyou op must be totally out of your fraking mindwhile your at it lets make the whole damn game 00 and say screw it to industrythink before you postseriously
your alliance is a 00 alliance  you live in providence do you believe that industry does not occur in 00
firstly we are not cvasecondly were friendly to cvathat dosent mean we operate exclusivly theregoes to show how very little you really know and how frequent you assumelike it or not high secconcord is here to stayindustry requires high sec regardless of affiliationeveryone knows all super alliances have alts that work herewhered you come from a black hole
theres been tons and tons of different proposals to increase account security to prevent accounts from being hijacked but what about this very simple solution a confirmation email to change your password its done in practically everything i can think of so i dont see it being an issue to implementnow theres the chance of the thief changing your email well a workaround would be to send a confirmation email to your old email account first if your old email was deactivated thus your need to change it make the site take your payment information to verify that you are in fact the true ownerwhile i realize that keyloggers will probably snag email passwords and that sort of thing it would reduce the amount of hijacked accounts considerably regardless theres plenty of phishing sites out there that look like an eve login page plus the isk selling sites that actually steal your password but it would at least add some sort of security layer of course it would be helpful to have different passwords for email and eve but thats just common sense
dont we already have confirmation emails to reset our passwordsim pretty sure we do and thats a security liability not a benefit
if you get banned from sisi you get a permaban if the offense is serious enough extend the ban to a two week ban from tq as well i support this as long as theres no permabans on tq thats just too muchthe climate on sisi is rapidly deteriorating to a state thats closing on impossible to test anything there needs to be harscher punishments in order to stave this stupidity off i dont agree with the above poster that less people will be on sisi or less people will go due to the risks of a ban sensible people will still go because they will adhere to the rules and subsequently not get banned
real world comparison i go to a paintball event and proceed to backstab my team by dishing out headshots when their backs are turned  get promptly booted from event i leave the paintball facility and is picked up by the police and thrown in jaildoesnt sound even remotely fair nor justa permanent sisi ban be it account or ip based is severe enough it is a privilege to use the server and there are rules attached as those rules do not apply in tq there should be no bleed through whatsoever
as much as i can concur with the large number of scumbags in sisi this isnt going to fly wellits really a different world out there as opposed to tqthe only way id support this is if its a repeat offense ignoring a gm should have a major impact as far as examples but not even on the firstsecond or third strikes reallynot supported because its a bit too prejudicial
this would work normally except for the fact that goons have lots of alts to keep on keeping on no matter how many get banned and it pretty much seems that the people that keep pulling this  over and over are doing it to expressly troll sisi if ccp handed out some two week bans on tq over it i think really qwuickly youd see this  come to a full stop supported
it would need to be in extremely blatant cases of rule violationssomeone that ganks a player or two on sisi should get a ban from sisi but not one on tqsomeone that gets a group of players to place bubbles at the fdmlj gate in pf346 or any gate on the way to fdmlj and then proceeds to kill everything that enters even as players tell them they are breaking the rules deserve at most a 12 week ban from tqthey know exactly what they are doing and they cant accidentally drop bubbles and accidentally shoot everything that entersa developer has to take the time to investigate the claims the more time they waste banning trouble makers from sisi the less time they have to actually make eve if the penalty is upped to tq bans even if temporary players that go to the sisi server for lulz might wise up once they know being a jerktard can result in a tq ban too
and extend the forum bans to the server too
yes there would be less credible people on sisi youve had at least two people on the forums post as much and were not even a good sampling of the player baseif the devs or gms really thought there was a testing problem on sisi then the first step would be to have people apply for the privilege to test on sisi just as players would apply for a beta test for a new game thats all that sisi is really is beta testing treat it like thatif a player doesnt follow the rules of beta testing in any system he is kicked out of the beta testing and allowed back later as a paying customer i cant see any customer being banned from beta testing and paying for the game based on something he did that broke the beta testing rules save for maybe hacking or very severe insults and swearing at the gmsdevs i cant see it happening in eve either
so when one target pops the gun will automatically start targeting the next seems a reasonable response to the fact that pos guns only get one target that said it could get ugly with one player controlling multiple batteries with different targeting queues  i dont know how often that comes up but it could be ugly for the ui when it does still i can support this in principle
what you want is called pos gunner learn starbase defense mgmtherschel i think what he wants is kind of a different ui for pos gunning not so much a new feature but i think the current pos gunnery ui is fine
the fifteen minute block on login is s for someone that has a legitimate bad connection how about thisa ship that disconnects in any way should1 be scrammable and not ignore scrams as they sometimes do when logoffski during gatecloak2 not disappear from space if they are agressed ie you are being scrammed or shot at3 warp to a safespot 1 mil km away and nowhere else regardless of amounts of loginlogouts and always warp back to the exact same spot they left if you log back in even if you instantly log out again you simply land in your original location and then the game initiates a new emergency warp with align and all that jazzthis would lead to that a logoffski that is agressed is screwed regardless a logoffski that does get away has no way of warping to several spots a logffski that logs off and on and off in order to make a new warp will find himself back at the origin point pirates or whatever before doing another align and warpthat would solve it for logoffskis without hurting people that legitimately disconnect or log off in space for the end of a gaming sessionthoughtsalso thread necro
agreedfix logoffski we want play with real pvp game not tricky exploit game where someone know trick that is uncatchable
sounds like a valid problem to me
im guessing youre implying that jump bridges will not be implemented with the new sov systemnobody knows this for sure at the moment since ccp have not yet released details on exactly what kind of upgrades one can do to systems a skilled jf pilot can jump that ship 1125 ly at least i would suggest that its more than enoughif 11 ly is not enough for you i suggest you bring 2x guardiansbasilisk at the end cyno point and have the next cyno up already
ease of logistics with jumpbridges for capitals makes it easier for alliances to keep huge swathes of spacewith the new system the places with bad connectivity to the rest of eve and far away from the rest might be left alone by the big powers and settled by othersso jf or any other logistics tool doesnt really need to be made easier
this has nothing to do with jumpbridges but more the viability of the end systems for alliances to takeassume you take a constelation in the backest region of period basis there is no way to jump there from lowsec in 1 go so that space will only be usable by someone with a nap with the people owning querious systems since you need a midpoint or 2
yes because its not actually possible to jump combat ships and jfs to the same cyno and therefore you cannot possibly run a combatready convoy through enemyheld space as such we need to make jump logistics fallingdown easy in order to prevent there being any possibility whatsoever of logistics being difficult or dangerous wtf no
not supported deep space was viable and used before jump frieghters and jump bridges both of these innovations have become crutches learn to walk fly again
do you even fly a jump freighter are you even qualified to talk about such thingstake a walk before you embarrass yourselfps oh and i can fly one youd be surprised just how far one can fly thank you very much i suggest you do your homework before you start yelling the sky is falling amirightkthxbaieven at 10 lys you can reach fantastic distances i never thought possibledid you know that rens and jita are within in that 10 ly range even tho concord wont let me do that its just a rough idea of how small our world really ishell i could hit 00 from the edges of high sec you seriously have no bloody idea what your speaking of even at a minimum of 2 jumps i can go anywhere i want for the most part within reason of course
i could be wong but i think it was possible years ago to remotly stack stuff you had in others region i think it should be possible again or possibleit would be server load friendly as i bet im not the only one who have assets in trapped space which show as 1705 items but if you remove all the  1x1mn afterburner1x1mn afterburner1x2mn afterburner1x5mn afterburnerin a 9x1mn afterburnerwould much easier for everybody to manage
how about a saftey in numbersdefensive only aproachfor instance make them so only one can be fitted per ship and only on mining vessels this way only miners can use them make them high dps with bad tanks make them with disruptor so gank pilots might count them as high priority targets make them defensive only so they only fire if they or their flock are fired upon make them intelligent so they point seperate unprovoked aggresors to the maximum range possible but concentrate fire one by one starting with tackling vessels basically make them buy the miner enough time to escape and nothing else
another aproach to feilding them could be to let mining vessels hold as many of these bulky contraptions as they can carry but still only allow them to field 1 per vessel at a time because other wise people would just hit them once and send them scurrying off through heavilly camped space give them a cargo vs saftey decission to make
i would support the general idea as it brings more people to lowsec which is always goodthe downside is i believe it will be hard to balance to little effect and it will be a useless item too strong it will convert lowsec into a fortress citing someone from earlier in the threadi also see different needs for 00 keep a 30 hac sniper gang busy and empirenear lowsec 12 lonely bcs piratingas others have stated pos guns take forever to target and can be tanked a sniper gang can easily kill some hulks before the need to warp outsummarygood idea but the implementation is flawed back to the drawingboard with something easier to balance and you will have my support
its not a ed suggestion its actually pretty reasonable the only problem i see with it is that its easily exploitable anchor 5 guns in a low sec belt fly around and bait a few pirates in an easy target ship and then warp to the belt the pirates land in the middle of hell and gets blown to bits in a big lulz in localits a very good suggestion but im not so sure about its actual implementation
defensive only no need to hit snipers just the furthest tackler if you are in a hostile fleet that warps in an attacks but you decide not to fire the guns should not attack you even if their owners decide to as long as you dont draw first blood as far as tracking just say it was donated by concord since the guns follow their ideals so closely this idea gives miners time if a gang comes in miners warp out it also would beef up security enough that a small defensive fleet which is ussually what there is to protect miners because the rest of them left their pvp ships to fly hulks would change it from purley escape oriented to you messed with the wrong miners with the addition of a ecm boat or a well tanked bs or son logistics ships for the guns longevity but still defencive only
no objections its already availible in the account management page having it on login gives you a constant update and can prevent the dreaded account disabled punch in your face when you are eager to play
this is starting to come up weekly and as always noyou get a 100 training bonus be happy with it or go back to wow
this can already be done its calledbuying a character with isk
wotlol erm no
a straight purchase of skills does not fit into eve as a game but a leasing scheme does ie ccp scamwant to try out that cool fittingship but still a month or more off isk not an issuelease the skills needed for a week at a hefty price to try it on before spending the time to train itlimit it to two skill level at any one time with rank acting as a multiplier on cost to prevent people using it for titan lvl5 time is isk if you can save time by not training what turns out crap for you you have saved isk
i agree though there are counters for station huggersoh and for the record most of us know the game so be a bit constructive
edit ignore this post look below for actual wikis
yep
this proposal is not meant for inside the heat of the battle but rather outside however having the ability to cycle drones by adding repair speed while in triage and making it a viable option to repair in battle would be interestingthis would be very nice however i am not sure if this would be possible but that is up to ccp as alwayswith the upcoming changes it might be a good idea since triage will be removed from ms and i think triage should open the option for active usage of this in battle however it should not rival the triage repair rate
cant believe im actually agreeing with a privateeri support the concept and i think i have a thoery on how it could be coded post to appear soongood stuff pb
this looks like an opportunity to say tallywackers
drop the time maybe 1 minthe timer still doesnt force people to formulate a post for that time we still see pointless threadslet the people who need to discuss something on the forums get to it thats what theyre for right
its just like the onboard scannerthey fix a problem and try not to harm their users but they still manage to annoy the hell out of the regular suscribers 05 or 1 second should be enough for the onboard scanner 2 minutes should be long enough before posting againdo you realize how long it takes now to support 34 topics a day in the assembly hall and bid on 45 auctions in the sell orders
yeah im personally very unhappy with this five minute delay
in total almost a goddamn hour the minor consolation is that it is only temporary while they work on a more permanent solution to keylog spam posters hopefully it will be tomorrow
decrease the timer if need be but no captcha its annoying stupid annoying and especially either useless or unusableeither the image is so easy to read that even mediocre ocr programs can read it or its so complicated it takes three tries to get through it
yes please fix the delay on the forumsas far as your scanner i wish theyd bump the delay up to 15 secs lag is bad ok
since the 5 min forum timer was implementedfrequency of stupid posts has droppedfrequency of keylogger posts has droppedfrequency of caod crap has droppedfrequency of trollingflamingtrash talking had droppedfrequency of grammarspelling errors and edits has droppedwith all this in mind you actually want to remove the 5 min delay why
this
i support recaptcha
because it takes ages to reply to topics a lot of the times a post is ready to be posted and is just left in a tab waiting for the timer to disappeartheres idiots and there always will be but it hurts a lot of posters such as myself that goes through forums in waves and view 20 topics at once then leave for a whileyoure telling me i should sit and think about if i really want to check a box that says support for 5 minutes change the timer to apply only to creating topics problem solved
remove the damned timer its really really gay when your trying to reply to multiple threads at once
supported reduce timer or apply it to creating topics its ridiculous that i have to wait when i quickly browse through forums want ot reply have to wait 5 minutes then forget about it all together
i hope youre not the one representing this on the next csm meeting wtf at not knowing how to narrow targets down and recommending to use scanner probes instead how did you get in there anywayedit oh and bump
i agree this delay isnt that great also ever since the update ive been getting directional scans that take upwards of 5 minutes i dont want to say theyre related but im assuming they areplease remove or significantly shorten the timer
please oh god please give us back a scanner that we can actually use   this change has made my experience of the game about 10x more frustrating and pretty much wrecks a good scouts ability to give accurate reports or find hostiles with any reasonable speed
i would like to say this change stinks and id like my old dscanner back
supported ccp need to reverse this
no support for this keep the timerall of the pirates and griefers hard to feel sorry for ya so until this changesi have a whole 2 seconds more to try and align and warp a barge
good ideas
i am sorry that somebody broke the law and outed a ccp dev still employed by ccp by the way who decided that he wanted to rig things in favor of his alliance i am sorry that ccps favorite alliance got disbanded that is no excuse for going on a witchhunt against anyone associated with the guy who pointed out ccps corruption
and yet again isd people might be involved in yet another shady business
end ccp
i would like some answers from ccp as to why they believe they can use their third party connections to breach users confidentiality
this department likely doesnt even exists anymore
not supported the i is for internal
yeah and they dont need customers at all  oh waitif this is true  considering who it came from i suspect that it has good chances to be true this is bigger than t20t20 may have broken some rules of the game but it was all about pixels who belong to ccp in the end anywayps if shc did remove this than ccp did a good thing hiring caldown for 3040k   year they just bought the fidelity of the biggest fan forum
here it comes again the whinetearful lynch mobas its been stated before the i is for internal people we have no business assuming anythingand thats all this damn proposal is a big fat assumptionwhile i think the gms need adjustments i dont need to know what they had for lunch
dear ccp alt pitch and fork is what gets results every business owner wants to save face and continue to have the trust of the buyers it worked for t20 it worked for the rattler incident and will continue to work
if i worked for ccp youd find yourself banned for any number of reasons i could think ofoh wait i donti guess that makes your little assumption a bit stupid
thisthe article given is an example of isd and bh who are players who volunteer for these positions and not official ccp employees so give that a thoughtt20 was a massive screw up an ccp knew it something like this have never happened after that internally
want an explanation from ccp ginger of this
cough lark cough
whats thats supposed to meanonly a few hours passed between when he did it and he got caught
so your ccp who 
that would explain how drake manages to post in every assembly hall thread seemingly 24 hours a day
club
support change of ugly floating space scrap into something that actually looks like a structure
in addition to the fleet invite notification what about with chat invites as well
i just had an idea that would seriously improve the immersion aspect of eve soundbinaural soundwouldnt it be awesome to tell where a nearby ships is in relation to you just by hearing it if the effect gets disorienting allow it to be turned off or use speakers instead of headphonesif you dont know what it is heres an example
a few questions with that besides the technical difficulties since binaural sound is processed at recording time usually1 would the sound be oriented with regards to your ship or your camera 2 is 3d sound really that important in eve its not nearly as much of a positioning game as an fps game3 will this actually benefit once you get into fights with more than a few pilots currently all ships sound more or less or exactly the same hard to distinguish
on your second question i think directional sound based on your camera position not your ship position can be very usefull especially given the omnidirectional nature of eve combat if you could hear a distict sound for each module type aswell as being able to tell where it comes from then you could gain a serious edge in combat by memorizing those sounds and thus knowing exactly what ships are using which modules
additional clarification your eyes are hyperfocussed especially compared to your ears which are extremely good at pinpointing the exact location of a sounds origin if eves soundsystem could accurately make use of this itd be a very big gain tactically aswell as emersionwise
dierdra that is a very good idea i would also have to agree that it should be relative to the cameras position and direction it would allow everyone to easily become immersed in the gameon a slightly related note i want my hair back maybe i should get a hold of youtube about that
really would love this
liang nuren  i respond to posters in kind so far all ive interpreted from your responses have been narrowminded arguments with little or no constructive content try harder if you expect anything more than flamesrapid fire responses next timeas i mentioned to someone else the changes to t2 ammo are a band aid theres a major issue with the current design and implementation of t2 ammo due mainly to availability of faction these changes more or less bring the ammo types in line with conflag you talk about kiss however somehow you want the ccp to totally rebalance implement database mods for dozens if not hundreds of turrets and then qa every minmatar ship effected by your broadsweeping changes during a major expansion for instance tachyeonsbeams have roughly the same fitting costs as 1400mms hence my point on the paladin it has the grid to fit its turrets properly mainly due to the fact that there isnt a massive difference in fitting costs between short and long range youd actually have a better argument for increasing the power grid on autocannons tbh because thats the root cause of this issue unless you want to do something idiotic like changing the fitting requirements of artillery or autocannons and thus rebalancing and qa of a whole bunch of ships  a second role bonus that brings the varugurs fittings capabilities in line with the other marauders will not break eve oknot in the same way a navy raven totally invalidates a raven right like i said on the target painter bonus feel free to come up with something unique but in line with other tier 2 tech 1 battleships we also considered shield and armour remote repair and cap use range bonuses however they just through the ship way out of kelter in comparison to the othersin terms of dps as i mentioned in the op the ships likely fitting is considered when measuring the dps an armour tanking tempest will rarely have 3 damage mods for instance where as 3 would be standard on a shield tanker the actual max dps figures are lower but combined with ac range 200ms mwd speed and spare drones it provides an alternative to the standard can it rr xcan it snipe xcan it tank xcan it gank xcan it solo x top trumps archetype whilst still being in line with the others in its class merely making the tempest competitive in one or more of those standard areas would simply displace its racial peers or spur on a gallente or caldari boost bandwangon next season on rr performance specifically the fitting requirements of large remote shield boosters are the principle reason why no one does it turtle style anyway shield logistics are very common but as were not really wanting to boost rr atm im going to let it slideon acs becoming blasterlasers falloff is a ty mechanic to balance battleship turrets around we agree on this yet you insist on using it still because of racial flavor suit yourself i get the desire to have a tactile difference between firing one set of turrets and acs however until game mechanics change theres very little to work with optimal increase is not only the path of least resistance its probably more balanced ponders a vargur with 90110km falloff with rigs after astrophobics fix is implementedlike i mentioned earlier i believe ive not only offered suggestions that follow the path of least resistance provided the fixes where they are needed ie i do not believe thrasherssabresclaws need 50 more alpha tyvm but i also believe ive tried ive considered the effects of these changes in context atheistofdoomi think its better than a double damage bonus where one damage bonus would do tbfh although i would like to here you suggestion
pattern there are three whole posts worth of comments on flaws in your proposal how about you stop evading the questions and answer themliang
well argumentedbehind the charts and numbers i can tell you some of the things from fleet fights i fly often tempestmaelstrom1 tempests primaried allways  not becouse of the damage they can put over time but becouse of the tank2 tempest on papercharts looks greatbut wondering why people are switching to amarrfirstlygallentecaldary turret ships instead using minmatar in the fleet battles it must be becouse not in the order of importance tank damage rof yep theres an verry important variable in a fleet fightand not becouse the cap variable
resubmitting because thisshould not be the minmatar fix
all the time before iceland leads up to iceland and what is done in those few days is the culmination of all the csms work during that term till thenthere are more online csmccp meetings afterwards but they arent face to face the first iceland trip is really the most important time in the csm by far
this just reeks of potential abuse of favoritism by ccp dont we have enough of that tinfoil long term csm members will form natural friendships or more between players and ccp and that always ends bad as larkonis noobler has show us it doesnt take much for a csm member to go fck csm and flat out cheat for personal gainsalso you will have people voting for the same people without really looking at the other candidates or performancelastly new blood is always good for any organization fresh ideas fresh viewpoints and new perspectives are good good corporations and alliances are always recruiting the best pilots and the csm should always be doing the same electing 4 of the same people will put the csm in a rutif this is about poor issler well thems the breaks im pretty sure issler could have turned down the position and then saved the full term for laterno
hell ing no
makes sense it would help in all engagements whether it be pvp or pve
so i recently did an analysis for a different postit shows that the best 25 ships in game are all minmatar and gallente except for 2 which were amarrthe best caldari ship was the drake at position 26the data analysied was the combat records of the best 95 players in evefrom battle clinic i got the stats on the ships they have flown for the last year so 95 man years of pvp datai grouped all the kills and losses for each ship type then worked out 2 parameterseffectiveness and popularityeffectiveness was a percentage based indicator of kills versus lossesthe equation was 100killskillslosses1the 1 was in the equation to prevent divide by zero on ships with small sample sizes and to prevent them getting 100 with only a few killspopularity was how often a ship was flown in combat compared to its class counterpartsthe ships were sorted into groups  frig1  frig2  hac1  hac2  bc1  etc each group had 4 ships in itequation  100   kills  losses    group kills  group losses effectiveness tends to favour tanky ships or ships that can run awaypopularity tends to favour ships that can get killsto get a final score for each ship i added the paramaters together and divided by 2this gives each ship a score out of 100the ships were then sorted by score to see which are the best ships in game taking into account there class
link to spreadsheets
im going to assume youre trolling since you dont show any kind of valuable proof whatsoeveralso i lold at exequror being 8 and nyx being first is pretty funny310
found your problem
ccp need to seriously reevaluate how they approach balacing caldari most of the ships in alliance tourney were caldari caldari can rat faster then any race while their ships allow 2 month noobs to tank lvl4 missions caldari space is overcrowded ccps solution add more agents make caldari even more attractiveso caldari get better and better have more and more content added while due to the large volume of players in caldari any nerfs are met with large volumes of complaintsthe solution to the caldari problem isnot more agentsnot more stationsnot better shipsnot better ecm
you also left out the fact that there are human people flying those ships a good majority of them who are idiotsfailfits including the guy who thinks this proposal is worth a damnwhile i agree that buffing caldari is a bit of an obvious overtone this is not the best argument for itsure as hell shouldnt be weighed by pvping statistical crapi mean thats like saying everyone flys drakes even if i fail fit itduh
so i think we should all just give up and buy nyxs because theyre the bestest
oh god nerf teh exequereroroer
the dataset will be published tonightit was 5am in the morning by the time i had finished compiling and analyzing the dataill linky the sheet to evefiles when i get home tonightthe kill and loss stats were from the top 95 players on the bc killboardyou dont get on there without being at least competent at pvpthats exactly why this dataset is relevant to the argument it shows the ships being flown by the best pvprs in eve and it shows how effective they are when flying those shipsyeah its the best tier i cruiser  not saying its the best ship in gamean analysis has to take into account cost of ships theres no point comparing a hac directly to a frig for instance that wouldnt show much of interest
tourney pvp is not tranquility pvpyou cant leave the arena without being exploded by a gmthis gives 2 advantages to caldari that arnt present on tqdamage at range  better tanks through lack of needing to fit tackle in mids
exequror  all cruisers bar the scimitar
your methodology bears no resemblance to any sort of realistic pvp ranking and as such i hope youll pardon me if i regard your conclusions as not being worth the paper theyre written on
youve put a lot of effort into this but really when youre trolling you need to be more convincing sort out the positions of the celestis and ferox for a start and its a bit obvious to place most of the supercapitals right at the bottom apart from gallente ones which are right at the tophang on nerf gallente
oh is that so so we should all bend over and worship these 95 peoplethese 95 people are gods of eve nowshould i start kissing there s so i can get what i want in this gameyou are really something if you think thats going to help your casein case you forget poindexter not everyone in this game are pvpersand statistics can be made to say anything to anyone at any timedont bother wasting your time on such fruitless ventures
yeah the supercapital results have to be taken with a pinch of salt even with 95 years worth of pvp data the supercapitals dont have a very big sample sizebut i did not want to jiggy with the raw data  so they are in atmi cant jiggle the positions of the ships either  it would become apparent that i cheated if i did that the raw data killslosses is in the sheet  so the data is fully validatable by anyone who want to go to bc and total up the kills losses for each player this i did btw by copy  paste into the spreadsheet and then sorting and using a sheet function to count the totals  so there shouldnt be any misscounts in the datai did take out the t3 as there wasnt a full years data for those yeti also had to take out the faction ships as there group size was so much bigger than the t1t2i will publish the full list  inc t3 and faction  in the other thread though that is not so much concerned with balance between the primary races
yes you can get on there without being competent battleclinic does not have all information unless the player in question has their api linked to it this will be in many cases not so and the player will only post their killmails and not lossmails giving a distorted view of these statistics not keeping into account that killmails can oh so easily be fakedrating the skill of a player in pvp by kills and losses against kills and losses in a group does not give a real picture because it does not show the situation in which the battle happenedalso the statistics are based on player performance and preference and not on what can actually be done with the ships in questionthese statistic are therefore just numbers and can not be used to support your proposalonto your proposal itself caldari ships are good when properly utilized they can provide a stable amount of damage from amazing ranges provide ecm warfare provide the best sniping platforms and tank if needed caldari however can not easily provide tackling support and high damagethis means that caldari are specialized and so are the other races but they are less noticeable and i bet you can figure that out on your own so i dont have to name themboosting amarr no they are the most popular ships atm and they are good at what they do
the kb will consider mails from every api and post it haswhenever a player gets a loss mail another player get the kill maili do not know if the players do as you insinuate  it does not matterconsidering the size of the dataset 130000 kill iirc its unreasonable to assume that fake posts or non posting of kms would show a bias towards any races shipsif anything random not linkage of mails of fake posts would tend to flatten out the race bias in the data as the fake posts or non linkages would apply to all races more or less equallythe dataset is 95 years worth of pvp data it refelects the proportion of fleetroamgankagesolo that happens in eve this is good because it reflect the overall ability of a ship in anyall circumstances rather than rellying on seperate interpretations of  soloroamfleetgankage  which could introduce biasalso the statistics are based on player performance and preference and not on what can actually be done with the ships in questionyespvp players prefer ships that are good at pvp  preference is a proxy for ship capabilityplayer performance in each ship in question is also a proxy for ship capabilitystatistics are goodmany people go this ship is bad that ship is bad and offer no evidence at allthey can and will be used to support my proposalsamarr have some good ships yes they need less of a boost than caldarithe statistics clearly show minmatar and gallente to be way out in front when it comes to pvp
im getting slightly worried that the op is serious and isnt trollingseriously you have a list that tells you that supercaps are the worst ships in game except for the gallente ones which are somehow the best this and the position of the ferox exequeror wolf jaguar vigil and many many more tells you that your list is nonsense you stayed up to 5am producing statistical noise
i have always said we need to narf exequror as first priority
dont wait up  the sheet wont be up till 1ambut please take a look when its up and you can tell me if im madi had no idea what it would show when i started it
lol at navitas gallente mining frigate being better than omen or maller or even paladin for that matter
the navitas is a decent mining frigatethe omen and maller are woefully bad cruisersthats why navitas gets a better score than omen  mallerthere no point compareing across ship classes that would allways show bscruiserfrig
i thought that list were showing pvp rating of shipsnavitas has 4615 rating while tormentor amarr mining frigate which is just as good only gets 385 ratingbantam has 3205 rating while burst has 1769 ratingburst has 140 cpu while other 3 ships have 150 and can fit 2 t2 minerstormentor also has 3 low slots for cargo expanders while bantam and navitas have 2 and burst only has 1in my opinion that makes tormentor the best mining frigate and burst the worstif this list is not about mining aspect of these ships i would still have have hard time believing that navitas is that good for pcp activities
dont get too hung up on individual ships and what you think it might showthis is primarilly pvp data  so mining frigs which arnt really upto pvp are gonna be a bit spurious capsules  indis  shuttle were removed from the data as non pvp ships  i supposed i could have removed the tier 1 frigs as well but then where do you draw the line the thing that concerns me is that most of the best ships in class are gallentemini

somethings been bothering me about your sample selectiona nd i finally figured out what it isyour popularity rating  im not sure what your assumptions were when looking at popularity but im not sure they lend themselves to an objective analysis popularity is a woefully bad measure of objective data because it takes into account a human factor that cannot be factored out of the equationfor example you may assume that people always fly the best ship for whatever role they were trying to fill but this may not be true they may have been flying a particular ship because thats what they hand on hand or because thats the only ship of that classtype they can flypopularity also skews your kills to losses ration for the simple reason that a more popular ship has a larger chance of getting lost which skew its effectiveness downwardsid be curious to see the raw effectiveness data as compared to the raw popularity data because if your sampling is correct there should be a direct relation between the two again assuming your original human factor assumptions were correct my guess is however that there wont be because of the reasons i laid out above to whit people dont always fly the most effective ship for whatever reason
tldr  your statistics are full of crapthats easier xbut yes shes right your basing this on popularity is utter foolishness at besteveryone flys whatever the hell they want to fly its not going to be what you assume it to be
popularity and effectivness are explained in the opprobably not very well  ill try to improve the op a bit later when i have more timeeffectiveness is kills  losses  more popular ships will get killed more often they will also get more killseffectiveness is a ratio so it improves in quality the more a ship is flownthere is a 1 term in the equation which prevents ships with small sample sizes from getting 100 with only a few killspopularity is how often a ship is flown in combat  kills  losses  divided by how often the ship class is flown in combatthis shows the preference of players for a ship in its classi think effectiveness is important because it shows us how good a ship is when in the hands of a good pvprpopularity is also important effectiveness on its own only tells half the story  some ships may be survivable  tough or quick  but of lesser value on the battlefieldpopularity clearly indicates which ships the sample group of players consider to be the best shipsconsidering the group size of 95 if eve was a balanced game then the preference for one races ships over another would be equal to within a few percentthis is clearly not the caseas i cant be seen to show favour for one method or the other i have weighted them equally in the rank score attributethe data is now up on evefiles and linkied in the first replyi use open office spread sheet but have saved versions for excel 97 from ooi have included the raw data as it was copy and pasted from the known ships pages of bcraw data 2 removes all the spurious clutter from the web page and shows the method used to total up the kills  losses for each shipraw data 3 is the totaled up data before any analysis
current situation it is difficult to conduct bombing runs or coordinate group movements with cloaked ships they will constantly decloak each other if you try to move them togetherproposed solution if youre cloaked in gangfleet with another cloaked ship you cant decloak them nor can they decloak you pros because there is no way to know where your fleetmates are when cloaked you cant avoid coming too close to them this solution solves that problemcons cloaked gangs will become deadlier by not accidently revealing each other
no absolutely not
feels good man
gwhgdffgsrhwhselling t shirt
either that or make them visible to fleet members but it is deffo messed up the way it is
i thought cloaked ships didnt decloak eachother was this changed
it wont really make cloaking gangs that much deadiergood idea i support it
this is dumb no
ive confirmed that cloaked ships can decloak each other
omg im agreeing with a goon what nextgood thing other goons disagree from that i take comfort
makes sense to me especially given that stealth bombers are now usable and are really a ship that wants to operate with several of them in close proximity
just because it sounds about the right thing to do realy
supported but its a bit hard to know where they are even then
no
supportedcloaking and moving as a fleet can be a pain
its a joke that covert ops cloaked ships in the same fleet can decloak each otheragreeing with goonsshudder  there must be something seriously wrong
agreed have lost a few kills because of this 
current situation when a carrier pilot loses a fighter there is no accounting for this lost and there are no killmails generate for the killer either this presents a problem for corporations and alliances who want to reimburse fighters lost in combat proposed solution add some way to track fighter killlosses be it by kilmails or another means weve got killmails for frigates and pos modules so why not fighters too
with a full deployment being 150million this really can become an issue
sounds goodperhaps extend it to drones if possible special log that shows only deployable losses 
tiny tiny tiny buttons
yeah pretty much all of these are silly supportededit another problem came to mind you cant create wtb contracts for nonbase itemseg researched blueprints i should be able to post a contract along the lines of wtb raven bpc me 20 pe 5 runs 1 1m isk so that there can actually be twoway trade in such items
confusionok who can i kill you can kill anyone who is red blinky red or solid red well it used to be one now it is the other solid red is the old blinky red blinky red now means they used to be beloved til they dated your sister and did her wrong so that little skull with the minus sign means exactly what again  this is just a glimpse into how confused i am when using the overview there is no reason this needs to be confusingsolutionadd a tab to the overview display called key under the new key tab there is a listing of all the different things that can be displayed on the overview and what they mean little red minus sign  corp enemy little green plus sign  corp friend solid red line  well whatever it means im really not sure please fix it so idiots like me can figure it out apparently this is confusing to lots of us idiots because every time i ask on the help channel i get a different answer maps have keys how about the overview

okay that is a step in the right direction i waited a while to actually feel this out and see if this was an acceptable change to eve and it still rubs me soreclass restriction that goes against the sandbox and loreamount of rigging can be variable and capitalismrisk v reward i smell a wow employee in that choiceits like fw items not being useable by people not enlistedthats how awkward this feelsall while leaving the calibration system that can work to handle all that and balance against extreme rigging just to griefcheaper suicide ganker fits with t1 mods inbound mandatory inty rigging inboundplus a 5 bonus to a large ship with a s rig is more newb friendly and customizable all around the player gets the exact choice of what risk and reward he fits to which ship id even want bigger bonuses beyond what we see now if the sizes are appropriate like s ecm rig gives 40 booststacking on a kestrel but you have to pay for the m ecm rig to get that extra for a caracal that give players more options who use ecmvaried skills no an ecm skilled player fitting useful ecm to feroxbrutix not in my everigging skills at 35 to unlock the extra efficiency from rigs would be even more customizable not just timesinks like they are nowjeez ccp this looks lazy the more i look at itno offense but i practice tough lovealso put it on the drawingboard some way skilled up riggers can convert t1 rigs to t2 with the materials and locking the ship into an overhaul job on sciindustry window make it take a week thats more sandboxi am enjoying this fun change just like a vaga pilots who kited t2 light droneswebsneutrangesmissilesgunfire but i gotta support this thread the right thing and the fun thing are never the same thingyou can fit 3x rig to any t1 cruiser even if you should run out of calib on the importantdangerous additions eg rig for trackingdamage and range fit t2 pulse harbyzealot game cheaper rigs are boosting maxmin in eve that is the definition of gamebreaking and autoinclude i used to think about rigging my razus but at seeing the new ratios that ccp chosedont even scale dynamically lol id be a damn fool not to slap 2 onno amount of player talent will save your inty from a rigged rifter that breaks the game as rifters with t2 could already gank t2 frigsand nothing in the oldnew rig system stops dps rigging from stacking properly some crafty griefer is already looking for a rifter v af duel and in no way should you nerf rifter its perfection incarnate its just more perfect at less cost ratio change the ratiowhy do they get all 3 that affect dps on a nanobuffertankany setupbecause the system is broken calibration points do not run outpilots do not need to think about other ways to boost shipbtw why are rigs even affecting modules on the ship i thought they were built in simply to improve hull struarmshhardpointslauncher mountslowsmidshigh rearrangements or do those come in t2 rig expansion of this miniprofession
ive not read all the posts before me but i totally love the new cheap rigs doesnt make sense to put 15m of rigs on a frigate totally makes sense theyre more expensive the bigger ship you haveabsolutely love them makes a headache for manufacturers having to do more stuff i just wish this was the case from day 1 when i couldnt afford to lose a badger

i support this with the following caveats either tracking disruptors should not be scriptable to affect missile explo radiusvelocity or amarr recons should not be given the bonus to the missile side of of it tracking enhancers giving td level bonuses would essentially invalidate tracking computers which makes for a huge nerf to shield tanking snipersliang
current situation as it is right now you only get an alphabetical list based on station name for selecting which station you want to move your clone to this does very little for revealing where the station is located the lack of information is problematic when you want to pick a specific region to relocate your clone to you can rightclick and show info on the location but the steps are unnecessary proposed solution show the region the station is in within own column in the list
makes perfect sense supported
while were improving the clone interface ive personally always wanted a right click  kill yourself option for faster pod teleporting

bump because im still dealing with a petition that should have ended weeks ago and wont due to the ignorance and lack of knowledge from gms get a ing clue or dont attempt to do a job you arent capable of stop the robot responses stop talking to people that have far superior game knowledge than you like their idiots get with the program or get the  out
please can we have the show info on acceleration gates list the ship types allowedcj
definitely why have to fly ship to a gate just to find out it doesnt work or you fly smaller ship through just fine but have no info on max limits

considering how powerful faction ships are becoming in dominion a bc version would be insane just imagine if you scaled up the phantasm by adding more damagetank or the new gila for that matterthey would end up being too powerful for their even if they were to cost a fortune introduce them and you would probably need to either make them gimp logistics platforms or redo balance for all other ships to accommodate themwould be fun but a no vote from this seat
i support thistier 1 yes tier 2 nowhy because bcs have no faction variant navy or npcwheres the love
yeah they are missing too  i personally dont use destroyers much but i would support a topic that asked for there introduction into gamecare to start the thread  i have way to many topics on these boards allreadyi did not include them in here because having 2 requests in 1 thread means its impossible for a person to support one without supporting the other
i am a new miner and am only a few days away from taking my first step into my hulk at this moment members of my corp are outmining me in battleships that have taken less time to train while i have spent what i believe is now close to 30 days to have the skills for a ship that i will never use i fully support dropping either the mining barges v skill to iv or the astrogeology skill to iv for the covetor also im honestly getting sick of staring at my retriever
ive always wanted to step up from my retriever as im at astrogeology lvl 4 mining 5 industry 5 mining barges 4 mining foreman 4 refining 5 processing skills to 34 just cant justify the training time at the moment to get hulk with my other goals in eve and yet with a lot of sp invested in mining and industry i can still only make  3 mil isk per hour because im stuck in a retriever with only two strip miners
supported
thats a very big hell yes thumbs up the only reason anyone would fly a covetor anymore is if they know theres a good chance theyre going to lose it
this is a quick fix that would make a lot of people happy
bumping for changing retriever skill requirement to mining barge iv
ok not a huge issue but when did this come into effectbefore i could get up from my desk and handle those pesky real life issues that tend to come up as they donow recently when i do i come back to a login screenif its new i didnt see anything about itcould be my fault i admitbut to go on the record its rather annoyingi know its probably to stop the afk tactics alot of farmers use and thats fine and dandyquestion is how long is the afk timer
there is no such thing afaikotherwise there wouldnt be any more damned anticloaking device postsi would suggest checking your internet connection and filing a tech support petition at that rate
connection is good maybe just in station it seemshappened again while i was making this post lolbut thanks ill be giving the network a look never hurts
yeah ive been parked in station in a pos bubble mining for over 4 hours at a belt never got kicked outso start eliminating other possibilities should be able to find it
i can confirm there is no afk timer i often cloak up in a safe spot and take a nice long nap
i am pretty sure most will agree that self destructing just to rob your enemy of a killmail is rather very lame so how about fixing that so it doesnt happen anymore for example by making the self destruct timer last 15 mins when initiated under aggro just like the logoff timeror by awarding a killmail like when rats land the final blow going to the player that did the most damagetrolling removed zymurgist

while i approve of the sentiment ccp has already stated that the limit on bio length is due to an unspecified possible exploit and that they refuse to change the limit or discuss why its in place csm 1 raised this issue if im not mistaken also theyve got the new social interface coming through the pipe either for dominion or the next expansioni hope so hopefully thatll make the whole point moot
as it stands you can only set one custom default and the other 4 options arecurrent keep this its good50m200m500mwhat the hell are you gonna do with those i propose that all of the 50200500 get scrapped and you should be able to set 34 defaults of your own even better would be an array of 34 orbit and keep at range buttons on selected item menupvp is clumsy enough as it is and this would make it a lil easier than going through right click menus in the middle of a fast paced fight
i have seen posts about stocks and shares and the mention of contractsall too excelspreadsheet and complicated if you ask mei would want to try to simplify eve when we add functionalityi suggest that we simply allow corps to go public have an initial offering of shares that can be traded on the market just like any other comoddity this ipo is attached to a written manifesto of why the corp is going public what it hopes to achieve and indication of if it is a growth share or income share it will just aquire other corps and grow andor will provide a dividend for the investmentthese shares can be issued by the votes of directors and voting rights in corp actions can be achieved by owning 10 of a company one vote per 10so directors have to be careful about continually issuing sharescorps need to state what their projected dividends are and their ability to meet those commitments will affect their share price by natural market forcesmore shares can be issued on the market but the corp has to compete with existing shares already in play so cant be unrealistic and have to attach a manifesto with their rights issue and there are time limits on reissues to buyback shares corps can simply place a market buy ordercorps could also once every 6 months split the shares to reduce the individual value and create liquiditythe value of the share is not the same as the net asset value of a corporation and this will be harder to prove but continual results should inspire confidence in the truth of the manifestoaccountsi dont see the need for contracts or complicated mechanics the simple evemarket will decidefor voting rights only 10 holding is needed to cast a vote people should be free to sell their shares at any time allowing greater corporate espionagehowever any holding that reaches a voting right 10 or invovles a deal regarding a vote holder needs to be automatically published to the market to ensure insider trading is not masked and that members with voting rights already are effectively making a statement when they reinvest in their corpcorps should also be able to publish their own news articles on successful initiatives at their own risk of wardecspeople should be able to look at the news history and share transactions of vote holders on the corp pagethis vehicle would enable the eve banks to invest in corps themselves more easily and spread the risk for individuals by providing their own shares and dividends at a lower rateit would also be nice to couple this with changes to allow banks to operate more freely for example a loan system where credits were automatically withdrawn periodically on an agreed interest schedule it would be up to the banks to work out if corps or individuals are risky or not and price their loan at rates accordinglythere thats my lunchtime over
i dont know if im the only one but the share system needs a lot of work i feel like its not used correctly for all i know if ccp would do or create a whole complete share stock market system they would need a big server and lots of ressources for thatmy opinion just remove the share thingunless it has real use 
the current share system is far from perfect but a lot of the proposals you outline would actually make it significantly worse 10 to vote is silly sharesplitting limits are equally silly and the idea that people will have confidence in share sales as a whole is just nonsensical if you want a proper share system take off the 2 billion isk dividend cap allow shares to be traded via contract or some other equally open system and create new tracking tools to let potential buyers see how the share has performed in the past also clean up the corporation window generally so that people can actually use these new functions without tearing their hair out in a bout of ui rage
while i hate hot dropping with every fiber of my body i cant agree to these termshowever cyno fields requiring a 30 second stability period would give pilots a long enough time to react appropriately yet it would be short enough for the beacon not to get popped if its not on the same grid instead of the current cyno holy shi static we have now it could be more along the lines of cyno spotted redouble your efforts weve got 30 seconds before all hell breaks looseanother solution is to make the cyno beacon only be the centrifugal focus of a massive 05 au radius subspace distortion military experts would call this a cynosural field the capital ship could arrive anywhere within that sphere and would be required to warp to the engagement manuallyeither one would be a fair improvement but more anticyno modules would just be asking for trouble imo

pretty sure he meant high sec seeing as how youre in privateers and whatnot
if youre going to make it a regular thing just let players set their own skills itd allow for better testing while eliminating the armageddon day server rush that prevents people from actually playing with their shiny toys
it is ccps server where they allow us to connect to help test changes if and when they have something specific to test they always give skillsmodshulls to facilitate testingsisi is not a playground for us even though many use it as such i would rather access be restricted to people who actually use it to findreproduce the bugs that riddle this little universe of ours ie permabans really meaning permanent bans as in forever and ever
interesting concept fun if restricted to a week or two per year it wouldnt waste too much time and this investment in fun might get more people involved with genuine debugging during the other 50 weeks even major rl corporations have holidays parties and the like why not the test server no one would have guessed that building rockets would give us tang who knows where something like this could lead it might be fun finding outsupported
sisi is the worst test server of any game ive played simply because of not being able to change skills its literally skllls should be changable or at 5 all the time so you know we can actually test things instead of waiting 2 and a half years of watching the imbalances wreck tranquilityhello titans and doomsdays
no matter how much you wish  its propably never gonna happen
no ask yourself this if everyone had max skills would anyone test anything that wasnt a titan or supercarrier nonot supported because the mad server rush and lagests interfere with actual testing
yes to this or at least make it so skills train to 5 in seconds so we can help with the testing
current situation when a character is accepted into a corporation there is no record to show who completed this action the same applies for removing characters from a corporationproposed solution add a history tab in corporation ui and allow for comments so that a reason can be given which other directors can see within same corporation also if a character has been in the corporation before a popup should indicate this when theyre being readmitted
yup life sucks when you have way too many people in your corp to keep an eye on
yup that would be good but is it available to public too cause i want to know if i want to accept x character that just left your corp  i would like that too
also have somewhere where you can see who left your corp of their own accord as well  right now theres no notification whatsoever when someone wanders off and its not hard to miss that they left corp and keep providing them with access to outofgame resources well after they left a former members tab would be quite nice to have
under no circumstance
i like it would make things a bit easier to sort out
supportedi cant even understand how or why they dontmake the info viewable to those who have appropriate roles and to the said persons own employment history tab

at the moment it is quite normal to find acceleration gates in missions that will allow mining barges but not their t2 version many missions have large amounts of roids in i assume as part of the reward if you can be botheredso can we please have barges exhumers and orcas added to the allowed ship list of all mission gatesthankscj
last i checked i was able to freely roam about mission areas in my hulksomething tells me your not doing it right
dunno about an orca but i have never had problems getting an exhumer into a mission belt if theres a specific mission with this issue it might be a bug in that mission
ive found gates that i could get my hulk through but not my alts iteron v and vice versa this usually happens when i spam low level missions just to find a belt sometimes in exploration sites  i know not cool to make the site stick around and not respwan somewhere else after killing and looting the rats but the belt was huge dont remember what missions i had issues on but i think the site was blood vigil one of the blood sites anyway
i can confirm flying orcas in as wellif im in my hulk the orca is near by 
bump can we get csm on board with this
youre more or less describing last years fanfest pvp tourney while i like that style the big formal alliance tournaments should stick with a pure combat model
already done and didnt work  mhhh perhaps some changes here and there then ah wellps i stopped watching the tourny after i watched it the first time not my thingi dont know
as a miner i think this tourney would be like watching paint dryid rather watch the combat side of the coin tbqh
nvm missread the op im all for it
i think it would be quite a nice bonus if there were some random loot drops from mining standard ores just to make things more exitingim not saying we suddenly find a modulated beam laser in an asteroid but more like why cant i accidently get some amazing discovery of morphite or ancient fossil or sleeper artifact that was burried in the rockjust so it wasnt predictable per hourisk and the miners get a smile to their normally dire existance being harrassed by griefers odds could increase as you lower the security status but i still think it should be less than 1000001 in 10 space the item would be delivered to the cargo bay on destruction of an asteroid not during a mining cycle
i like the general idea but i doubt it could worki dont think they can mix ores inside a single asteroid or hide objectsthe mining could trigger an event that spawns a new object thoughi dont think it would be good if it were implemented into standard belts better put it into explorationi remember a similar experience  an exploration had me mine some arkonor in highsec even upon which suddenly a spawn of rogue drones appeared
thanks maz but no way in hll will i go to kugutsumen site

supported no other race lose its bonus just by changing ammo typeif most ppl against it because kinetic should be caldari racial dmg then i have a solution for thatkinetic bonus should apply even with not kinetic missiles for examplethunderbird heavy missile does base 150em dmgthen ships with kinetic missile bonus will do 150em dmg 5lvl150 kinetic dmg which is at lvl 5 150em dmg 375kinetic dmg  1875dmg same as with scourgethis way caldari wont loose its dmg bonus due to ammo change and still has its kinetic racial favour
i sure wish that i could switch my ogre iis for a different damage type too bad i cant carry 4 racks of heavy drones in my dominixyou shoot something with high kinetic resistance you do ok damage you switch your damage type to em damage this does more damage than your kinetic bonus you do even more damage than you did with kinetic so on top of having this advantage you want to do even more damage with everything you already do so please stop postingyour level 2 vs level 5 argument is flawed because ships have a pair of bonuses even if youre not getting your kinetic bonus youre getting your second bonus no matter what it may bebeing able to switch your damage type is a third bonus in itself minmatar damage type are dictated by ranges gallente and amarr have no variation in their damage typesif you want your all around damage bonus then you have to sacrifice every other type of missile damage or make them akin to minmatar ammunition in that they dictate range as well as a split damage type then you can have your 5 to everything per level
mr noob gallente whiner look at this waywhy does your domi get dmg bonus for light drones aswellyou shoot something with high speedlow sig you do whatever damage you switch your drone type to light this does more damage than your heavies with bonusyou do even more damage than you did with heavies so on top of having this advantage you want to do even more damage with everything you already do so please stop postingalso why gallente drone ships get dmg bonus for warriors  those are doing matar dmg type  so they shouldnt if they want to use faster drones they should have to give up their dmg bonusi hope this cleared out how stupid your argument is mr gallente whiner
i was using an example if we were balancing ships around specific encounters this wouldnt be a very good game now would it i have no problems with the dominixmy problem is people not realizing that theyre asking for more of a buff than the ships need if you read anything past the first lines of my post you would know that clean some sand out and try againasking that a ship be able to be excellent at every scenario is absurd thank you for proving my point
i support this topic it should be replaced with either a rof or damage bonus but missiles need more fixing than just looking at the ship bonuspersonaly id rather a damage bonus as a rofb would just mean that when i go deepspace ratting i run out of missiles much faster but being mainly pvp orientated that doesnt phase me too much rof bonus would also for this reason alone at least for 00 ratters nerf the pve aspect of using missiles at least in that aspect so that not so many people would complain about caldari being the best pveers all the fuking time the only ship thats really good for pve lev ivs intended is the raven anyway and that already has a rof bonus so nothing would changebut really put aside the allaiance tournament fantasy arena for a second and in the outside world in gang or feet pvp missiles just dont get there fast enough to be effective at the range that caldari are supposed to be aimed towardseg cerberus can hit around 160k doing approx 400dps but to get there you have to wait 25 seconds so thats 25 seconds of dps that your missing before damage is even appliedif while your missiles are in flight you need to warp out your damage gets turned off the instant you click warp to allign even though you still see the pretty exlosions unlike all turrets that will continue to do damage while they allign to warp not to mention instantly rather than 25 seconds laterso yes missiles in general need to be seriously looked at and the fact that the raven happens to be good at running angel missions is no reason to even talk about the fact that caldari happen to have a ship thats good at pve because for all of the rest of us who dont give 2 flying pieces of turd about  carebares in highsec running the same repetetive mission rooms over and over when it comes to how weapons should be balanced because popping 60 red crosses that dont need tackling because they are too stupid to just friking warp away already doesnt mean you can even get close to taking on 1 square while dealing with broken game mechanics
i agree with the irrelevance of the dps of these ships they are not combat vesselsso a blanket change that terminates the kin bonus would not relly affect thesethese are all combat vessels  the onyx and fly may have primary roles of disruption  but there dps is still relevent to there use especially in smallgang solo workill decline your advice for now becauseim off the opinion that the main problem with cmbs lie in the poor damage bonus they recieveroflkets wouldnt be so rofl if they got rainbow dmage bonuskessies and hawks can also fit standardsmore dps from a proper bonus on the nh would free up a low slot bcu  reactor controlas a breed of ships cmbs are underpowered statistical analysis supports thisthis is hardly surprising when mathimatical analysis of the bonus equates it to 33 the value of gun  rof and damage  bonusesstat analysis also shows that the current rainbow bonused ships are not favoured for pvpthe information is there if you care to download it  0  hits so far  
how do you figure all other races gallente minmatar and amarr are pretty much restricted to two damage types either way em and therm for amarr  kin and therm for gallente minmatar is a small combination of em explosive and kinetic iirc but only twocaldari have the benefit of being able to choose a pure damage type to deal damage in you want to destroy and armor tank fit explosive missiles you want to take down a shield tank switch to emits balanced as isgallente do therm and kinetic alot of therm and kinetic but they need to be extremely close to do that their drones help make up for that lost dps while fighting at extremely close rangesamarr they are restricted to em and thermal but their benefit is that lasers have extremely awesome tracking they do almost as much as blasters at much farther ranges that makes up for their em and thermal restrictionsminmatar have it rough but i know most people use rf emp ammo which is em and explosive their benefit for autocannons low damage potential is coupled with their quick rof and alot of minnine ships have the slot layout for missilescaldari have missiles and can choose to completely focus their damage type and still have quite awesome ranges and damage potential you want caldari to be the i win race i see that little caldari  pvp  solo  success choose threeyou can pick caldari pvp and success solo pvp is hard to find these days anywaymissiles arent affected by tracking and it easier to help make up for your lost damage output agains nano ships for those times you decide to use a raven to pop a cruiser with torps use a damn target painter its alot better at what its designed to do than tracking enhancers to their turret counterpartssorry man but that kinetic missle damage bonus is helping keep the balancenot supported
dude read the op  not some random sacrcastic replythis thread is about the ship bonuses and there incompatiblity with combat tactics not balance between a and bkinetic mdb is not helping keep the balanceit destroys the balance that would otherwise existcaldari ships are not balanced with minigallente atmthe statistical analysis i did on pvp data shows a strong favourtism towards mini and gallente ship by the top pvprs in this gamedamage type switching is not some sort of god mode
your every post seems to say do you agree with me no then you must be talking about something else because i am right the vast majority do not agree with you there is no problem with the current design of caldari ships  missile or otherwiseand your vaunted statistical analysis is fundamentally flawed there are numerous posters who have said that in your other boost amarr and caldari thread
no that post says dude read the op  not some random sacrcastic replythis thread is about the ship bonuses and there incompatiblity with combat tactics not balance between a and bno the vast majority  gun and drone users  have a vested interest in keeping things the way they are nowand your vast majority isnt really that vast  mostly the same people posting and reposting to try to get there arguments about balance through or more simply in some cases to try to derail this thread with noisethey will never convince me and neither will you  because my own cross trained experiance of this game tells me of the current supperiority  all things taken into account  of guns over missiles and mini and gal boats over caldariwhen i started that stat analysis  i never knew what i would findbut i really wasnt surprised when it showed the extent to which experianced pvprs favour minigallentethe stats are good  they show what they show a pvp preference for minigallentesome peopple have ranted the stats are bad without offering an explanation whyother have tried to look for faults and never proven anything
you have tunnel vision the statistics are fundamentally flawed in terms of sample selection there are wellreasoned responses which state what the flaws are but you have steadfastly ignored themit is the same here you state over and over again that the bonus should change and that it is not a balance issue that is quite patently false a bonus is a game mechanic and therefore by definition a game balance issuethere is no malice in my statements and if you read any there then you have read too much into them you are quite simply wrong
a sig radius reduction would be a big help as well

please
share the love with the rocketsproblem with the hawk is from its 22 split weapons days cpu and grid were balanced around that then it got switched to 4 launchers0 turrets but nothing was altered on the cpu or grid to allow for the different fittings requirements
i still like my idea of rocket damage goes straight to the hull ignoring the shields and armor
i support this request
i dont own a xbox or ps3 and i will buy one for dust but i feel like a  playing a fps on a console get it on the pc
dont buy a console just for this man thats setting yourself up for obvious disappointmentif you want a media center then get an old hacked xboxopensource xbmc is much better then the xbox360 softwarebuying the latest console for a game that looks to just be a mod and wont have any real connection to eve for 23 years is kinda silly
i own a ps3 but i dont like fps on consoles would play dust if it was on pc
i support this oh wait crap if i support this then i wont be able to reply to my other topic today since i have to leave the house in 2 minutes ok that means i cant support this at this time i hope you understand

1 to all ideas mentioned so farliang
signed and hopeful but not holding my breath
yup
agreed
thing is drake you do often seem to simply troll every thread with a qq cry more response without stopping to think so i am guessing you would be happy for ccp to be releasing your ip to any third party it likes the breach of privacy here is serious given that some of the shared data can be linked directly to peoples irl names and addresses maybe ccp or any of their friends will be trawling through your online info one day looking to see what you had for lunch
ppl need to read the thing the op didnt describe it very wellthis is a new case of breach of privacy and trust by members of isd and ccp
ive got drakes ip if anyone wants it
a devblog was released on the subjectupdate on the devblog with a bit of commentary 
well looks like its time to suspend accounts untill they clean up there act no way in hell that i can see that they can excuse whats happend
vagueremove the bumph and we are told very little about what is going oni get the impression ccp is trying to distance itself from this but how can it when ccp ginger is reportedly in full knowledge of what was going on according to the information leakedthe dev blog along with its numerous edits as cataloged here
i hope this gains more support from the playerbase and attention from the csm
you do realize that specific link has to do with the isd right and only the isddamn guess i better start my new marketwts tin foil hats for 1 million isk get im while your hotyou have my ipgood for you now be a good little nooblet and run along
show me on this doll where ccp touched your ip i dont think creating uninformed panic using scary words ie my ip1 over something that looks like some overzealous isd volunteers will help anyone or anything
uninformed yes because we want to know the whole story about what was found panic no not really but its a privacy issue and corruption issuei believe the one that is uninformed is yourself on what an ip address can be used for when it is in the right hands i will give you a couple examples that could impact the game eve specificallya large fleet fight is going on one specific fc is leading the group and seconds before a jump bridge opens and an opposing fleet jumps in he is ddosed drops from eve and voice comms their fleet dies in a chaos fire could also be done to super cap pilots to kill themwould be a very valuable tool for security of forums and such to keep out spiesits an advantage no matter how you look at it it should never be done for game and real life reasons
to the first page with you
this idea is so cool and it would be a big improvment to the current pos system we have nowwith the changes to the sov system going on atm i see no reason why there cannot be a change to the deisign of poss
a long time since the last industrial expansion do it already
it looks to me as though he did in his last post of course it is ratherdifficult to tell where the questions he is evading are since the posts you mention seem to be comprised primarily of bullets depicting your unsubstantiated views maybe i just need to l2english but it looks like he covered everythingpattern ive been trolling the shc topic for quite a while this latest iteration of changes look good to me when one considers the objectives you are going for and the hurdles that accompany themsupported
as ccp is truly working on this i will no longer post this anymorethank you one and all for working with me in trying to get this pushed to the forefront
id like to see them address hit quality but otherwise im pretty stoked woot
honestly im pretty stoked regardless of hit qualityliang
not supported asisi could get behind the idea of two consecutive terms then two to three terms off before one can run again this should help make sure that the truly talented csm people can still contribute after their 2 terms and that were not scraping the bottom the the barrel due to term limitsi would just prefer seeing people not become entrenched in their positions on the csm and i think having different people and diversenew ideas flowing through regularly is best
we could give the csm a unique luxury yacht too so they can fly around the cluster in style cant have our elected representatives feeling cramped on their way to jita
yes yes yes i would also love the option to allign to bookmarks
2 thumbs way way up
as much as i hate people not aligning when they are told to in fleets i dont want everything being done for them teach your people to listen dont make fleets afk endevors not supported
 afkhave you ever managed a fleet of about 50 to 100 peopleseriously think about this before you make assumptions
definitely not supportedwhat is the next youll ask for that you can target and focus fire for ships in the fleetgood fcs and alliances manage to get their people to follow orders and benefit from it bad alliances dont and shouldnt be given an easy way to make up for their own inadequaciesdrake draconis if you cant make your people follow simple instructions like align to then you are the one failing not the gamefoolish suggestion
and yet they included warp to
warp to has a function besides being lazy it allways your fleet to hit at the same time at the same place besides good fleets have their members warp to optimals anyway when not on the move
no i havent but i have been in them i wasnt saying that happens now but i am saying if we keep giving more automation to fcs thats what it might become for example if we had a jump fleet button fc would be able to completely move their fleets without having the need for anyone to listen the people that miss alignment when being chased by hostiles are the people that get caught at killed i just want to keep some responsibility with the individual i think thats a fair criticism of the proposal
also a shoot at option would be way easier before an op you can just bring your bs to form up pos then you can sleep ride bike etc and when you come back the fc played his rts and you can get a new ship
not as foolish as the one who assumed i was asking for more than align fleet toonow go run along lemming and continue to blame all of your faults on the fleet commander
consider this youre in florida two rival gangs kill each other on a daily basis but because they handed a bit of paper in to the policegovernment that said this is a war the police and government do not investigate the crimes or arrest offendersthat is what wardecs really are when applied to highsecso they do not really fit outside highsec wardecs are unnecessary as you can do what you like and turn people redin terms of eve dynamics consider this in empire space do you really think that because corp a declares war on corp b that the governments and concord are going to turn a blind eye this makes no sense whatsoever there would be mass protests go write a chronicle about thatyou have nullsecyou have losecyou have suicide gankyou have can flipping bait trapsyou have discoraven outside jita 44 or niarjai dont see what purpose wardecs have except for people to harass other players corps and stop people from having a break the main issue i have with this is that i pay to play and it limits my choice if im station camped in highsec not happened for a while as i live in a wormholenot everyone wants to fight and the griefers have multiple options alreadythis is one of the most annoying features of this game for casual players i log in oh i cant play why pay
definitely not supported eve is a harsh place and non consensual pvp is one of the main features if you dont like it can i haz your stuffs
it would appear that for some reason ccp dont agree with you linoover the years many people have raised this issue only for it to turn into a flame session between the people doing the wardecing and the people doing the defendingthe origional conceptblueprint for eve was to create a game were people could run around and kill each other all day long it would seem that this is still truehaving been on the recieving end of many a wardec i understand how frustrating it can be to log in just to find out your station campedbut it has also been my experiance that eve however serious other people wanna make it is just a game after all and blowing up other ships is part of that game and i personnaly have spent many hours fighting and blowing up those people who wardeced my corptho i do agree with you on a few subjects you raisedyou have nullsecyou have losecyou have suicide gankyou have can flipping bait trapsyou have discoraven outside jita 44 or niarjai dont see what purpose wardecs have except for people to harass other players corps and stop people from having a break eve is a massive game and i personnaly see no reason why there is a wardec system other than to harrass and grief new fledgling inexperianced or carebear corps in highsecbut on the other handeve was designed so we can go and shoot other players and no amount of forum posting is gonna change that
 facepalm hello kitty is that way 
wtf  wha  if people go seem y last posts they will know doesnt take an engineer to find out that i have a small tendency for being a carebear but not fully i love killing peoplewhat you propose is ridiculous that will never happen the game was ment that corporation could declare war on each other plain and simple its the main feature of the game and always remainbut the way it worked before was pretty good since the majority of players were only hardcore pvpers and it did work over time many other types of people joined which had different opinion and now we got a bunch of mixed people in eve some dont even like pvp at all and never flown a combat ship hard to believe but its true and they play eve  wtfwhateveryour solution is not it not supported just like ccp did the sovthey will have to look at it themselvesno matter what happens it will change but they will not us or even the csm will have no power over this
wardec system is flawed but the alternative is unthinkable  no warccp do need to ban all combat from the hubs 0910 systems it produces an unnecessary amount of lag and inconvenience 44 bumparama anyone and lord knows there are plenty of stations elsewhere to play the silly docking games attweak it by changing security status of the hub systems and removing all offices if need be even in a postapocalyptic world i am sure walmart wouldnt tolerate shootouts in their parking lot either
you morons need to stop comparing real life to a fictional world
id support it if you had to pay huge sums of money to the government for mining permits and there were no missions in high secits super unrealistic that you can steal the governments minerals without filling out the proper mining paperwork also concord should destroy any npcs that shoot you in high sec as well its stupid that they dont
real life  eveand wars can serve perfectly valid reasons too including but not limited to  destroying competition in an area getting them to leave so that you can more fully take advantage of miningproductionpiratingexplorationwhatever in the area you want to operate in with enough war you could possibly get them to move  get back at them for can flippingsuicide gankingsmack talking you  corps to make money either mercenary corps or pvp corps can make isk by warring industrial corps if industrial corps dont have the means to defend themselves they dont deserve to existand all this coming from a mostly high sec player who doesnt wardec without reason and spends most of his time doing carebearish thingsand in terms of eve chronicles yes concord and the governments turn a blind eye in fact concord reviews all the wardecs to validate them just read about it in the novel
yes wardecs suckits a broken system to be surebut removing them is not the answer nor is buffing them nor is any number of hundreds of suggestions yes even my own suckthis is why i have trouble making suggestions here because they always mess up the balance
omfg you make lot of sense your a genius please be on the csm team your facts are so awesome
unless you have asked each and every person in this game who considers themselves a casual player about what they think about war decs you just told a big fat liei am a casual player and i have no problems with war decs and why do people have to bring real life crap into this game i do not give a rats ass about what two rival gangs in florida do for recreationyour idea for war decs needs to be flushed to the deep dark regions of the waste land
and get strung up by the lynch mob not sure if i have enough structure to tank that
if you remove war decs there is no way to remove poss from space that you might want to occupy there are many other reasons why they are necessary but that one alone would break the game significantly
wardec pvp is utterly lamestation camping  no thankspicking on targets who dont wanna fight  no thankswardec mechanics are not good for eve and make no rp sense whatsoeverwardecs can mean misery for small corps who find themselves bullied by griefer  lamer corps 5 x there size or experianceseriously who would wanna play that game  how many accounts has it cost eve allready i agree with the previous poster that there needs to be a way to fight over moon assetsrather than removing wardecs completelly they should be changed to enable combat at certain moonsteritorial wars are better imo than persecution warsanyway with the options open for real pvp where both sides wanna are prepared to fight  fwlowsecnullsecwhs the wardec is becomeing the last resort of the lamergriefer and could do with being looked at again
speaking as a full fledged carebear whos entire battleclinc record consists solely of hauler lossmails and a hurricane salvager loss too  and damnit i miss that ship  this silly cyclone just dont cut it  no there is only one place in eve where you are really and truly 100 safe and that is docked inside an npc station and then only if you dont play the market or something like that this is the way it should beare war decs broken absolutely and undeniablydo they need an overhaul from the ground up aye you betchashould they be eliminated from the game never
im mostly happy with the replies i expected the hardcore grief machines to seriously be opposed to this then the odd random comment to justify it and the balanced responses who understand the dilema and that the game is played by people who have different opinions that are equally valid as their owntotally agree that wardecs give an excellent platform to perform highsec posbashing but lets ask what purpose highsec poses serve since theres no moon mining its a glorified research and invention mechanism if we allow more research stations in npc highsec stations are highsec poses necessary or am i missing somethingthe majority of eve space is 04 or lower isnt it if war decs were removed eve would still not be safe in highsec as i explained plenty of opportunity to disrupt corporate activity through griefing its not even that profitable in highsec so to make money and hit people where it hurts attack them in losec and nullsec or are people frightened of the real players 
lies hides claw marks and wounds from last convo
what the heck is a real player is a real player someone who resides in low sec or 00 are the ones who live in high sec all imaginary players is it like real and imaginary numbers i hate math
while this is an interesting exercise you have multiple problems with your datayouve taken the sample already incomplete from a biased sample  that is only those who have a ranking on battle clinicnot every pilot will choose to put their killmails and lossmails up on battle clinica pilot who puts hisher killmails up on battle clinic may not post loss mails meaning the sample is even more incompleteyouve not taken into account the circumstances of each killmail this list is as likely as not to be a ranking of ships which get picked first for a gate camp because they fit sensor boosters easierthere is potential crossover when you count a ship as being lost because one pilot killed it you dont take into account the possibility that another pilot in your list was also involved in that kill and so potentially count it twicekillmails can of course be faked
1 would not introduce racial bias into the data2 would not introduce racial bias into the data3 would not introduce racial bias into the data4 i dont need to take into account the circumstances of each kill to do that would require reintegrating the data for soloroamfleetgankage killsif i were to do that then i would be using my opinion on how important each aspect is the data however complete should be a fair cross section of all activities in evegankage on gates may get lots of kills  but solo small roam kills tend to score more on bc due to point being split fewer waystherefore its not fair to assume that the peops at teh top of the leaderboard only every do gate camps5 only if a player manually posted a km and managed to mess up somehow again would not introduce racial bias into the data6 would not introduce racial bias into the data
er what have you taken a basic statistics class1people with rankings on bc are more likely to fly pvp oriented ships which skews data you cant say its not racial because you have no idea 2a group of people who doesnt put lossmails on bc will skew data as they could correlate towards a certain ship type say mission runners who lose their maraudersbattleships since mission ships are predominantly caldariamarr this certainly does introduce bias3 see aboveno rejected nein terrible
1 you know your completely right about thatso what conclusions do you draw from the data that shows pvprs flying predominantly mini and gallente me i draw the conclusion that minigallente are overpowered compared to caldari and amarrhence this post  caldari and amarr need a boostyou may not like it and i dought youll support it being mini but thank you for making my point for me
1 for style but 11 billion for thinkingfor instance my most often killed ship is a drake now we all know that a actual fight between a pvp fit drake vs a pvp fit hurricane generally favours the drake unless the hurricane has a billion or two in impl
who said anything about flying youre looking at a killboard your statistics are bogus and so are your conclusions saying that something appears often doesnt make it overpowered just accessible youve drawn conclusions based upon false assumptions and little more than a home brewed formula that proves nothing i mean look at your list for just a second  the exequror the black ops being spread about by an entire list its nothing but bunk
i was about to like spreadsheets but then you reminded me what s people with spreadsheets can belogic  wisdomgo get another sample pool you  cant believe you wasted csm reading time with this rubbishalso its boost minmatargallentecaldariminmatar need full turretsfull launcher5050 setups to not need 2 dmg modsand l guns to not suck and all their ships to fit either armour or shield tanks that change the use of the shiparmourtank stabber  heavy ewar shield tank  nano tackler they should both be viable as to gridslotsbase statsgallente need their 2 flights in dronebay minimum and l guns to not suckcaldari need to be able to fit more ecm on more t1 ships and keep their crap launchers or allow missile launchers to fit 2 size caliber of missilesamarr need their t2 tracking nerfedplay the game avoid those misleading biased data dumpscreating global ccp killboard thread gotta search firstthat needs a fix soontmalso make op players character 1000 until he redoes that spreadsheeti hate himher so
you could just as easily draw the conclusion that more people are skilled for gallenteminmatar so they fly what they know
op is right it clearly shows that currently most pvpers fly matar then gallente ships however this is being due to the past 2 years where matargallente ships were the bestamarr were boosted significantly in this yearso only need is to boost caldari and to some extend gallente for pvpas amarr is op right now and matar is still good enough no need to changes there
uhh no he isnt
yep he isnt  is he
the data sample due to its nature  that being the combat record of the best pvpr in eve  will not not be full of fail fitswhy you are singling out the drake  there are 200 ships in the listthe data only goes back 1 yeara  trueb  truec  opinionopinion is not a logical operator
you dont want much do you i laugh at miniwhiners who think they have a hard timemini have the best ships in game  thats my opinionthe statistics support my opinion  not yoursthere should be no more boosts for mini  they have it too easy as it ishigh damage guns that dont use cap  and you still want more  
your opinion is just that an opinioni could stare at the screen and make an opinion off of a bloody pixel or a shadow or some funny funny mark on the damn wall and it wouldnt make it any better or any stronger than your opinioni suggest you do some research on statistical analysis and then you should read up on something called the scientific methodwhen you come up with something that is unbiased proven tested and not polluted by your opinion then you might have somethingwe are not interested in your damned opinionwe are interested in facts proof especially facts that do not originate from sources outside ccps domain or the game itselflast i checked battleclinic is not owned or operated by ccp and they arent watching everyone because i happen to know for a fact its missing quite a few kills and funny little things like thatso get that through your thick skull as you happily leap down the rosy path of spreadsheetshere we are at how many posts and still only one supportmust be nice to be a martyr for the cause
praise be a sensible objective nonrant reply this may be true  then the question is why does the data show a bias towards players skilled for gallenteminmatar when there are more caldari players in game  according to official stats  than any other races  its not the case anyways if you look at the raw data most players in the sample fly multiple races
careful  the bias behind your arguments is starting to show
try not to rantthe data is not mine  it is unbiased by my opinion whatever that may bethe equations used in the analysis are applied equally to all racesi have not given you my opinion in the data
could have fooled me
not really no not so much
thanks you for sensible replymost of the players in the sample if you look at the raw data fly multiple racesits fair to assume that they are generally high skill point characters who have cross trainedi think that the data shows them choosing to fly mingallente rather than being stuck with them because thats what theyve trainedany way assuming you are correct this would make the situation even worse than the data suggestsconsidering that nearly 40 of all players are caldari why would pvp data show a preference for gallentemini ships the swing to minigallente preference for pvp is even greater if you consider that only 1926 of players start out training minigallente skillfrom the official statsthe offical stats in case you dont wanna go get them yourselveof the 660000 characters in eve there are110000 amarr 169243000 caldari 373172000 gallente 26127000 minmatar 195these numbers are in almost perfect harmony with the racial composition numbers we published more than a year ago showing very little change in preference
i approve  lets boost caldari ship and amarr there not good enough lmaocome on flame me i dare ya lol you all know im right who would use missiles anyway pfff who would use lasers come on way too much cap dont use them for now they sucksarcasmthread
im trying to behave myself sort offirst of all your data population was only concerned with pvpers not the game as a whole of those caldari players how many of them are actually pvpers i wonder and how many of that larger nubmer are actually active accounts and havent been mothballed for three yearsbe that as it may excluding the race of the pilot were back to your original assumption that people will always fly the best ship for the job in the game and i dont know that the premise is accuratei dont always fly the best ship for a particular job  sometimes i fly a substandard ship because its what i had available to me i dont nmormally pvp but the comparison is accurateadditionally my criteria with what makes a ship the best for a particular task may not match yours by way of example i dont use a hurricane to salvage i use a cyclone arguably the hurricane is the better ship because it has more low slots and thus can theoretically carry more cargo resulting in fewer trips to base while salvaging but it also costs nearly twice as much to acheive the same function 31  34 million versus roughly 19 million  which is why i dont use it
sample size 1000  this part sample due to player choosing ship race a400 ship uses  40 race b250 ship uses  25 race c200 ship uses  20 race d150 ship uses  15 sample size 1000  this part sample due to only 1 ship being available assuming ships are balanced availability should not have a racial bias sorace a250 usesrace b250 usesrace c250 usesrace d250 usestotal sample  what we are seeing race a650 ship uses  325 race b500 ship uses  25 race c450 ship uses  225 race d400 ship uses  20 ok theres a quick example of what happens to data when a random but equally distributed variable is affecting the resultsif some of the killlosses were due to only 1 ship being available for the player to fly assuming that all races ships are equal the effect would be to reduce mask the size of the player preferenceim not suggesting  that happens btw not too any large extentthis is taken care of in the analysiseach ship is only compared  for the popularity component of the result  against its class equivelents in other races
heres a statistic to analyze 545 ppl as of this post and assuming each person read it once which i know is already wrong have read this thread and 1 one un ein ichi moja has given it the thumbs upand he wasnt agreeing with you he was just flame baiting
funny how all your ideas are nothing but trying to buff caldari when there is nothing wrong with them
yes most threads on these forums go through the rants phasethey then have to go through the dude you havnt got much support phase  that tired old argument never works010 for originallity in derail attempt110 for this one
absolutely not that would be ed nobody cares about a dronethe fighter idea though yes
some way to track the loss of fighters would be nice considering the cost
only 1 supporterto me this seems as straightforward and obvious as an idea can be the overview has all sorts of strange icons explain what the icons are in a new tab on the overview why isnt everyone giving thumbs up here
you have to organize the priorities in your overview settingsmove enemies tageffects to the top neuts to middle and pirate crap to the bottomi still have no idea is mine works properly as the new confounding bracket and background options are stunning if they chose to work and my tabs dont always loadbut i support this interface improvement some varying ship icon brackets for shiptypes would also be very welcome and better if each object had an interactive hud like rts gamesless words more symbols kthx ccp
sure wouldnt mind to have a legend of some sort to help understand it doesnt hurt either so what the hell
very simply it seems that several months after their inception wormholes have become a bit of a gimmick at least on the strategiceconomic side of things now please correct me if this would have some negative impact on the pve content but it seems like wormholes might become strategically relevant if they stay open a lot longer and that this would be a good thinganecdotally when apocrypha first came out and the possibilities were exciting people spent a lot of time trying to find cool things like routes to systems on the other side of the galaxy faster routes to jita etc sometimes these things were actually found and lots of scrambling and careful managing of what went through went on to try and get the most out of the discovery i remember one point when a roving gang came through from the north into delve and there was some extremely brief but amusing back and forth before the route closednowadays it just doesnt seem like anyone bothers that much if a cool connection is found its not a big deal because it will be gone as soon as a couple ships go through anywayi dunno i get that wormholes were supposed to be the purview of small intrepid gangs but i think it would be really cool if they were even a little strategically relevant i hate to keep using the jita example but imagine finding a shortcut to jita that stayed open for a week instead of long enough for five ships to go through thats long enough for people to add it to their routine and for prospective pvp gangs to actually meet each other and the change should be easy
relevance is subjective wormholes are quite strategically relevant to small intrepid gangs thank you very muchben
the time of the wormhole doesnt stop small gangs to form and go in wormhole but the mass will uhh no not supported
facepalmsnot supporting a wh noob post
no
ws  more dangerous than  00  more dangerous than  lowsec  more dangerous than highseci think things are better the way they areremoving local from 0 and null would hand to much power to cloaky reconsgoing to the belts to minerat would be tantumount to suicide without local
id support something like this but id expand it to include ships entering a system by means other than a gate wh covert bridge dont appear in local
you can load ammo from your cargohold into your guns you can move items from your cargohold to corp hangar and vice versa why not dronesi propose to have the ability to move drones from your cargohold to your drone bay without assistance of a ship with sma
as a gallente player ill bet you do but this will never happen it would unbalance the hell out of all ships each ship has limited done bays to give one an advantage over another it also makes drone ships nongodlike with unlimited some coughdominixcough would be the best ship in the whole game as you would have an inhuman tank all the neuts you want and close to unlimited drones actually unlimited if you have an alt fly in and drop drones in a can
comments a counterbalance to this in pvp would be that you could no longer carry so many cap boosters cap boosters are the lifeblood of eve pvp  a cargo item almost as mandatory as the mwd it would be terribly convenient if you didnt require going to a smastation to refit your dronesmy counterproposal when you eject a drone from your cargo bay it ejects exactly one drone it goes into space as a drone you can then rightclick and bring into your cargo bay but you cant do this more than once every 2 minutes the same as ejecting anything from your cargo bayliang
i too would love to have a 600 m3 drone bay in my plated bseither youre trolling or you just dont realize how bad your idea isinfinite drone baysa valid tactic is to blow another ships drones up to lower its dpsit makes people micromanage and it is one of the many things that make pvp complex and fun
drone ships should be able to expand drone bay by shrinking cargobut taking from cargo directly to bay is too powerful
yep by giving up a low slot or something at leastbut nothey should not be able to refill dronebay in spacealso it would further boost amarr ships as they usually have the most cargo space after ammo
uhhh gtfo and never post this crap again no no no never you mad you blind stop touching yourself your destroying your braincellslike some guy above said put a can in highsec fill it with drones and go happy griefing killing everyone you flip can its already used with boosters in high sec
if implemented as liang says yes maybe your original proposal hell no
less drunk posting and more just saying no nid youll get yourself banned  o pand i hate to see one more semirational poster go poof for saying such things as you dobut sorry to say i agree with the majority as stupidly frustrating as it is allowing people to move drones to the drone bay from the cargo bay is too much of a balance tipperhowever i do like the idea of using a low slot mod to increase drone bay size hell a rig at that rate would be good too
uh i over reacted beacuse the op thought or writing this here  he should of gone to features and idea instead this one doesnt make sense whatsoeverand no im not drunkyet
just looking out for yah nid o7
wow someone loves me no flame no war hihi
yeah this is not a good idea and definately would bonus drone ships way over the top
funny but i would have argued that it was a relative nerf to drone ships  especially those which receive drone bay increases per levelliang
fixed that for you while the ops suggestion obviously doesnt work your suggestion might without throwing off ship balancing you should make it into its own thread though this one here is burned
originally up until about a year ago tracking disruptors did nothing to falloff rangesunfortunately this pretty much made using them completely pointless due to the extremely short optimal ranges of blasters  autocannons and had limited effect on pulse lasers ccp saw this as a flaw and made them affect falloff as well as optimal which actually finally made them useful to havenow if you could script tracking comps to boost optimal or falloff that might be an idea but since nothing currently uses 3 scripts thats probably not feasible and would make minmatar snipers somewhat competitive with their contemporaries something ccp seems highly averse toas tracking computers are scripted to perform one function only range or tracking they are balanced and working as intended
actually the first problem is that you fail to take into account the single largest difference between the twotracking disruptors are targeted modulesthe computers and enhancers are notthe fact that the percentages are larger is part of balancing the fact that you can only use it on one person at a time
ammo doesnt affect falloff  other than some t2sso if you want to tc te to affect falloff then make antimatterempmultifreq to lower falloff to 50 would you realy want thatoh and missiles already heavily penalized by signspeed there is no need for a module to completly make them useless
tracking disruptor like the name says disrupt the tracking and falloff  for some reason if you ask me this small part with optimal and falloff should be removed but thats another story and flame war lolfor the tracking computer no problem there if its active it gives you more bonuses and if its passive less bonus sure no bonus for falloff but its passivewant more do you wantfor missiles mhh no they already got lots of penalty and nerfing as it isdont over do it
moar falloff plz
i dont what tracking disrupters to work on missles that means thats what i have sensor damps for i dont want somthing that will work onn everything i comeup against well i kinda do cause them my arbi would be more usefull against caldari but i dont want a fool proof solo win eve mobile i was balancenot supportedalso can i have a special arbi with 8 lows and 8 meds ccp and lots of cpu and pg k thnx bye

im not asking to have bs and cruiser spawns in high sec belts but what i am asking it to see a bit more diversity to make it a little more interesting for high sec care bareshave roaming frig gangs appear in belts rather than the standard regional areas as a rare spawn of course so you could potentially find yourself under attack by a rogue drone group in amarr space or the angels appear this stops people from setting up specific tanks and never having to worry about surprises it also increases the odds of getting some of different salvage the roaming force would be slightly larger than average and would group their fire more effectively to make it more challenging also warp scrams might be niceps i dont want to make these rat particularly rewarding for the person that kills them i just want them to be a little more deadly
would be nice to make belts a little more dangerous for macro users and players in general as long as its not ridiculous
i dont give a shUFFFDt about passive tanked mission boats i want a navy drake so i can watch all the vagabonds say ouch then run awayoh wait thats all they do already oops
i think tier 2 navy ships would be a bad idea way to over poweredhowever oneoneone1 i seem to remember from an old database dump that there were supporting faction destroyers and tier 1 bcs i definitely remember seeing mordus legion versions of the cormorant and the feroxwould be a good incentive to get people out into lownull sec if these were only available from the shadier agents
aye they put all sorts of strange ships in the dd that never make it to tranqi remember seeing a pimp brutix got images of fist shapped ss with leopord skin paint job and pink fluffy adornments on the gun portsas long as they fall between tech i and tech ii damage commands they would no be op
covetor at mining barge v and astrogeology iv right now it requires both at 5 which is a bit over the top
im not a miner and i hate it but 1 good use of the tier 3 is that its cheap so if you get ganked in high sec you can replace it faster than your t2 variant same applies in lownull secso perhaps the tier 3 is not correctly viewed by the community lots of pirates and bad boys out there is that if they see a hulk afk they will probably try to gank it at that level you should know better than to go afk so this is not supported but i do understand the logic behind it you miners are not viewing it my way so your wrong
i support the general idea dont have enough insight to assess the proposed fix though
i dont see what youre trying to say this is not a proposal that will decrease the number of afk hulks available for ganking this proposal is to make the covetor a viable stop on the path to piloting a hulkas it stands retriever  covetor is a about a month of training and then covetor  hulk is two more days it makes no sense for people to purchase the thirdtier barge when theyll only be buying a hulk two days laterhowever people will still be training for the hulk because its still much better than the covetor
downtime maybe
nope just a network problem isp or your network
if you want to avoid it untick the reboot client on disconnect there is no afk timer for some odd reason which leaves just a client crash or connection drop on your endhonestly dont know why there is no afk timer in these energy conscious times surely the world would be an itsy bitsy better if people wre encouraged to turn off the 3400w computer once in a while

not supported the point of self destruct is to deny the enemy
thisthis is the same nerf self destruct whine that gets posted here every couple of monthsno
self destructing is a valid and strategic move although only pansies use itdont change anything about it except allow the killmail to go to whoever got the final hit off on the ship
rather nerf killmails
get a fast locker with you and lock his pod problem solved and  him off lol
noinstead give out empty killmails no fitting with the selfdestroyer as top damage dealer
self destruct should left no modules in the wreck also killmail should go to the highest dmg giver
you complain just because you missed out on a killmail really you made them lose their ship isnt that what you wantedselfdestruct serves another useful purpose the client is prepared for a session change so its more likely to escape in your pod consider it as a gentlemans acknowledgment that you beat himon the other hand it would make sense for a selfdestruct kill mail to mark the pilot that selfdestructed as dealing the final blow and others firing on him to be listed as damage dealers
of course its lame but thats why its so great its the last chance someone has to control how things occur if you cant field the dps to destroy a ship before it destructs you dont deserve the km
not supportedive never done it but i see it as a valid tactic and do not see that it needs to be changed in any way
requotedif you cant kill them before they selfdestruct you dont deserve the killmail pure and simple
i say apply same rules for killmail as if npcs laid the final blow yesincreasing the timer under agression is not good as self destruct is per design an anti griefing method it allows you to get free from a situation you cant otherwise escape eg if you are scrammed webbed permajammed but they dont kill your ship just hold you turning that from 2x 2mins into 2x 15mins is not good obviously
at first its not such a problem for people who have played for 6 months or lessbut after a year 2 years suddenly your address book is a total nightmarecurrently if your like me and im sure there are quite a few out there youll have lots of people and lots of enemies and lots of friends and random alts to track and you find yourself unable to sort them outyes you can create folders but you cant use them because the drag and drop feature wont let you scroll and if you right click theres no way to move said contact into the folderi think this problem is also present in the bookmarks section as welli propose that we be given the ability to right click any said items and relocate them to folders so us messy people can clean up our messesmake sense yesdiscuss
yes the ui could do with some love herei think if you double click a folder it breaks off into its own windownot sure if it works but have you tried breaking off the folders and dragging from the main window to the sub folders windowanyways some improvement would be good here
i was unaware of said feature ill confirm that when i get home from work todayyet im quite sure that can easily be classified as the yet not so obvious but should be in the ing manual feature
confirming using that double click feature extensively also works for bookmark folder assetsdeliveries personal and corp corp blueprint folders
fair enough 
lag is not a valid exuse for anybody else so why should you get away with itthis needs fixing
couldnt have put it better myself
be that as it may its the fault of ccp not the playerscant check right now does it at least warn you last i know you could write for ages and most would simply bit cut without warning

id say the current system is wholeheartedly floored and weak the shares really dont mean that much except for votes and a lot of their uses are implied rather than being that useful and functional they should be removed at a minimum and a different succession mechanism put in place before delving into the stock market there is no need for an childish attack on my ideas they are not silly at all the 10 to be eligable for a vote is a suggestion to simplify the the rights of investors it may turn out to be a dead end idea but its not silly grow upit maybe that stakeholders can relinquish voting rights if they do not care in day to day activities like a bank you also dont want every tom  and harry to have a vote because they have a share but also when someone has a significant proportion of your stock it makes sense they can have a say the 10 is merely a suggestion on a limit splitting stocks is a regular activity that occurs in stock exchanges regularly the current investors get a multiple of their existing shares say 2 for 1 allowing more liquidity in the market and positioning the share price to a more affordable level vodaphone regularly split its stock during the yearsif you dont think having a gamesupported functional share system tradable on the open market will not increase confidence in using shares then you are mistaken i suggested trading the stocks on the open market in my initial post contracts are horrid things to work with and need to be thinned out too in my opinionas for cleaning up the corporation window totally agree its a mess and the role configuration managementsimplification is more of a priority than sharesstocks

double posti feel like a dunce my last post was comparing bs to bs and battleships were not your concern when you raised this topic but my general argument still stands the pros of missiles vs its cons compared to the other races is acceptable
yeah the raven is not a bad shipyour eft numbers for dps get a 25 boost from the rof bonusi still think mega has the edge tbhswapping ammo in a rave takes 10 seconds per try and unless you have the right ammo loaded to start with you lose a hell of a lot of damage on target  either by swapping out or sticking with sub optimal ammoits hard to guess in battle whats gonna be the best type to unless you use split launchers and watch the log as the hit values come inin a gun boat you can see range and direction to target which are the priamry concerns for gun boatsi dont use ogres when flying a mega  i useually go with either praetor or berseker  but that just me i like to spread my damage types out as much as i can
i admit ive always been mildly irked by the idea that missiles need lower damage than guns because they can pick their damage types freelyand then caldari ships often lose a large chunk of damage by switching away from kinetic ammo it would be nice to see the missile bonus apply to all missiles the way gallente drone bonus applies to all drones and not just thermal drones but i dont know that the really sucky caldari ships hawk worm raptor nighthawk flycatcher are bad because of their kinetic bonus generally they are bad because of lack of fitting or because frigate missiles in general suck kinetic or noti dont know that this would really remedy any glaring balance issues seems more of a fixes nitpick issue

i had something typed up but then i realized saying it could get this thread deleted and my account temporarily banned such is the state of my confidence in ccp fairness ill just say thisits said the company is basically a lan party that got out of hand theres strengths and weaknesses in that one of the weaknesses  lan parties are cliques cliques pursue personal vendettas cliques dont like to punish their friends ia was created in part to mollify player concerns that ccp operated more as a clique than a company actions like what prompted this thread argue that ccp is still acting very much as a clique none of this affects me personally in the least its just kind of embarrassing to see
overwrought or not id rather not have ccp employees going around and trying to find out who active on private websites in this manner
sure
or i post a picture on forums and log ips accessing it your ip address isnt exactly private every internet advertising company has an enormous database with everywhere you go basicly to determine what to advertise although i dont think i have to explain pl anything about getting ip addresses
so you would be okay with another t20 like affair because you would rather ccp did not try to prevent itor do you have a list of private websites which should be exempt
there is a difference between ccp employees doing security stuff with the server log and isd volunteers doing it
i wonder how cyvoks connection is doing nowadays3 years away from the game after ther t20 fest and now this one week after i resubwtf
the sky is fallingmade up drama eve players love so much request it when youve a real reason and anyway youre not going to know anything they dont want you to know frankly you shouldnt its all in the contract you signup when you start playing there is the info on what data is compromised or not go read it and stop making up drama if privacy was so important or you where so scared in the first place you wouldnt give a private company your billing info but yo do so
sounds rather unprofessional
the problem isnt so much the fact ips have been exposed but that they can be linked topeoples billing addressesin game character namesaccounts on 3rd part websites like forumssomething that should in no way effect eve players in game now isand the fallout is people are being victimized because of in game events and allegiances because their identity in game has been linked with their identity out of game both in real life and on 3rd part websites this leak of what is in reality sensitive information in the context to which it was presented specific ip addresses of people accessing a 3rd party forum whom are eve players being run aganst irc records from coldfrontircnet the irc channel where people are have account issues on sisi dealt with that require telling someone from ccp sensitive information like account names has reportedly been occurring with full knowledge of isd and bh and ccp ginger
somehow i dont get it why someone would focus only on kugus forums and comparing to devblogsi mean wouldnt that mean that the person is against kugu forums and he wants to harm those forum users amd if ccp has known about it its more reasonable that they ordered it for some unknown reason instead to make their hands dirtybut then what they would use those ip for
kinda funny that the people who are in shock and awe and are going emo over it are the ones flaunting about how many forumsts they have access to mind you i do not at all condone whats stated in the op if it happened but pot kettle etc
not to mention the total and complete lack of common sensei maintain several forum boards now that are tied to eve but none of them are directly tied to the gamepeople who do not think things through when it comes to security refuse to accept responsibility for there stupidity instead they blame ccpthat and the fact this whole damn semithread is based on something isolated over isd and not the overall populationhell for all we know this probably started because someone stupidly clicked on a keylogger link
i am quite sure isd dont have access to billing addresses wtf should they do with them
as far as i know they dont but you can glean a lot about someones identity from an ip address sometimesadmittedly one is making the assumption that the individual that pays for his internet connection is the same person that plays eve but in any case thats likely still the address of an eve player isnt it
how do you get from ip address to billing address of isp only works if you got someone working at that ispaccess to their database but if you got that allready anyway then you dont need some ip addresses of people coming from a certain site since that is all allready known you cant just go from ip address to billing address if you could those antipirating organisations would have way easier task if not every isp would block their requests for addresses when they have only ip address
bumping this for great justicewe require more feedback d
uhh i usually turn my audio off in eve because its not good enough or i just use my mouth for various actions but thats not a good idea over time my monitor gets wet from my overly exagerated spitting so the only thing i can say about this is go watch some scifi shows like startrek for example thats the kind of immersion im talking aboutok sure its not very useful but i love the sounds in these sounds in these shows
i love you mazzedit and your ideas too
this sounds like a really good idea would simplify the process and should speed it up you would need a median price for these services but shouldnt be to hard to figure out maybe around 350m400m isk to transfer a toon which sounds about right since a gtc costs 35 us and 30 days sells around 300m isk
and just like they did with fan fest tickets so the code is there or should be trivial to code great idea
hiya astro
aye to the minmatar race

i have to agree on this ccp almost never follows player requests even very well thought out and discussed ones such as this but rather their own idiosyncratic logic and my biggest fear is that ccp will do something like the falcon nerf in the form of one element being improved such as the 50 arty clip size although this alone would be a good startccp have consistently disregarded the minnie bses and large projectiles over several years now while other fotms come and go
supportedi actually think linos pretty spot on
youre implicitly assuming that eves social and moral structure is anything like that of western sururbiait isnt
let me demonstrate a use of a war dec tactic thats not griefingcorp a lives in dead end system and minesrats all day its a high sec system so when corp b moves in and encroaches on their source of income they have a dispute corp a war decs corp b and chases them out of their territory and continues to profitand that my friend is how you use a war dec get what you want make others suffer welcome to evepersonally i view war decs as a way to prevent bordom by killing idiots like you
i dont think so the wormhole is just a natural phenomena that connect 2 distant spaces so you traveled through the wormhole and you got in a far away solarsystem thats allyou cant live inside a wormhole
ok ill bite lets get ccp to give carebears 5 systems where they cant be ganked and war decs dont apply enjoy the lag and enjoy beating 10000 other players to the belts before there stripped good luck enjoy
well at least id know where all the suicide gankers will be
you can however look like an overeducated idiot by arguing semantics that arent even important to the conversation at hand seriously give it a rest i refer to it as living inside a wormhole too people knew what he meant and thats really the important part about communication innit
your reasoning is horrible but i agree not for the reasons youve listed but because the whole mechanic is broken no one has come up with a decent balanced fix for this mechanic so i dont see why we need to keep itand before someone says wardecs are fine let me list some points1 corp hopping2 npc corps3 no consequences for either side i dont give a rats bum about real life  eve wars should have consequences4 neutral remote reppers5 alliances multiple problems here6 wardec limit7 wardec price structuredo i need to list more problems as op metioned there are other waysplaces to get your fix imo all this mechanic does is create more lag in highsec empire those that ought to move on because they want pew pew wont and those that stay because they dont want to pew pew keep encourage the others to stay remove the mechanic and the problem is gone simplewant the mechanic back fix it
you would be the last person id expect to support thisyet your logic is scary it makes senseproblem is it will never fly but im sure you knew that
i would maybe support this if in exchange all l4 missions and all asteroid belts are removed from hisec and alliances with 00 sovereignty are allowed wardecs within empire
ccp should make a pve server so they can dump players like the op there instead of letting them pollute tranq

no thanks mayhaps take a look at this link my good sir
im just puzzled as to how you actually got someone who isnt an alt to give support to this thread how did that happen
in this case i am not just talking about graphical effects i am talking about actual physical effects to players ships in specific areas this was mentioned some time last year during fanfest i think dont quote me on thatwhere nebulas asteroid fields would have tactical meaning to them what i am suggesting here is to add effects to specific areas of space but nowhere as drastic as the ones that are found in some wormhole space but just enough to give that extra bit of edge for people who know an area for example in specific areas of space for a few systems it looks like your in the middle of a nebula and is unique to that specific area of space so for instance for one constellation it may be in a nebulae that reduces sensor efficency and reduce lock times and lock range by a small amount say 5 or in some areas may effect shields reducing sheild recharge by 3 or something for a certain area smaller concentrated areas of nebula like the ones you find in deadspace areas could have more sever effects from the reguler constalation wide or regional onesanother environmental effect could be in a certain radius from planets where the gravitational forces could start coming into play so for instance when your in the gravitational pull from a planet there could be a speed and agility reduction penalty due to the extra thrust needed to stay on the currant course witch would be more of a problem for ships with a larger mass but less of a problem for smaller craft with less mass giving an advantage to smaller ships this can occour alot while fighting at stations poss and outposts due to them being nearer a moon or planet different planets would have a different level of effect based on the size and type of planetthese are just a few examples of passable uses of environmental effects others could include thermal resist reduction while flying close to a sun effects from the deployment of titans on the field from the large gravity well they are supposed to generate witch might make fcs think twice on deploying multiple titans on the fieldof course alot of the suggested are open to debate and i believe it would be something very much worth while seeing in eve giving space a more unique feel to areas of space and give an advantage to people who know an area well
mostly because of two things  most drakes i meet out there are failfits  because they are flown by mission runners npcers and caldari nubbins which is the most common type of nubbin in game  and the drake itself is one of the meaner battlecruisersso battleclinic only ranks you according to the last year last ive seen it doesnt  im 121st or so and i havent been playing in the last 9 monthsthe selection criteria for best pilots skewers the data since it includes trainingetc choices made before the rather significant changes in evec can be proven by testing  running the numbers  results of skilled pvp fits vs skilled pvp fits in fact it is rather obvious from the spreadsheet unless you really insist on claiming the bellicose is a better ship then the blackbird in which case i must conclude your trolling score is not that bad at all
right ok i think i understand what your sayinglet me just clarify something herethe data set i drew from bc was the data set of kills and losses of competent pvprs im gonna call them top guns from now on so i have to type less textthe kills column is kills with ie kills the top gun has achived while flying a drake not number of drakes killed by top gunthe losses column is number of drakes lost by the top gunso both kills and losses of the drake relate to the drake been flown by the top gunthe choice of top gun known ships data should minimise the numeber of fail fits in the data for any ship typebattleclinic ranks you on all data available over however many years youve been playingthe known ships data  from which i drew the raw data goes back 1 yearthe best pilots are likely to have more sp than the average player and are more likely to be cross trainedlots of the raw data grabs shows pilots in multiple race shipsthere maybe some lag in the data due to trained skills  but this dataset should minimise it compared to a dataset of average playersbb a good ship  the ship otherwise know as primary bang dead 
do you know why blackbirds get primariedhint its not because they are worse than bellicoses
the top ranked players on battleclinic are mostly solo pvpers as well which would heavily skew the results considering that gallenteminmatar tend to be alot better for solosmall gang
so you get better results if you fly something largely useless to comparison to its peers but ninja yourself on killmails and gtfo in trouble rather then fly something which is so useful that switching primaries to it if youre in any position to fire on it eg in range fast enough etc is a nobrainer interesting idea of what is a superior shipobviously the bellicose needs a heavy nerf to be on par with the blackbird may i suggest 20level ecm strenght bonus and two more mids in fact i fully support that nerf to the entire minmatar ship line well suck because were instaprimary
i think your completely missing the pointthe bb is can only ever be considered a good ship when some one else is flying itit the noob meat shield ship of choice uses its mids for ecm and is left with what 2 low slots to tank with maybe bb would be a better ship if it had less mids and more lowsi offer it as proof positive that the data set works before you saw its position in the list you considered it a good ship lmao
op should try actually playing the game instead of playing with numbersnot supporting
thank you for the flamebump
the blackbird is a very capable ship with ecm bonuses equal to its bigger less mobile and more tankable cousin the scorpion please go and fly this ship before you make a claim that this is not a good shipalso would like to add that the only statistic worth while in this topic so far is that out of 64 replies there are 2 supports one of you and one guy who did it for the lolsi suggest you just drop this topic as your not getting anywhere when you try and defend these current statistics
the fact that you dont know how good the blackbird is is proof positive that your statistics are flawed and is almost certainly indicative of your ulterior motives for posting this thread
woa your analysis method is so bad clearly proven by the ranking you present it leaves me speechlessstatistics are not just a bunch of numbers the method in acquiring these is crucial to give them meaningnot supported obviouslyedit about the blackbird it shows your lack of knowledge while choosing your method it is hands down the best ship in its class t1 ewar cruisers you can field being shot down first in a fight is a clear indicator for that and it gets a bad ranking for being primaried method is fail qed
amarr have been fotm for quite a while now and most caldari ships die to pilot errors range is importantthat said  not supportedstill waiting for your first useful suggestion or is it all about trolling
amarr bs are fine amarr caps are fine amarr bc are fine amarr have one of the best hacs in the game amarr cruisers have issues mostly because of the silly tier cruiser system and the omen being strapped for fitting in a bad way the punisher is actually decent as long as it uses auto cannons instead of traditional amarr weaponry vengeance and malediction kinda suck but thats because rockets suck now caldari have some fail ships in every category seemingly but also some good ships in most categories as long as you arent trying to solo in them they also have issues with frigs and crusiers not being as good as they could be due to the tier system really the bigest caldari fail ships are their frigates because frigate missiles sytems are terrible rockets are bad all around standard missiles are too hard to fit this causes issues with the hawk crow and flycatcher the raptor is bad because it has way too little powergrid
tbh the days of the bleeder punisher are over for some time now with the changes to warp scramblers and taking into account the fact it is slow and only has 2 mids i prefer small pulses these days for their rangecap usage would be the only real reason for autocannons with frigate lvl5 and decent gunnery skills it is almost negligible
the only people who fly bbs are noobs who dont know any better and paupers who cant afford a falconthe only time there anygood is when you have lots of them and not so many opponents  they die far too easilly in fact i have to say ive never met a bb i didnt killyour misconception that there good is probably based on you  not flying a bb  being protected by naive corp  alliance members flying them to provide you with ew and taking fire ahead of whatever ship you are flyinglike i said bbs are good when there flown by someone elsedrop this thread after 3 days  dream on
i guess thats why you see so many former falcon pilots switching over to blackbirds these days
the analysis is fine 95 of the ships are in the ranking exactly where youd expect to find them there may be some weird out of place due to small sample size  supercaps  and a few like the bb which are counterintuitive at first glance3 days i think this thread has generated more pure rant hatred than the rest of threads in the forums put together the real problem here is not the stats  there just numbers farmed from bcthe problem is people egos  mostly mini  wont allow them to accept the truththe truth being that there not flying the worst ship  split damage whines  large ac comparison to blaster whines  there actually flying the best ships
and thats exactly the point these numbers are by no means statistics they are just random numbers pulled from bc then you apply some unfounded conversion to get other numbers and present them as statisticsif you want to make proper statistics you need a sound concept of converting the original data which you clearly are lackingjust to give an example what im talking about taking kills with a ship and comparing it against losses to create a efficiency ranking is completely bogus you are ignoring the fact that the truly efficient ships are being shot down firstif we are applying stochastics to the problem we will find that actually being shot down a lot while being used a lot is stochastically strongly dependant to good efficiency in other words your efficiency ranking is backwards
ever heard of cost vs efficiency seeing as your that much into numbers i would think so the blackbird performs well for its costa smart bb pilot will jam you and stay out of scram range and never engage solo they are support ships not primary attack vesselsi primarily fly recon ships and heavy interdictors over other ships i think i have seen my share of playing the ewsupport role however this is not about my personal preference now is itnow they suddenly are good or are you refraining to me because i know absolutely nothing about pvp because my battleclinic stats arent as polished those statistics could say more about how much time i actually spend on eve than how much i understand about ittime shouldnUFFFDt be the argument to drop it the statistics should what are you gaining from this people with half a brain are not going to support your statistics thats all it is no idea just statistics and these statistics are not realistic either
1 yes dude the bbs score is made up of one component  taking its own stats into account  and 1 component which uses the stats of other ships in its group as wellno part of a ship score compares it against more expensive or cheaper shipswhile effectivness will be lower for cheaper ships  it will be lower for all ships in its groupcost of ships will not introduce racial bias into the data2 i was not refering to you personally i have no idea what your bc stats showi was refering to the blackbird as a ship that is good when it is flown by another personie it is a nice ship to have along in a group  but no one in there right mind should be volunteering to fly it as there gonna get primaried and blown to pieces3 of course times important  i knew this was tinfoil hat territory before i postedpeople are gonna try to shout it down and not let it get a fair hearing  especially mini pilotsthere afraid if this topic starts getting support there ships might get nerf batted  which is not what i am asking forlook at the posts so far  in 3 days ive been asked twice now to take it downmost people are just ranting flaming and baiting hoping they can cause enough noise to make assesment of the information as difficult as possible
the stochastical analysis of the ships and all there parameters  im not going to list them  and any unknowns such as ecm successfailure and random gun hit success  x1  x2  x3  plus disconnect and any other unforseen circumstances has allready been performed on the tranquility clusterall we need to do is take the results of that stochastics analysis in the form of kills  losses of ships and look at themin order to look at them some simple statistical analysis is needed in order to make sense out of widley divergent sample sizes for different shipsthere is no need to do 2 stochastical analysies
uhm the results from fights on tq are not a stochastic analysis they can be used as base data to perform such an analysis but it has to be done properly or it is meaninglessany such analysis would require you to investigate the meaning and relationship of the original data you didnt do that what you did is just randomly converting the numbersplus your method of selecting the initial samples is questionable at bestreally if you arent prepared to do it properly this just looks like a troll threadedit i already said it earlier your method to produce your efficiency rating is flawed due to highly efficient ships obviously being taken out first in a fight why dont you pick up on that and prove me wrong
agreed some method of tracking at least lost fighters would be awesome
kill mails for drones tooand dont forget the poor missiles that get smartbombed before they reach there target we need kms for these too
a method to track fighter losses is needed desperately
bump
the entire user interface is horrible tbh let us now ponder the what 22 months of amazing jumping windowsstill this would be an improvement
needed
i hate the tiny overheat button its caused me all kinds of headache
supported buttons too tiny and green bah must be easy to come up with a better interface for this
supported we could really use a second light or something to indicate that the module will overheat when the cycle ends and then the current light to tell us the module is in the process of overheating
agreed that the ui for overheating is not very user friendly
supported
as it stands defender missles all target the closest incoming missle no matter how many defender missles are fired once the incoming missle is destroyed the remaining defender missles allready in flight do not find another target and become useless this makes defender missles not used very much at all if you make it so that defender missles either all go after a different target or automatically find another target if the target they where going after is destroyed they would be far more usefull and would actually be a valid option for pilots to equip them
defenders missiles are broken period they can be used yes but their functionality is an utter joke ccp hasnt made any changes to defender missiles in over two years and the one change they did make only broke them furtherdefenders need either a specific function while loaded or a specific launching device that is turnonandforget currently once you activate a launcher loaded with them they fire nonstop until there are no missiles in space and then shuts off you have to remember to reactivate once a new salvo is coming at youlikewise because they move 12kms they simply will not hit anything thats launched within 2030km they overshoot the target missile and by the time they redirect youve been hit
i think missiles are fairly well balanced right now with defender missiles as they are i dont see a reason to make defender missiles betterthe exception is frigate sized missiles which suffer from excessive fitting costs standard missiles to all round suckitude rockets
how about removing defender missiles outright no longer allowing vulnerability to sbs and fixing tds and tcs insteadnot supported
i think its funny to see all the people crying carebear tears here both piwates and real bears keep crying about their lownullsec going kaput and all of them direct the starters and supporters of this topic towards the wormholes you know where this idea started yup down in the unknowneven more funny is that in the wormholes you actually see both pirates and carebears all doing their thing and there people are not running around like headless chickens but are making coordinated moves together with friendsin the current lowsec people arent even looking at their overview or scanner they trust the info that local gives them 2 scary pirates 1 macro and 3 carebears in system only then they start scanning to link ship types to the namesi would like to see local chat removed indeed it would make the game more fun more interesting and definitely more scary whether a system is empty or not you should fly through it with the same caution that raven you have on scan you should not know if its a pirate or a carebear until youre right next to itbtw the fact that a removelocal topic gets created almost every week says enough i think
how many of these fail threads will you people create before you get the hint local isnt going to be removed from low and null sec get used to itme and my corp could just as easily go out with alts and create daily threads that demand elves and magic be introduced into eve would that make the argument valid does that mean its what the general playerbase in eve wantsthe frequency of threads about one topic doesnt mean its right
my proposal is actually quite simplemake it so a player cannot change the name of a contract when linkedof course they will then link a contract and type in local that is something else yes the block button is a viable option still but if you made it so single items like a raven contract cannot be renamed as a caldari navy raven in a scam then it ultimately saves on the database because you can block them without opening the contract in the first place thus reducing load on the market hubs
theres this thing that people do cant recall what it is has something to do with looking or is it seeing or is itoh yeah its called reading
dont click accept on contracts if you are not able to read for what ever reason drunk stoned too tirednot support
i will offer you some advice to avoid these scams without any changes required on ccps part at all1 click link for contract2 dont click accept yet3 click show info next to the items being sold4 answer the following question is this what i thought i would be buying5a if 4  yes proceed to step 65b else  mock scammer  proceed to step 86 answer the following question is the price what i thought i would be paying7a if 6  yes click accept7b else  mock scammer8 close contract9 move on with lifeas a side benefit you will also stop being ridiculed in the assembly hall by those of us who follow the above process
tbh im all up for removing the scam spammage no i have never been scammed but i dont think this is the solution contract scam spam is like all the rubbish i used to get in my post box its annoying and theres just no way to make it stop
yes stop the spam but not the scam as its a coughlegitimate business in the world of eve
its useless full of garbage and useless tropics lets remove it or make it able to post only directors and ceos from corporations
only open to ceos sounds good to me 
very good idea i agree also players caught using false corps just to be a ceo and post on the forum with alts should incur a forum ban
ceos only sounds good i like it 
add cp to the list of useless forums and you have my votethe way i see it caods just a cp but for corps and alliances instead of just individuals but in the end they both serve no purpose other than for epeen stroking remove them both i say this game could do much better without these forums though i suspect the vermin would just move into gd 
the whole ceosdirectors only idea is just silly since the only thing it would do is create a little cocoon in addition to caod or are you saying ccp should start locking and banning all discussions about corps and alliances not done by the leaders not bloody likely since their goal is to encourage social connections and trying to get people to join player corps the discussions by rabble about corpsalliances has to happen somewhere and it might as well be caodno if you are going to put the ceos only limit then most ceos should be able to post im a ceo of a very serious rp corp and should therefore be allowed to post there ccp should not discriminate against small corp ceos ccps forums are for all players but if you dont like the community here please make your own forums and continue the discussion there you can kick and ban everyone you like there but ccp should not get involved with such foolishness
this would make a drone boat of every shipnot supported  drone user 
many ships are balanced around the size of their drone bays larger bays giving ships greater fleixbility and staying power than ships with smaller bays trying to remove drone bay size as a limiter seems like it would involve a host of balancing issues so i see no reason to attempt it unless it provides an equally large benefit
actually if you wanted to fix it youd have fixed eject from cargo bay anything jettisoned from the cargo bay gets ejected into a can you can eject a drone from the drone bay and it be a scoopable drone that you can scoop to your cargo bay or drone bay you cannot eject a drone from the cargo bay and scoop to drone bay if you could then op we would have his wish and we wouldnt even have this thread to chat in
im not proposing all stations kick you outbut if you undock and fly away from a station you should actually move away from the station docking games are out of control and this is the largest factor whyi know this topic has prolly been done to death but the reason that its been done to death is because its an issueedit forgot to support my own post this started off on the wrong foot already
its a 2 way street pal the docking games also have a 2nd player you failed to mention the station camperam i saying its not a problem no but it takes 2 to tangopvp
as the ceo of a small corp i find that one of the tasks i use the most time on is locking down and unlocking bpos to be able to lock down a new bpo i have to do the following1 attempt to start a research job or the like with the bpo with a char that has no research slots available so the job does not start this process includes several accept windows about 10 mouseclicks2 propose a lockdown vote3 vote4 waitas the majority stockholder i would like to have an extra rightclick option for bpos  only open for ceos fx called majority lockdown the effect of the option would be to make the bpo locked down in one simple move instead of the 10 or so mouseclicks i have to do now just to be able to propose the lockdown voteso in essence  if you support a one click majority lockdown rightclick option for ceos vote in support of this topicthank youamanda
yes bronte
its funny you said that ive actually used a playbook program to help explain game plans to people before but its so hard to spread them corpwide and and impossible for alliances unles you force them all to do one and give you all their emailsgrrr i like your idea in the long term but for now id even settle for a beefed up specialized linkable paint program with built in symbols with the option to import more it would need infinite scroll grid lines and the abilty to have pages and of course text then a corp could link them in corp and alliance and practice them even when the coach aint on
oh yeahbig thumbs up
you might be thinking a bit ambitious in how it would work  automatic target splitting for jammer seems a bit crazy to me that said i like the idea ive heard something similar on the strategic scale is planned as part of ambulation though id definitely like it if a tactical version existed too supported
there will be a fleet finder addition to dominion so were going to see many more randomly collected fleetsgangs in eve soon most of them will probably not have an experienced fleet commander but even those who do could benefit from a battleplan program in eve to make sure that even not so experienced pilots in the fleet can carry out complex maneuvres simply because they will have instructions on their screensalso if battleplans could be created and sold by players imagine what kind of profit alliances like pandemic legion could make selling their battleplans
sounds interesting
t1 cruisers need to become a viable option again denying a whole shipclass their role in the tournament makes for less variation and thus less entertaining fights
 the process for getting a slot in the alliance tournament needs review  the qualifiers need video streams i would not object to paying 25 usd for the video of all three weeks any more and id just wait for the youtube videos even if i were paying i would have no problem keeping the present format  two weeks of remote commentators and then the final week with the studio onsite experts and game designers visiting im not sure what i think about the two hull types limit maybe restrict it to only certain ship classes in a previous tournament i loved seeing a team of 10 thoraxes fightformatting edit
up id like at least one csm member to notice this thread considering its pretty much agreed upon and nobody seems to have any objection its something that can easily be changed and doesnt require much conversation at all but if someone objects with a reason please post why
tcs as well as tds are scripted to perform one function range or tracking as well which is working as intended however the differences between td and tc performances are disproportional also for affecting range or tracking falloff is part of range so it must be included on both modulesdo you know what else is targeted and their counter is not thats right sensor dampsboostersyessignature radius will no longer be an issue i dont know when maybe dom but the archaic fail of radius comparison will be removededitwtf does that have to do with anything
yes these should have been fixed when tds got fixed providing the same boost to optimalfalloff just like tds remove thembut its being looked at with the projectile buff they planned i think
i think it would look nice if we warped to 0 at a planet it should look like this
that is what the planets in dominion will look likesort of anyway
the reason super carriersmoms arent flown is because they cant be docked and 90 of eve isnt willing to sign away thier freedom for a kick a shipmy proposal allow them to dock at a 00 outpost in a special way with the use of a mothership docking arraysteps to dockingwhen a mothership warps to a station it can check to see if there are any docking array spaces availableif there are then the pilot is informed where the open array is and heshe must navigate their ship to that location be it with a warp off warp in or a little manual drivingonce they are within 1000m of their docking array they can select begin docking procedures as an option this would be similar to the dock button but it would take maybe 5 minutes for the ship to be navigated into its place this would in effect be a cool down period to avoid abuse of docking gamesonce the ship is docked and has been maneuvered into the docking array it is now invulnerable to attack as it is protected by the docking array forcefielda pilot now has the option to exit the ship into their hanger the ship now is docked up the pilot must give a docking code this code must be entered before the ship can be reenteredundocking your mother shipas i said before the mom will be visible from outside the station and in a new in station service mothership docking array your mom will be listedto reenter your mother ship you must open the service by clicking its button just like opening the insurance service select your mothership enter its boarding code and vuala you are once more strapped to the side of the station in your shiny mothership now simply select undock and your ship will be released from the docking array and your free to go on your wayif you want to let someone else fly it give them the code they can select it from the station service and be on their waythe docking array and the moms in it moms in the docking array are invulnerable yes invulnerable if its latched onto the side of the station its safethe docking array would have about the same health as a medium posif the docking array is blown up guess what nothing is holding your mothership to the station so it drifts off into space where anyone with the proper skills can board itif the station is captured then the ships are safe for 24 hours then they are no longer protected and may be boarded by the new inhabitants of the stationlet the array be upgradeable so at lvl1 2 moms can be docked at lvl2 5 moms can be docked and lvl3 10why can moms dock and my titan cant titan pilot tears better then carebear  because moms are 35km long titans are 1518km long big fing differencethis is just my personal proposal to make super carriermotherships more used ingame hopefully it gets enough support that i will eventually fly a hel
wrongo they are not flown because they are not worth it
the short answer nosorry but no
nah pretty sure more important reason is that you need an alt for them enough people with too much isk would get a mom instead of carrier if they could just dock them
yep remove the pain of trying to find out where you are exactly setting your clone
but they are in local when he not playing so he is in safe because noone can catch him easy for cloaking when no one can catch him they just reserve the server capacity when they not playing yes not need to make against afk cloakers if the cloaked ship catchable but now everyone use the cloak on ceptor to capitalthis is the second problem would be logical if just the cloak ships reconcovopssbblack ops can just use it themi knows the 00 players always cry for some eploits and easy lurking but this is bllsht we need back the old times when those players who was afk minimum 30 minutes the server kicked them play or go out dont waste the costly server times
wrong forum dear i think you wanted coad one tick upthere is no need to introduce fuel for cloaks when we already have the capacitor to build onmake cloaks draw a constant amount while operating with covops drawing considerably less to allow for extended cloaked operationscombine it with capacitors not recharging while cloaked including gate cloak and people have to decloak once in a while to rechargeno more cloaked ravens capitals afkers  with new probes the small window is more than adequate for a hit provided you have a general location of victimclienthostileremoving local wouldnt make sense as ccp has used the gates internal communications as a reason for local in their wh fiction  where gates exists local existswould be nice if nullsec was delayed though a three to four minute delay applicable to all parties with a sovereignty holder able to online a module to cut it in half for his side  not safe but safer
to be honest i like the complete immunity i get with on a covertops frigate in hostile space i havent seen a single good argument so far as to why that should change
this and also remove local in highsec
not supported deal with cloakers grow some balls
cloakers have balls  everyone knows the story is not the afk cloak and everyone know the 00 players why dont wanna changeswho using them  pilots who using cloak for belt ratting for anomaly for plexing in 00 cloak on ishtarcloak on ceptorcloak on everything lol in 00oh yes they using cloak and they cry a river against ccp and players who want to change the cloak mwd tricks afk cloak cloak on not cloak user ship rules better if you dont speak from balls and dont speak the other 00 coward lurkerthis cloak rules need to change want to use cloak  do it if you sit in covops or recon but forget it if you fly with a hac

this is currently on the test server 
i was showing the area of the ui interface that would benefit from updating its huecolor to blue
i support this however doubt it will get past csm and if it goes that far past ccpthis is more of an issue of sales rather than gameplay if such a problem existed which it does then it should have been addressed several years back when this was occurring ccp has the add a response for why your leaving eve online as a customer if it was due to this reason then you should have ticked the button which says customer support lacks year 5 education buttonwith that said here are a few more things ccp should dodisclose all petitions to the public in an archiveallow gms to be more flexible in their decisions based on the ethical thing to doactually pay attention to the rating systemive given 0s for all but one petitionactually pay attention to why your losing customersallow volunteers to assist in the process for lowmoderate complaints ie reimbursements of less than 5m etcfix the issue before actually moving to another petition  petitions should take no more than a day to fix not 1 weekfurthermore since its impractical to have csm decide this due to the complexity and amount of work that should be done to this on a regular basis this should be solely placed in the hands of a ccp employee or form a committee solely to deal with petition rules  policies
not sure why it is not already so
yes pls
supported hell yesthis
support for diversitywould be good if mission arcs are started by random events like that it could even go as far as when youre waiting for a pvp gang to fleet up an npc navy raven comes landing in asking if your fleet would be interested in assisting it in a battle with gallente scum with insane loot and isk for those involvedhowever back to your topic faction spawns already do happen in highsec which are pleasant surprises ive got faction ammo and t2 salvage worth 5m from faction frigs in 05 space on a asteroid belt and the hauler spawn is a nice bonus but im all for more
id buy a navy cane if it just had the sleipnirs paintjob and a extra slot  bit more ehp hardly op except looks wise
does it really take this long to redact and censor a document
gm waiting times down dont be absurd takes me 24 to 48 hours just to get a copy paste answer let alone to actually talk to someone i pretty much given up lol i dont bother with petitions its pointless and usually a complete waste of my time
probably insider information or somethingprobably depends on what section you are filing in stuck petitions are really fast billing also fast but not instantaneous reimbursement petitions well they take a while
confirming that gm response time and petition resolution sucks
ccp is not going to revert the scanner back to the old one
this is absurd capital ships able to repair drones the mere thought of it is heresy and those heretics who have supported this will be burned by the empressthat said i support this however such an option should cost carrier pilots money or resources to repair said dronesthat said if resources are required to repair those drones a drone repair bay should be established giving carrier pilots another cool bay to store stolen resource stuff or not stolenalternatively if you like annoying us cool folks who drive capitals just charge on a amount of repairs done so it matches station repair rates or higher but never lower the staff you hire on your carrier arent more compentant than those in the station
i like it
increase all missile damage by 510 change caldari missile damage bonuses to explosion velocity 23
bump kinda disappointed this hasnt been mentioned at the meetings just needs a csm to bring it up to shine some light on the problem so that progress can be made
hmm interesting idea given the game has a pretty wide spectrum of possible activities can indeed see potential here to get at least part of the game contents accessibility improved without unreasonable efforts
latest csm response on this issue over in speakers corner
jesus christ
thats one way of puttin itgo voice your opinion in that thread as to what the csm should be addressin its pretty obvious theyre ignorin whats goin on in this threadif you already have a thumbs up here make sure the csm dont forget over in their topics to discuss this weekend
fix the scanner im sure you can come up with a better idea than the current scanner
really needs fixing asap csm ignoring this urgend issue makes me sadthe high cpu load with the macros spamming scan for hostiles can easily avoided while keeping some delay for 360 scans like one second but removing it entirely again for 90 60 30 etc narrow scans
what the hells wrong with you csmtoo afraid to walk back to ccp and tell them that the answer wasnt good enoughif you have no idea how directional scanner works then carry on your merry way
im a ratter killer the nano nerf almost broke me it became much harder to solo and harder to catch ratters in belts i adaptedthis 2 second delay is something that cant be adapted to i can no longer jump into a system and find that ravens belt in under 5 seconds i used to pride myself on my ability to use the directional scanner its a skill that is often overlooked in pvp now scanning out a ratter is utterly frustrating and most of the time pointlessi could deal with a delay a 1 second delay maybe the problem bigger then that is that if you try to scan before the 2seconds are complete then the delay restarts here is a scenario i scan and see a raven no poses 4 belts equally distant i narrow to 90 and attempt to wait 2 seconds then scan again woops i clicked a fraction of a second before the delay ended now i have to wait another full 2 seconds by the time i find the ratter hes already warping off clicking the scan button and getting no results should not restart the delay does clicking jump on a gate restart the session change timer no why not just make the scan take that much time to display results like is done with probes then there would be some sort of feedback to the user that its ok to scan again the current system is broken and needs fixing
then suggest changes from the crap that it is nowthere has to be some way of keeping the lag down without us using the horrifically broken improved scanner

whilst not being a scanner monkey myself i have people for that dammit i dont see any reason why pvp hampering would make sense to anyone least of all ccp since they effectively feel that eve is a pvp game be it combatindustrymarket competitionetcnow if ccp have said they arent going to revert the change then perhaps they need to consider once again reexamining the entire scanning methodology even if that means creating two entirely seperate scanning systems one for wormholesplexsetc and one for shipsnot that im endorsing that as an idea its just a suggestionem

old settings back pls
in their handling of the scanner issue ccp has proven themselves to be minmatar  but incompetant minmatar most likely ammatar but thats besides the point when a minmatar engineer sees a leaky pipe he quickly sizes up the problem and applies a suitable amount of ducttape sufficent to stop the leak ccp apparently fixes the leak by shutting off the entire plumbing systemim grateful for the efforts ccp has made to reduce lag and the results have been a generally improved playing experience but in this case the fix makes an important aspect of the game almost entirely unplayable coming up with a remedy for this should be a very high priority i realize that there are plans for an eventual overhaul of the scanner system but players need scanners to work passably well now not in 68 months

fyi im keeing my eye on this topic  but i want some clarification from ccp at fanfest before deciding if should bring it to the agenda

dierdra i really appreciate the supporthowever right before you have the csm meeting this weekend i want you to go thumbcounting for all the topics you are actually discussingdo all of those topics combined even come close to this onebring this up at that meeting whether its been approved or not
holy monkey my faith in csm has partially been restoredwe realize it will be hard to persuade ccp to completely reverse the change but that doesnt mean it shouldnt be attemptedthen there is option 2 of adjusting current change most commonly people ask for reduced delaybut there are also other ways to adjust it removing annoying popup message scan button unclickable when in those 2 seconds scanner not automaticly scanning when you change scan angleif rumours about revamping scanner in whole are true ccp could at least make waiting for it little less frustrating and adjust this scanner change abit
old settings and old cyno jump effect back pls
yep
if it means ccp disclosing more i support itas for drake your either an idiot or have your own agenda linking you to ccp because the more information you have the better your futures decisions will be only if such an action produced more work or gave you less of an advantage would place you in opposition of this request
as ive been following this thread on shc for a long time i whole heartedly support these changes
simply one word to this nocsms absolutely need term limits without limits all it would take is some major alliance say goonswarm to flex its voting muscle and keep the same donothing yahoos in the csm position indefinitelysuggesting no term limits smacks of corruption
as many have said no to this  cant support corruption and that is what your doing by increasing the term limitpresidentsprime ministers are restricted to limited terms because of the ability for corruption furthermore parties are often altered over decades to prevent the corruption of one party to support this would be to destroy the very foundation on which the csm was made that is a council for the players of evefurthermore it was ridiculously for someone such as yourself to bring this up one only needs to read the words csm under author and the topic to know that something is wrong with this topic csm should never have the ability to debate this topic or have any significant say over the matter such decisions should be left to a third party in our case ccp or if need be the players however since it is ccps interest to get players ideas it should be left with them to make any real decision as to thistopic listed 2 states that incumbents are observed on contributions this has many forms and therefore would need clarification furthermore contributions can be negative and promoted based on selfinterest this is not in the interests of ccpso to clarify no to supporting this its ccps decision and not the players allowing such an atrocity only opens up an avenue for corruption
so thankfully someone else in corp raised this to the attention of everyone as since im not a big forum dweller i never noticed it was being discussedso quick reponse oh dear frakking god no its a god awful ideademocracy as laid down by the us administration has a 2 term limit and when all is said and done it works ill point at all the issues with 2 terms of dubya and say no morein democractic countries where there are not term limits we get situations like the thatcher years here in the ukanyone with any sense will vote against this as being an all round terrible ideaem
crap you remind me of someone and i cant quite place itits that stupid sig oh right obamaill bet my life savings 300lol that obama tries the same thing
my vote is to keep the term limits that way we will keep cycling through new people and perhaps well eventually come up with a set who actually serves as a voice for the playerskinda like the million monkey approach to writing literature but in slow motion right now were still in the monkey stage but eventually perhaps well end up with shakespeare

i dont think you really know what is happening around you lino lickerin australia sydney specifically there are gangs where the police ignore what they do as long as they dont become publicly involved which is understandable why stop people killing each other when both sides equally want to kill each other and you the third party have no opinion as to either side should you then risk your life to stop them noon the the issue of wardecs they play a pivotal role in eve online by hampering empire trading etc corporations have to find other ways around this hide their logistics alts etc  this adds to the spy marketthus not supported
wardecc mechanic is definitely flawed but it has to be there its what eve is pvp in one form or anotherthe mechanic however is geared towards free piracy a grief corp wardeccing industrials to get easy low risk kills if yuo were to look at all the wardeccs currently in game i would expect well over 50 to be pvp corps wardeccing industrial corps to epeen their killboardsthis is basically the problem yes you should be able to wardecc a corp but there needs to be a way to make sure that war is valid in some way not just a grief attack on a randomly chosen industrial corphow to do this is a problem but in my opinion it needs to be looked at wardeccs actually make people stop playing and people may say ahh goodbye and good riddance carebear the simple fact is too few players  goodbye eve onlineso what we need is valid ways to make wardeccs a mechanic that works for the reason it was intended not as a grief mechanicone idea may be bad but at least its an ideahave corporation security status maybe a concord status if youwardecc a corporation with a status thats high your corp takes a security hit and like normal security status if your corp status goes below the limits for each system you cant access that systemso grief corps would lose status fast and therefore have to target corps in lower and lower securityon top of this there should be some way of having a totally valid war that is not subject to the above rules ie maybe a corp member is killed in lowsec or by a suicide team whatever the agrieved corp could then wardecc the offending corp without any penaltysomething like this anyway some way to stop wardeccs as a simple grief mechanic

i think what he means is that it doesnt make sense for concord and the like fiction background and story wise to allow corporations to kill each other in high secwhich makes sense but it doesnt make sense because well if the factions are at war with each than what the hell is concord there instead of killing everyone and making the peace across the galaxy under an iron fist of insta kill shipsor rather why doesnt the npc factions employ concord ships in the first place and if concord is so effective in high sec then why are their npc rats in high secit makes no senseso inclusion might as well leave high sec war dec in simply because nothing else makes sense eitheroh and you must aquit
forgot to support my own topic oo lol
if theyre going to do something like this it should be the same way they did it with wormholes  big unmistakable things in the sky that tell you what effects to expect that said to be honest im not a fan its cool for wormholes but for 00 the player geography is enough distinction between systems and i dont like forcing people to have systemspecific ship fits and similar stuff
well i was proposing for changes minute enough that system specific ships were really not needed unless you really wanted or needed that bit more of an edge and not just for 00 but for empire as well
bump for great justice
some players will do a log off to keep from getting killed that is just a factor but a good hunting crew can normally find these guys and kill them anyway if they persist in playingbut if you limit this then should those that like to use the log off trap be penalized also if you log off to surprise someone then shouldnt your ship not be able to lock a target for at least 5 minutesoh and if your cable company just happens to interrupt your service because numb nuts down the street got caught pirating cable and they are having to fix his mess and you just happen to be in your dread getting ready to cyno and now you dont know what happened so then is that fair

no your method is still faulty it has nothing to do with ewar ships they just happen to be a very good example to show you what is wrong there but i actually dont expect you to realize that anymorebut dont expect me to support your proposal was there even any proposal in the op at all dont think so either before you fixed that i have to say though your attempt to dodge my point by trying to make a personal attack  questioning my motivation was mildly amusing 310 for effortedit and just for your information i am flying all races except gallente so by your logic being a minmatar alt lol i should agree with you simply for the fact i would bargain a boost for 2 of the 3 races i fly i dont however
i think you know damn well that a stocastical analysis if done properly would take months if not yearsdude that is so far past resaonable for a forum post its not even funnywhat other motivation could you have you might be taken more seriosly if you post from your main rather than an alt behind which you can hide you motivation
i didnt ask for an extensive scientific study i pointed out a very basic mistake in your formula for evaluating effectiveness a very basic very obvious mistakea quick approach can be done in a few hours to a few days if you wanna invest some time it still can be done properly avoiding aforementioned basic mistakesif you would have any interest in being taken seriously youd think about how to fix your approach yet all you do is stomping your feet and yelling but im rightso yea another troll thread obviously but the title already suggested that anyway
you were pointing out why only newbies with a small wallet would fly these and i was pointing out why i believe it can be a very good ship when properly utilised my argument had nothing to do with your stats i was pointing out for the price you get 10 blackbirds insurable and well you get 1 falcon these perform better no doubt about that but this still makes the blackbird a very interesting option to fly as they are cheap and they are very nice shipsi say once again blackbirds when flown properly by a guy who knows his ship well is going to be a very valuable addition to a gang yes it will be primaried however when your bb pilot knows his stuff he is not going to die due to this anyone who knows how this handle this ship will volunteer no matter if they get primariedits not really a tinfoil hat area as much more of a sceptics area you put up a bunch of random numbers the problem still is and remains that you cant rate ships and then conclude on this that they need to be fixed as it stands now the sabre is now on top and the only reason that is is because they always end up on every killmail where a bubble has been deployed by the best dictor of eve yes interdictors are unbalanced vs each other if you ask mewhat you should however do is point out the ships or weapons that need fixing and why this makes for a lot less negative responses as you gave them a problem and solution instead of what we now have is a global overview of ships being used and then being told that the entire race need a boost if you want to propose fixes look at it from a one shipone class leveli must say i have agreed with most people that your the information can not be used to support your argument what this has all turned into over the last 3 pages
i think its time we all let the poor man suffer in his delusion on his ownif you keep feeding him hes going to continue to bang his head on the wall of irrationalityso please ignore himits obvious hes full of  so stop feeding the troll
wrongbattleclinics algorithm favors solosmallscale pvp less than 5 people  its possible to win a fleetbattle with 100 bs kills to no losses and all you get is overall 1 pointin other words  if all your kill are solokills and all your losses are against a blob your statistic will be favorable for you you could lose 10 ships to a blob because your piloting skills suckthe setup isnt suitable for your playstylethis situation and youll still come out on top because you killed one lone target of the same size or biggerthis means  bc bias to solo pvp means  unless you do a lot of solopvp you wont be part of the top100no i know many excellent pvpers that heavily favor so called lolpvpships like exequeror osprey celestis atron because its eve on hard thats also the reason why the exequeror high in your list  because some players in your list enjoy eve on hardmode and their excellence can be seen in making ships work despite the general ship performancewrong pvp is situational theres no bad ship per se or atleast they are only a few  but ships utilized in a unsuitable situation will perform subpar if not completly terribad statistics can be use to answer questions but before you have to know the correct question your question was not how good perform ships in pvp but what ships are prefered by the top95 in the bcrankingwhen you consider how battleclinic processes the data youll realize that the topplayers are solosmallscale pvpers even without your analysis we could have told you that amarrcaldari arent suited that much for solopvp but more for bigger gangs
err no the case of your exeqror it gets in your rating mostly because of its successful usage by one corp genos which is a bit over represented in your top 95 due to bc peculiar scoring systemand they didnt use it because they think its good they did it for the lulz and used it to farm cva pets which arent exactly known to be bright
oh this is just stupid you are stupid you are stupid for wasting your time on this your statistical methodology is stupid your list is prima facie stupid and you are stupid for taking your nonsense stats at face value and i am stupid for replying to this stupid threadthe ordering is still nonsensekronos second best nonsenseexequeror fifth nonsenseincursus and atron above rifter nonsensejaguar wolf and vigil good nonsensedrake below cyclone nonsenserokh fifth worst nonsenseishkur seventh worst nonsensecerberus second worst hac nonsensegriffin worst frigate nonsensezealot nonexistent nonsense
this is the part where i became convinced you were just blowing smoke up our collective asses if youre not willing to invest the time to do the statistical analysis properly your numbers arent worth the electrons it takes to render them on my screena lot of us are asking exactly the same question about you especially at this point
very typical of the hatred bubbling away in this threadcall me stupid and the stats stupid as many times as you likenot one of the 6 or 7 people posting and reposting again and again in this thread they consider stupid can offer 1 single reason why the data would show a strong favouritesm towards gallente and minimater boats for pvpincursus and atron above rifter nonsenseincursus is tier 5 frig scored against other tier 5 frigsatron is tier ii frig scored against tier ii frigsjaguar wolf and vigil good nonsenseetc etcdrake below cyclone nonsenseetc etcrokh fifth worst nonsenseerm top 50 ships posted in this postishkur seventh worst nonsense read abovecerberus second worst hac nonsenseyeah cerb scores badly because its in the same group as the vagavaga gets a huge scorecerb may be a good ship  but its lightyears behind the vagagriffin worst frigate nonsenseerm top 50 ships posted in this postzealot nonexistent nonsenseerm top 50 ships posted in this post
because your assertion is wrong the sample isnt useful if you want to consider all forms of pvp by taking the top 100 players in bcs listing you already have chosen a sample that favors small scalesolo pvp the strength of gallente  minmatar is solosmall scale pvp or should i say if you want to do solopvp your best choice is likely gallente or minmtar  but this isnt disputed by anyone  and in this regard the chosen data supports this statementif you want to talk about the perfomance of ships in bigger fleets the top 100 of bc are not a useful samplepvp  solopvp  smallscale pvp  fleet pvp the difference of the later two isnt as pronounced as some might wish
a valid concerngo check the kms of the top players  there is plenty of fleet action in therefurther the sample size for bs  bc is huge these are not great solo  small gang roam ships theres plenty of data in there for fleet actionsmall gang ships  intis  hacs  etc  etc show favourtism towards minigalfleet ships  bs and bc  show favoritsim amarrgalminicaldari iirc
except even if they do fleet stuff the points that put them high up the charts are from their solo action the one good way to climb up on bc is to pop expensive stuff in cheap stuff if you dont mind dying a lot just fit t1 frigs for antiinterceptor work and go to 00 entry points youll be able to farm lots of nub inty pilot seeing you as food youll be ganked a lot too but guess what you dont lose many points for losing a t1 frig especially to superiors ships thats why your stats are very skewed toward a very small subset of pilots not representative of the general pvp scene and yes it will be skewed toward gallenteminmatar it doesnt mean they wont hop in a holy golden dong when serious business calls
as empirical evidence of your theory please explain to us the assembly hall voters what is about the exequror that makes it the best t1 cruiser for pvp use how would you fit it how would you fly it what strategies would you usewhat makes it so overpoweredinquiring minds would like to know
the data shows that the exequror is the best cruiser in its tier  not best cruiser overall its score is based on its effectiveness killlosses as a percentage and its popularity within its own tierif it scores higher than other  better  cruisers its because it is better within its own group than the higher tier cruisers are within there respective groupsso with respect if i may modify your question to what make the exequor the best tier i cruiser or is it tier ii  my answer would bei dont have the faintest idea never flown one  dont even know what they look like tbh
had a quick look at it on the item databaseit gets very nice bonuses to remote armor repsits compared in its clasee against shipsamarr augura  remote energy transfer caldari osprey  remote shield transfer minmatar sythe  remote tracking link this is pure speculation  but i think remote armour rep is just the best support mod to bring along for spider tanked gangs
there is just one slight problem logistics usually dont get on killmails
point  drones  weaponsrr split on top rowall quite capable of being on kms
but equally true of all the other tier 1 cruisers so what is it about the exequror that your system of testing provesalso 3 of the 4 tier 1 cruisers are mining platforms osprey and scythe getting direct laser bonuss exequror gets larger drones and a larger cargohold how are the nonpvp applications of these ships accounted for in your testing that would warrant a boost to caldari and amarr
yeah  you just explained why the gallente tier i logistics is better at pvpmore cap charges too i missed that  like i say i dont fly themthe data is based on killlosses over 1 year for 95 of the best players in evethere are no numbers for the number of roids munched sorryminingrattingmissioningplexingwormholingpos refuelingtransporting and spacerobatics are all beyond the scope of this studyconcerned here about pvp balance  someone else can do pve good luck too them with this crowd 
point  your too close for a logidrones  why are you not using them for logistics as wellweapons  km  free up that space for logistics dont go splitting your efficiencythe real reason those mails float up is because they can easily be used as bait
you need to go look up what a spider tank iswho said anything about them being used as pure logistics if your gonna do that your gonna use a logistics ship
i know what a spider tank is dont try to lecture me are you planning on spider tanking a few logi cruisers with almost zero dps and no realistic rr tankyou started about logistics when you summed up the bonuses of the logistical side pointing out why you think they are goodthis about the specific t1 logi cruisers not their t2 cousins
so its your contention that the top 95 people who provide data to battleclinic are the top 95 pvpers in all of eve online how did you test this contention to prove it correctyour title quite clearly calls for a boost caldari  boost amarr how can you call for a boost to 2 entire races of ships based soley on pvp and not on any miningrattingmissioningplexingwormholingpos refuelingtransporting and spaceaerobaticsso you do admit then that this study is of very limited scope
spider tank there you go  thats what im talking about before you jump to any more conslusionsthe article focuses on bs  but it can equally be done in cruisersim not personally planning any t1 spider tanked cruiser roams  but if i were out of all the t1 logi ships i take the exequoror as its armor rep bonus is far more valuable than the bonii offered by the other t1 logiof course it would also be handy to get the new boy in the corp to fly a armor tanked bb to provide some ewar supportwho knows  with 4 or 5 exes on the field he might have a 5050 chance of making it back to base in 1 piece 
ignoring your argumentative first pointcorrected the title of the op thansk for pointing that outyes pvp data only  of use in investegating pvp balance only
from your op so how am i being argumentative how do you know that the top 95 pvpers in eve are the very same top 95 contributors to battleclinic on which your entire dataset is based
oh thank you for that link i really didnt know that you have just opened a new world for me how realistic do you assume it is that 5 t1 cruisers with a rr tank are going to even be deployed i will tell you its none they can not provide enough dps with a rr tank setup to really kill anything which cant escape which is the strength of the rr bs gang make the ships passive tanked and repping each other so the tanks cant break and provide loads of dpsa very good example are the dominixes they make for class rr bs gang ships
yeah the op needs cleaning up and clarifying  it was a bit of a quick and dirtyit was gonna be a sample size of 100 playersit turned out to be 95 because 2 of the entrys on the leader board were npc entities and 3 players were no longer active and had no or virtually no known ship dataso thats why its 95the point in using the data was to get the combat records of 100 very good pvprs to look at what ships they flew and how well they flew themwho are the best 95 players in eve  the largest public non partisan dbase available is bc  and it says these people are  who am i to disagree with that 
actually its not none god forgive me for coming anywhere close to agreeing with dav varan in this thread but if you dl and watch part 2 of garmons movie here youll see towards the end they get drunk and decide to take 7 rr exequrors out into cva space where the locals do a really nice job of sticking their heads on the blocknow they are doing this purely for shs and giggles but garmon and friends are very good and make what is a mininghauler cross breed a pvp ship  against fairly useless opposition this one special and i believe unique evening of drunken lulz completely skews the dataset making the exequror look better than it is thats why i was asking van davan what he knows about this ship its use and if knows anything about this incident which invalidates all the data his test is based on and the answer is no to all three
a youre obviously lacking a clue if you lose bbs so oftenb the whole methodology is flawedlets take your data samplea data collected mostly from pilots who are more inclined to solosmall gang check a gang on gang fight yields you maybe 67 points for two 1015 man gangs bashing each other soloing a merlin in a thrasher gives you ten theres no way to get to the top wout doing a lot of solosmall gangb bc top 100 is chosen using a data set older then one year when balance was differentc effectiveness a worthless measure for gang situations check flying the most worthless ship in a gang which dies will result in you being on most mails even if you just ninjaed on it with 0 damage bonus points if you got awayd popularity a worthless measure of ship performance check couple with the fact that most on the top 100 will solo  very small gang more then they will fly in large gangs since its the only way to actually get there and therefore fly ships which are better for this type of combat more oftenyour data set would be more believeable if it encompassed all players includes failfits  yes but so does your data set  only failfits killed at the hands of the bc top 100 if that is too hard randomly chosen eg 1000001000000 killmails would doyour analysis of the data set would yield better results with1 separate list of all t1 frigates in general since there is no difference in usage of a rifter and a incursus  theyre directly comparable ships even being of a different tier ditto vexorthorax ditto all bs ditto bcs etcetera separate list of all afs separate list of all interceptors separate list of all t1 cruisers separate list of all bcsthis removes the sort of results where omg vigil is better then any hac its probably 67th when it comes to t1 frigates and rifter is almost certainly 1st comparing a chimera to a rifter on a global scale is rather pointlessalso it cuts off the completely misleading bits like the munnin close to a vagabond why on earth would you divide hacs into two cathegories and so on and enables a reasonable analysis by shiptype2 a saner measure of ship performance beingkdefficiency  sumengagementkillssumengagementlossessumengagementkills per every engagementafaik most kbs have the capability to give you a look at the entire fight when you look at killboards not sure if bc does results returned are the same for solo fights but do not favour ships which are utterly worthless to primary better measure of what something brings to a gangif you must have popularity then it needs to be included as a separate list

many things on the eveonlinecom website are mirrored through eveonlinecomsuch as the forums however one thing i noticed that isnt is the apiat my workplace eveonlinecom is blocked by the trend micro clientserver security agent and categorized under games but eveonlinecom is not and is free to access which is how im even posting this at work at this very momentthis means evemon and eft cannot access the apii am requesting that wwweveonlinecom be assigned to the api as well so that it may give some people another option to gaining access to it
did you ever consider it is blocked on purpose and circumventing the company firewall might get you fireddo you like your job
eve online is a game i seriously doubt ccp is going to change something up just for something as simple as a firewall
im not circumventing it they left it open not my faultso going to a blog site that has yet to be classified as social networking even though other similar sites are blocked is circumventing the firewall noits not my problem that there happens to be two addresses to the same websitefurthermore my company has no direct control over which sites get blocked only which categories we can and cannot view trend micro systems is in charge of the categorization of an individual website and eveonlinecom has yet to be classified which means its fair game to accesslastly this has nothing to do with my job this has to do with me requesting ccp to add api access through eveonlinecom just like they do with several other of their services
lets wait until your boss finds out
my boss wont they dont monitor traffic as i said they have no direct control over the blocking of specific sites so they are not watching which sites we go to we are allowed to use the internet they are just trying to limit the types of sites we can go onin all actuality she probably turned on games so we couldnt play flashbased games because they are definitely against that theyve seen us doing that and asked us to stop which we did when we were asked to way before the filter was implemented it just so happens websites like eveonlinecom refer to a game so it gets categorized under games their intention is not to stop us from looking at websites at all because the handbook says we are allowed to
everyone sees the isk spammers flying around space most people either block or ignore them from my understanding because thats simpler than reporting themi propose changing the ui to make it easier to report characters for spamming isk among other thingswhat i propose is adding a report option to the right click function when right clicking on the name of a speaker in chat or the speakers message the report option would expand out into a few other options which would include isk spammers harassment and other rules violation etc etc once an option is selected the create petition window pops open with the selected characters name already input and verified and the associated message that was clicked is filled in as the petition text the petition title is also filled in as an appropriate generic title for the category selected to report an isk spammer all one would have to do is right click the spam highlight report click isk spam when it pops out a second later make sure the right character and message is autoentered into the window that pops up and click create petition three mouse clicks to report an isk spammerit would also help if this was enabled in the mail system as well for when isk spammers hit your evemail boxto combat abuse add text to the top of the create petition window opened by these options indicating that abuse of the reporting system would result in sanctions against your charactersaccounts and if and when such abuse does happen have the gms hand out escalating punishment such as one day bans one week bans one month bans and so on up to a permanent banalso make any character that is reported under this petition added to a temporary block list that flushes itself either every 30 minutes or so or isnt saved at all so it empties upon logging outby taking the process of reporting isk spammers down to only a few clicks of the mouse the general apathy of the population can be combated and more people will be inclined to report these hacking macroing isk spamming bastards rather than just ignoring them
supporting myself
i can dig it
makes sense to me
signedwow has the same feature and i loved it back when i playedthere was no effort involved in simply rightclicking the personit made you want to report the offenderif ccp really cares about getting rid of isk spammers they would implement thisincidentally i wonder if they really do care since they havent implemented it
you know its weird when it takes less time to get a response from gm about an isk seller than it does to file the petition in the first placeso im supporting this on the condition that the gms come down hard on abusers even no especially on the larger scale where entire alliances would massreport their enemies on the assumption that they could get away with it because theres too many of us for them to ban everyone over itben
carebear what you mean that i wont be able to afk mine whilst at work and ill have to stop leading a solitary hermitlike existence in an inherently social game in order to organise a proper mining op with gate scouts nooooooooooooooooooooooooooosupporting making lownullsec local like wspace local ccp had planned to do this anyway and they backtracked presumably because like all other crazy people the taste of carebear tears is something other than sweet nectar to them looking at the scanner thread though 50 pages and thousands of supports and no meaningful response from the csm other than to use probes wtf i have a horrible suspicion that only the interests of carebears are represented atm  which given the certainty i hope that the csm are not all carebears makes me a sad panda in any case the csm should be telling ccp to get of their bums and implement a feature they were talking about a year ago
not supported whyin anticipation of dominion major alliances are already retreating from their space to conserve costs costsif you read the dev blogs one of the differences in the new expansion should be the introduction of a new sov ownership system one in which you the player pay for all the benefits associated with a system that includes the stargates that other players use this means that the more stargates the more you pay but not only that resources will increase in systems where you pay for additional extraswhats this mean massively reduce your empire to say 3050 people per system including alts etc time zones of the players where as most of space currently is only populated by either no one but with moon mining 35 people with moon mining or the exception of 2050 people in the system removing local from 00 is simply not worth looking at until after this new expansionperiod
no local channel should stay as it is now
well the way i see it is as followsremoving local would not be the threat a lot of pilots have stated in this threadwhat would it really do if local was gone 1 wed have to use the ships onboard scanner its not as nerfed as some of you make out2 wed have to use scouts3 covert op ships are finaly truly covert4 system wide scanning with probes would become the norm5 fleetssquads would have to improve teamwork and communications6 security patrols would be a must7 no more smack talki really dont see what the problem would be shouldnt all fleetssquads be doing 1245  6 anyway  oh yea i forgot to take into account the lazy pilots who want it all handed to them on a platechange is a good thing specialy if it improves gameplay like i believe removing local wouldsupported
yeah nothing like entering a system seeing 30 ships on scan and locating them all one by one empty at a pos hugely benefiting pirates here
i wouldnt give two darns about the glaringly obvious scammers if it were not for their incessant spam when in amarrjitarens i simply close local to not be botheredwhat i would like is a rclick player and select spam this immediately blocks the user to you as long as youre in that system and logged in but does not add them to your buddy list as blocked permanentlyif enough people select spam on a given character in a given period of time they get gagged for a period of time 15m to an hour if this gag occurs more than a set number of times in say a few hours they are gagged for a couple of days if they keep getting hourdays long gags theyre flagged for review and can possibly be banned entirely
whilst the nerd rage still flows we need a way to instigate a special election so that we can kick out the csm before their term is up if they do something monumentally idioticproposala petition is raised here calling for a special election if 5 or more of the votes cast in the election support this 1500 people based on the last election then an official referendum vote is triggered to end the term early if it passes the csm is dissolved and elections start anewprotectionsto stop hilarious griefing of the system all referendum votes remain secretif a referendum vote fails no referendum proposal may be tabled 14 days afterwardvote takes place the first saturday 7 days after the recall proposal gets enough supportoptionsthis could be changed to an individual candidate recall but i fear that its harder to stop abuse in any case as long as the csm are all happy that theyve done enough they should have ntohing to fear from a global recall vote anyway
nopejust get rid of the csmhow many more barriers between players and pseudostaff do we need
i disagree i think the csm is inherently a good thing but its in danger of becoming irrelevant if it doesnt actually represent us plebs and in any case it doesnt obviate the need to make the members directly accountableone might argue that having 3 from the worker caste 3 from the warrior caste and 3 from the monster raving loony caste might be a better model but thats a seperate issueoh and support because i am that vain
what do you think the odds are of a csm member picking this up v
given the inanity of the current csm and the current power block voting structure of the elections anyway  id say its pretty good because it wont matter unless you also ban recalled csms from reelection regardless of whether theyve hit their term limit or not
the odds are pretty damn low  seeing as how a 57 page thread gets ignored concerning real pvp events while puffy zomg i need more free trips to iceland paid by my lol playerbases dime pop up when they need totheres more than one angry player here
what i dont get is why you guys have such a problem with the csm in the first place its not like were pushing to make the game worse and we already do get kicked out by ccp when we do something monumentally idiotic so why so much of this impotent internet ragealso lol  the potential for all the goons to kick out anybody they want actually that would be kind of funny
ccp told us directly the scanner wont get reset to the way it used to be what else do you want us to do force ccps handyoure angry and youre ignorant now you know better
because their candidate did not win and you do not support their ideological viewpoints
just quotin for the majority oh i dunnomaybe trying to at least pretend to represent the players you were voted to representid love to discuss this more but you have much more important topics in mindsimple basic topics such as oh pvp can just take a backseat i spose
check out the topic i am raising for this meeting
and
and what
so i guess you know how to use the quote button
please refrain from quoting other people with no additional discussion worthy content
micia the day you start to realize ccp is in charge and not the csm is the day you stop being a stupid idiotthe csm can bring any and all proposals to the table but if ccp says no the answer is noblaming the csm for a decision made by ccp is nothing short of stupiditytake it like a man or gb2wow pleaseoh and stop trollingas to the opi like but it wont work the mechanic would need to be defined to a bit more refinement
im a big fan of recall elections in reallife politics but im going to have to oppose this proposal the biggest difference is that my mp is a single representative  my riding is represented by one guy he has to get a plurality to win his seat and if that plurality shifts then he can justly be replaced as our representative the csm uses a different electoral system and its one where the rationale for recall is far less clearcut consider a representative who is clearly there to represent some large but still distinctly minority group the clearest example of this on the current csm would probably be zastrow j  i dont think he has much of a nongoon voter base whereas the other alliance reps tend to have more spillover zastrow isnt there to represent me or you hes there to represent goons how can he justly be recalled by anyone who isnt a goon this all boils down to what the council is really its not a government its an advisory board the electoral system is specifically designed to create broad representation of diverse play styles  yes a lot of people hated lark or ankh or jade but they were legitimate representatives of large groups of players ccp doesnt need to know that each of them has a whole bunch of haters because im sure that theyre already aware they want to know what evil pirates or idiot carebears or wacky tldrmancers think needs to be done with the game so that they can ensure that they dont  off large swathes of their player base or ignore concerns that only affect one group even if most players hate a given rep it really doesnt matter  theyre one voice of nine and theyre not there to be liked by everyone theyre there to speak for their people and as such you shouldnt be able to recall them if youre not one of their supporters also a more practical concern csm terms are six months long just how long do you think it takes to run a recall petition and election not supported
this plus my statement about ccp being in the chargethe csm is an attempt at representing the players but not a direct intervention to change game mechanics
ive been wondering this too and i think it directly ties to the lack of transparency going on with the csms we also rarely if ever see or hear any results that directly came with having a csm body that improved the gamesometimes you guys will put out a list of agendas you intend to bring up with ccp but thats usually the last we ever hear about it plus its often the same list of agendas from the last csms and the csms before them
the list of issues we bring up are released to the publicand the patch notes are also released to the publicquite a few csm issues were put into the game or else made moot by other overhauls so you need to do a bit better research before you start crying about lack of transparency maybe we didnt connect the dots for you but what we accomplished remains there
i see much wisdom in your words i dosigned
good point well made but at the same time id counter with this  an mp is elected to represent his whole constituancy  even and one could argue especially those that did not vote for them theres a point about voter participation here too with regards the ability of alliance power blocs to guarantee a seat at the table but that diverts somewhat from the central issue which is that if they are not properly representing us then theyre not doing their jobs as individual members you cant get away from the point you made this is true but this is why i explicitly framed the proposal in terms of the whole csm collectively they are here for us in terms of timing id be happy for there to be longer limits if that was what was required but i see no reason why start to finish the whole recall  reelection couldnt be completed within a monthincidentally most of your concerns the goon problem et al are fixed by increasing voter participation and in the absence of party political broadcasts before the 9 oclock news letting more people know what the candidates stood for before the election giving people a chance to recall once the candidates are in place would give people the feeling that they can make a difference in this process  even if all were doing is electing an advisory board make the average joe in his pod feel like hes part of this and hell be more likely to take an interest thus do we get something that actually works as opposed to infantile dribblings were getting at the moment
neither jade or that stupid dutch chick are on so i really dont see the need for this
your proposed recall mechanic would be abused to hell and back there would be a motion to dissolve the csm every fourteen days just for the fun of itfrom the replies to this thread i gather that you are angry that the csm was unable to get the scanner cooldown removed i fail to see why this is angering you  the csm delegates do not have any actual control over what the developers do the csm opened an issue about it i dont understand what else you expect them to doi do not see where the csm is failing in their role
anyone can propose any motion but if it doesnt get the thousands of supports then its not happening so no abuseas to the issue you refer to youre late to the party tldr version is as followsfederated union of scouts in eve augh 2 secs nerf do not wantccp tough lag is badcsm ccp say no use probesfuse srslycsm yes no rollbackfuse ok heres options abcd which dont rollbackcsm ccp said no rollback were talking about making the camera more like wowfuse no waycsm way now bugger offme no heres whycsm cry morefuse bad csmccp delete posts delete more posts thread cleaned of off topic material bad forum scsm adds scanner issue to agenda
every member of the csm could be my own personal love slave and id still want this nerd rage may have inspired the initial post but at its heart the csm works best by getting more than 10 of the population to vote and part of the way you get to do that is by empowering the voters at the risk of repeating myself unnecessarily the point is important so im going to do it anyway the voting population arent broadly aware of the manifestos  platforms on which csm candidates stand and in lieu of some kind of organised dissemination of said material the people will remain passive in gaining said knowledge by giving them the option when theres misconduct or incompetance or downright neglect on the part of the csm to remove the members on a vote of no confidence everyone feels more a part of the whole thing
yes i do realise that ultimately ccp makes the decisionsi am not blaming the csm for ccps decisionsi am angry that the csm has simply accepted ccps response and despite the huge amount of support has refused to go back to ccp to actually fight for ittalk about rolling over like a beaten dogim not trolling im simply passionate about this
what purpose would fighting for it serve exactly they changed it because they decided scanner spam was hurting system performance they can look at the support counter on the scan time thread just as well as you or i can and despite it they are not reverting the change any further petitions to do so would be a waste of time however if what foolish bob said is truethen i would indeed be disturbed however i havent kept up with the threadnaught so i dont know what exactly was said if 1264 people agree that the cooldown timer is unacceptable and some have proposed alternatives but been ignored by the csm then that would indeed be a problem
what happens to those modules that required sov levels are these mods going to be instantly anchorable as the system gains sov or will it still be required to hold sov for a set number of days before these can be anchoredinstantly anchor able would allow alliances to erect a bridge network through hostile territory very fast and protect it from capital siege attacks this would speed up sov battles allowing hostiles to bring more ships to bear faster and deeper into hostile space then beforeon the down side it would make the removal of such a network necessary for a defending alliance and making it easy for the attacking alliance to steam roll through as the defending alliance spent time and assets both trying to defend space and remove the hostile bridge networkideas for sov changes to control towersthere should be some benefits and drawbacks the new sov system has to the control towers why hostiles looking to remove sov will undoubtedly anchor control towers to use as rally points and safe spots during a siege as soon as that happens it is not only a sov battle but a pos battle as well with does nothing but add more complexity to the new system that it was suppose to avoid or reduce my idea would be to nerf the hostile control towers so they are less likely to be used and when they are they are reasonably nerfed to a point that they can be taken down easier and require less of a capital blob to dosome random ideas for nerfing hostile control towers in a sov system some combination of the following to give a advantage of the sov holders to remove hostile control towersinability to enter reinforced modereduction in hit pointsreducing the fittings cpu and power gridincreasing fuel costs 100reduction or removal of all resistances can be overcome by anchoring hardeners but then reduces the number of defenses that can be anchored slightlyremoval or reduction of passive recharging of shieldsa benefit or bonus to the attackers as soon as the took sov is those nerfs then are switched to the original sov holders and they would now have an easier time removing the hostile towers from the system
not supported because if you remove the dumpsters people will simply dump their trash in the street
its not necessary to remove caod altogether when all they need to do is enforce the existing rules of the forum starting with the one about caod supposedly being incharacterben
its not a good idea to ban caod as it would simply move to another forum while it would get rid of the problem why shouldnt we have all eve posts hereproactive and encouraging moderation is needed imhothere are small corps that should have a voice this needs to be balanced with the corps that have thousands of voices hard to do if you apply specific rulesets that tend to exclude small corps because of a size limitspam alliances do exist to counteract this measure and are laughing small corps are upset because they cant take partid take a look at how shc do regionalconflict threads also make caod a no warning ban area one wrong move slap apply to all characters on an account
if the ops idea is implemented what exactly would be the purpose of a drone bay
long ago when eve was still new and for a few years after you could do just this then ccp removed it so guess what their not about to reverse that decision
yup eg a ship with a 5m2 drone bay could keep pumping out scout drones foreverbad idea
im going to get flamed so bad for this i know it i propose to not allow any character in this game to sell anything unless they are in a player corp this way you can hold those players who like to under sell you accountable for their actions just so that were clear on this one way to get around those who have alts who mission but in a npc corp to avoid war decs can still trade it to a character who is in a corp and sell it that way the market keeps getting flooded by idiots who want to make the price of your items less because they dont care about what they have
actually most pure trading characters will never undock from jita 44 so what would being able to wardec them change apart from wasting your iskas you already pointed out the player that acquires the stuff can just trade it over in station think npccorp hauler alt that does all the moving
pretty much this
and so you think that the only way to make isk for new characters should be running missionswhen you have low skills mining is a decent way to make iskand all the people that has dropped out of a player corp to recover isk to pvp should only run missions
no just no
god let it rain brainsfacepalmsnot supported
what youre saying is that there should be no npc corpsso youre failing at trading pvp  not a reason to rewrite the rules if theyre selling way below your production cost have you considered buying up their stock and reselling at a profitdont take it personally its just that this is a terrible idea
sure all stations should kick pilots out 100 km from the station  in one of several random directionsif the undocking pilots arent in docking range than the station campers shouldnt be eitheralso pilots should be able to see whats outside the station before they undock or have the option to change their minds after they see whats out therehowever i think this is not the primary cause of docking games it is the mechanic that allows docking games
wow you really are out of touch are you not 5 weeks for a new player to be pvping in a bs i think you have got new players mixed up with alts
the horse is dead for the love of god stop beating it
i dont see a problem with the rig patch they simply balanced the build cost for rigs across ship classes now the question do i rig this ship or not uses the same rig cost vs hull cost parameters that it did before for battleships now either fitting rigs to battleships was a no brainer before the patch or it wasnt if it wasnt then its similarly not a no brainer for smaller ships also there are differences in cost among rigs of the same ship class so you might choose to go with an expensive cdf or go with cheaper resist rigs
fixed qq some morethere is absolutely nothing wrong with ccp making a move like thisa good majority of modules have various sizes to fit various ships it doesnt make sense that a rig that can fit on a frigate can also fit on a battleship and the fact they all give the same returns should mean nothing because smaller ships have less to start with anyway15 of 100pg is 15 added pg oh noes that frigate gained so much more pg as if it makes such a huge difference its not like frigates getting rigs means they can kill bss nowthis option does add choice choice to people who dont have all the money in eve at their beck and call
think im up to 75000 to 80000 mouse clicks with blueprint locking systemmore clicks then lines of code p
theres already been a couple threads on allowing corps to switch to rolelocking for bpos i support the principle but i prefer the other mechanism to this one
ability for an fc to label primary and secondary targets ingame hell yesthe rest not supported
broadcasts they work tagging doesnt really work you only pick tags if you are on grid at the moment of tagging
have a better steam for the finals it was fine for maybe 20 min then i couldnt watch it because they were 1 second bits of footage every 5 secondsi think ive detected a time flux
this really there was absolutely no point in fielding a t1 combat cruiser instead of a tier1 battlecruiserabout the ecm ships imo they should be limited in a similar way as logistics ie only one ecm specialized ship with the exception of ecm frigates being allowed to use two if you dont field a ecm cruiser etc
i say give each team 10 ship classes to use like in the olden days this may reduce imagination but seriously no more logi ship setups or mass medium sized dps shipsgive the gladiators the weapons you want then let them fight with skill and tactics screw free will its for entertainment and gloryalso no implant no best named only tech 1 or tech 2 keep it simple
not sure why this is in ah but ok lets critique at 7 herei am not a fan of reintroducing logistics ships it has made some of the matches boring and long but not terribly so like in the first few ats i think it is more of range being a bit overpowered in the at as ranged ships gets their range handed to them on a silver platter while short range ships have to fight an uphill battle just to get within range they need better camera operators showing the interesting parts of the action sometimes they are ok and sometimes way off as well as better commentators i know veroneveto is an at brosef but good god how did you let ryas commentate it was just awful give the commentators some energy drink or speed or something because they sound so dull and bored when they should be excited at watching a cool battle and tell us all the details commentators also need some tools to know wtf is going on its offputting to hear experts say i dunno what is going on or i think i know what is happening but not sure great you arent sure what is going on awesome intel ryas you realize you were talking about some random topic and missed the critical scimitar die and now you are confused what is going on right ryasi like this tournament but it could be better the entry process needs to be completely reworked but the hd stream and hd youtube videos are completely winsupporting something not sure what
learn to do the mission i can run it the entire set of missions from recon 1 to 3 level 4 with any alt that can fit a shield tanked celestis so can you it isnt rocket sciencethat being said i support the idea
i agree its getting stupid i get that fanfest is next week and there is allot to do but quite frankly i dont give a monkeyseither do the job properly or dont do it at all imhocj
brilliant its everywhere except on eves own site  you know  where most actual paying pilots go
op starts withgiven the almost complete disregard that csm have displayed in the directional scanner issue it would appear the answer to your question isno
wikis are upsemipermanently show pilots name in space larger hud bracket for caps and supercaps add character transfer and portrait change tokens just like plex csm term limits fix plex keys add login history in your account managment the critique of the alliance tournament issue is going to take a little longer to write up im basically going to go through each post and tally up every concern that is listed then rank them from most common to least common then list some concrete ideas that are good in the thread so if i dont get it done by today im just going to put it off till next meeting
thread cleaned of off topic conversations there are other more appropriate threads for other conversations
o power to the peopleill skirt the edge of topic to suggest thisone thing missing from options to discuss would be investigating the possiblity of shortening the timer in lieu of removing it if there really exists a happy region in the 5001100ms range for example that is workable for the scouts and doesnt greatly impact lag then its by far and away the easiest option to implementthen youve covered all the bases i think
i say againjita park speakers cornera less formal venue to discuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar managementi would like to discuss the csm emotional stability i sensed alot of rage in the unclean version of this thread
hellorespectfully i would like to make a commentcertainly they will not revert to the old delayless scanner mechanic however that thread with 1200 supporting posters is not calling for a mere reversal of the change which was made we can all appreciate the impact which the delayless directional scanner had on server performance and many have acknowledged the need for a control to prevent lag caused by scanner spamseveral great ideas have been put forth in that thread which would improve the situation without reversing the initial decision to impose a delay on directional scanning some proposed changes have involved things such as  adding a visual indication of the directional scanners remaining delay time a meter which displays when scan is ready again lowering the delay to half a second or one second removing delay on narrow scans of 90 degrees or less preventing 360 degree spam but allowing for smoother scouting adding an automatic scan feature which automatically pings every two seconds adding a visual indicator of whether the items shown in the scan are from the most recent scan or have not yet been updated due to scan delay presently combat notifications occlude the directional scanner delay message making it hard to determine whether a scan has been performed or notmany of us would be grateful if you would consider presenting some of these suggestions for modification of the present game mechanic during this weekends csm meeting
should give dessies the ability to fit a decloaking device have it work like the directional scanner where you aim your camera and decloak things in a 5 degree radius up to a certain range based on skills
even removal of useless rof nerf would help please some attention

this change is just plain bad
this is a very important issue 2 seconds is by far too long and maddening
i approve of the change iirc the change was implemented to prevent spamming the scan button and to remove an exploit this is eve adapt or die
supportingi have recently started to use a scanner to much more extent  this 2 seconds delay is horriblesolution  either reverse change or make button unclickabble within this 2 secondsfirst is better
agreed
nothing that gives a major shift in the balance of a battle so there should be no reason not to thumbs up
supportin privacy
agreed with this in 07 when i first read itand i still agree with it today this is not too different from the mechanics of t3 shipsyou should be able to open a fitting menu on a pos and start adding subsystemsheck or just give us an interface so we can move pos modules and set them up like they look in missions would be fine to
cant think of any disadvantages
good idea
make the overload bar thinkerhigheras soon as overload is toggled make it go red withought waiting for the next cyclewhen overload is active the thingie goes redproblem solved if clicked on accident you will notice the line turning red and you have few seconds to disable it
supported even thoug i dont use overloading i can see the importance of a fast way to activate iti often find myself stressed in battles because there are so much to do in such a short amount of time with that overloading issue it will only take longer
i ver mych agree in much of what you say autocannons really do need a boost in some way im not sure about the hail at the moment republic fleet emp is not so far behind and has none of the negative side effects of hail reducing the negative side effects especially tracking would atleast make it a ammo type you can cosider to use i completely agree about the vargur and also about the artillery i like the navy phoon and the normal phoon i do not like the target painter bonus on the tempest what i do like is though the slot layout it would make the tempest more unique instead of what it is now as you said whatever you decide to do with the tempest there is something that does it better i have nothing against making a target apiting bonus but only giving it range is not gonna help giving it like 25 range bonus and effectiveness per level would make it more interesting anyway great work man im glad someone is trying to make a difference

sorry maz cant support the specifics that youre proposing although i think that continuity is important and a change is needed to help ensure it item 1 four continuing members is too manyfor all the reasons stated by nonsupporters already two would be plenty staggered terms might also help with continuity although im not sure how the system might be painlessly and fairly converted from asis to that item 2 way too subjective even if ccp had very good reasons i can already hear the whines and moans from the players whose favorite candidate got rejected out of handitem 3 issler should not have this partial term counted against of eligibility to run again however i believe that partial terms that result from someone dropping out due to rl or a failure to meet their obligations should be counted against that eligibilitysovery much in your camp regarding the importance of continuity but just cant support the specific ideas youve proposed
i have a proposal for wardeccs which clearly need some work i expect all griefers will flame this thread it isnt polished and will need more ideas but at least it is an idea apologies for anything here that others have posted but i dont trawl forumswars can only be fought in systems of less security than 08 just like the pos anchoring rule the reason for this would be that concord and the factions dont want fighting going on in the most populous systemswar wardeccers should have a valid reason to wardec like for instance one of their members was attacked somewhere this is enough reason for war if there is a valid reason for the wardecc the following rule will not applythe price of war if a corp wants to randomly wardecc another corp this is still perfectly valid as this is a pvp game primarily but corps have a concord security rating if the security rating of th ecorp you are wardeccing is higher than yours you take a hit to that rating corp security would work exactly like personal security in that when you go below certain level your access to higher security systems is restricted but you dont go flashy red only npc security can shoot youthe price of a wardecc should increase with the difference in sec levels of the corps ie if corp a sec 1 wardeccs corp b sec 8 it would be far more expensive than deccing a corp who also had sec 1 a flat fee like the current one should be there for deccing corps who have actively shot your membersobviously this is only a start to making wars more playable for all involved it is aimed at making griefing have a price and for wars to actually need a reason for happening but also providing a place where those who absolutely dont want to fight wars a place to live and play rather than quit eve in frustration it does none of us any good if people leave the game it doesnt stop those corps who want to wardecc for easier targets but it makes it have some cost wars will still be prolific and carebears do need to go to 07 and below becasue that is where poss areif this is coupled with tax and other penalties for being in an npc corp i think it will encourage alot more pc corps and alot more action but the action will more often be between people who are happy to have that type of actionnow ideas critics and of course griefers flame away

people who dont want to pvp should of course be allowed this option naturally this means that they wont want to use the market mine scarce resources anchor pos covert lp or place or accept open contractsalternatively if people want to be immune from combat pvp in 08 and above thats fine too so long as they are compelled them to sell their stuffs to me only at npc list price just as they want their ships to be immune from my combat pvp i want my wallet to be immune to their market pvp
why do wardecs need a nerf what problems does your proposal solve
this isnt about pvp this is about the wardecc mechanic which at the moment is used almost predominantly for griefing of industrial corporationsmany people are saying the mechanic needs changing even ccp acknowledge the wardecc system needs work this is merely a proposal dont take it personally just because your version of pvp is to kill industrials and carebears who are easy targets for the epeeni sincerely believe and so do many others that the wardecc mechanic is very flawed from both sides of the coin ie being able to bail from a decc by joining then leaving an alliance to the fact that it is used as legal piracy from a storyline and roleplaying point of view and no im not an rper either it also makes no sence whatsoever that concord and faction police are totally ok withthe idea of grief corps legaly pirating industrial corps who have done nothing to deserve itfrom a business point of view it is also a problem because quite simply people leave the game due to griefers spoiling the way they play the game just because they can if people leave the game it is bad for everyoneas i suspected the stream of flame that is basically from griefers so how about some constructive critisism not just bleating please
not bad does need polish but i very much like the idea of corps having sec ratings that affect the wardec cost
i like the idea of wars costing more  less depending on what sec system the corp wants the dec to be applicable toalso i like the idea of wars costing more the longer they go on fori think really the whole war dec thing just needs to be made that little more difficult oh yeah i like that to
make them pay in ships and implants a 23 person griefercops is no match for a 2030 person blob of rifterflying industrialists if you want to avoid putting your implants at risk make a combat alt it wont take much training time to make an alt that will be dangerous to them if you outnumber them and not much practice time to learn to fly together would you be prepared to pay concord for that privilege that would make your proposal more supportablein its current form not supported
one more thing  dont assume that everyone who disagrees with you is a griefer im not
i know thanks for the compliment and yes youre right im normally more reservedthe main reason i pressed the support button is because ive noticed that people tend to notice threads if there are more thumbs up on it especially if the topic is pure flame fuelbut have to admit the thought has occured to me but mainly becuase every tiime there is a discussion about wardecs theres a constant stream of people parroting wardecs are fine is it let me tell you a storythe first time i got wardeced was when my old corp was werdeced right after wed joined an alliance in order to avoid wardecs first lame thing about wardecs ironic i know but our agressors didnt know that this alliance was set up for the single purpose of deploying a defence force against wardec leet pirates or rather imo mercs with no clientswe where all mission runners and no experience but i was really excited not the first time i had experienced pew pew but the first time was less than impressive this time i could prepare because this time i knew that i would have to be prepared to loose my ship the first time i lost my ship in lowsec and i fully accepted that it was my own faultyet we managed to turn the tide in the end and our agressors started to dock up all the time i logged on every day excited i was ready to get these guys and we where very close to doing more damage in isk than they had done but most of them didnt even log on and the ones that did mostly stayed docked hoping we would make a mistakelater on we got wardeced again after that i left the corp and joined a 00 corp thins changed and before i knew it i was the ceo of a new corp and i found an alliance for us to join at last i could see it for myself and the pvp was very different but far more entertaining it felt as if i was playing a different game beforethen my life suddenly changed irl i didnt have as much time to devote to eve anymore my corp fell apart fair enough i went back to highsec and started to train up for a marauders i got a marauder i did missions it wasnt the same but never the less i still enjoyed itim still enjoying it i would love to pvp but even in 00 where i was there was almost always some thing to chaseget chased by ive found that most people try to avoid pew pew unless they think they are going to win not very different from mission runners funny enoughwhen you are defended by concord and have stations to dock in all over what is the risk of declaring war against another corp of your choosing its like having your cake and eating it and in this case you are guranteed that if you choose the right cake you will like that cakewhats the consequense of choosing the wrong cake wheres the inspiration to make you go out there and get that cake even if youre the deccer and have decced the wrong corp the is no incentive to go out there and try to get even the mechanic indirectly inspires people to not even log on even the people that are pro this mechanic say that if you dont want to fight go do something else and wait it outthats really good advice for a person that is new to this game and is really excited about it but unfortunately it wont make him want to stay after all would you want to pay for a game that you hardly know and cant playthe wardec mechanic is only good for attacking noobs and be honest now is there really need for a whole mechanic dedicated to take advantage of noobs if its that hard for you to get at noobs maybe you should go play another gametldr i like the concept of having wars in eve but the execution is so terrible that i would rather get rid of the whole thing than let it stay the way it is
basically 00  all other pvp learn to risk it if there where more of you out there i could get back out there even with as little time as i have its the best the game has to offer you have all the tools available in the game and theres a reason to fight rather than docking up00 is the best part of the game but it needs more people that arent super hardcore in it if there was as much traffic in 00 as there is in low traffic highec 00 would be perfect living out of a pos needs a bit of polishing though its painfulbut not being able to dock is imho the best feature of 00 because you can run but you cant hide stations everywhere and docking games are a sin to this game arenas sound like a good idea simply because running away is not an optioni never run away in games in eve you have to run away but only because everyone else does it and because in a lot of scenarios youve already determined that you cant win i dont mind loosing ships i can grind a bit more and im lucky enough to enjoy a bit of grindingbut when i i need to spend two hours chasinghiding from someone in order to get a kill i dont see the point two hours is the amount of time i can spend on eve in a day and not every day and if thats too little for me to be able to pop something every now and then then im not gonna botherand again im not complaining im happy doing missions and i would like eve to stay here as long as possible if eve grows eve stays wardecs disrupt the one thing that kept eve interesting to me at the time i joined a corp interaction with other players without it i would never had come as far as i havenow im fine and at the time we got wardeced i was fine but had we been wardeced ealrier i dont think i would have been i fairly sure i would have left the corp and eventualy left the game mind you the hmm channel has always been good to me and that might have kept me in the game but i doubt iti could never have gotten the kind of support help and guidance that i did by joining that corp i first joined before the npc corp wardecs break these apart is there a need for such a mechanic is it really healthy for the game is there risk involved with wardecsi say nay wardecs need some attention and no minor balancing it shouldnt be attractive for people to declare war even in eve maybe if it was a bit more fun perhaps make it a bit more like 00 no docking and no concord for 1 week that is others are protected but you arent now that sounds like fun
cant support the idea of removing war decs they serve a useful purpose sometimes for example for low sec pirates war decs are useful to ensure we can engage positive sec status antipirates and fw people at will on gates and stations wout fear of sentries
the problem is that these areas dont change anythingwormhole anomalies affect everyone in the wormhole identically so the net result is no change at allif spacial effects are to be used tactically they have to provide an advantage to one party over their opponentwhere this would work to a tactical advantage best would be faction warfare where a ship has to fly to and hack or activate a structure or module within the conflict space fw complex et al and then remain within a certain range to enjoy the benefits of that effectto remove the effect the enemy force has to destroy the item or send their own hacker over and attempt to turn it overfor in space anomalies youd have a sliding scale of effect the longer a ship is there the more they gain or more they are penalized prompting people to either set up a leadin trap to use the advantage of the zone or attempt to chaselead their foes into it and attempt to hold them there while the penalty stacks upit could work but not in the current blanket nature it follows now
wrong its all about awareness a wh roaming gang wont take into account their gang compositionfitting for any effect but soemone residing in a wh which boosts shield tanking ie will take it into account result is the residing gang will have a tremendous advantage over the other gang if they know how to use itthis wont work on kspace for the same reason awareness everyone in kspace knows where is travelling so they will just fit according to the systemregion7constellation in wspace you cant decide where do you got to thate xtend and best thing you dont have easy logistics even if you knew where you are going so not soe asy to refit for itonly way this would work is dynamic changing effects daily in regionssystemsconstellations
your points are valid but your misunderstanding like many that this may effect players with a bad internet connectionthis is entirely about people who exploit a game mechinic that allows them to cheat their way out of their ships destructionalso ccp does not reimburse you because your internet is crappy trust me ive tried once or twice

just had a glace through the raw data for spikes in exe activitylooks like there may have been 2 such incidents1 in august with approx 37 killsand a smaller 1 in may about 10 killsthere a spike in march too  but its inconclusive if it was the same thingi knew nothin of this incident yet managed to guess how the ship was being used after looking at the item database entry for the shipit would never have occured to anyone that the exe might actually be a decent pvp shipbut then along came this analysis and it showed us all the lightthis is amazing proof that the dataset was appropriate and the analysis validbigger men at this point would admit they were initially mistaken and start getting support behind this thread

the only thing this is amazing proof of is that a couple of nights of drunken pvping by very good pilots completely skews the data therefore any testing done using the data is in error and any conclusions drawn from the testing are blatantly wrongdo you know why the atron is 4th on your list of top ships or the imicus even in your list for the very same reasons as the exequror very good pvpers deliberately take out bad pvp ships against weak opposition knowing its so much easier to bait with these ships as everyone else knows they are rubbish for pvp and will engage freely its the skills of the pilot winning not because of these ships but inspite of these shipssee its the human factor your saying ships of race a are weaker than ships of race b based on some historical figures but those figures are based in part on 1 alcohol and 2 shs and gigglesyou dont understand the game mechanics yet are calling for fundamental changes to thembigger men at this point would admit they were initially mistaken realise they are getting no support and let this thread die off
i cant decide which is more ridiculous the whole point that the op is making or his complete refusal to listen to anyone trying to explain why he is wronglisten dav even if your analysis was valid which it isnt and even if this does in fact indicate that caldari  amarr need a boost which they dont then all youve proven is that two specific races ships are more suited for a specific type of pvp killbaords dont tell the whole story im sorry but you just cannot make a decision about tuning the game based on killboard statsi havfe never been in a battle where the resulting killboard data gave the true picture of which ships or players were important and why one side did better than another the picture is always incomplete because it doesnt include information like who was doing the scouting how did the two sides meet was one fleet hunting and the other trying to hide and if so what ships were being used to hunt or was it a case of two fleets wanting to fight and ending up in a closerange slugfest with no tactical dancing around beforehand did one side have less firepower but more ewar did one side have more logistics was this fight on a station so people could dock repair and undock easily was this even two pvp fleets or was it just one pvp fleet and a bunch of carebears trying to defend themselvesall of these factors are not shown on a killboard but they all have a significant effect on the way the fight pans out people who specialise in caldari know that their forte is ewar and those ships are always paperthin and primaried first they will always look like  on a killboard but they are vital and the game would be a poorer place if you persuaded ccp to remove these racial differencestheres a reason why ccp has never supported killboards or run their own if killboards were a recognised as an official ranking of any sort fleet pvp in this game would die out overnight and everyone would just camp gates and rack up easy killsall you will ever achieve by acting on an analysis like this is to make all the races the same when the racial specialisations are what makes the game more interesting than mosti am really sick of this kind of crap  people wandering in and playing the game for a few weeks or months then deciding that they know better than people who have played for years every argument you have put forward in this thread has shown your understanding of pvp to be superficial at best and more likely completely nonexistanti hate the kind of people who have high scores on killboards i dont want the game to be reduced to that the people who score highly on bc are good at what they do but thats only a tiny part of eve and its fine that gall or mini ships are best at that type of gameplay caldari ships are monsters at pve but you dont see minmatar players crying their eyes out about that do you its a big game with lots of different playstyles and a huge range of ships that dont all have to excel at every type of playso in short get lost you have made assumptions before you started that are 100 wrong and as aresult not only is your conclusion erroneous but your selfconfidence is completely misplaced you need to get over yourselfi will close with one observation in my years of playing this game many times i have been on the losing end of a fight and the one explanation that i have heard 100x more than any other the one factor that keeps rising up to account for why we just got smashed by a smaller fleet the one element that has been decisive in fights in every system since foreverthey had more ewar than usmoderatedapplebabe they already have a huge influence on the outcome of every fight
 youre trying to prove assertion a someone points out that a essential part of the proof is mere speculation that your efficiency ranking has any bearing on actual efficiency within a gang what does this do to ait makes it fail as proofthe possibility of such a scenario invalidates efficiency as a valid metric for proving anything at all poster is however able to grasp how manipulative is a global list as posted in the original post as a result of global ship ordering and separating every shipclass into tiers  adding popularity on topat any rate since you offer no credible proof to your whining you get only a rating of 510 for trolling just because of the effort

hmmm on the atron imicus this i was not sure what you were talking aboutthe post was made erroneously  i had accidentelly listed by the wrong column whoopsiecorrected that post atron was in possition 27  behind the drakethat was not the full dset by the way  just an example i was showing to oo to show that the bias is still there even if ew related groups were not countedon the point you make about the exethere was a good reason you buddies choose the exeits the only t1 logi that can do what they didit could be argued that the same was possible with the osprey  but remote shield tanking  remote armor tankingthe fact that they were drunk and doing it for s and giggles as you put it only confirms that the exe is a better ship than even the stats shownwhat could they have done sober and serious this is the first spreadsheet i have ever seen that indicates worthy pvp ships which would ortherwise go unnoticed by the general populationas such it is complete vindication of the dataset i have choosen and equations i have appliedthere are 60000 people playing this gamethis is a democratic forum  not a playground  i will not close down this thread because a small group of player dont happen to like what it shows
what you consider a good ship i consider a flying coffintoo valuable to be left alive by the opposition and too slow and no tank  thats really not a great combinationthe bb needs to lose a mid and gain a low to balance out its offence v defence imobut thats my opinion lets look at some factsyour scenario about the bb is just that one scenarioit may be as effective as you point out  but that is just one scenarioit is fundamentalley flawed to point to just one scenario and then say look this ship is uber because it can do thisyou even went on to post lol crap about the belli  because you happen to consider it a worthless shipwhile your bb may have done what it did you fully admit it died firstso for the rest of that engagement where a belly would have been providing its own dps  increasing the dps of all your fleet ships the bb did preciselly 0so not only was your scenario coloured by your opinions of the ships involved you have completelly ignored the 99999 other scenarios played out on tranq everyday all of them uniqueand there are plenty of situation where the last ship you want to be in is a bb  when you undock you never know what eve combat will bring youso you have brought to the table 1 scenario to prove the worth of a ship the bbi have brought the results of 95 years worth of expert pvp opinionnon of it my ownthis study is so much more valuable than your opinion the ratio can not even be quantified
if there was any value to this drivel i think your support might total more thana yourselfb a trolljust sayin

you are its in the thread titlekind of you to mention the 60000 subscribers to eve q how many of these 60000 support your theorya 1 youthat one other guy gave it a thumbs up and he quite clearly states hes not supporting you just trolling invalid ballotwhy is it no one agrees with you why is it only you have seen the glory of the coming of the lord how come you are so far ahead of the rest of us on this evolutionary bell curve called eveevery time you preach about the data and your theory i keep picturing a fundamental creationist clinging to his bible as hard as he can and ranting at anybody and everybody about biblical inerrancy
look you can beat around the issue this way or that your metrics and methods make your research utterly futile for proving anythingsince you cannot prove any of your claims well yes your personal opinion that caldariamarr need a boost has been noted
i am amazed that you still are continuing this topic while its getting nowherethe problem here is that you have given us readers a lot of statistics which we question because we dont find the source and your method reliable on this you base you entire proposal to boost two raceswhat you are doing wrong here is1 your method2 the global boostinstead of looking at individual ships and how they perform in certain situations you look at a global overview based on an unreliable source and say this needs a boostwhat you are doing wrong is not looking at the ships or giving us a solution on how to boost them because thats what its all about giving a solution for the problem and not just a problem described in numbers and telling ccp to sort it out even if this somehow miraculous gets picked up by a csm member i will bet a crapton of isk on it this never gets voted in onto the issues listyour assumption that support will flood in after we have seen the light is wrong there is no light to see here
it is hard to coordinate fleet in a big battle and find out which exact target is jammed which target is scrammed for example lets say you are in gang of 5 people every one of you has a web and scram suddenly you get jumped by another gang of 5 so while your fc calls primary you need to make sure that a all dps in on primaryb every single red is scrammedc certain ships are jammedd certain ships are webbed currently we have 2 ways of figuring this oput sooming in to every singe ship and trying to figure out what ewar is affecting it which is rather time consuming and is pretty hard with rockets smart bombs energy neuts and tens of other visual effects that affect target at the same time you can figure out who is jamming what over voip but even with best organization it takes a while and odds are you have to jamm something first or it will be too late so currently coordinating is hard so here is what i have to offerwhen you target a ship like on the right we currently have everything we are affecting it with under the icon of the target we have all effects that are being projected on him aoe effects will not be displayed putting cursor over icon of the icon of the effect will cause 2 things to happen1 it will create a line on hud from the target to the sourcesources of the effectorand it will highlight them on the overview so i see who is repping the target and who is scramming it 2 it will display scale of the effect so when i put my cursor over the warp disruptor icon it says 3 it means that target has 3 distruptors on it it will say name of the person projecting the effects and how many of the effects he is projectingwe get a status bar for you ship somewhere near the capacitor ui that says if your ships is being scrammed webbed whatnot and by who putting mouse over the icon will cause things listed above to happen we get separate icons for warp scram and warp distruptor this will greatly help fcs to observe what is going on in the battle you could also have an option that would create lines between ships with colour according to effect that is being projectied and arrow showing its direction like if ship a is jamming ship b there will be blue arrow pointing at ship b from ship a there will be a number next to the arrow or maybe thicker line or few lines if there is more then one effect being projected of the same kind that way fc sees right away which of the 12 battleships on the field are repping who is draining cap and who is remote sensor boosting the septor so nones pods can get away
i endorse improving coordination and suggest a strong look at the fleet command tab be revised and improved
i dont think your proposal is exactly right but its a strong start im cool with people being able to see better what ew their gang is using
i should have seen this one before posting by proposal for a strategic command ship which in essence also calls for a new fleet overview role
ofcource my proposal is not going to be exactly right i am jsut average user trying to make a thought through suggestion now if the core idea is valid the professional game developers will do it the way it really should be doneanothjer detail maybe the lines of effects could be shown when you turn tactical overlay on now it is almost useless or maybe instead of having a line the visual effect could be highlighted so it stands out or is clearly visible eg it is made brighter
not killmails plz that would just be stupid something else anything would be fine though
you are clearly not a carrier pilot losing fighters is a painat 15m each instead of 400k for a drone totally agreed
the simplest solution is to make the light green when normal redyellow when overloadedand it changes color immediately not after the new cycle that would already help a lot now is the green icon could be made a pixed or 2 higher that would pretty much make it easier for everyone i am just offering another way to solve this full support
do it do it now before ambulation before the new sovierinity patch before you go to bed tonight this would be the biggest upgrade the game has had this far
while im sure debating the employment policies of some random company is amusing to all of us lets boil this down to something a bit more germane you want ccp to put effort in so that you can use api tools when operating through a firewall that blocks wwweveonlinecom and only that one address i can understand why you want it but why should they be bothered giving it to you its minor even for people affected by it and it cant affect many people id me more swayed by an argument of helping people who make typos than i would be by this one
i propose to remove sentry guns from lowsec since i allready think the security given by the npc is driven to an extend not even realisticfirst some whiningi feel it reduces the ability to pvp tremendouslythink about it a pirate spends at least an hour finding a target when he finds one it is very likely its near a station or a stargate if the pirate is in a ship that cant tank the sentries hes gonna have to watch the target fly safely awayi have tried and tried for several hours of play to find a target and the only places i ever find ones are at stargates or stations where these lovely sentries are really its so discouraging and frustatingi know i havent tried as much as some of the real eve pirates have but even for players not into it shouldnt be something scaring them away from even tryingnow i understand there are some people i prefer calling em cowards carebears that would watch their world perish if their protection dissapeared thats why im only suggesting it for lowsec so that the people that want to pvp can have it that way and are not being hindered by some bloody sentriesanother idea i have is to not remove them but allow the players to destroy them and say let em reappear in a few days that allows the piratespvpers to actually shape the areas they operate in i understand it would have a big impact on security stats but pirates are ready to take those consequensesconcord doesnt really make the eve universe better and scarier its more like a kindergarden where the adults tells the kids what they can and what they cant disallowing the kids to have the fun the way they want tonow the finaleallow players to kill the sentries in 00  05 and make em reappear a few days later make the sec hit balanced according to the crime no not ing 2 for killing a bloody sentryit should allow for some more risky and dangerous gameplay cause really i thought eve was supposed to be a dangerous universe but its really notya know some people really want it to be dangerous and most people ive heard wants it that way the game just doesnt seem to be harsh enoughif people just cant take loosing stuff fine they should stay in 06  10 yea i know you can just say go to 00 then yea cause theres gonna be more targets say whole alliances with 100 people yea sure ill take em on solo anytime
some more ideas for features people would like to see introduced to contracts came up in this threadremoval of courier contract volume limitscontract window filters to search for blueprints by mepe range minimum run count and originalcopyauction contracts assignable to a corporationrightclick option on market and nonmarket items as hotlinked or in a hangar to view available contractsinterestpaying loan contracts with collateral such as bposcollateral and completion time options for item exchange contractscontract apishare trading through contractsitem search function in contract historyoption to award a bonus for early completion of courier contracts
easiest way to fix the damaged item problem would be to allow damged items to be contracted and have the details column display damaged  240 hp for mods or damaged  010 armor  110 structure for ships similar to how bposbpcs are distinguished
more annoyances it isnt possible to create a corp contract from items in a personal hangar illegal item restrictions on item exchange contracts you can post a contract requesting them so why cant you post one offering them inability to view courier contents only complains about oversized descriptions after you attempt to create the contract instead of just not letting you type in a description that long in the first place
we need an api to retrieve character or corp blueprint data with information about location type originalcopy me pe licenced runs remaining and max runs per copy etc and of course what they are doing if they are locked in researchmanufacturingcopying
assuming their system can handle it without it taking too much effort yeah
noits not about the apathy of the general population i can already see mountains of false accusations piled up  and it doesnt matter how many warnings you give because you cannot stop the people who think they are correct in reporting whatever they are reporting or just act on a moments weakness filling out the form on the site gives some time to cool off and review the facts
id like to see a gm watching jita chat so isk spammers in jita are quickly banned i doubt it would be that hard and would reduce the amount of petitions for isk spammers and make it overall less of a problem
currently isk spammers have a loopholeyou can only create 2 petitions at a timeso they bring in 34 bots in each wave
that sounds good but what i would like to see is gms sitting cloaked in their special frigates in the starter systems while they do their daily petition answering thing so they can globally mute any isk spammers that are born in each system
fixed your postand supported if the gms wont do something proactive about isk seller spam at least make it easier for us to do their job for them
supportedalso the last time i petitioned an isk spammer the petition was answered in under 5 seconds of me sending it
this local as is in high sec is fine i can think of all kinds of logical reasons in the context of new eden why it might exist and be maintained as a service there no local in null sec and delayed in low sec like in wormholes would be ideal having spent some time in wormholes i like the idea of having to use tools and skill to find out who else is there also without all those server hits to populate local chat data maybe it would offset scanner hits by enough to give us our old dscanner functionality back
local in 00 needs to be changed yes but it doesnt need to be removed the main problem with local atm is its used as the ultimate early warning system ive done a hell of a lot of roaming in my time and ive seen it happen time and time again that the very moment someone comes in local that people mining and ratting go cloaky cloaky or more often run to the pos in the systemlocal does have a purpose as someone said before if your system is under attack you need to know the numbers against you but at the time time local should not be a tool for people to avoid the risks of 00id say a fair compromise would be so lets say put a 60 second or so delay on local anyone whos ratting or npcing whos doing it right and checking their scanner wont have a problem but anyone who uses local to avoid the inherant dangers 00 is supposed to have will learn that surviving in 00 should take more than just looking at local and running to a pos the moment a neutral comes in the system
no thxor make scaneable cloaked ships too and end of 237 cloak if end of 237 intel too
no thanks would make cloaked ships incredibly overpowered and make rattingmining a lot more boring go to wormholes if you want no localhigh sec does not need this buff
i agree
not supported at all im getting rather tired of this issue being brought up tbh
i do support this idea ive been thinking about it myself ive been trying out piracy and ive really been discouraged and frustrated when jumping in to a lowsec watching system being emptyed a few seconds later cause ive been spotted in local it just frustratingif you ask me the eve universe is just waaaay too secure the extend of concord is just bizarre
come on any other suggestions because i think this a little bit prenerfed
honestly it makes perfect sence to me although imao carrier drones should be about at longrange as dreads main guns 150km
makes sense
read the op ffs supported
im not against scams removing scams would be very tricky after all for one man a shuttle priced at 8mil is a scam but to the next one its a blessing if its the only shuttle in a 15j radius then id rather pay for that shuttle than risk my implants with no defence what so everbut yes the constant spam of it and the amount of obvious scam contracts i now have to scour through a list of 50 contracts when im looking to buy something it makes it very hard to look for a good price and thats why i tend to avoid the contract system as a whole these daysbut no removing scams is not the answer like i mentioned its hard to define what a scam is and removing the ability to rename contracts wont solve much either after all adding the text to contract prices didnt stop the spammage there is no easy answer im afraid i guess ill just minimize buy dealings with the contracts sytem its simple and it works
are there no kind of dissolution triggersbroken system waiting for the day it breaks
i take your point but as much as representatives have an obligation to represent people who didnt vote for them theyre not on the council because of constituents who supported other candidates theyre on the council because a sufficiently large number of people1000 decided that they liked them as a candidate and wanted them to advance a particular agenda to ccp for example if 5 of players want a moddable ui 95 dont and the 5 had elected me to the csm last term i would be perfectly justified in ignoring the 95 and continuing to advance my principles because that was the platform i ran on the other eight could and would say i was crazy but that wouldnt change my position nor would it change my responsibility to advocate for it ultimately a recall vote is justified on the grounds that while the representative might have been supported by a plurality when the election happened later developments destroyed that support making them no longer a valid representative of the populaces opinions with a voting system like the csms how can you possibly tell when this had happened there were about 30k votes cast and meissa won 9th place with 1132 votes can you envision any sort of petition system that could reliably tell you whether the 4 who voted for a given candidate had lost faith in that candidates ability to represent their views versus just having annoyed the other 96 itd be like saying that because you should be able to recall your own mp you should also be able to recall somebody elses not to mention the procedural difficulties  youd basically have to reelect the entire council from scratch to recall one member or else the replacement will always be a goon i cant imagine canceling the whole csm for a month out of a sixmonth term to maybe replace one member is worth it at all as for voter turnout we live in a world where half of all eligible voters choose not to cast a ballot for who will be the most powerful man in the world do you really think theres any circumstances whatsoever where well get high turnout for a player advisory council if i had nine eve players as love slaves id probably be more likely to support recall
i had a weird thought for a new t3 ship class in eve strategic command ship scs2 pilots required main pilot runs the ship second can only see a newadvanced tactical overlay and requires fleet admiral role fa should it require fleet command v  showing all fleet members regardless of which system they are in fa skill could determine number of jumps away 1 or 2 jumps per levelthe fa should have the ability to set warp in points for fleet ships within a certain range control scanning drones to pinpoint the enemy positions and basically responsible for planning and controlling the battlehigh enough skills and the fa can link to another strategic command ship 05 jumps away and incorporate that ones sensor data into its own overview so if the fleet have more of these they get better overall sensor coveragean scs should have no weapons only mounting gang links and perhaps a few drones it is the fleets job of keeping it safe it should have a thick hide though and a relatively high warp strength a tough one to crack but not impossiblebeing t3 it could be modular as well tailoring it for specific types of combat or better modules for larger engagements say maximum number of tracked targets instead of the offensive section on the strategic cruiser it could be a scic strategic combat information centre section the scs could then have the following 5 t3 sections defensive electronic engineering scic and propulsion systemsthe scic determines the number of simultaneous tracks friends and enemies combined as well as if the scs can exchange tracking data with another scs in the fleet including from another system if the module is advanced enough and the fa have sufficient skills for itinsane idea or could it be viable 
this is more of a ideas forum threadthe inclusion of a new t3 ship with sophisticated interfacing concludes that a lot of programming will be required by ccp staff usually features such as this will always be required to go through several phases and none of which deal with csm look up patch notes under eve insiderthat said i dont support this because of all the topics that csm could fix that are likely to receive a fix this is not
since ccp will probably never be able to solve the problem of dreadnoughts and other slow moving ships bumping each other off their sentries i propose that a change be made to allow sentry drones to move when theyve been recalled to a ships drone bay to curb abuse ie using the return to drone bay to cause sentries to move closer to the ship only to tell them to engage a target before theyre done they could be set so that once theyre told to return they wont respond to further orders until theyre back in the drone bay
i like the principle but im not sure if your solution is workable still worth asking ccp for see if they have any better ideas
i endorse the idea of onetimeuse rockets being fitted to sentries when being launched for the purpose of better recovery
i like the idea but it will make the sentry mongers life too easynowdrop sentries move away to safety enemy can move close to or kill sentries to mitigate damagesentries are lost unless you win or risk your ship in recovery operationthendrop sentries move away to safety enemy can move close to or kill sentries to mitigate damagemove sentries to apply damage once more without ever getting in danger yourself orrecover sentries and bugger off without ever endangering yourself or sentries are lost unless you win or risk your ship in recovery operationit will function as a way to partially bypass the restrictions set by dronebay size making balancing even more of a choremake the recall order nonrevocable balance by tweaking speed and it might work would still make sentry life far too easy for my liking but not as easy as ability to move them
i would agree with you if sentry drones would be massively more powerful then ordinary drones but they arent so i support this thread
force them to only move at 50ms and you have a deal
yes allow them to move just move slowly this will allow you to recover them after your fleet has nudged you out of position or theyve somehow ended up inside the shield of an enemy pos another limitation of recovering slow boat sentry drones while theyre returning they are not shootingcurrently they do move at like 1ms or so but they still shoot while doing so
im sure ccp has answers to most of these questions and im equally sure its too late in the process for the csm to make much difference now given that a lot of the answers you want will probably get released a week from now
if you start nerfing the control towers of those that dont hold sov all you would achieve is a mad dash for sov after the patch and then make it a hell of a lot harder for smaller alliances to secure a foothold in a system while going for sov and kicking out the incumbantscant support as it will just reinforce the 00 status quo
bumpthe more this is delayed the more we get bad impressionscomplete farce if this is not out monday or tuesday so people have time to go through it before fanfest next weekendthere was a half mile of things put on the public list of potential subjects to be raisedop asked for this 99 we have 279 now more than 2 weeks 18 days to be exact what good reasons are there such a delay

apparently i was censored as i was guilty of a point of order infraction since these rules are being enforced by the master at arms i would like to request of the speaker for a point of information may it please the master at arms what does csm intend to do with regards to the issue of the scan bug issue this is an important issue and we your constituency would like for the csm to ammend the current agenda to reflect the needs and wants of the community we would further like for the csm to consider to lay on the table the issue of adjusting the camera angle in lieu of the main issue which i have tabledthank you
make ccp fix scanner and dont ignore the most pressing issue there is in this gameme awaits to be censored out again
1200 support for scanner changesmeh please do something about it
please have a look at some ui changes they might be worth your attention
this is a good idea
ill just say what i did in the game dev forum
supported
ill bring this forward in a meetingin fact i already spoke to a few ccp about this a few weeks ago when i was in iceland ill do it again during fanfest
awesomeexactly what it needs a little convo here and there over time will gain traction
supporting fro great justice nice idea
this is far too long down the list also for the love of god  change it to a 1s timer and make it unclickable while the scan timer is active or do one of those two thingsthis isnt a hard fix
so were almost at 60 pages of people saying how much the new scan times suck is it not time to just remove itsigned
whatever you say lemming i prefer to live in the land of reality not tin foil hats and paranoiaif that makes me an idiot in your eyes i dare say im pretty well offso keep on yelling chicken little im quite sure youll find more bits of sky on the groundthere well always be an amount of risk in any gameapplicationwebsite wherever we goi choose no to spaz out like some teenager if there was a problem im pretty damn sure ccp would not be doing so bloody well in business afterall your still playing arent you
the performance of a company is subject to many variables which can be so easily manipulated by management and poor controls unless your in a vital position overseeing ccp you wouldnt know whether the business is doing well this supports that you arent all thererisk only occurs in life when the outcome of events are uncertain with perfect information there would be no risk the lack of disclosure means you know less and therefore the amount of risk you accept is greater simple logic thanks for confirming my pointlastly id like to point out the recent events with the collapse of some companies now if you werent trolling the forums so much drake maybe you would know that the public has demanded a push for greater security in business namely to do with disclosing more information so that we can make more informed decisions about whether the company in general is likely to go bust with that said how often has a push been made by the public for less disclosurethis means anyone who reads this post will either bea illinformed about the purpose of disclosing information possibly because of people like yourself for giving no justification for not supporting it and trolling forumsb support this thread because they know that in the long term having more disclosure will mean better outcomes in all future eventsc dont support this because it leads to you or your friends having to change something with eve data which can only be changed by ccp employees thus you need a connection to ccp to be in this category why pick up a few articles about employee research and youll have your answerhence why i support this thread and why csm should bring this to ccps attention
theres a glaring problem with your so called logic chicken little1 csm is not on ccps payroll ccp can say no or its none of there concern and your still going to throw a damned fit2 your assuming you have the capacity and the foresight to understand or know the details and to be capable of judging them as a result so you know what the hell are you going to do about it emorant some more complain some more to what end what are you going to accomplish aside from more crying and whining over someones stupid mistake that ccp has made efforts to fixlike i said if it was that bad people would leave the gameagain your still here so i guess its not that big of a problemnow go get your tin foil hat and run along  o pbecause like it or not ccp runs the show not us making silly demands like this is a waste of timewant to get there attention unsub and get others to do the same then youll get there attentioncsm wont bother with this they may mention something but full disclosure please lets come back to reality

great idea
alternativly plex could be used for the 30days or face change or character transfer
i really dont see any reason why everything that involves currency shouldnt be done ingame
nice idea
excellent idea thumbs upben
sounds good
yes yes yes you have to wait for the end of the cycle for it to actually overload but you do want to make sure that you have activated overload for the next cycle
rework of the overheating interface is sorely needed small buttons and clashing coloursalso why does a module deactivate overload when i deactivate module  give us an option to have a proper toggle
ahem
exactly strpr more then just your local friendly roaming gank fest we really think about it tooif active local tanking is to be more useful in pvp the wider issues need to be looked at until then we will all keep sheild buffering small ships with logistics in support and armour tanking rring battleshipsthere are a number of ways this can be fixed like resists being improved during module activation it boosts more then hps perhaps for higher energy cost looking at fitting costs looking at glaring disparities between armour and shield tanking difference is good making it utterly fail on ships designed for that task is not so this proposal i dont agree with but i agree there is a general problem which makes fitting quite inflexable and fitting some ships in a way that uses active tank bonuses pretty much a bad idea that is unless you fail fit
full support furthermore active tanking requires far more attention from the pilot than a passive tank and should be boosted accordingly
hmm this doesnt solve the core problem of active tanking being that the active tank will fold in no time when more than one hostile is shooting ithaving said that i personally dont miss active tanks at all as it did only favor a few select ships to begin withbesides it does still seem to work pretty well on the ships designed for it anyway at least in those situations that favor active tanking over a buffer
preety muchthe problem is that boosting active tanking significantly is a complete nerf to anything solo most ships being buffered with a few notable exceptions largely tank bonused ships makes for a far more solo friendly environmentthe few things i see as silly regarding active tanks the fact you cant run even a single rep on a pvp ship without cap boosting and doing it often fitting requirements a little steep  particularly cpu on shield boostersoverall not supported
new players need a jump start with sp for example 5  10 mil sp that can be assigned any way they want this would be for new accounts only 1 character only and they could pay a premium to ccp for example if 5mil sp  3 months training time then the cost would be a 3 month membership premiumbackground we had a group of 5 people all started playing eve a couple of months ago 2 have already dropped out one has been playing wow while waiting for sp to train myself and the other person have concluded that we will just sit at space station for the next 6 months or so while we trainnow before you get your knickers in a knot it doesnt matter if this is right or wrong  this is what has happenedit doesnt do ccp any good to advertise on tv for new players when they already have new players that quit due to unrealistic new player limitations it also doesnt do ccp or eve any good because i wont recommend it to new people because it takes too long to get startedall the shortcuts to speed up training such as buying characters learning books implants etc to help this realistically only benefit long term players for a new character such as myself the learning books alone takes 2 months to train  with implantsin the end ccp is losing money by losing players i would like to see ccp make money so that we get better servers less lag a better game  more players
1 may i suggest watching
six months in station youre doing it horrifically wrong a new player who starts working his way up the mission chain can be doing l4s inside of two months with the appropriate standings skills and cash with no real difficulty a newbie miner can be in a retriever in two weeks and a hulk in eight an industrialist can be pumping out ammo after a day and have perfect t1 skills in 23 weeks a pvper can score kills with maybe six hours of training and a trader doesnt even require that much just what are you trying to do that you need several million free sp also i find it hilarious that someone would complain about not starting off as an effective character in a mmo and his refuge would be a traditional grindfest rpg where you spend your first week killing swamp rats or did your wowplaying buddy get his level 80 by sitting in the newbie town waiting for free xp to roll in after he made his character
not signed we already have a 100 training speed boost for new characters i think thats more than enoughon top of that noobs get two remaps for their attributes which is very good for reducing training times even further if you get it rightthe only gripe i have at the present is those damned learning skills ive just finished training the main ones to five and will soon start on the second set spending over a month just training learning skills sucks in my opinion it would be nice to have them removed from the game and have the skill points allocatable to other skills or give them to everyone at level iv for the first set when you create a character reducing training time spent on them the only problem with that is you get the folks with 100mil skill points moaning because they spent the time training them so we all have to suffer too
guide ot faster training 1 remap for max attributes to learning2 get learning to 53 get all other learning skills to 44 remap to balance out attributes except charisma5 profit
your group is a faili enjoyed the game so much when i started that you cannot even imagineit was wonderful exploring the game discovering things meeting people and growing and dreaming
this no support its already much easier on new pilots than it used to be and i think the new pilots are losing out by having a less challenging experience
hahno
no they really dont
i know at least four people who joined eve in the last few months and were running l4s as a corp activity within 3 or so weeks as well as pvping youre wrong newbies dont need more sp they need people who dont tell them theyre useless until they have x million sp
this is not the game for you quit now
i think this summarizes you pretty wellalso patienceps not supported you can do tons of stuff with no sp whatsoever
cause you noob you special 
i survived with 800k sp to start no speed bonus i lasted a year i got 10m sp and no friggin noob is getting a years worth of sp because hes new plus they wouldnt know what to do with itps join a corp then you wont sit in a stationnot signed
800k you lucky git i started with 65k sp and before anyone told me about learning skills i was at 1m sp 
coming from a corp thats been wardecd for the simple fact that the other corp assumed we were weak i can see the frustration in the current system however i do not see any reason to make changes to the ability to wardec as is i think as a way for industrial corps to counter frivilous wardecs is to implement a merc system similar to how the bounties work where there is an in game market for merc corps for hire you can place your bidstargets and corps can pick up the contracts in game and after war is declared and fufilled they will be paid this way if someone is grieving you you have the ability to hire an army
good idea about concord perhaps paying for the privelage of being in the highest sec spacebut as to the rest of the post this is a post about wardecc mechanics not personal preferences i have fought wars and so on alot of pvp but this post is about an ingame mechanic that is abused easily the reason i proposed this is that i hear alot about why war is broken but see almost no proposals about what to do about itwar is a great part of this game and there should always be ways of going to war but it shouldnt be a way fro griefers to legalise piracy in hisecand no i dont think your a griefer for disagreeing with me the only people i think are griefers are the ones who go all emorage at me becasue this mechanic would limit their ability to shoot at defenceless people
this is a harsh gameyou consent to pvp the moment you undockwardecs can be a pain but if you are smart you can prepare for themfrigates are cheap as are the mods to fit them effectively and pvp with smaller ships is a lot of funso stop complaining start grouping up and start standing up for yourselfthe only thing that may need adjusting is the war dec system for corps as prices havent been adjusted since the game was started afaik unlike for alliancesso in short not supported learn to watch local learn to play smart and above all learn to have fun
when republic fleet xl ammo was removed in revelations 22 ccp greyscale confirmed it was for balance issues now that faction xl ammo has reached a point of saturation where any wellfunded capital force can readily make it available i believe it is time to resurrect navy xl ammohowever i propose that the damages be shifted seeing as empire navy xl ammo will be easier to acquire the current 10 damage bonus now granted lowgrade pirate ammo should be attached to it while said lowgrade pirate xl ammo should be boosted to the 15 level as its understandably harder to acquire and transport given it can only be earned and redeemed in 00this change would grant dreadnoughts and soontobelessuseful pos higher damages to help them stand a chance against the massive amounts of hp supercarriers and titans will possess as well as give more incentive to acquire xl ammunition of both grades and serve to lower costs of bothall this being said i do not believe highgrade pirate ammo should be offered as a 20 damage boost to capitals would probably be too much
cant really see any flaws in that
i would love to accidentally jump into a system that has system wide shock waves that do around 5k damage every couple of minuts  or one that slowly overheats your modules over the course of time or caused effects simaller to the paranoia of certain drug boosters stuff like that would be hilarious you could even have one loaded with the best ores but nullifies mining mods lol or one that catastrophicly tries to bond any two things that get to close to eachother together ending in a beutifull explosion hahaha i like it the original post it gives the game more depth
come on delve is safe just goonies there
its not even a good mission for those with rorquals and jump freighters because of the need for 2 manual cynosin addition ill point out that blood raiders lack a level 4 q20 station based agent which is something all other pirate factions have actually all other pirate factions have multiple l4 q20 agents which in some cases share the same station
that is pretty bad but cannot compare to the raw existential dread experienced on getting materials for the war preparation from your pirate storyline agent just where the f are you supposed to get 6000 m3 of omberkernitewhatever in the middle of 00the fact that you then get sod all in terms of faction standing gainisk because the same mission can be completed in five seconds with no effort in empire is galling to say the least
can i point to the uproar your alliance would have started if those agents were added when delve was controlled by bobkenzokumining it or getting someone to mine itthere are a few mission storyline or not that are hardly good in 00 but unless ccp decide to revamp missions in general and give a larger range of pve content with missions and storylines more focused on the different factionscorporations than today i see little possibility for a changeand ccp dont seem interested in spending the manpower needed to revamp all the pve content still in hope of better pve content supported
we would have probably complained yes but i think our alliance has been pretty vocal how delve space is ridiculously broken as far as truesecfactionofficer spawns with the coming systemmoon changes and ccp relooking at pirate faction ships the mission changes should be a no braineras for the mining i have no problem with it at all as most everyone has some basic mining skills and the volumes arent really that bad if 00 pirate missioning takes off the market will address this
asking for a boost to a race is about as generalistic as it getsyeah i allready told someone the lol no one supports you tactic isnt gonna work on me you know whats changed between then and now nothingits not my personal opinion my personal opinion never included amarr needing a boostbut hey the data indicates what it indicates i just presented the facts of the statistical analysis and noted that all the best ships were gallente  minmatarif you think i made it up you can allways go verify the results by doing it yourself
well its not written anywhere that every post on the boards has to be about a specific boostnerf to a specifc itemim only really interested in creating a level playing field between the races so that people have more options for pvphaving gallenteminmatar as supperior races for solosmall gang pvp means people have fewer ships and setup to choose fromhow many amarr frigates and cruisers are any good for solo work for instance   i know a lot of them suck because they dont have enough mids to fit propulsion and tacklecaldari suck at solo on the other hand because mostly they cant tank and tackle at the same time and have big issues fitting cap injectors in an environment where neuts seem to be everywherethe lauded superiority of caldari for fleet work is nothing more than a myth shield transfers are impossible to fit and fire into weeker resists than there armor repping cousins missile damage is week and often arrives to late  in very large fleet  on primary to do any significant damage verus gunsoh wait i nearly forgot caldari have ecm  well theres a great option for me to enjoy my fleet pvp in i can go out and get myself blown upall im looking to achive in this thread is show which races need the most attentioni hope i can get some constructive critism at some point and maybe gasp even some help in improving the analysisbut before that happens this post has to get through the negatron  idiot poster  knee jerk reaction phaseif i have to defend it solo for years before it reaches the positive feedback stage so be it
you already got that criticism but refused to even waste a single thought on how to improve your analysisnumerous people including myself pointed out where your analysis falls short but you arent trying to pick up on that the only thing you are doing is trying to discuss away the obvious
honestly just dig up few major alliance killboards for a far better picture of what is actually being used tons of apocs and armageddons and such ships are used in major fighting all over tranquilityand suggesting blackbird  bellicose because people donUFFFDt shoot bellicoses firsti actually agree with you that omen and maller are sort of sucky but statistics are not needed to know that and rockets are terrible
ok your personal opinion that caldari need a boost has been notedfacts of the statistical analysis is a misleading statementyour methodology is invalid for proving anything that is a fact  since a metric which can but does not have to indicate that a ship really did perform better in a gang as indicated by example given is not admissible for anything labeled as fact or proof the problem is that your criteria are not universally valid  the fact that your efficiency metric can score a ship well while real gang efficiency is low and vice versa means that your post  and let us for a moment pretend that your sampling is somehow valid  fails to provide proof that ships scored low by you are indeed inefficient you only rely on speculation that scenarios where my metric is invalid are rare  once we have firmly established that such scenarios are possible only a detailed analysis of how common they are statistically and factoring that in could give some credibility to your study assuming your sample selection criteria are valid in the first place where we have shown problems with them alreadytherefore this post while it does contain a statistical analysis does not contain a statistical analysis which proves there is a lack of ship balance in regards to caldari vs the rest without proof your post remains a expression of your personal opinion this has been noted already
supporting ui improvements since 2003
im aware  theres a reason i supported it anyways just saying is all
i have read several threads concerning the problems with local chat and i have a solution that may address one aspect of this issueremove ships that have an activated stealth module from the local chat user list they will still be able to chat in local and observe it for what it is worth thoughmost of the stealth pilots seem to think that the user list this gives away their presence and goes against the idea of being stealthythis proposal would preserve local chat but make stealth more of a functional tool for observing people for various reasons whilst remaining unseen
i agree
you want to boost cloaking itUFFFDs not like there isnUFFFDt enough of sbrecon gangs around already would be really nice to chill in a system nobody could find you nobody would even know youUFFFDre around i think everyone would fit a cloak them
yeah exactly cloaking is already a huge advantageesp cov ops cloaking i might come around to this idea however if there was also a mechanic implemented that required cloaks to be occasionally refreshed somehow so that pilots couldnt afk cloak for long periodssay more than an hour or somethingwithout their cloaks turning off and having to be reactivated manually
100 love the idea of multiple monitor support by being able to undock various windows from the main client window and move them into other monitor spaces would be awesome
gate guns really arent that hard to tank adjust your setups its low security not null security  if you want completely unsecured space theres really quite a lot of it for you to go play in there are some tweaks id support but outright removal no
the security in lowsec is already a joke if you want to gank without builtin consequences thats what 00 is for
i agree we should get rid of the gate guns they are these unchanging fun killersinstead concord navy spawns similar but weaker to that of the faction navy spawns in highsec also with the sleeper target changing iqmuch better that waythis way the tank ships can tank just as they ought to the speed ships can speed tank drones arent being destroyed right away anyway it also provides safety for those not at gates which promotes people actually doing things in low sec
an awful proposal with underlying themes of selfishness how about instead of removing low sec gate guns why dont you go get better
two things take place in lowsec1 ganks in that case the point is not to obtain a fair fight its to get a nice km or loot ganking indies at gates or stations comes under this categoryits entirely fair that it should require a fair amount of power ie sentry tanking ability to gank stuff otherwise ganking would be too easy and people subject to ganking would avoid lowsec at all costs2 real fightsdubbing them real because they involve a conscious decision on the player to warp to an asteroid belt looking for a fightthis is when a variety of people wishing to fight meet up at amamake iii  1 asteroid belt and slug it outif youre looking for the first which is what your post suggests you cant possibly be saying id like my t1 frigate to be able to gatecamp industrialsif youre looking for the second sentries dont matter either youre fighting in belts in which case sentries arent there or youre getting gatecamped in which case on the contrary they can help slant things your way when youre getting gatecamped which makes for a fairer fight
what its not enough to be allowed to kill anyone on sight but now you want it to be even easiersheesh man up get a bloody backbonei hear people tank gate guns all the timenot supported
got to say im really quite glad you didnt join sons of 0din after alla day into piracy and already moaning how hard it is piracy is hard it is supposed to be hard we arnt fluffy comedy one eyed chaps with jolly pirate nicknames we are hated and feared and rightfully sowe are pirates because it is hard because if it isnt a challenge it isnt worth doing go and run missions you wont have to worry about gate guns there
gateguns really should not have infinite tracking too that bit really hurts new players the most
thats it ninja salvagers should draw aggro even if they do not loot from the cani checked through the assembly hall but by page three did not see that anyone else had posted regarding this issue apologies if i missed
what a great idea now ill have yet another way to get a flag onto carebearssupported itll significantly increase chances for gankage
i agree we need moar ways to kill mission runners
how about this in low sec they show a number at the top for how many people are thereand replace all individuals with just 1 corp logo and ticker per corp present this way you can see how many people are afoot in low sec and what corporations they might be from but would have to find them to know for sureand in oo change it so you can just see corp logos and tickers but no numbers at the top this would let you know wheather or not the system was empty also would let you know if your wts are hiding there or if you should move on but not which ones or how manyin wh space keep it like it isblank unless you talk in itand last but not least in high secgroup all members from the same corp present in the system together under their corp logo and tickers so there is numbers at the top and listed on the ticker for each corp so when u left click it opens that corp and u see and can click on all the people from that corp that are present in the current system grouped together and when you r click it gives you the corpalliance info this would clean up high sec local and make scanning local easier in say high traffic areas and on top of that it would be much better public exposure for corporationswith this idea when people talk in local the talkers char name would still show up in the chatbox same as it does now just the listing on the right hand side would be affected by this changewe wouldnt want to make life hard on spammers and we dont want to ruin the actuall friendly interaction of people just trying to have friendly conversations either  i think this idea would help everyone even the miners with or withought the scanner nerf its ussually somone with probes that you really need to worry about as for miners they will just rush the belts anywayso all together cloakers get a bonus miners get to keep their run for the hillz local and fleets will know if targets are present so they can begin to scan for them its local streamlinedjust a clarification with this setup any individual can still talk in any local at the additional risk of becoming visible and linkable in the left hand chat box comments
it doesnt matter how many alts you use to propose the same awful idea removing local is still not going to happen
im not an alt and i didnt say anything about getting rid of localdid you even bother reading it try reading it again slower this time so you can try to grasp the concept of streamlined and not removedcomments
1 paragraphs capital letters use them 2 this is not a text message being sent to a 14 year old girl u is not a word 3 corp sorting as a way of cleaning it up a little in highsec and narrowing down information as sec status drops is one of the more interesting proposals ive seen for dealing with this problem and it at least avoids most of the usual pitfalls of the nerf local whiners that said it still doesnt feel right to me local is at root a chat channel for all that its morphed into an intel source in practice corporations dont chat it makes decent sense but its just not meshing in my mind sorry
1 paragraphs capital letters use them 2 this is not a text message being sent to a 14 year old girl u is not a word i disrespectfully refuse if its not a text box then why does the tab not work why are all of these present it is definitely a text box just like my phonethat being said i do respect your opinions and i appriciate you looking through my evil failed english to the heart of what i am trying to say now if yer dun picking on the fact that i failed english all the way thru 1999 ill just let you translate it for me and if you really like you can even rewrite it for me if it bugs you that much but as a father of a 14 year old a 2 yr old with another on the way who has owned his own buissiness since o5 and makes more in a month than his old english teacher makes in 3 years your english lesson has safely landed on very deaf earsthat being said i realize that its not perfect but it does cater to every one to some degree and i think the impact would be positive as a wholeand your comments are solid can u extrapolate what part of this idea doesnt sit right with you is it the fact that i leave local somwhat intact in 00 even tho for all the player could tell it is just a single entity that might be another miner or a noob or a carrier group or is it because people cant help but to poke holes at people in local as a whole
how about thisin low sec you see the number of players in system and the corp logo and ticker of all corps that have at least one player there you can therefore see how many people are afoot and what corporations they might be in but not specifically who is there and what corporation they belong toin 00 same as above but without total numbersin wh space do not change anythingin high sec local is the same as it is now except characters are grouped by corp just a way of streamlining it making it easier to identify particular corp members without having to set standings and scroll through the listfixed for you i only support the high sec change
not supported because op doesnt know how to speak englishamongst other thingspost with your main  o pop should go back to skool to lern to spiel an tpe
lol thanks for the summary roland much apriciated even i can read that 
1 i havnt posted with anything but my main2 seriously thats your contribution to this discussion are you seriouswow
oh yes im quite serious so much so that when i type here i dnt trt me p0sts lik som cell phne txt msgyou want to be heard type decently and clearlywith grammar and spelling of which im no example of but im quite sure people will respect you a little bit more if you dont come across as some childtake the time to type things out your not going anywhere for 5 minutes anyway laughs
i disrespectfully refuse if its not a text box then why does the tab not work why are all of these present it is definitely a text box just like my phonethat being said i do respect your opinions and i appriciate you looking through my evil failed english to the heart of what i am trying to say now if yer dun picking on the fact that i failed english all the way thru 1999 ill just let you translate it for me and if you really like you can even rewrite it for me if it bugs you that much but as a father of a 14 year old a 2 yr old with another on the way who has owned his own buissiness since o5 and makes more in a month than his old english teacher makes in 3 years your english lesson has safely landed on very deaf earsive reposted that for you because i suspect you are suffering from a simaler learning disorder as mine and suposedly if you hear things over again you will possibly retain the information better  and you are absolutly right about that this isnt some silly cell phone its a video game forum now if you could try to actually read the roland summary of what i said mayby u can give a real reason to dislike my proposal
not everyone is english native speaker that said using a spell checker is still a good thing not supported it is interesting as an option to sort your local that everyone could choose for himself according to alliance or whatnot but the idea of just having that just does not feel right to me it is just weired
not supported because if people dont have enough pride in their ideas to present them in an easily readable fashion then i dont have the time to wade through a wall of text
max theres a fairly obvious difference between someone who is bad with the language because theyre not fully fluentpoor word choices weird tenses etc and someone who is bad with the language because they dont carelack of spacingpunctuationcapitalization txtspk etc i dont criticize the former group because theyre infinitely better at english than i am at their language but i do occasionally criticize the latter group especially when their awful writing style impairs my ability to read what theyre trying to say to be fair to the op half that difficulty was probably caused by me being on the forums at 240 am but judging by the chorus that followed me im not alone in finding it hard to read chopper while i was kind of a jerk im not just trying to correct you for my own sake youll do far better in your efforts to convince people that your suggestions are good ones if they can read what youre suggesting without getting a headache theres a reason we standardized languages and its to allow for ease of communication the better you conform to the language that the rest of us know the better your ideas will be conveyed to us since youre trying to convince us of your ideas you might want to pay attention to that fact as for the idea itself i think my opposition rests on the fact that chat channels are at least theoretically designed to help people chat i dont want to talk to random goon 374 i want to talk to that guy who was smacking in local five minutes ago your system works very nicely as long as nobody actually talks when they do what happens do they show up on the channel list if so do they disappear when they leave system theres a couple other similar problems but thats the most obvious youre trying to describe a more reasonable solution for a system intel window based on current mechanics and at that goal youve done a good job but thats not local chat if you were to make local delayed and voluntary and then add this as a separate window i think i could actually support that but if youre going to be making a proper intel channel then you need to sever the absurd link between local and intel ultimately i think i like the idea and just dislike the way youre proposing to implement it as such i suppose i do support this after all
your in a corp alliance or whatever your in a fleet your the boss so you want to get people fleet up to make your job easier you use the fleet invite feature you display it spam it in corp or local chat very easy and good way to do itproblem is when your in faction warfare you cant all because its an npc corpsure its a small problem probably theres more priorities going on but still an annoyance that i cant fleet inviteso if corp can i want it too
so you cant do fleet invitationalliance with fail warfare thats unusual should be fixedmight as well call it fleet invitationmilitia while they are fixing it
already coming check the fleet finder on sisi  hmm it might not be coming
i know the fleet finder is supposed to fix this but it probably wont come out for a while fleet invite militia would be nice
my suggestion for an improvement is something that would be a minor change and the only real people who i think would disagree would be those who wish to exploit the corp mechanics i propose that pvp between corp mates in highsec must be verified by some form of flag mechanic so that the battle between both parties is consensual now let me give you an expample of why it was days after our corp was formed when we had a new applicant he seemed okay nothing horrible about his past that we noticed at first he claimed to speak poor english and thus did not get into comms we let him join and ran missions with him for a few days he seemed fine until one day when a couple of the guys were on a mission alone he drops fleet and starts shooting at one of them the fight would have been fair except he had 2 logistic ships warp in on him and begin remote reps because he was in our corp the game did not flag them as aggressive essentially there was nothing they could do but get destroyed now i understand eve is a harsh place and the game mechanics allowed for this to happen so there is not much anyone can do except be even more precautious of new members but it does not have to be this way a simple pvpflag could prevent a lot of potential grievers
what your saying this guy attacked you in high sec he would have gotten his arse owned by concord a couple of logistics ships wouldnt have saved him even if your in the same corp i dont think that allows him to shoot at you even in high sec without concord showing up if he attacked you in low sec then to be honest your fair gamethis smells a bit too much of wow pve servers for my liking if you didnt check their api in future and keep a close eye on themas it stands i cant support this idea
boo on pvp flagging if your corp is killing you against your will leave them and join a good corp if you have spies infiltrate you and cost you a ship or two you got off easy let me repeat that you should be on your knees and giving thanks to the all mighty that he was stupid enough to give himself away so easily with a flagging system the bastard would have just waited until he got access to the good stuff in worst case scenario he could have robbed the corp blind and caused it to collapsealso it seems that making changes to how neutral repping in highsec works would be a better solution to the issueedit attacking another player or their stuff who is in the same player corporation as you does not cause a concord response
be more careful about who you recruit
by clicking undock you agree to have a permanent pvp flag on your ship deal with it or gb2wow
very much support streamlining the contract process by removing some of the dumb  poorly designed interruptions with regard to damaged mods my preference would be to be given two optionsrepair and continue which would take the cost from my walletremove damaged items and continue the interruption of the contract process by damaged mods is one of the most annoying and unnecessary features in the game especially when youre trying to contract scores or hundreds of items in remote stations to someone else get rid of it
very simple if a close my corp then i should have the ability to destroy delete or remove the shares scattered around especially the ones i gave to peoplefor now i cant and nobody cant after talking to a gm they cant either as they dont have the access to do it thats very weird but anyway i would like to have an option to destroy the shares i have if the corp is destroyed
shares are shares of ownership rationally speaking no one can destroy a corporation they dont completely ownthe only sensible thing to do is to make sure that the ceo has a majority stake so he has the power to do such thingsfurthermore the ability to buy back shares without resistance would also help quite a bitshares in general are messed up in a number of areas so your idea is not the best but your problem is quite valid
thats the problem for example i closed my old corp but created around 1m shares after i closed my corp i just remembered about the shares that were given to me and some other people since the corp is closed its useless to keep those shares they got no value so at the point i wanted to destroy them but i cant the game doesnt allow me to do it and not even ccp for now
id support the ability for a player to delete shares they own of corporations or maybe just closed corporations no support for other people deleting my shares of closed corpswhether automatically or manually  if i want to keep a memento i ought to be allowed to
yep which is why i refuse to use them stupid little things like that get down right annoyingshares are useful in marketing and trading but tend to be problematic
i wish the forum had a more advanced filter optionie character market  would be nice to to have the option to filter different characters character types pvpindustry filter asking prices and skill pointsyeah i know theres far more important stuff that needs doing but yeah it would be nice
to the contrary i think whs on average should stay open for a shorter period of time max 12 hours would suit me fine having lived in a wh for a few weeks i suggest that whs being open longer than they stay open now would be annoyingly tedious
actually i think the transit type wormholes ie the ones that connect lowseclowsec lowsecnullsec or nullsecnullsec for example should really stay open for a longer time
i think this was already proposed and i aint gonna search 3 million pages in here so heres the proposalto have ccp create a program  just like ventrilo that we could use for voice support pretty simple hey of course when you start the program and connect to a server then you could see some channels just like chat those channels could be linked with your username so if your in a corp the corp channel could pop up and same thing with the alliance channel if your in fw the corp militia and other type of channels could pop up when a fleet is created the fleet channel would be created simple as thatdont need to go in details but here are the upsdowns of itadvantageno need to rejoin fleet in case eve crash happened to me yesterdaymore channels since its dynamic and linked with your character name and your corporationcant think of others for now but i dont see anything negative that ccp would say no to thisdisadvantagelots of coding since this is a programresource from the computer but since its so low these days it wont be a big programsince its a program ccp could develop a codec selection list for bandwith purposenot sure on this but since this would be a program ccp might make people pay for it if thats the case i would buy it anywaynothing wrong with the current eve voice right now but i feel its not enough i would like to use a kind of program just like ventrilo or teamspeak another better idea would be for ccp to look at the sdk of teamspeak 3 and create the program with it im not the expert in coding but this i think would work well
not supported vents free as a client and there servers are cheapccp wont be doing any such things unless its conveniently in game or very very easy to implement
sure vent is free that i know but its usually privately used i would like to get in a voice program sometimes and meet people there not only the ones in my corp but also the ones probably in my regionconstellationsolar system or even ones that wants to roam in my sector that is 1 solution since lots of people will connect to ithow much time that happened to you when you wanted to pvp in a fleet but no one was there or even when you wanted to roam but not enough people in your corp im pretty sure theres at least 1 person in here that it happened this voice program should help decrease this other disavantagealso when you say easy you wont have to type ip address passwords and port numbers like ventrilo or teamspeak since its eve servers you open it you connect to it and thats it choose your channel and boom a good implementation would be to allow the user to create its on channel too
its called eve voice and its going to get overhauled rather soonnot supported
what overhaul is that  any details  if not your argument as no weight whatsoeversomething tells me your not supporting because of the log on trap  thats another disadvantage sure but lets face ts and vent exist for that too
first off im an industrialistsecondly making assumptions makes you look like an thirdly its called the cosmos i think project and if you had bothered to do your research youd know thatccp has indicated they plan to do a number of things to make life a little easier as to when that takes place is up to themthere is no reason to propose such a package becasue people already have vent and ts to use adding another program is just that one more choice not earth shattering enough to be of any use atm
heres what cosmos is from ccp caedmon from what i know nothing in cosmos suggest anything about voice and i wasnt at the fanfest so i dont know what was said exactly when you say plans  what plans  for cosmos  i answered that already so yeah i did my research so again whats the overhaul on voice you said again  im still waiting for detailsgo on the pvp side of eve and youll know that eve voice is not perfect its far from it most small fleets fw small corps uses ventrilo because its very easy to use and customize but usually not all of them i guess uses teamspeak since the bandwith usage because of the low quality of the codecs but it does take some expertise to tweak it in a way that its nearly perfect without a problemlike i said before no problem with eve voice but its not perfect bigger fleets is a mess with it you crash your done no more eve voice you gotta get an invite againif they accept it ofcthe reason for the package is valid because we already got eve voice integrated but its not the best tool for the voice comm sure its one more choice but thats with every product out thereps i never made an assumptionsits called knowledge most if not all that are not in pvp are not interested in this proposal
yes that would be terribly handy
ill bring this forward in a meeting in fact i already spoke to a few ccp about this a few weeks ago when i was in iceland ill do it again during fanfest
thisand have shifts of gm monitoring all hubs and favorite chat channels
its a pretty poor show but theres not a lot you can do about it im pretty sure nobody cares about the people posting in here perhaps if the people who are complaining they want to raise points at fanfest were to actually complain vocally at fanfest rather then backslapping each other making beer jokes comparing eve bum bags at guffawing at awful gags in devs speeches perhaps something might be done for next timeto be fair though in all probability and gathering what we can from the various csm hints there will be things in the responses to the issues brought up which would ruing the suprise of the unveiling of other things at fanfest  and thus they want to keep it underwrapsskunk
the aggressor has whatever grievance they decide is legitimate now sometimes this is easy kills but more often than not there are actually reasons to go to war if you smack me and i decide to teach you a lesson about that that is my prerogative if you are undercutting me and i trace the activity back to you you are a legitimate target if you are mining ore that i want you are a legitimate target if i want to put you under a wardec to slow down your corp activity in empire you are a legitimate target this is by design within the framework of eve as long as the fee is paid i see no reason to put some kind of limit on it based on activity some groups have had mutual wardecs running for years for rp reasons or whatever this should now be artificially cut short just because you dont want the conflict is a pretty dumb idea if you dont want to be decced stay in an npc corp its a good thing you guys dont work as game designers because eve would have died ages ago if the continual whines about wardecs had ever been acted on
term limits and helping to keep idiots from decloaking each other is more important to the csm than the issue that over 1200 people have signed very well on the order of term limits i vote that the current csm term ends immediately
no it is more like we discussed the scanner issues with ccp when we saw them facetoface a few weeks ago and theyre aware of player unhappiness and are looking at revising the current restrictions people were spamming the scanner and it was producing quite a load on the servers inserting the delay reduced this drastically
you guys wanna get your stories straight
vrikshaka  i do not see any substantial inconsistency in what my colleagues responded to that issuethe minutes of tonights meeting are published on the evelopedia and a raw log is available too as usual
why should you have to spend isk on repairing them that doesnt make any sense im sorry you dont see isk draining from your wallet when you rr drones so why in that situation
you always have the option of remote repping your drones for free even with the drone repair bay however you can always dock up and repair them similarly you always have the option of equipment armorhull repair modules to repair your ship for freenot adding a cost to it would make the station service obsolete
what about hull damage unless im missing something you cant repair hull damage in space the op stated that this feature would be invaluable if you were in hostile space without a station nearby then you could repair damaged dronesfighters which had hull damage slowly over timestation repair services would still have a purpose you wont be able to repair damaged modules with this will you 
if you pray to your god maybe you can repair hull damage without a station have you triedthe point is station repair service to me seems to be becoming more and more obsolete right now it appears to only fix heat damage and those lazy pilots who dont purchase a armorhull repairer which costs about 1m repairs if you do it in station  anyone gonna fix that for that price i want a full waxing and everyone on my shipthat said i dont want prices to be ridiculous like that but they shouldnt be free either you incurred damage do you think that when a projectile hits you your armor receives no mass loss thered be chunks in space furthermore its a good way to make sure that a sizable chunk of isk that goes into the game also comes out
for me it just seems a bit silly its your ship your fightersdrones but you have to pay for them to be fixed if they introduce hull repair systems then fine but seeing that we dont i think it should just be free you incur shield damage and it regenerates you dont have to pay for that lol what your suggesting is a bit like this scene on a nimitz carrier pilot  oh hey bob thanks for fixing that f18 for medeck chief  no problem that will be 5000 please i accept paypal and all major credit cards a carrier relies on its fighters and drones being in tip top condition having hull damage that cant be repaired however little does affect its combat performance it makes complete logical sense to have this feature hell make it a trainable skill for carriersuper carrier pilots say 5 increase to repair amount per minute of all fightersdrones in the hanger deck per level
supported
how about putting them in a bathtub with gel and hook their brains up to a computer
i got used to it  like you can get used to drive a car with a flat wheel you may control it but it just dont feel right
of course if ccp would give a crap about pvp
same here i dont like it but i do what i can for once youll see more people using there heads when it comes to hunting lmao
give them time to sort through all the alts posting support this change almost only and exclusively affects pvpers that target defenceless belt rattersminers in lo sec00 which are already pretty scarce to begin with and im using the term pvp losely here since pve fits have zero chance against pvp fits in combatthis change may actually bring a tiny bit of life back into the lo sec belts and youre having an emoragequit moment over itffs relax go take your add and pimple control meds go introduce yourselves to the sun and give this change a chance for once
fix it pls
hilmar our goal of being a very transparent company
i support this proposal
i didnt even have to read past the topic to know id support this one ingenius idea
genius at work heresupport
yes
yesdont they all cost the same amount as eachother anyway so it shouldnt be that hard to just implement an option on what you want to use your plex for once you buy it or something like that so it doesnt create 3 seperate markets as the character sale  character portrait market would be dead in comparison to gtcsalso if im not mistaken there is more supply than there is demand when it comes to gtc at the moment so i guess that would help the situation
what you want is this
uh what nos needs a buff nothing can really use it anymorealright agree with thisi think lower pg was one of the suggestionsthe rest of your post was pretty good points  stats however even if this isnt a step in the exactly right direction its a great deal better than the current situation
not sure why this hadnt happened way back afterall since the nos nerf its practically useless outside missionsso pretty much anything that has less then oh say 2400 gj of cap pretty much better stay away from dodge even in the current nos nerf state 1200gj going into a capships 100000 cap pretty much does nothing to raise the amount of cap they have or can use instead their cap can be low enough that you are simply using the cap nos like neuts on subcapsthis i like it means you can burn through your cap charges twice as fast and some people might even overinject lots it will also mean people might be able to get more gank out of their ships in very short termalready getting 50 reduction of stront and 300second cycles more then enoughactive tanking just isnt there i see lots of good eve vids with active tanks but in real pvp active tanks just dont work you die so quickly that u dont get rep cycles in the extra 10 wont change much
good idea ive wanted a boost to pvp activetanking for quite some time nosses are somewhat useless now too i mean the nos could be a good counter to neuts but if you have the same ammounts of nosses on a ship as your enemy has neuts on his ur most likely gonna loose the capfight that doesnt make sense to me as nosses are practically useless in most other situationsdunno much about the capstuff but the other things are great 
active tank discussion is interesting but i think you should drop the nos thing and the following chap makes clear the reason whythe nos is not the counter for having been neuted thats what cap boosters are for changing the nos to do double cap  or even the same cap as a neut would not help you in your situationlets say we both have 100gj in our capacitors and i spend 20gj taking 20gj from you yes i know in practice i take more but not enough more to alter the point im making here you then fire your nos and get nothing nada bupkas why because we have the same cap this is what the nos is for it ensures that all things being equal you will never cap out whilst he has capacitor to give you but it will not disadvantage him to help you so even if you boost nos by 1000 youre still not helping yourself all youre doing is making small ships that attack larger ones even more cap stable and frankly they should be more or less that anyway with the values as they are
i agree with all these proposed changes
i would prefer sr t2 ammo to give positive tracking bonuses rather than more damage even doing identical damage to t1 ammo would be goodon the minmatar chages i think the 1650mm cannon needs something more more range probably so that they can work with the 250km lr sniperfleets
i quite like the falloff mechanic seems a much more natural thing than the lasers cliffside drop off in dpswe are discussing this in the test server feed back thread on navy ships and generally agree that a tempest should be changed from a rofdamage to a damagefalloff bonus setreason being a decent gain 10lvl in falloff would be the best way to narrow the gap on the scorchapoc and javraven when using acs keeping it competitive to a phoon but trading a bit of dps for a beefier midrange this would also give artillerys a nice boost on effective range without making the tempest just an apocclonethe double damage bonus of say 10lvl  depending on just where the projectile changes go would give the tempest a real niche as the king of alphastrike for gangs and small fleets without obsoleting the maelstrom as the tempest would still be behind in dps and ehptank
hello allif you are lambda member this will probably not be interesting for you thought you may be interestedif you are corpalliance ceo or managers this thread will surelly interest you please take time to read it and comment it many people are talking about dominion regarding change in souverainty and so oni think that as ccp what to give more dynamism to alliance and boost internal and local production to do so ccp need to totally rethink the system regarding acces rights and corporate hangardeveryone knows that corp thiefs are commun in eve and that they take advantage of a rather basic and non efficient right management systemdominion will bring new features and needs that are to be  larger acces to warehouse more people in charge of corp and alliance assetswork and more asset splitting within corporationthe probleme is that the existing system is not good at all to manage and make possible such changesnot easy to manage  it does not have a clear hierarchic mapnot easy to set up new titles as it needs hours and hours of testing making sure that the title does not give backdoors and make what you intend it to donot easy to track  the only thing you can track is member last login and pull a query on each type of rights or title base on a limited number of title and warehous  only 10 title can be created only 7 warehouse availbale for corp pos title totally non sense  when you own a pos ceo or managers must give you rights to acces all tower creating a very big security issue bpo use require too many rights and acces to be used by everybody  a bpo option in personnal and corpalliance should allow everybody to use them like a hugh library that can be used but not taken wallet acces are required when using pos production modules how stupid is this you own the pos do not set charges on it so you dont pay but you still need to have acces to pay 00 isk  so on 7 wallet one is automatically blocked to allow people to use lab prod array and so onmaybe ccp should think about changing radically the following things  create a map of title clearly showing access links and what can be done with it  add more corp warehouse create alliance warehouse create alliance title and rights with a cross corporation systemcreate an efficience title tracking for title changes and so on find a way to avoid giving acces to wallet when using pos structure that are charged 00 isk and so create usefull and clear logfile for warehouse and rightstitle modification add an option to bpo so that they can be used by corp members without having them able to take or see bpo  bpo library or so  minerals would be directly taken from personnal assets no need to drop in corp asset create real private title for personnal pos owner add walletsmany other things can be addedplease fell free to add or discuss my propositionsi hope that guyz from ccp will take this in accountthe more people will reply and add content the better chance we will have to get change in this right acces management nightmarebest regardsoriginal post

well i was playing this game for almost 2 years now i have few friends who tried the game they all quit1st was a wowlike mmos player for whom eve is way too complex2nd was a teenage son of my friend both are wow players too he wanted to pvp badly but didnt really want to put any effort to learn how to fly his ship in the end his dad who saw his son playing told him that the game is crap3rd guy an aircraft mechanic liked it although didnt even try to enjoy the social aspect of the game in the end he decided that the game costs way too much and he prefers to spend 15 euros a month on cigaretts4th guy again a wow player who got bored with it wanted something different he played eve for 2 weeks and got back to wow5th bio or environment or sth engineer he liked the game although he thinks its too expensiveand me i have 2 accounts main characters having about 27 mils sp each and tbh with you theres a lot of newbies who play this game in a much more enjoyable way than i do simply because i lack the ideas on how to use my sps and im too lazy to think and come up with some strategies and tacticswhats more ive not so long ago got my first solo kill in pvp and no i didnt drop a dd on top of a noobship i used a t1 frig set up in a noobish way which doesnt require millions of sps it did require some knowledge on how to set the overview how to use a scanner etc brains or willingness to learn game mechanics over spsconclusion1 there are many people who wont like the game simply because they lack ideas how to have fun with it and they are probbably cheaters and premium features lovers  or would just like the game producer to show them some simple way of playing im not saying thats bad as everyones different and i used cheats in games too but there are games for them already2 wow players might not like the game as its completely different mostly because of a vast freedom of choice in characters development ships fitting trading strategies which all make this game very complex and confusing following this way of thinking giving a new player more sps at the begining would only add to complexity of choices concerning character development and proper fitting of a ship in fact getting the skills to use eves interface properly and increasing awareness of game mechanics saves more isk and gives more opportunities of a balanced fight than lvl5 skills and t2 shipsand one more thing about ccps ads and recommending the game to other players i doubt that ccps goal is to get millions of fans who just hacknslash everything that moves when theres an advertisement of a luxury car on tv its not aimed at achieving attention of people who cant afford to buy it even though the product itself may look tempting besides i doubt ccp could even compete with blizzard who dominaites hacknslash market the same way luxury car producers dont bother to compete with companies that produce cheap cars in large numbersif you dont recommend eve to your friends it wont hurt ccp at all eve has at least 100000 players who will the last thing an easier game  more players there are some premium things in eve already though one can buy an etc from ccp and sell it for isk thus giving ccp more money for the cluster upgrades and allowing poor players who have the will to find a way of earning some good isk quickly to keep on playingand theres of course already mentioned by threads author himself a possibility to buy a character from another player it again requires either cash or some some consideration and strategy on how to make enough isk fast
i agree that all players should get couple million sp to assign not just new onesmost of people that disagree here are not really new players and so they think that everyone has isk backing and some other character to playnew player will start with around 60k sp and wont be even able to fit civilian damage control on their shipits true that they can remap to learn learning to 5 and then to train for retriever or hulk but as a 3 month old player i assure you that is not road that new player takes but rather designated alt routeif you are telling somebody what route to take you are probably making sure that person moves on to some other game as they will hate game in which all they can do is mining or mission runningits mine understanding that in the past players were able to pick career option that gave them around 800k sp and they were able to move on from thereccp should have built on that system instead of creating current one where you get 60k sp and speed learning bonusperhaps they should even remove learning skills from game as well as some of the most assinine skills like targeting and some others that dont serve real purpose but level 5 might be required for soemthing useful
i only read the first paragraph and i stopped cause i cant hear myself anymore i screamed yelled whining ed too much herein other words no you will suffer just like alllll of usbesides just because you got 5m sp doesnt mean you know how to fly a ship effectively in combat get in a corp that will learn you the ropes if they dont do that and if thats what you need change corpseriously cause they suck
no no nohaving a bunch of skill points to toss around still isnt going to do these people any good because they still dont have the player knowledge to effectively assign or use themnewb woo i spent my 10 million sp now i can fly carrierscorpmate great im in trouble assign me some fightersnewb what are fighterscorpmate boom we all see the results when some cash loaded newb comes in sells a bunch of plex and buys a character with wtfomgbbqpwn skills and then promptly loses a nyx or something similar 20 minutes into the game and then comes to the forums to whine about it
really whether they are saying it nicely or not the rest of the people in this thread are pretty much righteither you enjoy the game and skilling system and work with it doing what you can as you gain more sp or you dontif you dont and would rather have game time  leveling up spwise wow or the like is your game and ccp doesnt mind you leaving to play it if ccp wanted the game to be the hotest greatest and top game out there they would have designed it wow like as you described instead they want a game they enjoy making and we enjoy playing and in the process they have done a lot for new players to get into it easier along the way but no they wont hand everything to you on a silver platterby the way they have new players that quit due to realistic new player limitations the kind that show the player that this must not be the game they want to play but they also have new players that keep playing because it is a fun game and they enjoy the skill system
esp if they are coming from a game where you do not loose your stuff when you diei am constantly confused at people who use and then they went back to wow as a justification for changes to eve if they went back to wow it is because wow works better for the eve is not wow and is different because it is designed for people who are not interested in wow in general at least
most corps that advertise that sound anywhere close to compelling have sp requirements that are sometimes 6 months to attainits pretty easy to get into a cruiser but it seems that cruisers are a giant wall getting into anything bigger is suicide because you wont be able to fit it with anything remotely usable without spending 3570 days of trainingthe problem isnt that it takes so long the problem is that you are relatively worthless for months yeah theres ways you can get creative to use a newbie but then again how creative are people everyone agrees the learning curve in eve is extremely high this is due to a lack of general creativity and problemsolving skills of the player however keep in mind it is up to the game to entertain the people not the people to find a way to entertain themselves not all people are willing to hunt and peck for a reason to play a gamei love space i love space ships and planets and in general anything that resembles scifi eve was the best game that is being offered but despite my sincere desire to play the game it took me 3 cancellations before i finally got iti love the idea that skill points are earned at a dramatically increased rate for new players i think it should be more so and possibly even accelerated further descending with time instead of just dropping you off the edge first week 4x second6th 25x 6th week10th week 2x 1012th 15x landing the player around what 8m sp in 3 months of play meaning after playing eve for 3 months you can join a guild of your choosing and have had time to make mistakes with your skill tree and had the opportunity to fix them without being stuck in the tar pit
wrong eve is a niche game for those of us who know how to and get the most enjoyment and entertainment from finding our own path to fun the numbers of people who get it continue to increase year over year its not a problem that the majority of gamers dont get it its evidence that the vision has not been lost

this has my support
csm term limits received a total support of 3 with some csm members opposing it how can this be in the submission and receive any credible ccp inputwaste of time better spent elsewhere
maybe i should apply to become csm at least i already know i am caesari like it how it is now tbh though 1 change might be to get actual representationaka get at least 2 carebear positions 2 market jockey positions 2 low sec positions 2 00 positions i also like the idea of alliance leaders getting in there it kinda proves that ccp isnt padding the csm with ccp employees then again enslaver from lotka volterra turned out to be a ccp employee
as many mission runners know once you go below 50 standing with a faction it becomes impossible to run missions for them the remedy for empire faction standing is simple  run missions for sisters of eve for pirate factions you can only raise faction standing by running missions for an allied faction if youre 50 with those several factions you will never be able to repair that standingcoming from other mmos with various npc faction systems im completely opposed to designs that enable players to permanently damage standing the system design for empire factions may be a tedious long slog but its appropriately available as an option for those that want to do itmore to the point under current pirate faction standings design players with a second or third account have a tremendous advantage they simply train a weeks worth of social skills on a fresh alt and can then actually runcomplete missions using their main character this proposal doesnt affect me personally as i have multiple accounts and have not yet irreparably damaged my standing with any faction still i think it would be a good improvement to eve i suggest sisters of eve missions be modified to also give standings to pirate factions or ccp create a new corporation which would work for pirate factions the way sisters does for empire factionssee the third post below for an interesting alternative method
specially for people whove been running loads of missions in empire before heading out in 00 spacewhile beginning your eve career you wont have any idea that those missions will prevent you from ever doing pirate faction missions ever again
a corp mate just made another alternative selectioncreate certain agents in each home region of all factions that for a price reset your faction standing with all factions the price would be a hefty 1 billion isk or similar and have the benefit of serving as an isk sink while also having the drawback that it would reset all positive faction standings to 0 as well as negative ones for role players this could be explained as obtaining new identity documentsedit after thinking about it briefly i realize that this might also appeal strongly to empirebased mission runners and those participating in factional warfare as long as you lose positive standings with negative i dont really see a downside to it that in combination with the cost it could be escalating or a fixed fee would serve to deter people from using it frequently it could also have a cool down period like neural remapping if ccp thinks that is necessaryim personally pretty open on whatever the mechanism would be  isk sink time sink you name it whatever the solution it should remain independent of security status though for example you shouldnt have to run missions killing concordded in order to raise pirate faction standing there may be some that are but i assume they would be rare and you could decline those
i support both these possibilities there really needs to be a way back if you messed up when you started the game i messed up my standings doing lvl4 missions for caldari witch kept me out of fw and from doing missions for pirate factions yeah all of them ccp make this happen one way or another
supported or add lp rewards that forgive some amount of negative standing with that faction
just an idea1 get an alt2 let that alt grab missions for you3 4 profit
he specifically mentioned that and stated it as a disadvantage to people without multiple accountsanother idea run missions you can run and turn those lp items into standing for pirate factions iei run khanid navy missions and purchase a khanid navy energized adaptive nano membrane i smuggle this item into delve and sell it to an agent there who trades me the item for standings the agents will want specific items that are already attainable and some rp thing can be put in about their stocks running low or needing them to reverse engineer keep the idea of smuggling and black market trading to keep it interesting this would keep ccp from having to program much more than a new agent into the game and the ability to increase standing that way also while running missions it might hurt your standings a bit but they should be more than offset by the itemscould be tags too
i support this even if im not impacted but to make one part of the game better for a lot of players
hello i know several sides of eve and wanted to suggest an idea covering several issues1 too much isk in the game2 too many players leaving due to character growing slowly3 many people having a weird feeling about certificates being good for nothingkill em all certificate does not look like a piece of game character like skill it looks like something more formal achievable acquirable and yet they dont get too deep into the game just towards real good core and ok spec skills so let the eve universities sell them certificate needs all prerequisite certificates to be bought and a big sum of money to get training all the prereq skills missing im talking about approx 20 bils for core competency elite summed upafter like hour of intense thinking im really sure it wont upset the balance it will get iskies out of the game quicker and it will get rid of people from level based mmorpgs complaining unability to use their massive online presense to catch up with the bigger guysps im almost sure someone must have raised that issue already but maybe related to skills only but evesearch is unreachable atm so i eagerly spam what i feel like being right thanks for reading
eve has defined itself as a game where time is significant you need to subscribe for a period to earn sp you have to be active to change skills and you can earn isk to purchase equipment ccp earns money from you submitting to this treatment of gameplay therefore whats wrong with your proposala ccp loses money due to not requiring players to subscribe to the game for longer periods of time i myself buy gtcs when i want to make another character etc but not stop my training process what you propose would mean i wouldnt need to buy those gtcs on market price may go down if global effect is strong and then less people will supply gtcb unfair treatment towards older players of eve these players are ccps real market they have earned ccp a steady stream of income over the years and probably for years to come do they really want to wake these sleeping giantsc breaks the imagine of eve online what makes eve different from wow well for one the skill process i hate playing games where the troll standing next to me is 30 levels higher simply because he has no life eve doesnt reflect the amount of social life youve thrown away playing the gamethat is why im not going to support this to change that feature would be to trim the advantages or differences which set eve apart from every other mmo these differences are important
argonius i heartfully thank you for a very good note of criticism it basically means putting together all issues possible due to my suggestionand you are right basically what you said is the real drawback of what im offeringhowever id like to once again stress on the big part of isk cost if you think 20bils is not big enough make it 100bils for reason respect to older players  man remember how actually many skills are out of certification planning cover for good and are not achievable through proposed systemtime based nature of the game  big cost stands for it to get the money you need time its just a question of deciding how bignot selling gtcs  and where do you think a person from out of the game would suddenly get all that isk with isk farmers currently in rapid decline right  from buying gtcs and selling plexes to the community while plexes as you know are very well affected by existing marketting balanceand one single attack on you because only one part of your position surprises me  sacrificing social life is supposed to be a bonus wake up cool people often just buy characters here and do such amount of insta trolling that any user of proposed system would be left to nervously smoke nearby in all ill end here our two votes form a nice shape of pros and cons of the mentioned ideathanks again
firs of all you failed at searching buying sp was a topic not even a week ago and the consensus was nowhat many players really fail to understand training the sp is one thing learning how to use those new skills properly is a 2nd thing last but not least  just because a skill is training doesnt mean you cant do anything in eve and btw  buying certificatestitles irl is also illegal you have to stay there and do all the tests aswellthat said  not supported
why the hell would i want to spend isk on something that is nothing more than a piece of paper saying i know this
i think hes talking about spending isk to get certificates which would give you the sp specified in the certificateif thats the case fail for another thread from a new player that wants sp but doesnt want to wait around for it in wow you spend every waking moment killing x number of rats to make your character level up in eve you set skills that train over real life hours much better in my opinion which is why im playing this gameif he meant spending isk to get the certificates after youve skilled which we currently get for free im with drake and would just say no to certificates they would be pointlessthe day you can buy sp with isk or otherwise is the day i quit eve as it would have become neopets online pay money for your new clothes on your character yay thankfully that day will never come
its a rhretorical question at best but yes my sentiments exactlybuying sp hell noan isk sink for certs hell the majority of the playerbase doesnt give a damn over certs at best
heres a thought though admittedly i probably wouldnt support my own idea despite it benefiting ccpplayers submit plex cards to concord covering the amount of days they want to train in other words say you were 90 days away from the skills needed for a hull tanking  elite certificate you would submit 3 plexes to concord in exchange for the skills that way you tie it in to legally purchasing isk and ccp gains revenue overall from plex salesrough idea like i said but im curious what your opinions are of it
any buying sp for money is wrong
1 get cash or grind for isk2 get lots of plex3 trade up for sp4 sell 3 day old uber account for a crapload of isk5 rinse and repeatconclusion  anyone who makes a suggestion for buying sp is a ing  of a idiotsorry you have no excuse for not thinking aheadplease people give it up stop turning eve into wow
while i largely agree i have to nitpick one point if any wellfunded capital force can get pirate faction ammo and is willing to do so for a 10 dps boost wouldnt they still be willing to do so for a further 5 boost after this change maybe pair it with a drop rate decrease on the good stuff to keep capital ammo as a whole on par with the status quo also now that titans have real weapons i could support 20 ammo as long as its rareexpensive enough that only titans can really use it but thats a really minor issue
considering the only place to get highgrade 20 ammo now is from faction drops and for highgrade faction capital ammo thered have to be faction capital ships to destroy outside of l5 missions thats a good reason not to put it in the lp store and nothing would stop them from using the 15 but the 10 might be cheap enough through mission runner competition to justify using it in poses the only way i could see putting the 20 stuff in is if it were dropped in 5000 round bpcs dropped from faction ratsalso supporting my own proposal
the issue is if a revelation uses xl faction the crystals become dmged or unpackaged the revelation dies and youre left with unsellable crystals so you just reprocess them this leads to alot of waste in these crystals to the point where faction xl crystals practically dont exist on markets in empiremoros on the otherhand has stackable ammo which makes its way back onto the marketeither way bring back empire xl ammo means a large supply for dreads to use to do more dps and kill more cant see the problem here
i too want extra pewing power
last time i was in any semimajor trade hub the supply of pirate faction ammo seemed fine to me granted i only looked at seprentis and dark blood but i have to assume theres angel ammo out there tooempire mission runners have plenty of stuff to cash in their lp for already the pirate mission runners in 00 have my support on this onenot supported
the last thread on this matter is locked due to inactivity and as far as i can tell evesearch csm wiki this matter has not yet been raised by the csmproposal increase maximum fleet sizethe current maximum fleet size in game with full skills wings and squads is 256 members with most major alliances able to max that out easily with a cta mail or announcement a few days in advance of the operation it is my opinion and the opinion of other members of the larger alliances that increasing the fleet size to either 512 or larger decreases the hassle of organising two fleets at the same time for those that dont know that would include two sets of warpins cynos titans for bridging simultaneously and in some cases two fcs for broadcastingcalling targetsin the upcoming dominion expansion ccp have detailed that to keep their 00 holdings alliances will have to utilise more of their systems this entails either installing pets or bolstering alliance membership numbers these new members would also be expected to fleet up to protect their space making the current fleet member cap more and more awkward especially for the current alliances who can already max fleets outfixing the problemeither through increasing the number of pilots able to join each squad or increasing the number of wings able to be created in a fleetthis may have to entail new skills to reach these new numberspros and conspros decrease in the amount of work needed to operate a large fleetcons none that i can think of also this would in no way encourage larger fleets or more blobbing the current or future numbers would just be grouped together under one fleet
signing my own proposal
agreed even though it is a cough atlas member asking for bigger fleets
yeah 256 is far too low in this era if theres going to be a hard cap at all it should be north of a thousand id be fine with adding a rank 16 armada command skill to unlock it if you want to keep smallgang skill reqs the same but the cap is far too low
signedyes nothing more annoying to get a fleet already has 256 members
signed
add another level completly is my take would allow better coordinated fleets the fc can take the highest level to allow a fleet booster at fc position or better cooperation with some casses of multiple alliances probably would be limited use
signed
is it not appropriate that a very large number of pilots require more work to coordinate than a smaller number
i have to agree with scatim helicon on this
they already do if you want to get the same kind of performance out of them as from a smaller fleet a hard cap like this shouldnt be used to force the issue it is only acceptable if it is mandatory because of technical limitations
if they can do it without more lagsigned
signed
signed because it sucks having to make a second fleet to hold our hordes
signed
noyay lets make it easy to form bigger blobsgame mechanics need to change the other way tbo to make it harder and less useful to blob up and wino look theres 1000 people in local yay fun no
40k m3 is a little out of line with other l4 courier missionsthe lack of quality 20 agents is a strange and easily remedied discrepancy
its no problem pnuka ill just haul it in my cargo expanded revelahahahahahahahahahahahaha
yes that why i choose to look at the results of 95 years worth of pvp activityin 95 years worth of pvp data there are going to be the results of all types of scenariosstatistacally no weighting has been applied to different types of scenario  to do this would require the exercise of opinionthe raw data allready contains an accurate weighting of all different scenario types yes you can keep trying to incinuate this to other readers  its not true however many times you say itnon of the raw data is from my own activitythe same formulas have been applied to all ships equally and without prejudice
would a fleetwide overview option available to the fleet boss only to select all cloaked ships keep distance at 3000 meters from same be viableothe ideasa leadershipbased skill that grants pilots in a squadwing the ability to see each othera high or midslot module that gives all pilots in the same squad the ability to see each other
decloak immunity is a step too farwhat would be useful is the ability for cloaked ships to indicate their position ongrid via the broadcast window to other fleet members while remaining cloaked that would make retaining your cloak a matter of coordination and intelligence rather than dumb luck
this would kind of make senseit would make deployments of stealth ships somewhat less problematic
this
this or tactical formations as fleet options which would keep the ships far enough apart
agreed  supported
i suggested this back when stealth bombers were originaly upgraded to covops cloaks and its nice of scatim to repeat itmake the in position broadcast to fleet work for cloaked shipsas it is now broadcasting while cloaked just defaults to the nearest planet but if it displayed your location in 3 dimensional space where everyone on grid and in fleet could see it then it becomes a test of comms and coordination to position ppl without decloaking each otherbut for now thumbs up as something needs doing
so if i understand this right a neutral enemy bad guy good guy or anyone that is not in your fleet will uncloak you but only the people in your fleet will not uncloak you  whoaaa dont know whos your pusher but give me his number i want what your smoking on a serious note no doesnt make sense theres more ways to work with this limitation since your doing bombing runs you should be able to figure a way for this so dont ask me i wont even reply here to tell you
supportedid also like to see some way to actually see my cloaked friends in the gang
valid gripe  but your solution is too powerfuli would support gang members being able to see each other  using the cloaked graphics this could be explained rp wise as the ships transmitting to each other there positions through there ftl interfacessome work would be needed on the gang warp to keep ships adequatelly spaced off course
someone whos got time will have to cd this but i understood that the following was truea ccp were aware of the decloak issue and agree that its not intended behaviourb ccp want to remove the issue but the coding is somewhat complex so itll be fixed soontmin any case continuing to poke them about it is a good thing also anyone who votes no has clearly never tried to run a covops only gang and thus is not entitled to an opinion
absolutely yes please
supported making it easier for fcs to organise fleets would make combat in this game all the more fun id altso like to see more hotkeys
thumbs up as with most proposals of this nature numbers need tweaking specifics but the idea is great
no support as said above i dont find it a problem with cloaking in fact its a tactic used to scare minersratters into docking up and if you can afk in space all the time then thats a total day of loss for them if they start rattingmining  you attack one and show them your waiting for them to get sloppysbs already give off a huge amount of damage and catch people despite being listed in local only poor pilots would complain about thison that note when i mine i usually watch tv or play another game while doing it so im not always looking at local 100 of the time cause id die of lack of player involvement
great idea dsupported all the way
i had an idea that might reduce the amount of time it takes to travel i call it jgl for jumpgate linking how it would work is simple a ship would come up to any gate and with the right skills you tell the gate to link with the next couple of gates that would be in your route therefore you might be able to avoid low sec system that are being camped or just save time to your main destination skill sets that can come from this is 1 jgl skillbook x8 enable jumpgate linking subsystem within gate network lvl4 lets you jump 5 gates within region at lvl5 you can jump 6 gates across regions penalty 30 second wait time per gatelink2 jgl reliability x5  lvl1 15 lvl2 30 lvl3 50 lvl4 70 lvl5 90 of successful jgl3 jgl waittime reduction x5  lvl1 10 lvl2 20 lvl3 30 lvl4 40 lvl5 50 reduction of waittime per jgl4 jgl pirate gate x5  allows you to use jgl on pirate gates only lvl4 lets you jump 5 gates within region at lvl5 you can jump 6 gates across regions penalty 20 second wait time per gatelinkthe system would be limited to two groups ie group 1  freighters and group2 battleships and battle cruisers type shipsshadowburn
nosaving time eve travel is too quick already this woiuld just make the game feel even smaller which is exactly the opposite of whats neededreducing risk you can already reduce the risk of lowsec travel by planning appropriately making use of the intelligence tools available and using scouts or cloaked ships we dont need to remove the exposure to these risks we need to teach people how to prepare for them and work within themnot supported
this idea sucksthink the consequences through
being smart travelling in lowsec is as safe as highsec sometimes i feel less secure in systems like niarjauedama than i do in lowsec oh and covert transports just rock dso coming to the conclusion  i cant really support this
you obviously didnt take the time to think about what would happen with such a system in place as a whole did younot supported yet an another noob proposal
id buy me a second monitor just for this tbh
exactly i work on webpages and setup domain names and alias domains and subdomains it would take a total of 15 minutes max and since eveonlinecom is already mirroring portions of eveonlinecom it wouldnt be that hard at all
oh really its that easyfor someone who claims to be an expert you sure make a lot of assumptions about how eveonlinecom is set upreally smart of you golf claps
introduction of tracking yesremoval nolosec should give some degree of security albeit a low one the perfect tracking on sentries really does hurt the budding pirates most though i suppose it does prepare them nicely for a life of getting the shortend of the stick on almost every gamemechanic where security status comes into play
well i managed more than once to make a suicide tackle and still get out in a frigate it isnt all that bad 
all it will mean is that frigates will be camping lowsec gates bad idea
fixed and also adding to the no camp camp belts in small ships or defended locations in larger ones lowsec shouldnt be nullsec i think the balance is about right even if i would prefer to catch those cloaky haulers
well the idea is really temptingwhat about flagging a character who is stealing from a can or salvaging if the owner of the wreck is in close distance to it lets say 30 km that would give a chance to warp disrupt the aggroer and try to destroy his or her ship it would make carebears bring webbers and warp disruptors with them on a mission introducing them to some pvp if they decide to take part in itand of course if the wreck would be farther than 30 km from the owner it would be treated as a leftover and would not bring a flag on a ninjasalvager
per ccp mitnal per gm faolchu  per senior gm ytterbium  per ccp prism x  these quotes are kept handy for your convenience at ironfleetcom
100 ways to shoot yourself into the foot1 shoot the guy salvaginglooting your wrecks
it is considered my salvage by the code that determines whether or not i can tractor it either it is my salvage or everyone should be able to tractor btw i do believe everyone should be able to tractor itthey should just go flashy red when they take it if you want to salvage someone elses mission you should be willing to risk your ship or bring friends to protect you
wrecks are containers which is why they are yellowloot belongs to you salvage does not ccp supports ninjasalvaging per ccp dropbear
i for one think it should not matter as salvage and loot are one and the same
no need for change if you wanted that salvage you would be the ninja salvager to it if you dont make it to it before him then you dont want it thusly we can conclude easily enough nothing bad has happened
i am amazed by your poor logic the same could be said about looti do not disagree that ninja salvaging adds something positive to the game however i do disagree that it adds something positive to the game when i have no recourse i could at least hunt them down or war dec if ninja salvagers were not 2 to 4 week old alt characters in newb corps

ohh for the people that takes what the dev said exactly it doesnt count cause theres a lots of rules that were removed by arguing and making points even some devs do not accept some rules but what the majority wants the majority getswhen you speak to them you can feel that there not accepting certain game mechanics hey its all about the money at the end if 70 made up number are mission runners and there the most people who pay and doesnt accept the salvage issue going on from a broad perpertive you will have no choice at one point or another so please stop quoting what devs told thats not strong enough
this tbqfhU266Aeditagreeoh ye of little faith
so how come you cant tractor them even when theyre emtpy actually how come you get concordockened if you shoot a yellow wreck but not a white oneto op if you think this is gonna help you keep your salvage think again this will just become yet another canflip mechanic which im perfectly fine with
i am perfectly fine with that as well i just want the ability to shoot at them when they do it
since ccp  csm seems to have rejected the issue because of the server latency issues reverting this change back to no delay i am proposing another possible solution that still prevents scanner spamming but makes the scanner much more tolerable for pvpi suggest giving the scanner a maximum of 5 scans without delay and that each scan would take 2 seconds to recover if you are feeling creative you could even throw in some skills to increase this like survey giving 1 scan per level or making the number of scans based on the survey skill which is almost useless at the moment in pvp often you will find yourself needing to use the scanner rapidly but for short periods of time when you are trying to pinpoint a target like warping to a celestial then scanning a few belts or checking a system in an interceptorcovert ops i think this will be a huge improvement over the current scannerpeople who simply spam the scanner will very quickly meet the 2 second scanner delay so the extra load would be very minimal
it wont work you can spam the button 5 times then you wait 2 seconds and you spam 5 times again same thing latency issues will come back again from ccps point of view  even the csm will not accept it and even if they do ccp wontyour proposal goes back to square 1 more informationscan results and all sent to the user
i mean that you get 1 of 5 back every 2 seconds youd have to wait 10 seconds to get all 5 of your scans back
this idea is allready on these forums it was languishing back on page 20 or something like that thoughmight wanna go suport the original
yes herschel it was very late no need to apologize if you havnent noticed i love confrontationfor those who dont like my post sorry my iphone didnt come with spell checker or micro soft word i really did fail english although i speak english perfectly if you think the timer sucks for a pc imagine trying to get your ideas out on an iphone while trying to play eve i guess where i come from we were always more interested in what somone had to say than how they said it when somone gives me a present i accept it whether it is gift wrapped properly or handed to me covered in duct tape because i know that its not the box or the even the item inside the box but the thought behind it that really counts that being said i do see your points of view i just find some parts of them extremley off point snobbish and just plain rudeherschel in 00 when somone speaks they would be listed in the left box along with what they have said same as now the number bracket at the top of the chat would increase from 0 to 1the post would remain long after you or the person who posted it has jumped out of that system also the same as nowonce that person jumps out or loggs the number in the top bracket would drop by 1 again just about the same as nowthe corporation icon in the right hand listing is where the real difference would be after the person has spoken it would become more like its high sec cousin the corporation icon belonging to that player would now have a bracketed number indicating how many members of that corporation that are currently present that have spoken if expanded it would open its drop down and any members of that corporation that have spoken and are still in that system would be listed once one of the corporations members who have spoken leaves then the number on that icon decreases and they disapear from their corp icons drop down when all members of a corp are out of a system then their corporation icon would drop from the local listing leaving only their characters post with their name links and spoken words behind in the left hand text boxso yes you would be able to track wether or not the smacker is still in your system unless he jumps out and then back into it same if he loggs out and the same rules would apply for youthe reason i didnt propose the delayed local idea is because i see a fundamental flaw if a player is warping to zero one way running from a member of my fleet and i am trying to cut him off coming the other way the chance of him passing right by me are to high i think that kind of system would make it almost impossible to chase people down and would just lead to more station camping in the end i can almost hear frank sinatra singing strangers in the night in the backgroundthe reason for not spliting it into a chat local and an intel local are obvious if your talking about getting rid of local as a reconissance tool then yes it would need to be switched out with constellation chat that is an entierely different subject i am here to propose an alternative to removing local ps thank you for supporting
fleet warps are great for people and fcs to use but there are certain situations where they are a major nuisancecover ops should not be forced to cancel fleet warps considering most times they happen unannounced fleet warps cost cover ops time to get back on grid and are very hard to avoid due to the very fast warp time cover ops have fleet warps of ships that need to idle for all of 20 seconds in a tower should have the option to void fleet warps so they do not have to drop fleet for such a ridiculous reason as 20 seconds of afkspy fleet warping has its benefits and i am not against using it against enemies if you are lucky enough to get into fleet but players will be stupid and forget to deactivate warps so we wont lose this effect totally anyways so while it will remove this feature somewhat it will still happen leading to comedy kill mails
why not

i lost count of the times i used to wish for this when forming fleets signedquick edit  one side effect i will note though is that from my experience you ended up with a good command structure not good discipline but thats another matter i certainly used to invite only the same few people and they would move themselves into the relevent squad commands and start handling the logistics of getting people in ships  fleet whilst i sent out scouts and prepared for the off not a good enough bonus to warrent not having the link though
make the in game calculator a little bit bigger to me it looks a bit smallshadowburnmy 2 cents
yup nice feature if it was a little bigger support
my issue is really not with the pvp itself but the exploit that allows non corp members to assist in highsec without flagging them hostile
members of a nonnpc corp are free to fire upon one another in high security space without concord interferencefurthermore not supported
agreed however thats not what your proposal is asking for revise your proposal in a new post and id gladly support itto those reading what hes suggesting is that if a neutral remote repper reps person a when person a is fighting person b person a and b are in the same corp then the repper goes flashy to person b basically the same aggro mechanics that rr is applied to for outofcorp aggression and a completely reasonable proposal
you can stay away from a certain ship at x km that you choose but that someone else can come closer how about stay away from every ship on your overview just right click on the icon and select that global stay away option thats it done
hell noi get decloaked too but its because im not concentrating or flying well do both and it ceases to be an issue no its not always easy to achieve but if i can do it sometimes then so can youstructurally this wouldnt work either there are a large possibly infinite but its too late for my maths brain to work atm number of sets of ship positions around you wherein a movement of 1 ship pushes you to break the approach rule how do you then decide which of the n individual approaches should be violated its just a flawed idea from start to finish

if one of the items in you are trying to include in a contract is damaged the current mechanism does not flag this up til the very end of the contract processthis is extremly frustrating and timewasting when you have a large amount of items to contract to multiple partiesi suggest any items that are damaged and can not be included in the contract be named and flagged up at the first step of the contract process rather than at the final steprm
absolutely and 100 supportednothing more annoying than setting up a contract and then at the very last step getting told you cannot do it
yes and or included a red star that says 98 damaged next to a modshipdroneammo if we include them in a contractnothing more annoying than trying to contract a chunk of stuff and trying to sort through a single damaged drone or a crystal that has been shot 5 times or trying to contract a past ship that has 2 armor damage in a station you cant dock in anymore
nice proposal but imho you should have bumped one of the many old threads about the same topic also this is part of the big contract features that suck thread of mazzilliumaybe bump there instead of here
i am aware of the various threads concerning the many problems with contracts but this is the one thing that bugs me the most and so far the first thing that i have felt compeled to highlight in this forumso forgive me if i dont necro older threads and bring my particular concerns to the csm in a new threadrm
hey guysim not that good at making large detailed propsals but i will try my best to get everything you would want to know inafter spending quite a lot of time in 00 fighting in big alliance wars gate camping getting ganked ect i felt that there was one major thing that could be make local better a way of being a bit more stealthy when it comes to travelling around the place in a fleet ect so i propose this a new module created specificly for covert opssbsblack ops this module would be a highly specialised and expensive bit of equippment to try and stop everyone running around low sec and 00 with these on therefore their main use would be for a scout in a fleet or possibly pirates ect i think its important to note that this module shouldnt be something that everyone will have it needs to be at a level where most people wouldnt just randomly buy and use it due to its price but where its not so expensive that you would need to be in a big alliance or corp to use it for instance a small shared investment from a small group of mercs could make piracy in low sec more worthwhile for some but could still be avoided by simple things like having someone scout for youthaks alotzionner
so youre pretty much wanting to add an extra hislot  fitting to every covops ship out there as well as making people fit not one but 2 modules to be truely stealthy no i think notexpensive isnt a factor btw isk is easy to make after all there are 200 titans in game the only way to restrict is by saying eg covops only or else itll become as ubiquitous as cloaks on ratting ships in fact what youve made there is an almost 100 safe way to rat in quiet 00 systemsno

you could scan down npcs with the onboard scanner in the past and ccp removed that i doubt they will add it back
i dont know if it works with npc but using the ship scanner will be your solution and with that info you gain more than your puny 25 or so you will know whats his weakness since you know what he fits if your prepared enough after you got this info and you do it right he will diemy gawd alt scouts are so amazing in this case
theres actually sort of a key if you go to overviewsettings there you can change which symbolscolors you want with what statuses so its not impossible to use when you first learn it but learning eve shouldnt be about learning symbols in a less intuitive user interface it should be about learning to fit and fly spaceships the eve ui while its been much better over the years still needs a lot more worksupported
i have been using this character as a dumping ground for shares for a long time i have told many other players to send dead shares here too if they wishthis is an untrained alt that is just holding a corp for me so someday i am sure i will biomass him and when i do all the shares will disappearuntil ccp does something which i dont see happening any time soon feel free to treat this character as your dead share trash can
nice to hear about that  i will check it
was originally planned as a democratic advisory council that ccp could use as a sounding board to make eve better if i recallnowadays it resembles real life political institutions too much in that it is filled with people whose primary concern is their own interests rather than the game as a wholebut if the csm is meant to represent the player base as argued then the number of nullsec representatives needs a significant decreasethe 00 population is a minority whether you like it or not and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable futureone good thing that has come out of it is the assembly hall where the entire playerbase is essentially acting as the afore mentioned sounding board beyond that i see no reason for the csm to exist as it is still the loudest most persistent parties that get their way
its becoming inacceptable
ok i realise i missed making this objection before the meeting rl and allbut why oh why was this even an issue that made it to a formal council meetingit was proposed by a member of csm which seems a little bit like a conflict of intrest and self servingthe discussion thread only garnered 3 thumbs up which does not really seem to indicate much support from the player base if you actually go through and read the comments most of them seem opposed to mazzillius proposal either in part or in wholefor myself the only thing i can really get behind is issler is getting treated with this very short partial term she just inherited counting against her 2 term limit even though i dont really care for her views in most of the work she did with csm in her last regular term i have to say that getting promoted to a full council member from an alternate status this late in the term especially after the ccp visit and having it count as a full term of service is just unfair to her and those who had hoped to elect her to a full council position in the futureps i wish ccpisd would hurry up and approve the minutes of this meeting so my rabble rabble could either be justified or nullified by what you guys actually discussed
this might be really easy to implement adjustable text font sizes for the overview getting a bit hard to read at 1920x1200 
wow here is an issueterm limits that got more votes in the csm than in the thread that started it this a bad decision no one in favor of it has explained how putting ccp in the position of deciding who does and who does not get to be on csm does not open them to a charge of favoritism and more importantly why csm would think that is a good thingbeing a csm rep is something that the players get to decide by design ccp stepped back quite deliberately from interfering in that choice the present csm feels it is ok for ccp to be involved in choosing our reps let us hope ccp is wise enough again to decline
yep its embarrasinguse firefox with the dev tool addon and resize text
repairing hull damage without a station on fighters is easier said than done first the scenario from which this idea came is if your in enemy or distant space pos outpost a properly fitted carrier probably will want to save that high slot for an extra dcu smartbomb heavy neutralizer etc its better to repair the main tank of the ship armorshield than to aim for the hull this is why you will most likely only see capital remote repair systems on carriers repairing a posstation repair services do serve their purpose to provide immediate repairs in a safe environment space cant guarantee you this especially since carriers can only fly in lowseci personally dont think it should involve a cost unless the triage idea in here is implemented which automatically has its cost however this is up to ccp as always to balance it outi wouldnt even take them out if they had massive hull damage they are remarkably fragile for 15 million isk drones however since they provide huge amounts of damage vs battleships battlecruisers and to some extend cruisers this can be justifiedi do doubt if such a skill should come into existence on one hand it would be nice to have a boost but on the other hand it adds even more time to the required skills for carrier list for the new pilots

who said directional scanners are only used to find pveers
indeed who did stop setting up a strawman  i said the 2second change almost exclusively affects pvpers targetting belt ratters and miners and to  and moan about that 2second change is ridiculous considering they dont have a chance to survive an encounter against a pvp fit so basically let the change take its course it might actually benefit you in the long run this will require time which i know can be difficult if you have a short attention span you and everyone else should be able to easily adaptyou know that phrase youre always telling carebears adapt or die try it some time or you could just see my sig emoragequit already

i recently was trying to leave wh space and came across a cl3 sytem that had over 14 towers in it only one of which was active if ccp does nothing about this soon cl3 and below wh space will run out of moons to anchor a pos at not sure what could be done there are many idieas out there and i support the hacking idea something needs to be done soon thoughas to shooting a pos in wh spaceyeah try that one solo or with just a few bssto those of you who say just shoot it down and profitthis isnt all about abandoned poss at moons in 00 its about highsec and wh poss also the abandodned tower spam in highsec is rediculous but much easier to take care of as you simply group your corp together dec the owning corp and remove the tower for wh this presents a problem because you begin using the mass limits of the wh to bring in ships to remove the pos and then you cant get all you need through the wh to set yourself up again something should be done

facepalmi started out with 5060k sp had never heard of evemon or eve un iversity there was no such thing as salvage there was no lp store and you had to get basic learning skills to level 5 before you could train the advanced 3 implants were something like 1820 mill each in mission hubs double training rate and stat respecs werent even an idea i had no idea at all what i was doing when i made my character pretty much the only things i got right were having a decent perc stat and choosing a character name with a letter from the middle of the alphabetby the time i had been playing for 6 months i had already been through a major war in 00 made friend in eve with people i still count as friends today created my own corp and led it into first the drone regions then to cursestop making excuses undock and get started you succeed in eve by playing it not by having n millions of sp
mate i have some bad news for youyou know those sp requirements those corps have they dont really care all that much about the sp what they actually care about is combat experience the sp requirement is just a first pass filter if you want players with 1 years pvp experience then filtering out people with less than 1 years sp is logicaland i will bet you everything i own that virtually all of those compelling corps have members with considerably less than the minimum number of sp the reason that those corps are compelling is because they composed of people who got out there and started playing as hard as they could from day 1 if you want to join them dont cry for more meaningless free sp do that get out there and get started 3 months pvp experience beats the hell out of an extra 5m spbonus you get the sp anyway
this and then you actually learn about everything in the game that fitting long and short range on your ship is not a good idea that all of low sec isnt in complete anarchy mission are utterly boring and that infact 10 million isk is not at all alot battleships are not solopwnmobiles and are very large slow moving targets like fat deer in a field of lions when in low securitysmartbombs are not high sec friendly

as anyone who hauls a lot of stuff for other people probably knows organizing other peoples stuff using anything but courier contracts can quickly become an exercise in tearing your hair out containers cant be sized dynamically ships cargo bays have no builtin organization system and freighters cant even use anything besides the jumbo large general freight container if you are moving stuff without couriers often the only way to know who owns what is to open note pad and write everything down which gets annoyingwhat i propose is to introduce a new service that would be available in all stations npc stations could charge a small fee player owned stations could be more configurable that would allow you to select any selection of hanger goodies and ships right click them and wrap them up in shrink wrap you could then apply any label you wanted to the wrap so you could use it as an organization tool in both haulers and hangers
i approve this product or service
yes
right click  package items would be awesome
agreed
ibuse cargo cansi have to say it would be kinda nice to shrinkwarp prepackaged stuffparticularly when things get messyhell you could charge on a per m3 rate new isk sink hole
good idea 
ive been waiting for some changes to make not only artillery a viable option but also the tempest i love how the tempest looks but it is just too gimp to fly supported over and over
you gotta be kidding right 50 more dps at level 5 where everyother battleship only get 25 bonus at level 5if its alpha you like you could go with10 more damage per level  5 rof per level  this is equal to 10 more alpha  but only 5 more dps  per levelso as you train up you get 5 more dps  10 more alpha per level and your clip last 5 longer per level too
that would be even less then 25 damage bonusnamely a 17 damage bonus also if you might be familar with the tempest this change is a slight dps lose not gainit got 5 damage and 5 rof per level atm if you are not familar with it there is a 40 pages thread in sm to get a better picturehere you go
projectiles are prenerfed by 25 rof 333 dps so that with level 5 of your respective minnie ship skill youll be on par with the damage output of another races ship that has no damage bonus this is similar to the cap usage bonus on amarr shipsso no that would just make it terrible please note that a 125 damage per level bonus would still do less damage than a 5 damage and 5 rof
artillery definitely needs much more voly damage in order to be meaningful also requires an optimal range increase for any other improvements to actually workas for acs everything needs to be improved they are totally useless optimal range damage and tracking need love so im generally called in for an overhaulbeyond all things it is the large scale of ammunition that does not well scale large needs to be improved so much more than medium and small
never thought of the fact that goonswarm would get every single member of them to vote on their preferred candidateif this is the case i think it may be time to disband the csm because it clearly isnt working out as democratic as everyone thinksedit disband and never get a new one that is
full reset of all standings for hefty fee and long cooldown period i like this provides replay prospects for characters and casual playersprehaps put these agents in low and nullsec to make it even harder on those who want to use it and include a security status hit in the cost  concord will not be amused with you bribing people wholescale like this and concord standings will not be affected  i think theyre already tied to sec status
or charge 50m for each 5 per alliancefaction corrected up to a maximum of 200 so people cant simply buy their way up to 999anything that broadens anyones ability to play should be in ccps best interests and i support it
how does that repair ruined standingssomething should be done but no simple buyback no matter how much money for some it will be too much for others itll be no problem at allinstead id add bribable agents who will allow you to run a mission for them overlooking your bad standing and refer you to storyline agents wholl help you improve your standingperhaps make the quality of the mission dependant on how much you pay him not much  garbage hauling plenty  eliminate concord
i like this idea could just be something as simple as some documents that you need to bring to an agent for the faction you want to increase your standings with like the high sec data centers set a cap at 199 or something that way you will be able to run missions for that faction and start repairing it through missionsas you would need to bring them to 00 there is a bit of risk vs reward in it too
yeah anything is better than nothing
each faction should have a corrupt agent available in nullsec or lowsec the agent would agree to allow people with negative standing to run missions and build up reputation but in return would claim all of a players bounties rewards and lp in return for the service
im more inclined to add an additional mechanic that restricts such a use for 1 year much like neural remappingwith the 1 billion isk fee included of courseand faction warfare should be excluded as its a bit foolish to assume you can bribe your way back into opposed fw empireyou should leave the militia first then resetnaturally if you want to go back in kiss your standings goodbye like wiseim a bit hesitant so a cautious support heredarius  your alt mission running this only works for agents ive been doing it for a rather long time and if theres any standings boost its null or very small not enough and too painful to even try italso to the op about soe solution only valid for 2 of the empire factionscheck the faction standings and you will see the only ones that get standings are the ones that like the factionexample  soe wont raise amarr standings but ammatar mandate will
drake well the smart part of the alt is  i can keep my empire faction mission running standing and my alt takes all the standing for the pirate faction best of both worlds imho better than trying to get standing over and over again if you move to a different region
i suppose so 
blaster ships have always been the red headed step children of pvp everyone loves the concept but hates the designflaws of blasters compared to other race weaponrymegapulsecurrently the mega pulse has approximately 35x the range of blasters for this it has 22 less tracking and about 14 lower damage however its fall off range is near equal to the neutron blaster for tracking base stats  all level 5 skills on a neutral ship give the blaster an extra 12ms tracking per 1km range however outside of 4km range with close range weaponry it starts shooting in falloff for the next 11km with close range weaponry while the blaster is shooting in declining falloff the mega pulse is shooting in optimal so at an optimal of 15km the megapulse is tracking an additional 132ms of speed in its optimal range the blaster only gained up to 48ms tracking in its optimal ranged over the megapulsethe mega pulse also has a falloff of damage the mega pulse will do 14 less damage in the first 4 km of range however with optimal plus falloff putting a blaster at 11km the net yeild on damage has turned to the mega pulse by about a 35 advantage at about 6km the damage is equal even worse is outside of 27km range the blaster hits at virtually 0dps the mega pulse reaches similar damage to a blaster out to 55km without any enhancers the auto cannonfirst and foremost is the difference in style of the ships that use auto cannons while gal and amarr ships tend to be similar in style the minmatar gain considerable speed and agilitytheir damage is being looked at so ill hold comment on that problem for now however autos do get multiple damage typescapacitor is a big advantage for autocannon ships blasters are heavy consumption items for capacitor autocannons use 0 cap tracking for auto cannons is virtually equal to blasters however with the expected changes coming with the ammo autos should soon be gaining some sort of tracking advantage to blasters at least in varying ranges range for autos is also noticeably different similar optimal at close range to the blasters with 3km compared to 45km a virtual stalemate for close range weapons autos gain 7km of falloff with max skills on a neutral ship with ranged ammo the difference becomes more pronounced at 36km max potential range versus 27km for the blasters obviously there is a glaring deficiency with blasters i think there are 2 solutions to this problem1st i would boost blaster damage by 50 this would truly separate them as the highest dps platform in game in order for this to work their energy consumption needs to go up by 12 per second per gun after max skills creating a lot of damage that is not sustainable for long duration2nd i would boost blaster optimal range by 17 to 25km base this would boost their max potential range to near 33km still lower than autos and much lower than mega pulse but it would make up for this breed of ships that are much slower and bulkier than their minmatar companions there is a possibility that the lower tiers of ions and electrons could receive smaller changes to their energy consumption and optimal but all blaster damages need to go up near 50 for large gun tiers for the trade off of capacitor instability smaller guns would need to be looked at separately
for a numbers analysisthe neutron blaster mega with 3 damage mods t2 guns drones and max skills would go from 1265 dps to 1710 dps an armageddon will hit with same principles for 1184 dps at nearly 3x the rangethe megas max optimal range would go from 11km to about 14km using null ammo or about 18km with ironit would consume 35 energy per second compared to the current 27 energy per second with no other mods on that would cap it out in approximately 57 minutes in head calculation ill adjust soon compared to the current 10 minutes that may not sound significant but after about 20 seconds that translates into the loss of 1 800 booster injected for capacitor its optimal range with null would still be 13 the optimal range of a mega pulse with scorch damage would be about 1110dps with null compared to a geddon with scorch hitting for 681 with 3 damage mods neither uses drones in the calculation since they would add equal damagethe geddon would use 26 energy per second with that rof bonus at 5 with guns only and scorch the mega would us about 3031 energy per second with nullplease note that the null ammo for a mega hits at 1km less optimal for about 250 more dps with oger 2s that means that while it will do more damage if reliant on drones the geddon can burn out of optimal to reduce damage and have the ability to hit further away with other ammoone consideration if this is an apparent problem is to reduce null ammo damage to bring back some balance both ships have similar speeds so to me it makes sense that if a mega is in appropriate range it should always have a considerably advantage range means more than dps in most situations anywaysminmatar and caldari always have the options of playing capacitor warfare games with their extra high slots which would affect a blaster boats considerably more if the energy consumption went up caldari also have more range and minmatar have more speed

dont see any problems with thatsigned
yes please fleet should not be a tool to combat blobbing if people want to form a 500 man fleet they should be able to and not be hindered by an outdated max limit
no the game should be trending away from huge megablobsliang

this is an mmo  note massively multiplayer an arbitrary cap on fleet limit should not stop 300 people from participating with eachother in a reasonable manner no this does not mean that micromanaging 300 people will be easier just a little more convenient from an interfacing point of view is this something we need to wait 34 years on also for ccp to address like posfueling being a 2nd job dominion is supposed to also be about doing away with the mundane oddities and menial chores of eve and replacing them with more fluid features

dominion is shaping up to be the big 00 expansion with addition of autopayment of bills and a meaningful alliance management interfacewith taxes being introduced in npc corps i feel it is appropriate that player corporations were given options other than a shared hangar and chat channelbelow are some of the ideas i have on the subject had since reading the news about the npc taxation plan ability to move limited volume of goods between offices perhaps a special container that only accepts stackable goods ex no usedresearched blueprints time limited like jump clones scheduling interface to plan operations integrate ship fitting with markets to assist when buying modules proper corporate standings towards factions and not just an average of employee standings perhaps by allowing mission runners to forfeit standing gains or a standings tax the obligatory rp element revamp of roles needs to be more transparent and easier to configure shared bookmarks a special folder in hq office where bookmarks can be entered and subsequently used by anyone with the proper role shared custom starmap routes warpto using the corporate assets list for those with proper roles dont think it is possible currentlyprobably many more good things that could benefit corporate life but those were the ones that stood out in my mindedits crossed out interoffice movement of goods as it will be too easy sad i hate ammo runs
1 thing you did not mention is this for npc corp or player corp  the latter would be logical since ccp wants people out fo there in other wordsin any case some of these are already a feature about to come out the the scheduling interface to plan operations the first one is already doable if i understand right you can move good between offices from corp hangar to corp hangar for the standings yeah i can understand your point but does ccp wants to see more towers in high sec cause thats what i believe is the goal your refering too you are absolutely right about the roles its never easy to configure the roles but the interface really needs a clean up and lots of clarity and even more features imo especially about the hangars and such for example i would like people to have access to 1 pos or a certain pos right now it is impossible to do sothe rest is not bad too especially for a null sec corp when you want your guys to take a certain route so yeah i support it since it makes sense
changed title to reflect that it is meant for player corpsas far as i know the idea of interbus was shelved so moving things without an actual ship is not possible or i have been missing out these past years  would have to be a low volume to avoid the obvious loopholesi couldnt care less about highsec towers they are more than easy enough to deploy as is my goal is to give more tools for the roleplay inclined a corporation should have the option to align itself with one side or another not many rpers remain but it is or was a large part of evei tried making the initial ideas beneficial to corps regardless of where they live but with the feudal system coming allowing proper rental agreement in 00 space i envision more individual corporations living in 00 so slightly tilted in that directioni just want the joining a corporation to have meaning beyond functioning as a sort of static friends list with a shared hangar
the only thing i dont like is the moving goods thing sorry nop you want to move valuables you take risksapart from that it all seems like good stuff

misleading because your analysis of the raw data does not in fact your weighting is poor and invalid in certain scenarios and you have presented no analysis of how common these scenarios arewhich means that your conclusions may or may not be bogus and definitely means that theyre not admissible as proof no matter how much you relax the standards of what proof iseven if we pretend your method of choosing the data sample is valid oh yes it is true despite your attempts at misleading us to believe that raw data isnt mine formulas apply to all means something by itselfconsider that applying the formula to all ships equally and without prejudiceif hasjammertrue  efficiency10  else efficiency00different results you bet therefore using raw data which isnt yours and applying a formula to all ships equally and without prejudice does not yield a credible analysis by itselfthat is pretending you have used valid criteria for data selection of course
pyramid quoting is bad mkay  if some of the drivel you were talking got lost  toughtheres no need to analyise the data to find out the proportion of different scerarios sologangfleet whateveryou would only do that if you wanted to know the seperate abilities of each ship in each type of combatwe are not concered with that in this post  this post is looking at the overall abilities of each shipeach ships results in the total will be a combination of results from sologangfleet encounters in the proportion that those events actual took placewith 95 years worth of data there is more than 15 times more pvp action takin into account than even a beta tester could have accumulated on hisher own since the game startedso the data is an order of magnitude more representative of all types of pvp than a single players total in game experiances can beyour formula is lol of courseecm boats will by there nature when in the hands of experianced pvpr end up with more results in the kill with column than standard damage boats they will be on the kills of the primary with there weapons and kills they never did any damage too with the ecms as long as there still alive that is and proving value when those boats go downecm boats actually have an advantage at scoring higher as it is without setting them all automagically to 100 for some strange unexpected reason you have in your headfurther more from raw data consisting of kills and loses how would you propose on extracting the information of which ships had ecm fitted anyways i honestly cant work out why a 100 minmatar player such as yourself would object to a list revealing the extent of minmatar ships superiority in pvp asnywaysi also cant work out why in the last year you have never flown a blackbird as you consider them to be such uber ships 
assuming your data selection method is valid the data being valid does not mean the analysis is valid weve been over this95 years of pvp is just a buzzword big data set  correct analysisthe example formula listed was to prove that your argument that i have a big valid if we want to stretch the point data set and i applied a formula to all ships equally and without bias combined do not mean that my conclusions are valid successfully at that as even you agree my example is obviously worthless and the presence of a worthless example means that a valid data set plus applying a formula equally and without bias do not mean that the conclusions drawn from that are correct which incidentally shoots down your assertion that your conclusions are somehow magically valid because your data set is valid doubtful and you used a formula equally for all shipsyour formula is fairly worthless as a metric of utility in a gang in fact the existence of a counterexample where your formula scores two ships in the opposite way to real utility which has been demonstrated already is enough to dismiss it as evidence which is why your research is worthless as evidence of anything without evidence youre voicing your personal opinion which has been notedsomehow i think weve been over this but we can go in circles a few more times if youd likenice to know you feel your argument has been destroyed to that point that all you have left is a ad hominem
well we were talking about the data here and the analysis below iirc95 years of pvp is not a buzzword95  players   1  years worth of kill and losses in pvp   95 years of pvp data  fields kills with a ship  losses of ship extracted data  effectivness  numbers of ships killed with ship type  number of ships of type lost  expressed as a percentage popularity of ship within its group  numbers of engagements recorded for a ship  kills with  losses     number of engagements recorded for ships class  also expressed as a percentage your formula was lol because its inputs were not available in the datasetyou proved nothing except your total lack of understanding of this analysis  mathmatics in generalyou also put your opinion of ecm is uber in the formulasomething which i have not done in the analysis for any concept in the gamejust as well then that the analysis isnt looking at utility in gang rather the overall utility of the ship in gameyes you bring your opinion of the bb  which you dont fly  to disprove the analysis but its your opinion of the bb which is incorrect not the anaylisbeing the noob meat shield ship of choice does not entitle a ship to be classed as uberwell if your gonna resort to ad homs i thought i might as well do the samei have debunked the ad homs thrown at me i see you cant debunk the ad homs throw at youyour are deluding yourself if you think i think youve destroyed anything
anyone that thinks amarr need buffing doesnt play this game
it is absolutely a buzzword and nothing else in a attempt to give yourself more credibilitywhat is unknown is the following effects of nonrandom data selection on the results  the percentage of killmails collected in relation of the overall numberwhen we want to say something about the scope of our research we generally use terms like x samples out of y and such when we choose data according to nonrandom criteria we typically have some analysis of the impact of this95 years of pvp data from the best eve pvpers is nothing but pure marketing the measure has been proven to be not fully reliable for determining contribution in gang settings previously in the thread without it being fully reliable and with gang on gang fights being included and without a detailed analysis of how often it is wrong we can only guess how reliable it is meaning anything based on that measure cannot by any stretch of imagination be called evidenceweve been over this please prove that popularity within its group is balance related or that there is any merit in lumping it together with efficiency without that youve just added another arbitrary measure to a analysis of a nonrandom data sample using a provably not correct measurement method it is interesting how this is constructed as evidence think in logical termsyou have a  raw data b  efficiency as calculated by you c  real efficiency and d  conclusionb follows from a d follows from c but c does not follow from b since a counterexample existstherefore talking about c and d here is speculation speculation is not evidence
im not going to bother quoting anything since i dont feel like wasting my time looking for itits become obvious to me over the last 5 pages of data that the op refuses to listen to any argument counter to his own even going so far as to claim that its the minmatar and gallente pilots that dont want the information released as if there were some vast conspiracy to conceal it at this point we start thinkiong of you in terms of being a troll and not a serous critical thinker the occasional personal attack youve tossed out doesnt help your credibility on that scoreyour statisitcal method is flawed especially the inclusion of the popularity metric this particular measure is based on a flawed assuption conscious or not that a pilot will always choose the most appropriate ship for any given task  an assumption that i offered you a counterexample for in one of my own postsyour assertion that minmatar pilots dont want their supposed dominance challenged is laughable since not even the amarrian and caladari pilots who have posted in this thread agree with your statistical ranking the point is when your statistics dont match real life somethings wrong with the statistic not with real lifehoneslty i think i understand what you set out to do you perceived what you thought to be an issue with the balance of the ships in the game and attempted to establish a metric set that would demonstrate the problem ill give you the benefit of the doubt on whether those metrics were intentionally biased to support your position and say you just picked a crappy ay to generate your analysis that doesnt mean the original problem may not exist however just that your method pf proving it is obviously not convincing anyoneyour argument is akin to the followinganalyst the earth is squareastronaut wait whatanalyst my math shows the earth is squareastronaut this picture shows its roundanalyst whatever its still square cause the math says soastronaut um maybe the maths wronganalyst you astronauts are just trying to hide the truthastronaut

b follows from a   c follows from b   d follows from c in the context of this study as with all statistics c tends towards b as size of sample growswhat you call a counterexample is no such thingyou have an opinion of what c should beyou have based your opinion of the size of c based on the utility of a ship in a certain scenario or range of scenariosyou have not taken into account its utter fail in all the non favourable scenariosthat is why you cant reconcile what the data shows you with what your opinion of a ship isyou should tear yourself away from the bbs group for one moment and actually look at all the other groupsout of 34 groups  supercaps removed due to small sample size  2 irrelevants as none combats type vessels  28 are absolutelly spot on beyond any resonable persons arguements at indicateing the best ship in that group5 are harder to reconcile but by no means controvertialleaving just the bbs group cruiser2 as a point of contentionso instead of concluding there is one ship which looks out of place  everything garbage  a more sensible person would be thinking hmm this study looks really acurate i wonder why the bb is not where i expect it too be 
looolgenius is never appreciated in its own timetongueincheek
c does not follow from b regardless of sample size to prove that there is a statistical connection since logical is out of the question when a counterexample exists you would have to provide a study on how often do the scenarios where c diverges from b occur you have not so you failyour opinion that c does not diverge from b is completely irrelevant from a viewpoint of truth as you cannot substantiate that claim but we can plainly see that it is possible that c does in fact diverge from b and that is enough to invalidate your methodologyas you well know if were only assuming that c generally follows from b were talking about opinions without a detailed analysis of the actual connection between b and c and researching the effects of your nonrandom data selection and giving some proof that popularity is a valid measure of anything regarding real utility this is just your opinion regardless of the size of your nonrandom sample or any marketing buzzwords you like using to substantiate your claimsyour opinion has already been noted weve been over this for probably 5 times nowalso you cannot decide to ignore examples which undermine your methodology and keep the remaining results as is if the methodology is not valid then the remaining results might or might not be garbage but any assumption that that remaining data is valid is just that  a assumption
there is a fine line between insanity and geniusand you sir have seriously crossed that line

sometimes is neccessary to stick to your gunsthere arnt many threads on the forums where people request a thread be closed or become abusive and demand that a thread is closedmaybe im reading to much into it but i think those who have demanded the closure of the thread are doing so because they in some way feel threatenedif it was just plain wrong  people would just ignore it and move onpersonal attacks  by me  have only been used in response to pesonal attacks or incinuations i hopenot the best plan probably but hey fight fire with fireapologies to anyone who i have offended when they wernt trying to be abusive  incinuativethe reasoning  flawed or otherwise  that pop is a good metric for measuring the ability of a ship is based of course on the assumption that pvprs prefer ships that are good at pvp and on the assumption that pvprs know what the hell they are doing thats the reason why i choose this group of players  they are some of the best pvprs in eve and they do know what they are doing it is of course true what you say that they may not allways choose the best ship but any random ship selection would introduce noise into the data it should not introduce biasnoise will tend to mask the true extent of a ships popularity over its class equivs so the real value of a ships pvpabiilty will be greater than that decribed by pop in the datayes i have only myself to blame for that really i never should have introduced the data in a single list with the groups all mixed in with one anotherlook at the data grouped by class first of all  and you will see that actually most of the rankings do make a lot of sensebig post to be continued
kinda the truth allthough i would say experienced the imbalance rather than percieved itif your really interested in sequence of events id have to recall them being something like thisbuy eve  choose caldari character3 years of pve utterley pimping out caldari skillsget bored of pve and join pvp corpstart pvping with a more or less maxed missile caldari skillsget killed at lot at first but improveafter about another year after dread and carrier training start to look where to go next with skillslook at corp kms and see that gun users are doing plenty more damage on kms than i amdecide to cross train to mini  gal and amarr and gun skillsi found myself doing better with mini ships with t1 guns and base skills at level 3 than i was doing with caldari ships with t2 launchers and maxed base skills and advanced skills at lvl4 this is when i realised something is not right with caldarias ive trained mini and projectiles further i find myself really surprised at the disparity in ability between the 2 racesi couldnt figure out why this should be at first then it clickedmissiles suck so much on caldari missile boats because of the really poor damage bonus they get compared to the gun boats  im sure youve seen the thread so i start up a replace kin bonus thread and the caldari hate posts startpeople make all kinds of unsubstantiated claims in that thread and try to make missiles sound like some kind of panacia because they can switch damage type and other weapon systems cant one of the arguments againt the proposed change was by a guy called gypsioiii who asked for a full and total comparision of ships and weapons systems etc etc etcthat of course was far too complicated a task for any one player to performwell i come back to him with the data in this threadi didnt know what it would show when i started the cut and past harvest of informationi just wanted to sample the opinion of the better players in eve as too what the best ships to fly in pvp arei was surprised to the extent of the bias towards minigal and away from calamarr in the data hence this threadi see the argument more like the followingcopernicus zmog the earth goes round the sunlayperson waitwhatcopernicus my calculations show that the earth goes round the sunlayperson dont be stupid  the earth beneath my feet isnt movingcopernicus yes i know you move round the sun at the same speed as the earthlayperson dont be stupid  your stupid and your analysis is stupid  the wind would blow us awaycopernicus the air is in a layer around the earth and moves with itlayperson zmog you fckign heritic son of a  that not what ive been brought up to understand  burn in the eternal fires of hell for daring to suggest something contrary to what ive been led to belive by my own eyes you crazy stupid son of a  your just trying to trick us with your new fangled mathematicsad infinitum

yeah something is totally wrong with my caldari ships i can nicely stay at range while my amarrminmatar and gallente friends are tackling in close while i just spam missiles from range totally unfair for me to be safer than themand i can jam from far away enough while my rapier curse and arazu friends get hammered close range also totally unfair and unbalancednow i ask you  maybe your style of flying doesnt fit caldariwell except for hamdrake blasterox torpwtfbbq raven blasterokhah well you continue living in your dream world i will stick to reality
top damage on kms in gangs isnt everything but lets look at the matter in more detailif you want to top kms in gang settings then the following are importanta range if you need to mwd to optimal your dps is jack i see gallente underperforming in many gang on gang fights which do not start at zero i see the artycane owning the higher dps ac fit every time in gang on gang fights when it comes to topping kms and real utility too because short range ships get worse as gang sizes go up the tracking disability means little in gangs i see amarr bcs and particularly bs being monstersb gank oriented ships this is where caldari generally dont have it bar the raven which does not want to be in rr bs gangs not a missile problem the typhoon does preety damn well with torps  most of the standard ganktank ships are more tank oriented where they do indeed win on ehpdps calculation which is however more relevant solo youd still need to fit them like a total twerp to get outdamaged by a t1 fit hurricane with bc iiic instant damage means the less drone focus bar sentries for the 125m3 ships and the more gun focus instant damage gets to top the kms generally while dronesmissiles score worse due to travel time  you have a certain amount of lag before dps hits which is not very relevant solosmall gang but is very relevant when theres ten ships shooting at oneobviously caldari fail at two of these and so do gallente generally speaking which is why i in practice rarely see these two topping kms except in reasonably rare settingsto be continued
on the other hand caldari do have some strong points a good line of sniper ships or specialized range ships they get underused because sniper gangs take more coordination to pull off then random rabble however a good line of well tanked ships this makes a number of caldari ships painful to face solo the drake comes to mind with its preety awesome mix of dps and ehp with solid range on top while tanking isnt a role in a gang if the high dps ships get primaried first a mathematically provable fact but only assuming high dps ships get primaried first the dpsehp balance is relevant in solosmall meaning 5 people gang settings best ew ships  best ew its really no discussion if im out soloing in a bc and i see a gang with a blackbird and two random cruisers i will basically avoid it unless i suspect theyre stupid for some reason if i see the same gang with a bellicose i warp in and laugh a little inside falcon is mean but not op even after the nerf rook is downright awesome scorpion is a nasty ship as well despite the fact that 95 of the people i killed were using it wrong the remaining 5 i didnt kill heh torps which are awesome unfortunately raven is a shield tank and shield rr gangs well theyre slightly problematicamarr i wont discuss because once you get to bc sniper hac and bs gangs they are the correct tm choice seriouslytheres a few reasons why gallente are reasonably popular when it comes to the old experienced pvper who likes solosmall ganga they do well for solo  very small gangs given the slot layouts and the fact that a lot of damage being noninstant due to range drone travel times and such is not a big concern in the scenariosb slaveset can compensate for a lot of their disabilities given ehp and you will find veterans using pirate implants and hardwirings a lot provided this is lowsec were talking about shield buffer tanks have no such option to boost pure ehp the snakeset is the correct choice for shield buffer ships but ive only seen one drake use it  one from the russian all different corp names gang they do know how to fit ships correctlyc in the old days if you wanted to solo gallente was optimal this leads to a lot of people who are used to flying them know their ins and outs and like the ships even if id argue that a lot of their ships actually is not nearly as good as the forum lore says not everyone flies optimal ships however else 90 of eve would be flying a curse with hg snakesd theyre gank oriented largely gank ships have one advantage over tank ships for 1v1 combat assuming equal dpsehp balance they might kill the target sooner leading to less time to bring in reinforcements if you solo a lot this is a prized traitlargely the same for minmatar except they trade raw dps for more range and they tend to trade a bit of ehp for a bit of speedagility over gallente producing a altogether more favourable mix for solo then gallente imo although its something we could debate on i personally switched to minmatar after rolling a gallente character because the rifter is awesome and looks 11ty billions better then a tristan so are caldari underpowered no not really what they could use is adjustments to small ships and in some part t1 cruisers a fix to rockets and to a extent lights to go with the small ship adjustment and reducing the fittings of shield transfersa overall boost of any sort would leave a lot of the ships flat out overpowered if caldari became the top damage dealer race talking about subbs ships here since the raven certainly despite its disability to participate in rrbs gangs doesnt have this problem then tank would have to go seriously down and range could use looking at else youd get absurdly monstrous ships
i dont give a damn crap what ccp has to say about this subject doesnt make sense no matter how you look at it please try to convince me cause i dont see the point of thisthe solution presented doesnt make sense have ccp create a formation function to dictate the range when you warp and whats the distance between all your ships and it will probably make sense or even make poeople in the fleet know where you are and it will make sense too but to have cloaking intact when a ship collide nope no wayi can understand today since theres no of of warping in formation and no formal way of using range of warping and such when using warp squad of course that would make sense but to remove the collision when in fleet
no this takes all the skill out of stealth bombing gangs
it used to be that ships using the covops cloak ii they didnt uncloak each other and we have had no explanation to why they implemented the uncloak featureagreed but only for and between ships using the covops cloak and that are in same fleeta hostile should be able to uncloak me if he  his drones comes within 2 500mand i should be hindered from recloaking if another friendly or hostile ship or drone etc is within 2500m or im targeted
think if we refrain from convincing you and proceed with convincing ccp well get more places right 
heh fully skilled in thermodynamics but never use it because the button is too small and cant remember all the hotkeys
why does everyone say thatdo you all just fly around in interceptors or can you completely disregard the passing of time at willflying a freighter from amarr to jita is anything but quick im not saying it needs to be faster but it sure isnt too fastas for the topic dont like it either doesnt feel right imo
first of all freighters shouldnt be fast webbing the ship helps hello teamworkand yes i regularly do 5060jump trips with my freighter
actually i normally move cargo in a prowler since i am normally moving very small items  so yes it feels considerably faster to me than someone in a freighter that feeling of speed is very subjective based on our normal modes of playthe point is eve doesnt need to feel smaller
not supported
i never said they should be just that they arentyeah nice idea but actually rather useless unless you mean to reduce risk always goodi once timed flying through a 70au system  the actual flight in warp took by far longer than going into warp  even though that takes almost a minuteno reason to waste another ones time unless its really importantvaluable cargoif fleets could increase warp speed that would be more interesting
there is such a load of consequences that im not even going to list themtravel in eve is as it stand fast enough read just fine it might be boring but it keeps the idea around that this takes place in a galaxyyou should have gone back to before revelations where you could just as well autopilot anywhere in highsec because it didnt matter if you flew or autopiloted although the 15 km bookmark beyond a gate sped travel up of course
actually if anything fleets should align and warp at the speed of their slowest ship to maintain fleet coherency
this is a troll rightthis has to be a troll         yep this is a troll well thought out troll but a troll nonetheless
bahaha so awesomeso supporting this idea because of how stupid it is
i propose that the pos shield acts exactly like a bubble everywherethis will lead to many cowards dying appropriately
sounds great would definitely get me more carrier kills
for those of us who have no freaking clue what youre trying to say could you maybe elaborate a little
i think what hes trying to say is that in addition to keeping you protected from getting locked by other ships the bubble also keeps you from warping in and out of the pos without leaving the bubble first
a bubble in 00 is this thing which when anchored acts literally as an area of effect warp scrambler nothing except tech 3 ships can warp when inside a bubblea pos shield is emitted by a pos which provides a protection shield from anyone when inside it this means you can warp in and out of a pos shield and be perfectly safe nothing can do damage to youi think this is bad you should fall out of warp outside the bubble fly into the shields for protection you also need to fly out of the shields in order to get out exception being the appropriate tech 3 subsystemthis would make it impossible for ships to stay in the pos and expect to be safe
i propose you stop proposing ideas
this makes perfect sense to me supported
and your reasoning behind this for me the current pos bubbles are perfectly fine
domain names pretty much work the same in all systems they have to its the only way you can set a standard so that all domain name servers can access and recognize all the other servers out there domain name systems have to all be based on the same underlying principles otherwise the systems couldnt communicate now ccp may have some internal setups on stuff that may be specific to their system but the underlying basis of how aliases subdomains and domains work has to all be the same as any other systemi didnt claim to be an expert shows how good your reading comprehension skills arei just said i have experience with it and know how it basically works seeing as ive done similar things and have run multiple domains and subdomains on the same server
thank you so very much for proving my casei suggest you go read up on your dnsbindweb hosting administrative practices before you come backdns is only one part of the whole there is much more to it than just pointing a domain name to a locationserverthe api server is very likely and i hope to hell it is on a different server but all of us even then have no bloody idea how they have it all mapped out they likely have all kinds of things going onsubdomains dont necessarily map to the same serverand firewalls are smart enough to tell the difference at least the good ones not to mention certain security issues when crossing server barriers must be taken into account such as ssl certsand i seriously doubt ccp will lift a finger for a little indulgence because your wanting to frak around on the job
i understand their can be underpinnings that make things a bit more complicated sorry i wasnt being literal with the 15 minutes just sorta using an expressioni still cant believe it is that difficult usually if you point another domain name to something it just takes on the structurelike my personal website godaddy hosts both of my domains which point to an outside server byethostnet hosting
your asking them to mask the literal idenity of a secured api server with the public idenity of an anotherdns is nothing more than a recursive referencing system that points to ip addresss via a methodology i wont get into right nowdns is the easy partthe hard part is the functionality in which you wish to use that is not under that idafaik the only way to achieve what you want is to literally move the server into the realm of eveonlinecomwhen your dealing with different boxes as far as physical goes you run into complications when you try to merge the toofor examplemyalliancecom example has a few subdomainsforumsmyalliancecom is mapped to a directory easy rightthing is the database that drives the boards is mapped somewhere else and its on a different zip code physically speaking even a different backboneif you where using data from that database to a local machine youd see its a different hostname than the main one none of the 2 are related and your firewall could potentially block either oryour proposed solution is to remap it fine that sounds easier than it is so if i put forumsdbmyalliancecom and point it to hostname of the database would it workno because the databases security systems would deny access due to invalid identification because its designed to listen to a specific serveroh sure it can be reprogrammed but then you leave potential open doors in the security sense and it just gets bloody complicated in a hell of a hurrythats just one pitfallkeep in mind the assumption of all servers being in the same place 9 times out of 10 is falsemost companies who have critical assets tend to keep them offsite in a isolated area for purposes of uninterrupted operations and that system could be multiple servers or a cluster of servers all doing specific tasks that have nothing to do with the main web server here at eveonlinecomthe provider i work with has a different outsourced company that maintains a server farm for all databases for exampleso i apologize if i was a bit harsh im so used to slapping people around who claim they know as opposed to the ones who really know at least your nice enough to ask why as opposed to denialim sure ccp would have a authoritative answer on the matter but like it or not this issue is very minor if its an issue at all which it isnt
this is where im confused why do you say thatlike i gave with the example of my webpage i have two domains that point to the same locationgodaddy hosts my domains and i input dns information that points to my webhost serveri register those domains in cpanel and byethost knows that when godaddy redirects to my webhost what webpage to pull up if i say wwwserysoftcomblogphp or wwwrburkecomblogphp i get the same page so why cant they simply point eveonlinecom to exactly the same thing as eveonlinecommore or less why are they only allowing eveonlinecom to mirror certain parts of eveonlinecom in the first place what is the ultimate motive to doing that if you can do it to the forums why not just let eveonlinecom point to the whole thing if you just break it down to the domain name level there cant be security issues
did you even read my whole post or just that one bityour assuming everything is on one single serverits sure as hell not that much i can guaranteeyour dealing with the virtual aspect but you keep leaving out the physical aspectif it was all in one place then it would be easy to deal with but its notfor all i know the api system is likely integrated with the game cluster servers itself if not a subsection of it as they have turned it off every so oftenthe portal in which we gather api is like its own server at that rateits not unsual for large systems to be broken down physically into clusters of physical boxestop that off with the fact that i did say that even if you map the dns to point to a specific location you cant get around the authentication issueand your log in credentials arent enough there are hidden variables that are likely involved that are critical to securityand if you didnt read all of that then at least get thiswith all due respectwe have no ing idea how its all laid out and your request is likely going to get ignored because its just trivial at best there are far more pressing matters to resolve right nowwe can make conjectures and attempt to make conclusions but with no valid proof theres only the way things work at bestand i think im done debating this one
this post was easier to understand than your original onei get it now sucks you had to end it the way you didi was liking you for a minute there
im surprised you liked it for this longand the fact you didnt understand the first one speaks quite a bit about your true experienceim not a big expert on such things but i did learn alot about dns heck i did it manually by hand in raw format command line ftwim sorry if your offended but when your like me and you have to deal with all the kids that think they know it all it tends to get a little old real quickwith that i wish you wello7
id like to see tracking introduced to the gategunsi sat on a lowsec to nullsec gate in my af having a nice little chat with a red inty about the fight we were both about to jump intoit would be nice if i could have shot him before we jumped
just add tracking and sig radius factors to gate gunsforcing pirates to fly bs in order to pirate issilly
well how bad should the tracking of sentries bebecause making it bad enough so your tackled cruiserfrig isnt getting toasted will be a huge nerf 
as a jump freighter pilot for a group of low sec pirates i often have to fill 10 or more orders for them each wanting different ships and many mods often these mods are the same and with the only way for me to sort these out into different groups being the gereral freight container it becomes frustrating the size of this container allows me to only fit two in my jump freighter so now i only have 3 sections which to sort this stuff outi propose the creation of an item along the lines of shrink wrap like they use to budle freight these days that i can apply to a group of selected items which bundles them together into a container the size of their total m3 i can then name this for easy sortingthis simple item would make my life alot easier having to write down lists and all that bs
i do have a freigher not the jump freighter and its hell i support this

for the millionth time i support this more pvp in high sec for everyone and more smacktalk too i would just activate a mission fit a pvp ship and wait till my victimsalvager comes in all prepared for pvp of course just to see the smacktalk
defender launches should be fireforget have the same rof of rockets and if a missile pops with active defenders in space they retarget the next available missile until their fuel depletesthere should also be gunbased defensive systems with extremely high rates of fire high tracking and long range but tie up a turret slot because not all ships have an available missile bayboth should engage drones if no missiles are directed at the ship
simple fix always on constant passive scanning system like that old ugly halfsphere we used to have but up to 14 au in sizeits purely passive so hardly accurate all it gives you is a ship roughly xdistance away the further away the larger the deviation up to an au or more it wont tell you what kind of ship until theyre within 12 au the smaller the ship the longer it takes the passive sensors to detect it at all if a recon decloaks long enough to throw a probe and recloaks the sensors wont ever see itif you want more info you have to open up the scanner and actively ping local space this sends out a more accurate pulse of energy that returns shiptype information but the range still has a broad deviation at longer distances but it also quite effectively indicates where you are and what youre flying not so much that they get a free warpto but gives them a darn good idea where to throw their probes and what to look forthe passive fulltime scanner would not see anything but ships period no pos no wrecks no probes it would just tell you ship has appeared on long range scan at xdistance in roughly that direction on a 4560 degree arc wider at longer rangesthere fixednow youll always have a warning of a new contact what theyre in or what they intend you havent a clue and the smaller the ship the longer your passive system will have to look to see it
why dont we replace local with constellation and everybody just stfu about it
im not going to fanfest others are they could be asking questions but it is hard to know what the csm questions should be and if there are any worth using the opportunity to ask when we dont even get to see the minutesand thats not even taking into consideration the forum discussion of the minutes who does not remember the infamous 40 quote from one of those minutes and all the talk that spawnedthere were lots of things that could have been debated so it wont be necessary to waste time with them at fanfest  or at least you would have been far better prepared to go in depth with them if they have been opened up on the forum firstwhats the whole point of it if it is just going to be some closed counsil that doesnt give the feedback people needhas it has become a empty shell that goes through the motions but noone involved neither csm or ccp really care one bit and certainly dont care to inform the general publici am at lack for the english equivalent but the danish readers might know what i mean when i ask er det gUFFFDet hen og blevet en syltekrukkecsm used to be trumpeted as a democratic step forward and unique among mmos for improving the playerdev information flow something important and to be applaudedthe current state is giving the impression of slacking and not caringi think you are right about noone caring about the posts in this section of the forum it is quite likely assumed that anyone with anything worthwhile to say is already directly connected to either a ccper or a csm delegateand assembly hall is looking more and more like features and ideas with the difference that most people have learned to slap proposal idea or issue on their horse to make it look officiali can just note that today tuesday during downtime they have still not been posted and the thing kicks off on thursday less than 48h from now

my analogyyou  the playerbase  is a slice of bread ccp is a slice of bread the csm makes it nice and tasty by being the jam in the middle it bring the 2 bits of bread together
wondered if it would be now possible to get rid of this annoying thing
sorry if this was talked in other thread i probably missed but could someone redirect me or write a few lines about how csm was involved in sovereigtny revamp process what was the role of csm and what objections and concerns did they rise
and exactly how do you propose ccp do thatgold spammers plague nearly every mmo in existence if you find a reasonable and rational way of thwarting them let us know
could this be combinedamended to include the other active suggestion of being able to see the condition of drones while they are still aboard nice to know what needs fixing withut kicking their smokin hulls out into spacemike
just bring them inline with light missiles and make their base damage half that of the bigger ham cousins that is a doubling of current damage lights have 12 the damage of heavies that way they will still be iffy against small fast targets but brutal when something is larger tackled or painted just like the hams and torpedosno amount of explosion velocity will make them worth a damn against nonfrig targets so that is the wrong way to go if you ask me it is not rocket science harr harr harr i am so clever
fix rockets
fix nao
fix rockets and look into giving missiles some love one weapon system should not be locked out of fleet engagements
yes pleasegreat feature managing bookmarks in containers is a pain
actually bookmarks are stored server side its just the bookmark folders that are stored on the clientbut thanks for raising the feature request the ship fittings savings was awesome even if it takes a year for something like this itd still be great
noit would be far to easy to move around especially in a fleet environment would undermine the whole idea of covops and scouts not to mention make exploration utterly trivial everyone knowing where everything is the second it is probed downmake a central depository office or hq where bookmarks can be entered into a shared folder allows for rapid dissemination of locations removes the need for the cansodoom but most importantly it does so without obsoleting the roles of scouts and making fleet warpins a matter of waiting for bookmark to appear on screensorry for the hardships you face in wspace but it is pretty much what it said on the tin out there life is supposed to be hard

have read all replies here well 1 says  csm already decided to approve this issue further in january as it is ie votes for hacking ok2 the only tough pos problem is one with wh space second comes extinct hisec corp that judging by replies cannot be wardeccedim against hacking which would result in gaining actual pos modules at max the refinable derelict tower thing because it is better for pos marketid vote for introduction of any idea that would be deadly for an offline wh pos like attack by rats once pos goes offline or just autoscrapping it in wh spacewhole idea is that it should be easier to get rid of abandoned stuff in places where this stuff is hard to get rid of atm but it should not be easy to get billions from a new salvaging profession while collapsing the pos market
what is nos suppose to do exactly if its not suppose to counter neutsalso i dont subscribe to the idea that cap injectors are counters to neuts cap injectors are a requirement for active tanking yet another reason why it sucks fly an active tanking ship without an injector in pvp and even without getting neuted youll die very quickly it also doesnt scale well lolmidsgrid
you do understand that with these changes active tanking will be twice as strong overloadedid lobby for more but id fear that it could be abused some how undocking games etc
if the tempest becomes the sniper what becomes of the maelstrom i mean people prefer the megathron even though the hyperion is better also are you sure you want 30 seconds rof cycle timei dont want an apoc clone but messing with fall off is problematic right now you can get 150km fall off on the vargurmacherial on sisi because of the changes to tracking enhancers because the fall off number is so big and so many ships have bonuses to it combined that its actually normally a pretty ty mechanic hit quality drops as well as hit chance so your alpha is much less in fall off  i decided to leave it alone optimal range for acs i still believe is the best solution the problem with it really is that too many pilots have fall off tinted glasses it works for frigs and cruisers because you can keep at fall off against anything that out damages you and move into optimal against anything that has better range than you with battleships its infeasible to be in more than two places at once and far more valuable having a defined radius in which your weapon system is superior
i propose a change to mining drones of all types at present they fly to a rock orbit at there optimal range for mining now i propose that the drones need to be changed to work like sentry drones base range of 15km and using skills implants and gang bonuses gain the same bonuses as lasers and maybe balance out there old flight time with a few seconds extra cycle time this will eliminate lag when there is a fleet of miners no extra moving objects allow the bigger rocks to be mined by drones as currently when a rocks radius is over the optimal range of drone it is hit and miss as to weather the drones will mine or not any thoughts on this

download evemon it is awesome for planning out your skill training
wow really i didnt bother to check and see if there were actualy a program for it id like one in the game sorta but that will work thank you
lets give new players a jump start with spfirst we can put out a new skill set learning skills these could raise your attributes for each level we could have two skills for each attribute even this could double the speed you learn at training the basic skill to level 5 in order to train the advanced skill would be too much though so make level 4 the prereqhmm thats not enough how about we give every new player a vast amount of skill points to start out with something like 800000 sp no wait we should let them assign it any way they want how about instead for the first month or so we give them double the training speed yes doublemy creative wheels are spinning now thats not enough these new players might have attributes that arent suited for what they find out they want to do in the game lets let them choose the attributes too new players should at least get a couple chance to do this we could call it neural remappingtldr trading rl money for skill points is fail but the devs have already done quite a bit to allow new players to train faster and get skills faster
actually if you consider the shape of many other haulers in the game unless there is some secret future technology of which i am unaware the iteron v is very unrealistically designedlet me give a simple reason to start with it needs too much metalimagine a hypothetical object 100m long 1 m wide and 1 m tallthis has a total volume of 100m3it will also require 100m100m1m1m of surface area or metal to clad the structure so that is 202 square metresinstead let us create the perfect cube which would each have a facet of 3367 square metres adding to a total of 202 square metres each square would be 58m tall and 58m wideso instead of having a total volume of 100m3 using the same amount of surface area we could have a total volume of 58 x 58 x 58  195m3 of volumeso a hauling ship will always tend to veer towards being boxlike obviously aesthetic preferences and the mechanical details may change the ship design a bit but that doenst alter the illogicality of the ship designplus imagine a station docking bay what is the most obvious shape for a station docking bay a massively long thin bay or just a massive cuboid structure so a wide variety of ships could fit inbut what am i saying the itty v is an internet spaceship as long as it looks cool and it looks belieavable for what it does its all good
your math is wrong to encompass a volume which is 100m x 1m x 1m requires 4 sides each 100m x 1m and 2 ends each 1m x 1m yes that is 402 square meters of materialsand because your first math was wrong this portion also ends up wrong to still use only 402m2 of materials each panel of the cube can be 81853m x 81853m 6699m2 and give a total interior volume of 548347 cubic metersas i suck at math im probably also wrong i guess id rather see the iteron look like a smaller version of the obelisk
make it bubble wrap allow it to be popped and i will never leave a station again
hell yes
yep ive wanted something like this for a long time
amenexcellent idea
excellent idea have ran into this situation many times forcing me to fly another 23 jumps just to get cans to organize it around a bit
definitelybut dont confuse it with repackaging items something like rightclick  shrinkwrap items or rightclick  box items would be better using the word package would be pad due to confusing it with repackaging i think
while i am all for neat hangars wouldnt it make a lot more sense to double the number of hangar divisions a wrapped item cannot be accessed unless the entire bundle is opened so you are essentially asking for a longterm storage solution that does not involve office rentalscorrect me if i am wrong but isnt one of the significant differences between the wrap and cans that the wrap cant be scannedi am sure the suicide gankers on the hubgates would shed a tear if all haulers were using xray proof cargo bayswill the player made label allow you to see exactly what is inside if not they should not be tradeable to avoid the obvious scam potential
i dont like this idea the way it is worded right now it is just what scammers need to scam thru contracts or sales
a simple solution to the scamming issue is to make wrapped packages noncontractable if you wanted to contract stuff for another person to move you would use a courier contract in the first place this seems like it would be more for moving personal items or items for friendscorporations where they could just direct trade you a wrapped package
you see what is inside of these packs dont worry about the suicide gankers
zmog gonna train for min bs nowplease dont get it changed yetcause i reallly wanna fly a bs with double damage bonus on capless guns
poor troll or legitimate noob im undecidedalso this thread doesnt serve so much of a purpose anymore ill keep watching the changes being made right now theres a few things missing such as extra falloff on acs fusion being top damage the muninn is still terrible but i wont bother making a thread for any of it until ccp puts this stuff on tq
i think i would prefer to just scrap the whole csm rather than do away with term limits while i am not advocating scrapping the csm system now i am awfully close to it it just seems to be a way for the big alliances to get advanced intel on what is coming down the dev pipeline i dont believe that nda slows them for 5 seconds they are just a lot more sophisticated than you know who wasmy 02 isknot supported

supported
lets assume we follow your suggestion and bump the blasters with the suggested changes to the vindicator it would end up with what 20002200 dpsare you nuts and 6 minutes sustained fire is like firing permanently because everytime when you change targets and move into range the cap has time to recover a bit and make that period longer also does your calculation take cap boosters into accountin general i have to say  range boost maybe 50 dps boost no way even with the cap penalties thats over the top
i would support increasing optimal and reducing cap usage a bit
signed
signed
nuts no cause gal weapons uses cap take a neuter and the gal weapons are useluess seems like a good thing to me minnie dont even use cap and same goes with missiles so in other words you can or have more chance of using more defense modules instead of a mod for your cap since some people use a cap mod in order to have more life for their weaponsi like that change but i have to say with that amount of damage reduce fall off and dont touch optimal this way its still the shotgun up close and getting very very personal with your victim
blasters need fixing but not in the way im down wants to
leave blasters alone for now boost null
blasters need more tracking thats it
holy crap 15002000 dps megas and vindicators i would love to see these monsters in game no other bs would even come near in crushing a gallente bs 1 on 1hell yeah
thank you for proving it would be unbalanced
yes inside of 6km opitmal its harshly imbalanced which is the point of blasters its also terribly cap inefficient if you go past 6km optimal damage starts to decline rapidly im not sure how many fights you have been in inside of 6km ive not had that pleasure often enoughtracking disruptors energy neuts range and speed are all great counters to blaster megas
good analysis supported
just saying but 50 increase does not mean 15x as you have to remember the damage boosts on skills do not stack wellso likely the dps would be in the range of 1200 not 1500in support of more optimal and a tad more dps
im sorry but i cant stop myself from sayingim down
who the hell can afford a vindicatorsigned
in general a realy speced gank mega should be able to reach 2k dpsduring overheat but this is more a problem of the damage rigsunstack them with damagemods and we will see a lot more options instead off trimarks on anythingthe 1430 dps from my mega atmincluding max skills and imps it hits nearly 16k during overheating feel just a bit to weak with the 93k ehp buffer it got against resonalbe fitted bs it is to weak to gank a simlar fitted gedonehp advantage by the extra low mostly make the diffrence here or a dualrep hypewhat was a bit easier with 90 webs even if it is down to around 30 structure in general 50 is to muchfix damage rigs instead ffs and a proper number would be more like 1520i disagree on the range change the problem is not range it is effectiveness at the given range core problem here is the weak weboutside of rr gangs or throw away gang damagedealers that stops you to apply all your damage and negate range issuesonce you get your target webbed even without a dps a boost with a working web the blaster ships would be at least as good as pre qr actualy a bit better since more people prefere close range now instead of flying nano ships even if i mostly enjoied the kitting game against them also i compleetly disagree here null is finea bit to good actualy with bs sized neutrons the problem is the performance once you get into web range not the performance out of itand be shure it is a lot better than pre qr atm and eats any kind of cruiser hull at 20km alive allready with the reduced speeds even if it would be a option it doesnUFFFDt fix the range issues within web range and is fare to powerfull out of web rangebs neutrons
well maru kage might be if they stop failing at pvpanyway  people will be able to afford vindicator and then you suddenly got something that eats anything out there alive if the blaster changes as proposed here go live you would nerf the vindicator again for balance
not supported blasters are fine
hello alljust a quick few words i am not a moan and a complete noob there we go ok besides hotkeys there in my eyes an issue with the overheat rack buttons and the little overheat single module buttons and its the size of the buttons seriously sometimes in a omg wtf situation that button being so small is very annoying and actually takes some of your concentration away to maneuver your way to click it without in it up another thing ok you overload rack and the little button doesent turn green instantly if there is one of your modules in a pre cycle it would be better if the overload rack button would flash green telling you its awaiting the end of your mod cycles and is ready to overheat and then turn solid greenfor the whole button problem i can not really suggest another way of making it easier to click apart from making them slightly biggerfor individual modules there should be a bigger sticky out activation button at the top rather than having it molded into the top and being so small i have on some occasions turned a module off because of the precision needed and i just dont have timei know some people out there are just going to say go away you just suck and cant click it right you shouldnt have to master clicking a dinky button because in my opinion its a little bit of a gui flawhave not been on the test server recently so unsure if there is any changesthanks for readinggibtrolls will be mails spammed in game
would be good if i done this lol support my own thread ofc
yea i have the same problem its a pain when you miss it and it does another cycle and nearly pops your mwd
example of individual overheat buttonlinky lets hear your views its just to simplify things a bit yes it was roughly done but if i gave it some love it would look better lol
you failed at searchingcan we please have a modular  updated hud for overheatingproposal toggling overloadmaybe bump those threads instead of starting your own
search function failed on me tbh never works
drake drakonis your calling those who see things differently some bad names qualifies your iq not theirs also i think direct insults were forbidden here and your using symbols to conceal them too speaks for your respect to all people also this thread helps me to understand how exactly the eve community reacts to thisi myself am perfectly okay with the timeframes we currently have for skills and would not benefit from it directly but i did benefit from seeing your points a bit sad to lose very many people who dont like waiting to train the everyone has to train core skills but guess thats the way it has to be to keep it balanced thanks people
i happrrrn to think youre the idiot here drake wow has 7 million more people playing thann eve maybe this kind of thinking is the problemsupportted
im a new player hi new player hi everyone so anywho yeah please do nt let skill points be bought i like this game cause i can have a life and sleep at night and 8 hours later boom i can fly my uber cruiser and during those 8 hours somebody else is getting in there new cruiser too but if i understand your proposal then 8 hours later im flying in my new cruiser happy as a clam mining to get me some guns on my baby and some other guy in those 8 hours bought enough skills to get into a massive uber ship of epic proportions and comes along on me and kills me cause he bought all of it while i did it the old way no thank you the very least i would like to see is some sort of level system that just gives you a benchmark of were you are in the game not effecting the game at all except to be another blinking light in my character sheet
buy a char then which has the certificates you need
ccp got rid of ghost training for that reasonjust in case you missed it
i happen to like the fact that your forced to train to fly a hulk for 1 to 2 monthsi happen to like the fact your forced to train for carriers properly for nearly 6 monthsi suggest you take a step back and rethink your stanceits bad enough people are allowed to buy charactersafter playing eve for over a year i can see why people would take issue with taking shortcutswhich is why i draw the line there you want it that bad buy the  character legally and stfutheres your bloody sp
no actually wow has more people playing than eve because wow dumbed it down enough to appeal to the masses ccp did not take shortcuts with their game and destroy it just for the sake of getting more subscriptions hence smaller player base but more fun game at least for those of us that like it for those that dont well theres always wow
oh settle down drake it was 2 in the morning and i was drunk this idea is so laughable the only supports have come from its originator and me with a few screw drivers in me
i am guessing that you have not taken basic game theory have youeve does well because it appeals to people outside the wow playerbase if it altered to compete directly with wow it would die a horrible death just like all the other wow killers out there
1 i was drunk2 even while drunk i was being sarcastic i mistyped on account of laughing not the vodka p
dont drink and post efrim
lol i just have to point out that a persons iq have nothing to do with social skills as if i insult you for a stupid opinion according to your statement it means i have low iq mind clarify this just a little and for the record the higher iq a person have the less social skill they tend to haveso are you saying that drake is a genius and to the topic i think buying all sp associated with a certificate is not a good idUFFFDa like core competency elite thats huge amount of sps involved core fitting elite is usually only associated with t2 bs andor dread pilots due to the adv weapon upgrades lvl5 requirement and i may also point to the character bazaar where you can buy chars only to be called ebay when you actually try to do something with themso not supported not at all
niceo7
not supportedif i had to go uphill in the snow both ways in the dead of winter barefoot three times now then so should all the new people
remove clone upgrading every time after pod lost its not good isk sink  clones cheap its really griefing when u lose  something like bs 5 or even cap ship for new player even 35 days lost in training is too muchits a game  u dont need punish ur players for every wrong move how many rage quit was due to this feature and for all who want post  l2p remember  more troubles and complexity for players  less ppls in eve  much less funccp want more life in lowsec and 00  pls remove some of barriers if you have insurance you dont care much about t1 fitpod with learning implants and ur skills is something u want to keep safeand while u can buy imps and clear ur mistake for not warping out fast sometimes due to lag  u cant solve problem with clone
first of all i can barely understand you second of all supported
someone forgot to upgrade his clone as to your pointsits an isk sinkit isnt griefing but you thinking that it is is very revealingthe really new players wont lose anything since the basic clone is free older players really should know better the actual loss is 5 from those skillpoints not covered by the clone so unless you havent upgraded in a long time the loss isnt criplingin this game you do as you said its a game so why are you taking it so seriously no one is forcing you to play so if you like the game to kiss your wounded ego to make it all better instead of telling you what a moron you where this might not be the game for you intelligence and effort should be and is rewarded while stupidity is punished working as intended remember  the game is complex by design and attracts people who like that change that to cater to the lazy and stupid and you lose the people currently enjoying eve im all for more people playing eve but not at the expence of ruining the game an acceptable way to correct this would be a reminder when your medical clone doesnt cover your current sp or even a popup when you try to undock in such a scenario
simple scenarioganked in belt podedswitched off comp and went to workforgot about all that crap after workday took industrial ship form hangar  gate camp  pod  lost skill pointsdont see anything funny
well i think skill loss shouldnt be there  but something else like a death penalty which can be negated by paying isk for your clone that would be much better than the current form
clone upgrading is less about the isk loss and more about stations having medical thats actually a very important factor in regions like curse which have a lot of stations while only a few have medical and it forces a bit of centralityi wouldnt mind however having some sort of warning show up ie one warning category for docking at a station with medical and an outofdate clone another for docking at one with a clone that will be out of date at the end of the current training queue
lesson learnedcheck your clone before undocking
no doubt the current system could use improvements a warning label somewhere informing you that your clone is outdated perhapshoweverits not supposed to be funny a good game isnt just joy and fun with no losses there is no winid suggest being able to pay in advance would make more sense imo
if you take the fact that no warning is given when your clone is not upgraded and you can go outside of a pos and because of that the player loses sp and if one of the consequences is the player quitting everything and goes away from eve then yes there is a problemeither remove the whole upgrade clone thing or dont allow to undock if your clone is not upgraded if you ask me one of the other i dont care
its not a lesson that could help you in your life you always checking your brains before leaving housescaming in jita helps in rl
with the proliferation of applications such as eve mon evehq and other programs to let you know what you got going on sp you utterly have no excusewhile i dont like the fact that it could excessively expensive if you get killed repeatedly i cant support thisdamn efrim wth you come from 
so i need to use 3d party program to avoid this and u know  eve api was down at that time for some tournament
this is likening to getting into your car and not noticing you have a flat tire before causing potentially irreparable damage or not checking the oil every so often etcetcstop blaming the game for your short comingsman up and get with the programits never been an issue for me why should it be made a ingame problemthe api may have been down but the ingame skill sheet was still there and i kept an eye on that while it was down what was your excuseits called enforcing good habitsand really the isk invovled isnt really that muchi was told check your clone periodically when skill up make sure you replace your clone when you get poddedeasy tasks you forgot you only have yourself to blameif i had a nickle for every time some one came up here and whined about something they forgot id be fricken rich
its oil flat tire etc i can understand this and we all have more things to remember  like wifes birthday why i should remember such stupid info like clone capacity just cuz some brilliant dev said  its cool it adds more realism no in real world brains of clone dont have capacity and will never have such thing l2biology i dont mind losing ship or pod or any reasonable amount of isk  but dont touch my sp or do it in manner like t3 ships
then for lords sake dont undock because you will lose it again
dear god why i dont see any sign of your love in drake draconis may be he has no life and check his clone every 5 mins
come on  it is very simple1 log in2 first thing after logging in open character sheet and look at your clone grade and your total sp3 if clone grade is less than your current sp upgrade itdone takes 1020sif you live in lowsec00 for a while you get used to iti could support a warning on undock but no autopayment
me laughsare you really that foolish to think that you must have had a sad sad time learning to play evetry once a day noobletits not rocket science if you think it is your in the wrong gameeve is not a kind game but its not hard to figure out eitherstop being lazy youll figure it out eventually
avoiding the skillpoint loss is so laughably simple that your whinepost makes no sense at allthe normal routine i do and which works when setting new skills check clone and current skillpoints when podded get new clone before undocking always use evemon if you cant be bothered with step 1with that said it might be a hassle to actually do it manually every single time and i would however like to seem something in a form of a clone contract which keeps updating your clone to the same level for a set number of clones and paying a sum of money in advancehowever since this topic is a whine about it being this mechanic is so stuuuuupid and not an actual proposal for the matter at hand i can not support it
 this game mechanic is by design  this game mechanic serves a real purpose of making the opponent suffer loss real loss makes real win possible  this game mechanic allows players to make a choice risk vs reward risk  possible podding and sp loss
what will be eve without constant flow of noobs to shoot answer  it will be desert with few very very attentive or intelligent ppls who will occasionly meet each other in jita
somehow i feel that the game will be just fine with fewer people like you to whine about losing there sps because they forgot to update there clonewell thats what you really meant wasntcan i has your stuffseriously the actual accidental i forgots to update my clone is rare enough as it isand noobs your age i assume unless your representing them and thats a stretch and a half usually only lose a day or less of trainingif your like me well over a year and you forget you deserve to be laughed atand i will gladly be held accountable for said statementthread
i dont shoot noobsnoobs can also be attentive and intelligent as opposed to your implicit assumption here that only older players are attentive and intelligentthe attentive and intelligent noobs wont quit simply because they forgot to upgrade their clone the attentive and intelligent noobs paid attention during their tuts and whatnot and realized there was a clone to upgradeactually from my experience in game and on the forums the unintelligent or unattentive people that complain about stuff like this quit relatively quickly usually so what will eve be like like it is i guess but thats just from my experience i supposeeditoh and fail for your response on wanting unintelligent or unattentive people to be able play eve enmasse and compete just as well as the others eve would then be wow and our acronyms would be messed up
i recommend one and only one third party application  your brain
4 delivery stats filter the contracts by quantity successfully delivered so we can weed out the couriers intended to be ganked long before reaching their destination jita  amarr shuttle couriers dead in niarja as an example
effing signedwhen might wings actually act like wings and squadrons like squadrons last time i checked there was no way in hell a commander or even a captain could direct every man in a fleet engagement
no you have to copy  paste the name of the missing itemoh obviously no improvement can be made the quirks to copying bookmarks take so long to explainwhile bookmark copies create database overheadwow so smart
here is where your results are skewed eve is a complex game of rock paper scissors in which there is no ship that cannot be topped one way or anotherfitting a ship is about sacrifices tackle is a sacrifice i can say if you didnt need tackle in pvp there would be a bit of a difference in your findings pick a ship train it each race has their ships that do certain things well what you are effectively saying is make the exequeror comparable to the vexor in combat validity if tackling required low slots you can guarantee caldari and shield minny ships would be the supreme rulers of your borked statistic lessondrake is a drake thorax is a thorax tempest is a tempest no need to change what these ships do for balance instead skill one up and fly it eve is open ended like that
i dont usually do this but a hearty i agree to this post i might recommend nerfing rooks damage output a bit since im not sure if cerberus has a viable role at the moment but on the other hand its just awesome to fly
free bump for more people to laugh at ops idiocy i fly caldari ships they are just fine
somehow the csm supported this i cant this is crazy op the idea that they bumpdecloak each other is what keeps their power from being so powerfulat most i could say that a black ops ship on grid cloakedor uncloaked if hes insane who is able to operate a modulewhile cloaked which gives that black ops pilot the ability to see his cloaked fleet members who then communicates saying person x youre going to far left nooo wrong left
as all of us who have played eve for any significant period of time know eve is greatly lacking in interesting enviroments its all just ships stations and floating rocksas the mission recon part 3 proves it is easily within the engines limits to create specific backgrounds in an area it also proves said enviroments can be programmed to have an effect on player shipshere are some of my proposals for ways for ccp to make all the spaces in eve a little more interestingasteroid belts somehow a little row of rocks isnt that interesting by liberally placing say a hundred large asteroids within a 100 km of the warpin point this could be fixed these asteroids if suitably massive would greatly enhance the immersiveness of mining additionally maybe 23 asteroids moving at 400 ms with rarer minerals should orbit the belt allowing players in faster ships to increase their profit at the expense of efficency also adding covering the area in a minor speed decrease 10ish under the pretense of asteroid dust the spherical design also allows mining to potentially be safer in losec if you invest the time in deep mining spotsice belts currently these are better than asteroid belts but by scattering the ice pieces in across a large spherical area would greatly enhance the immersiveness adding mobile ice chunks of better quality would be good as well but only going at 100ms so that barges could follow maybe cause 50ish damage per minute to any ship moving faster than 500 ms as a result of ice shardsstargates and stations maybe add a few towers labeled concord monitoring station in empire or alliance name here listening post in 00 and adding random debris from the wrecks of unfortunate folks who shot the wrong personplexes when the complex spawns maybe have a 10 chance that the whole complex is blanketed in a gas cloud  nebula that has an effect on ship characteristics within the complex in addition to improving the overall appearance examples conducting gas gas in the cloud conducts energy very well increasing all damage by 10 radioactive area radiation from some cataclysmic cosmic event impairs crew functions slowing the cycle time of all modules by 5random space whenever a player enters a random area of a system safespot falls out of warp from low capacitor ect ect theres a 1 chance of a random cosmic feature such as a rogue asteroid a large gas cloud or some other suitable object appearing in the areain general adding something other than the 20ish overused normal backgrounds in favor of more interesting ones like in wh space would be excellent as wellfeedback on this proposal would be nice
i like the random events idea the moving asteroid probably isnt feasible imo
i agree losing fighters is too expensive and you will want kill mail for just the fighters just make it a kill mail pack example after a big fight x amount of hours you will get kill mail of how many fighters you lost of each type that way you dont get 25 kill mail for each fighter you lost talk about a full inbox lol as for drones we could probably do the same thing but drones but are about a dime a dozen heck i can build hundreds if not thousands of dronesbrenteni use my alt for formes
some guys here and there discussed about the local channel universal and they say we must remove it i think thats a little bit too extremehowever what i do advise is to change the local channel of jita1 either remove it see this as a last ditch attempt2 either invoke some your chatting too fast please wait x minutes system3 your solution herediscuss this multiple items thr amarr navy omen ead
not sure what the problem is here to be honest i dont work in jita but i work in other major hubs and theres contract spamming going onif you see removing the local channel of jita a valid solution then when you go to jita minimize your local chat or blink off you not looking at it satisfies that problemwaiting a number of minutes is a bit extreme this proposition tells me that you want to use the channel but you dont want others posting in it to drown you outsolution in search of a problem i think i simply dont pay attention to local chat when in a trade hub and im not bothered by spammers for those that want to see contracts then can watch that channel or various trade channelsisk seller spammers i see as a problem good solution to that is rightclick  report isk seller which ive seen mentioned for at least a year now
well maybe in the hub systems with more than 200 people in local charge a com service fee of 1 million isk the fee could be implamented just like the one for pms this can help with isk spamers and contract spammers because most isk spamers are new accts and it will make scamming less profitable
i really think ccp can afford one gm or employee of some kind to monitor jita 237 365 a year so as soon as an isk spammer shows up they are banned
i think i will support this topic
actually it would need to be at least 4 employees and problably more realistically like 5 or 6 to cover all day long every day unless youre assuming that one guy can work all day without ever needing a break or a vacation or a holiday or a sick daysono just report them and let the gms deal with them
petition the sproposal remove the local chat from jita
i do petition them but the process of doing so is clunky to say the least i think ccp can stick somebody in jita 237 365 a year it doesnt have to be one employee but i bet 4 could do it one supervisor or lead and 3 to watch for isk spammers that gives the lead guy to cover time off from the others and the others cover his time off this also supports ccps mission of cutting the rmt types off at the knees
located the real problem for you this is what they actually need to fixshould be right clickreport isk spamyes im suredone
by the way the lowsec pirate that posted a couple of replies above mine doesnt make any sense
a did it happenb what came of itwhich topics were tabled which were killed destroyer changes likely which were escalated to ccp for review
UFEFF 20090927 161332  zastrow j  im slightly hungover but im upsecond line on the raw log file  nice to see the professionalism and honesty of the csm hasnt been watered down at all quite the opposite in factand xerox the destroyer changes were passed
it would be bloody nice if the iceland minutes where made available opstill havent found them
i remember when jason edwards used to post terrible ideas like this now he is slowly turning into one of us one of us
nonsense jason is the finest troll weve ever hadaupported brilliant show of logic my good siredit slightly drunk had to remove some foul language
its   full of starsand spreadsheetsmike
thew only problem with this is its njot a bubble its a shield why should a shield act like a bubble
i support drakes proposal
for i think the first time ever i support drakes ideaand that means alot
how hard or easy is it for ccp to create an educational tool for schools or for general public like in elementary to high school or even colleges and universities i know that at the moment the universe of eveonline all the planets and moons belts etc are all static but if you could make a 2 or 3 starsystem for with moving planets moons of the sol system and have people in school learn about the solar system or even different star types and lost objects like voyager probes explore different theoretical ideas like wormholes in space black holes pulsars stars the list can go on and on any thing i missed out onanother great idea fromshadowburn
eve is a static 2d world for the most partstudents would get more from this
communicating that would be nice completely ignoring everybody for a month is terribly unprofessional from my understanding somebody inside ccp is the holdup on getting these published can one of the csm delegates tell us whose inbox we need to start filling with daily reminders to get the minutes published
the csm is clearly abusing the priviledge of representing us1 csm term limits as an issue was brought before the csm with only three supports how was this representing the eve player base again2 the current scanner mess which is only going to get worse when local goes away in 00 which had over 1200 supports was not raised again a comment ccp is rethinking its position was all that was made obviously with 1200 supports this should be raised immediately and repeatedly3 the csm clearly does not represent the majority of the eve player base how many of you are 00 big alliance members again what percentage of eve players actually go to 004 the current nda the csm is required to sign is a joke either the csm represents the players or it represents ccp which one is it this is a clear conflict of interest besides which it is probably violated in an organized matter by out of game communication by the big 00 alliances5 the csm is prohibited from delving into certain topics by who ccp againccp either needs to one take the handcuffs off the csm so they can represent the player base or two end the current csm system which seems to just be a way for ccp to whitewash its problems
limiting wardecs from what they are now only promotes less destruction so the new system needs to come into being where we promote more destruction but we dont have alliance p with 1500 wardecsat the same time creating the situation where it is far more beneficial to be the 1 man corp instead of an alliance of 1000 uber carebearslets say there was no wardecs i bet there would be a giant alliance of carebears some middle sized ones why dont they exist now well you can have 1000 1man corps 2mil each to wardec at minimum so 2 billion isk to wardec those 1000 people or you can have 1 alliance which costs 50mil to wardec add on top of that the 2billion isk stacks so itd cost way way morethe new wardec system has to balance the system it has to be legitimate to come together as carebears who have no interest in being wardecced at all at the same time you need their ships to be dying you need a system to allow for pos and cans and stuff to be destroyed you need their operations to be disruptable concord standing of the pilot concord standing of the pilots corp the wardec aggressors concord standing and wardec corps concord standing add in that any aggressor corpalliance will take concord hitnot necessarily anything as bad as suicide ganking but not as easy as low sec for destroying ships in highsec free ship kills in low sec in terms of sec hit the ammount of hit calculated around the 4 concord standingskilling anchored giant cans or pos or pos parts for that matter will be sec hit freethe sec hit changes arent activated proactively however at the end of each week aka when you reup or get out your average sec hit is applied this happens if objectives havent been achieved the objectives being the grievance
like i wrote before and you better read my post again cause you really need to if you wardec a corp and you dont attack from my own knowledge damn im smart there is no destruction you say theres less  thats not true there not attackingnothing zero nada zip the system right now doesnt promote anything at all just full control on the aggressors so in a way its more destruction on his sideif he attacks in the first placesome corps who wardecs love to promote fear to people and uses backstabing techniques if you ask me just dont attack after a long time and once the victims think there never gonna attack you return with your regular ships i never did btw then thats when they attack once you realize you did a dumb thing you prepare for war and the wardecers hides for a time again and does the same thing againnot that its illegal cause i know its part of the game and mechanic but i really think this is not right i mean if you wardec someone you should attack sure its true that you can wait some time but not a week  thats exagerating
so i can only speak about the csm2 we had some lengthy discussions with ccp while in iceland about how the sov mechanics could be improved the discussions were very blue sky and brainstorming in nature but i think we did convey a general excitement about some of their ideasissler
thank you for inputis there something more specific and recent i was expecting there would be some entry on wiki like for other discussed matters
ishkurisnt the ishkur a subcapital assault ship ya ishkur can do thatkilling capitals just takes dps which comes from numbers so yes ishkur is thiswell if we take the pheonix for example even other capitals can avoid being hit by it so obviously you want a subcapital the size of a moon hey ishkur is thathell ya ishkur is teh pwndude ishkur is the ship for you
review destroyersi dunno i figure they arent what they ought to be but fear being overpowered epically is so likely afterall have any of you seen an agony empire dessie gang wowtracking for fighters lost in combatalot of corpsalliances actually build and use public caps that way at the end of the day the pilot has no reimbursing to dodont see why this needs a changehow was this passed tbh is vuk lau really the only one seeing how overpowered this isbombers are crazy op already avalloc should know because goons just downed like 70 bs recently using them
are there any minutes for the directional scanner discussion
hi erikim sorry if i was unclear let me try and make this a bit more understandabledo those two statements not constitue an inconsistency mazz is basically telling us to go diaf because ccp isnt going to do a thing whereas avalloc seems to suggest that ccp have indeed listened and changes are in fact already underwayand theres even more conflicting information flying around in fact just from mazzilliu alone weve had three versions1 diaf no changes will be made2 shut up an overhaul of the entire scanning system is already underway3 that shes actually going to discuss this with ccp againwhat im asking for is simply a clear answer what is going ona full reversal of the scanner change isnt necessary were not asking you to act like children and demand this of ccp again but something needs to be done to make the scanner workable again because at the moment the basic pvp game controls are suffering heavily from the 2 sec delay and if ccp is already planning to do something about it please just tell us and the threadnaughts wont have a reason to exist anymorethere have been several good suggestions on how to do this please present these to ccp as soon as you can and ask them to do something about the issue 1700 posts many of which come from pilots from some of the most well known and competent pvp alliances in eve are asking you to be the liaison between players and ccp that the csm are meant to bev
mazzillu didnt say they werent looking at options just that going back to the old delayless scanner was not considered by ccp to be a viable option
