"a lot of players that never tried eve before, see the long skillqueue, see the advantages of two +4 implants and they don't want to lose those implants, so they don't pvp, they stay in high-sec and get bored, then leave the game. learning implants are a real barrier for new players trying to enter null-sec. they need skills fast. they also need to pvp. they also need isk and can't afford to lose 40 million each time they die. what to choose? why do players have to make this choice: fun or isk ($$$) ?so - , give us a +4 boost to all attributes. the money ccp will lose because of shorter training times will be a lot less than the money won because players fight, destroy more ships, are not afraid to pvp, have more fun and stay in the game."

"i honestly doubt ccp could pull off getting partner groups to accept plex as payment for services, or the promise of reimbursement from ccp's coffers for accepting plex as a payment. even if the partner services accepted plex, they'd somehow need to coordinate with ccp to provide ways for payment to go through, which would be potentially ridiculous amounts of extra work and maintenance costs for an event that only happens once a year. on top of that, there's other associated nasties of providing services for space monopoly money that'd make me balk if i was a vendor being approached by ccp for partnering."

"i'm actually excited about dust514 being profitable. i haven't turned on my ps3 in ages, but when i did play dust it was actually pretty fun. for my personal tastes, i can't play repetitive things like arena games or lobby shooters. i prefer to explore. give me a wasteland to explore and find shiny things, shoot monsters, discover and learn about eve lore. somewhere so vast that i may bump into someone, or i may not. i don't want a themepark experience. perhaps fallout 3 + witcher 3 + mass effect. that would be so fun. scanning planets and taking the shuttle down but it's impossible to be so accurate that you land where you want. if someone else is also hunting the same treasure at the same time, then they land miles away, but you're both tracking to the same beacon.... one can only dream, right? :)"

"this certainly plays into the whole \"do attributes serve a purpose?\" angle. i'd venture to say no. they really don't serve a purpose other than to make the oldest players feel good about shuffling some arbitrary numbers around once a year.learning implants of course exacerbate the issue. i completely agree they should go, as they're a risk aversion multiplier and stupidly expensive way to suck time (the only really valuable resource) away from players. and of course older players have the most isk to buy them, giving them an accelerating and compounding advantage over their existing skill point head start.learning implants can 100% be removed and replaced with pretty much any other implant and continue to supply meaningful choice, as well as isk and lp sinks, into the game."

"i support this."

"the myth that older players somehow get this compounding/accelerated advantage with implants is falseall implants do ocne you have 20+ mil is somewhat mitigate the obscene amount of time that you now have to devote to each skill to get it leveled, ratio wise per skill were advancing just as fast as a noob, sp wise were going up faster, but thats because we have more distance to cover per skill than the new guysnot to mention they are currently an lp/isk sink, and id venture to say probably one of the larger lp store sinks"
"as someone flying around regularly with 500m to 2b in implants i assure you i appreciate the risk/reward they provide. however there's a difference between hardwires and pirate implants that affect gameplay and learning implants you can plug into a market trading alt that doesn't undock. theres no reason attribute implants can't be swapped for something with more meaningful gameplay impact."
"while i can see and agree to some extent on some arguments, for the removal of learning implants and attributes. none of them include the ridiculous notion, that they somehow stopped people from pvp.let's make one thing clear here, you are gaining a bonus in training by wearing them. if you wish for that bonus to be permanent for all, then remove attributes and give everyone a fixed training amount per hour for all skills. just stop with the whole \"i can't pvp with them in\" bulls**t. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"while i am personally a fan of plex for tickets etc, i doubt for legal/logistics/cost reasons ccp could do what you are asking. it would basically require them to front the logistics of thousands of players' travel arrangements instead of just printing out tickets/badges etc.that said, i will try to keep the importance of plex as a payment option (where possible) top of mind."
"they did a test program in '14 where yu could use plex to buy beer and things at some local shops and at fan fest. my guess is, it either was not very popular or it did not work out so well, because they did not see to repeat the process nor expand it this past fan fest. so i highly doubt you will ever have them do 'plex for tickets'"

"hello guys.i've been thinking about the recent announcements about the new sov system, as well as the new ideas for structures, and they both seem to fit very nicely into a concept i had a while back. this might be a bit too much but please give it a think, and if not exactly to this, maybe look to having a similar setup in the future.here's the general idea: most alliances that hold sov in-game have a certain system they use the most frequent, and therefore label it as their 'hq'. i think that the hq should take a big role in sov warfare, as it is the core of an alliance's territory. where new structures are concerned, the hq should have it's main structure (or only structure, depending on the plans for how many structures are allowed in a system) anchored to a planet specifically. that planet should have 1 district, of which that 1 district has an anchoring 'node', that keeps the structure in fine order, much how a pos has to be anchored, as well as it's defences and structures being strapped onto it. this 'node' should be conquerable by dust 514 players. i know that involvement with other eve games has been a big wish to have expanded, and i think that the involvement of dust players in sov warfare should be crucial, but mainly only in the hq system. most alliances have a dust corp, and i feel that the dust corps are going to waste.so it goes like this: the hq structure can be upgraded with different modules, with some defending it, and others giving bonuses to sov in the same region of the alliance that holds that hq. for example, if brave's hq is ge-8jv, their main structure will be anchored on a planet, and on that planet, they own a node, which keeps the bonusing modules fitted to the main structure working. these bonuses should determine how difficult it is to take systems in that region, belonging to brave. the node on the planet owned by brave is attackable by other alliances with a dust corp, in the form of a dust match. lets say pl deploys their dust corp onto the brave planet in a match against brave, and the match will determine whether brave keeps control of the bonuses on their main hq structure or not.lets say pl win the match, and take over the node. at that point, bonuses in the region are shut down, as well as any defensive modules fitted on the hq's structure. at that point, the structure is more vulnerable to a proper attack, of which the entosis module is used on the structure, and then is taken over. brave will have then lost their hq system, as well as defensive bonuses for their sov in their specific region.note: one other idea i had was to make it so all sov brave owned in the same constellation of their hq would be taken over also, but this would be incredibly overpowered, unless if the defence of the hq was able to be extremely good.one more thing: the use of capitals seem to be of little to no use in the upcoming changes. i had an idea that capitals and supercapitals should influence the difficulty of how easy or hard it is to take a certain system, just by having them there.maybe having more on-grid field presence will make it so the system is harder to take, or maybe even impossible to take over, just because the defending team have a heavier field presence. of course, this would also be overkill in certain systems, so maybe this should only be allowed in certain systems.that's just a brainfart of my hq idea, and how to balance out the upcoming changes, making it so a bunch of interceptors can't take down a whole grid worth of systems.thanks for reading, o7"
"why should people playing a completely different game, on a completely different system, with no real way for eve players to actually interact with them have anything to do with how we hold sov?by shut down upgrades, do you mean turns off all the ihub stuff? if so, why should losing a dust match kill a titan you happen to have in build, break jumpbridges, disable ratting/mining upgrades and all the rest of it? there is absolutely nothing we. as eve players, can do to stop this.if something affects what i do in eve the counter should be in eve, not in dust."
"please change the 2.5ly jump range to 4ly. there are several areas where you cant move a carrier to a neighboring region without lighting a bunch of cynos to go around or jumping through a gate. as for the gate thing, caps have always had to use cynos to move, jumping gates with them is dumb."
"you haven't provided a reason for the reversal of the nerf. it was a bad nerf, but let's have something other than 'it's dumb'.caps have always had issues with region jumps, using gates is a hell of a lot easier than the old ways of getting dreads into fountain, or anything over the tenal-cobolt edge gap."
"so just use the gate. for those long region jumps jumping through a gate is a heck of a lot more convenient than cynos ever were. sure it changed some dynamics but this is an mmo, things are going to change over time.also, as someone else mentioned, you haven't actually provided a reason for reverting this change other than \"i don't like it\"."
"dear csm 10 and members of new eden,for quite some time now there has been a disparity between the effectiveness of sp invested into turret and sp invested into missiles. i have waited patiently for ~1.5 years since ccp ytterbium said that missile requirements could be a good thing to look at. while i understand that this may be too late to get looked at for the missile rebalance that will likely coincide with the release of the jackdaw, i hope with the csm's help we can fix this issue once and for all in a release soon after.in this topic i will show that a single sp invested into a base missile skill is worth ~1/2 of a single sp invested into a base turret skill. i will also show that a single sp invested into a missile support skill is worth ~1/3 of a single sp invested into a turret support skill. i will end with making some proposed recommendations as to ways to solve this issue. (note: all training times are at 2700sp/hour)first up base skills: speadsheet imageissue: it takes twice as much sp to train all the base missile skills to v as it does to train any one of the turret based weapon systems base skills to v. this means that a single sp invested into a base missile skill is worth ~1/2 of a single sp invested into a base turret skill.second up: specialization skills: spreadsheet imageissue: there isn't one. they all match up! yay!third up support skills: spreadsheet imageissues: not only does it take more sp to train all of the missile support skills (~1.5 mil more sp without controlled burst, and ~1 mil more sp with it), but the missile support skills only apply to a single weapon system. any sp invested into turret support skills is worth three times as much when compared to missile support skills because the turret support skills affect three weapon systems.so what are the overall totals for sp invested? take a look. it turns out that it takes 3.32 mil more, far less effective, sp invested into missiles to get the same effectiveness as you would by maxing a single turret system. something i found interesting is that drones take the least overall sp investment. which is why i didn't make any comparisons between turrets, missiles, and drones.so... what does this all mean? it means don't train missiles. the amount of time and sp you invest into missile training will be better served training any turret based weapon system. in fact, the sp you save will put you well on your way to fully training another turret based weapon system.how do we fix it?what i am hoping you will recommend to ccp will be something similar to this: break up the base turret skills into specialized base skills. for example, break small projectile turrets into small autocannon turret and small artillery turret skillbooks. option a: set the training time for each specialized base turret skill to half of what the generalized skill was. in other words, set small autocannons training time to half of what it took to train small projectile turrets. (doesn't add any training time.) option b: set the training time of the specialized base turret skills to what the generalized skill was. in other words, set small autocannons training time to equal what it took to train small projectile turrets. (doubles the training of the base turret skills.) set the training time of the base missile skills to the training time of the equivalent base turret skill. (if you went with option a you will have to refund excess sp that was spent in missiles. if you went with option b you will have to give away sp like when ccp made racial destroyers/bcs.) that's all pretty quick and easy and solves the issue of single sp invested into a base missile skill being worth ~1/2 of a single sp invested into a base turret skill. solving the issue that a single sp invested into a missile support skill being worth ~1/3 of a single sp invested into a turret support skill will be a little harder and uglier. the best solution could take many forms. here is what i would recommend: unify the turret and missile support skills. essentially have the same support skills apply to both turrets and missiles. a theoretical example of that this may look like. refund excess sp that was invested into either missile or turret support skills.now i am sure that some of you will be quick to note that there are a myriad of differences between missiles and turrets. when i brought up the idea in f&i there were many posts about how missiles always hit, \"rapid\" missile systems don't exist in similar forms for turrets, light and heavy missiles both apply to two sizes of weapons due to the \"rapid\" missile systems, missiles are used on more hulls than any single turret system is, and many more reasons as to why missiles deserve longer training times. it was pretty easy to debunk these as they are not issues with the training times of the weapon systems, but flavor differences between the weapon systems and potential imbalances that should be fixed by buffs or nerfs applied directly to the weapon systems themselves. so i ask you when considering my proposal you understand that what should matter is effectiveness gained by sp investment. the base skills grant you x effectiveness, specialization skills grant you y effectiveness, and support skills grant you z effectiveness. if xyz for missiles equals xyz for projectiles the the cost to acquire xyz should be the same. with your help we can make this a reality. thank you.i will be watching this thread so feel free to post any questions or comments you have."
"reserved for an faq."
"ccp needs to and not replace them with anything. the truth is that leaning implants add nothing meaningful to the game, are a terrible choice to make, encourage risk averse behavior, and removing them from the game would actually improve eve without dumbing eve down.let's start with choices. eve is not a game of choices. if you think eve is a game of choices you are wrong. eve is a game of meaningful choices. that is a huge distinction. a meaningful choice is choice that affects the eve universe beyond yourself. for example the choice to fit an ab instead of an mwd is a meaningful choice. your decision now is going to affect the fight you and others are going to have in a matter of minutes. you decisions during that fight are meaningful choices. what you do after that fight will likely be a series of meaningful choices.learning implants are not a meaningful choice. take any situation: mining, pvp, pve, market trading, etc. place yourself in that situation with another person. ask yourself these simple questions: does that player having no learning implants affect this situation? what if they have a set of +1 implants? +5 implants? under no circumstances does their decision to use learning implants affect your gameplay at all. some of you are going to argue that if you podded said player with +5 implants you would feel good because you destroyed something of high value they had. you will miss the fact that it wasn't the learning implants that affected your gameplay, but the value of those implants. if we set the value to 0 they would have little to no effect at all. learning implants are still not a meaningful choice.clone grades were a choice between losing isk or losing sp. that is a terrible choice to make. ccp rightly removed clone grades from the game because of the poor choice they presented, among other things. learning implants are the exact same choice that was presented in clone grades: lose isk or lose sp. imagine there was a third choice added. this third choice is a \"no change\" choice. so if i offered you the choice between losing your isk, losing your sp, and doing nothing and losing nothing. a majority of people would chose to lose nothing. that may seem a little extreme, but the point is that anytime where the choice of \"do nothing and lose nothing\" is the best choice it should be altered to not be the best choice. in fact the do nothing choice became the only option for clone grades and people rejoiced because a terrible choice was removed.learning implants encourage risk averse gameplay. i have trained many pilots to pvp over the years. one of the biggest issues is that the players, who often don't have lots of isk, would rather stay in highsec where they can use their learning implants to gain skills quickly than pvp or do something where those implants would be at risk. people should be out enjoying the game, creating content for themselves and others. it isn't hard to see that removing learning implants will get more people out into space and doing things in space. one of the biggest arguments to removing clone grades, argued mainly by nullsec and lowsec pvpers, was that a 15+ mil isk clone was enough to get people to not fly small ships. it isn't hard to see why 40 mil isk in two +4 implants is discouraging pvp just as much as clone grades were.ask yourself: if learning implants were removed, and we were given a flat sp/hour that compensated for their removal, would eve be better or worse off? i will argue that it would be better off. a meaningless and terrible choice is no longer present, more people are out doing risky activities while gaining the max sp/hour they can, and more content is generated. there are surprisingly minimal costs to removing learning implants. we lost a few lp store items. i am sure ccp can fix that. other than that... it is all gains. (feel free to let me know if i missed costs.)the bottom line is that eve will be better off if learning implants are removed. i hope ccp can see that removing learning implants is really in the best interest of the game. i ask players that agree to speak to their csm representatives and get them to urge ccp to ."

"situationsupers are imbalanced to game breaking proportions. these ships can have ehp that rivals or surpasses a titan, the dps of a dread and can be spider tanked beyond the levels of a triage carrier all while being e-war immune. furthermore, they<U+FFFD>re the sole ship that can fit the remote ecm burst module. this leads to groups whose sole modus operandi is the super fleet. if ccp truly wishes to make nullsec more vibrant and allow smaller entities to take space, it must be accompanied with a nerf to supers. backgroundin order to give smaller entities a chance at nullsec either the bar must be lowered or the effectiveness of these ships must be addressed. lowering the bar and effectively giving everyone access to nukes, while fun on paper, would not solve the problem. the height of the problem can be illustrated when s2n was disbanded in july of 2013 and lost sov in 209 systems. this was all retaken in 3 days by n3 and their allies with 300 supers. more recently, we watched brave get evicted from their sov in catch by pl. a much large alliance had no recourse against a small to moderate force of supers. assessmentccp has recognized the imbalance of supers and has made numerous passes at correcting the issue. they<U+FFFD>ve nerfed the hp of supers, they<U+FFFD>ve removed regular drones, and most recently they<U+FFFD>ve nerfed jump range across the board for all capitals. coming this summer, they<U+FFFD>re removing sov grinding altogether. ccp understands that a few select groups that hold all the ships that make inhabiting nullsec possible is not conducive with their goals for the game. unfortunately, they<U+FFFD>re dancing around the issue, rather than addressing it directly. recommendationthere<U+FFFD>s an understood balance in the game that a big ship is ineffective against smaller ships. i<U+FFFD>ve read numerous times where a battleship gets left behind in a fleet and gets torn to shreds by frigates. this theme of range of effectiveness has many forms in eve but it<U+FFFD>s a balance of power mechanic that gives eve the rock-paper-scissors ecosystem we all enjoy. supers do not adhere to this. the increased lock time of fighters and fighter bombers is another attempt at correcting this, but this does not fix the issue in fleet engagements. ccp should look into how they can best restore this balance of power so that supers are effective in their role but are not the i win button that they are today. for talking points one could imagine ccp removing the ability of fighter bombers to attack subcaps or a siege like module that would allow a super to deploy their fighter bombers and thus commit to the fight for an amount of time, this module would also remove remote assistance. but i really think this should be addressed by ccp and the community to decide which would be the most balanced way to address the issue. regardless, if ccp is truly working towards making a more vibrant nullsec community, then they must do so with a nerf to supers."

"this is what you said:currently, we pay for the use of skins and vanity items with aur (which can be purchased with isk or real-world money), or with isk from someone who bought it with aur. there are apparently plans to put skins in lp stores, but those aren't shipping right now. not everyone is aware of that.the root of the problem is that your op is ambiguous, which is why telling people to go read it is unhelpful. if i understand you correctly, you're referring to something like scaling the lp+isk cost of a vanity item in a corporation's lp store to the buyer's standing with that corporation. if so, all you have to do is say, \"i was referring to the lp and isk cost from a loyalty point store, not the aur cost from the nes,\" and all the ambiguity goes away.on that subject, ccp has also floated the possibility of pitching the standings system in favor of something else. that doesn't invalidate your idea, but it means that implementation might have to wait for, and be modified to conform to, a new system."
"clearly, being \"a victim\" is more important to you than getting \"the truth\" out.you're neither a threat nor really claiming anything useful.like the worst of conspiracy theorists, you make vague pseudo-claims, back down when pressed, and when pressed further you claim oppression of opinion and postulate that elaboration is on the way.so let's tell it as it is, right?- your opinions aren't oppressed, unless you mean by the weight of counterevidence in the cases i have observed.- your claims of disenfranchisement are based on other things than evidence, and when pressed for evidence, apparently you might consider doing something somewhere, but you're not sure of anything but where this information will not be forthcoming, namely here, where it's relevant.- you explicitly libel or threaten those who asks for evidence for your claims.in short, you're not socially naive as much as a poor manipulator and \"peoples man\", dishonest and only out to promote the \"solution\" that xenuria is elected to the csm. trouble is, the only \"problem\" this could potentially solve is your battered ego.run in csm 11, 12, 13, 14 and n+1, i invite you.it's hilarious to see you flail and fail, and i am sure that you'll get elected somewhere around csm 25, which will soothe the pain of having been rejected all prior elections."
"your argument is logical but ultimately based on false information. i am not dishonest, i am brutally honest. my ego is not important to the csm or to ccp. in fact my ego is not even relevant to the discussion. constantly bringing up \"ego\" as a retort to my platform says more about you and the caricatures you are perpetuated than it does me or my platform. i would also remind you that if you want to accuse me of something as you have a habit of doing than you could at least provide some proof of your claims. you come off as a troll at worst and a well meaning hypocrite at best when you shout for evidence while simultaneous providing none when the burden of proof rests on you to do so. i already cited my sources, were are yours?"
"lie, you refuse to answer questions all the time, or give false information. your \"platform\" is a charicature on its own, so that's not really hard.of course your ego is a part of this, what else would your candidacy ever hope to help?you've failed to answer numerous questions into even the simplest parts of your platform, which is among the reasons why it's not hard to see that you're either a blowhard know-nothing or a fraud, both of which would be easily accounted for by a hurt ego.do i need to reiterate the questions or where people asks for sources, or is it enough to say that the questions have been asked? contrary to you, i can quote specific questions that you have avoided, or rejected, or postulated answered, or simply failings of yours, giant gaps in your knowledge regarding both csm and elections.ahahahahahahahah.oh god, that's rich. after asking for sources for your claims in here several times, you now have the gall to claim you have cited them?no.i saw you cite a single source, that of eve players women make up a specific percentage, and the percentage to my knowledge was true. this is the only thing i've ever seen you citing, and it's a red herring at best.besides, i'm not postulating things outside this thread or your earlier candidacies (such as earlier candidacy videos and threads). what i've done is point out where you don't cite sources, argue against yourself, don't know what you're talking about etc. likewise did a number of other people, some of whom actually tried to improve your platform at which point you called them trolls as well.you're glorious entertainment, and the best weapon against your own relevancy."
"i suppose there is no reasoning with you."
"for that to work, you'd have to use reason, true enough.harsh requirement, i know, but i'm sure gendler souls like nariya will teach you if you ask.be careful though, if you get smarter you might come to realise that being right takes both humility and effort."
"i still have 2-3 kinda important questions that were never answered from the last csm thread"
"an in game asset that you're buying with real life money hence \"out of game purchases\".letting someone buy something cheaper based on in game standings is the same as putting a barrier between people and their money, your penalising someone for not playing one specific aspect of the game, ccp will never do it and for good reason as it's an absurd idea for a business to entertain."
"by that logic plex should cost a flat amount because at present an unfair advantage is giving to people who wish to purchase plex with isk instead of real life money. ship skins are not planned to be an out of game purchase as far as i know, they can be bought with aurum or isk, both of which are ingame commodities. buying isk for irl cash is illegal and considered rmt, so i don't think your argument holds any water."
"except plex is a flat rate, everyone ingame buys it for the selling price, adn anyone can buy it at that price at any given time, no one gets a magical 10% off for standingsand plex bought with real cash is the same price for everyone, because no one gets an arbitrary discount that no one else gets access to simply because they played one part of the game a whole lot.so yeah, plex is a flat price out of game, and a fluctuating price ingame, but its a price that is equal to everyone, no one has any 0's added or subtracted from the number.were saying your proposal would create an imbalance, because, again using the plex example, someone with security standings between 0-5 gets 5% off plex purchases, and people with security standing 5-10 get 10% off, people with low security status would be put at a real world disadvantage against people who have a higher security standing, because a commodity would be given magical discounts to people who played a certain aspect of the game and not others. so for every plex a pirate could buy to fund his pvp, a mission runner could buy 1.1 plex, which means the mission runner is the one determining the standard for plex sales, adn the pirate gets no say, because he is at an inherent market disadvantage that can only be circumvented by spending more real life cash than his opponent for the same number of commodoties.basically your proposal creates a situation of \"pay to win\" or to more specific \"pay less to win\", and penalizes group's out of game purchasing abilities based on their ingame playstylenow if you simply want to argue discounts on lp/isk items only, discounts not applying to cash based purchases, then we have a workable idea. and if that is the case please make it understood clearly in the op to avoid further confusion.********** but please, i ask of you, your csm thread is not the place to break down and discuss individual ideas, if you would kindly take your proposals, make individual f&i threads for them, or contribute to existing threads when necesary, then link your post in your op statement to show your support for individual ideas that we can then view for discussion within the appropriate forum, that would be nice. it will allow your csm thread to remain clean and orderly, and entirely focused on the actual act of attempting election, rather than specific details of each proposal."
"so i've been considering this for a while and am surprised i have yet to see it brought up to the csm or even for discussion. a quick search yielded no results.this is a proposal to the community to see if anyone would be interested, besides myself, in a column added to the market window under buy and sell orders that displayed the name of the character / corporation that placed the order.in the current system, the orders on the market are anonymous. in order to see who is selling or buying certain items, you would have to buy or sell at least 1 of a certain item. this is not too much of a problem on small priced items, but on larger ones, it can be unrealistic.as of now, i see no value in the anonymity factor except for that of market manipulators, who usually tend to profit heavily off of the average player.why do i think eve should show who is placing the orders?- it adds accountability to not only the marketplace, but in the entire economy of eve.- it also adds to the value of namesake for an individual, corporations, and alliances alike involved in industry.- you'd be able to see obvious market manipulations and who was behind them, possibly choose to attempt to not support it/them.- possibility to lower the amount of market manipulation.- it aligns it with the rest of the current marketplace namely the contract system, character trading, etc... in which all display the party initiating the transaction.- potential for more strategy / tactics in pvp & industry by easily being able to identify targets, supply lines, & economic warfare, industrial warfare, etc... adding to the sandbox effect.- seems like a reasonable and attainable request for some future patch if ever supported.why not? although i did think up a few potential cons, i'd rather hear from the eve community on what possible cons they believe there to be for this proposal.regards,oslo"
"you know that, currently, you can't pick and choose which orders to buy from? you always buy from the cheapest, and sell to the one with the highest buy price, regardless of the price you actually set."
"of course. and i do not propose any change to that mechanic.i believe your reply is referring to the following statement:\"you'd be able to see obvious market manipulations and who was behind them, possibly choose to attempt to not support it/them.\"if that is the case, then i didn't mean to imply that someone would be able to choose who to buy from/sell to, but simply when to buy or sell. time is one of the most integral factors in the market.example:you're in the market for a new ship. you go to jita or the nearest hub and check the market. you either choose to buy from the lowest sell order or be patient, place and a buy order waiting for it to fill.in the current system, if you were not in a rush or had no care for spending isk, then you'd probably just buy the ship. if you were a little more isk conscientious, then you may choose to place a buy order or even wait for the prices to drop. in anycase, you still have the choice of when you purchase an item or place a buy order.if you choose to place a buy order, then your best bet for information is the price history table/graph to tell if the item is over or underpriced.if there were names displayed, then there is another source of intel/information to play off of. you would theoretically be able to gauge if the market seems somewhat normal, or manipulated.for instance if one name or corporation was attached to the 10 lowest sell orders, or if one name was attached to the highest 10 buy orders, you could choose not to compete with that entity by simply not placing a buy order higher or not placing/adjusting a sell order to below their price. this not only helps the average player, but also adds flavor to marketeers.now, just to note, i understand how easy it would be to combat this by using numerous alts. this proposal is not meant to cure any single problem that exists like market manipulation. it is meant simply as another tool or access to information that i believe should be public. the current system of anonymity makes no sense to me or does not seem to serve any real purpose, except that of protecting market manipulation.also, like stated before, it seems like an easy change (comparatively) to implement and wouldn't take programmers/developers away from more important issues like pvp changes.- oslo"
"i would love to see this. it would add depth to the market and stimulate interaction between marketeers. definite +1."
"surely you'd just find out the names of a bunch of market alts with no connection to whoever their main happens to be?"
"you would see patterns and would then be more inclined to start researching which corp they belonged to etc. what reason is there not to do it?"
"i don't disagree that there is some information that could be garnered from this, but it is pretty limited. especially against those doing many of the things you would probably be looking for. player name would only work for those traders who use a single character to work the market. corp name could provide a more aggregate view related to a player or group working in concert through multiple characters, but i think this quickly gets buried by the fact that so many trade alts are from npc corps. could it provide some information, sure. enough to matter? probably not. would it be a big deal to program from the developer's standpoint? no.the bigger question would be: is this more information than should be available publicly and in real time? when you make a transaction in the stock market, individuals don't know who they bought from or sold to. it is a brokered transaction. institutional investors see who is buying and selling, but even there it can be disguised to some extent.i'm not entirely adverse to the suggestion here, but given the shady nature of eve from a gameplay perspective, i highly doubt the developer would view market transparency as something they would choose to endorse.before they ever get to this, i would prefer that they fix what steve was describing. you do always buy from the lowest seller, but you don't always pay the lowest price. if, because of volume reasons you select a higher price, you buy from that seller along with all the sellers at prices below him. however, you end up paying the higher price for everything. seems a little silly, but perhaps its just a feature. doesn't work that way on the sell side, but v0v"
"its coming"
"rumour has it that the svipul is getting power grid nerfed in regard of some people using a 10mn afterburner on it.i can agree that using a 10mn afterburner on a \"small\" vessel is silly. but it does not come without having to offline other modules or skip a gun or shield extender, or spend alot of isk for a good implant to be able to have a complete fit which meet up with the demand of the capsuleer pilot.anyhow, with my current setup i have 6.5 powergrid left, and i think that it would be a bad thing to reduce the powergrid at all or to much because then you would not be able to have a decent fit anymore.linking my svipul setup for reference: highslot: 6x 280mm howitzer artillery ii. medslot: limited 1mn mwd, 2x tracking computer ii, medium azeotropic ward salubrity i. lowslot: 2x gyrostabilizer ii, micro auxilliary power core ii, nanofiber interal structure ii. rigs: 3x small core defence field extenter i.also pay notice to the fact that i am using a +5 powergrid implant and a micro auxilliary power core ii (which is not apart of the ships powergrid from the start). i also have the skill powergrid management at lvl 5 (25% bonus to powergrid).powergrid implant: inherent implants 'squire' power grid management eg-605as much as i can agree on its wrong to be able to fit a 10mn afterburner to this ship, i find as wrong to render the ship into something useless and not so \"tactical\" as the ship is supposed to be.so my proposition is as follows:make the differently sized afterburner and microwarpdrives locked for specific ship classes/sizes.1mn ab/mwd for frigates, destroyers and other smaller vessels i haven't mentioned.10mn ab/mwd for cruisers, battlecruisers, haulers and other medium sized vessels i haven't mentioned.100mn ab/mwd for battleships and bigger.this would really make the game more balanced without gimping ships in themselves, and least it would resolve this issue with small ships fitting oversized modules on them which means there will be no need to tweak ships in regards of this dilemma/problem and thereby riscing to render them into something really bad.on the contrary to this proposal, the fitting concept of eve online would be quite boring if you would not be able to experiment with different sized modules (shield extenders, armor plates and so on) on various ships and sizes. so my proposal for this module size restriction is only in relation to \"active speed modules\". this is only because a 10mn ab svipul does about the same speed as a 1mn mwd svipul, but the difference there will be no signature increase due to ab used instead of mwd, good luck with tracking that on the other hand you could always adapt your fleet composition to counter this issue with specific ships that has long range webifying, target painting and energy neutralizing. which in my opinion is what is so awesome about eve online, you can do anything if you just put some effort into it.the big question is, do we want to have a open universe where more is possible, or where most things are strictly controlled and less innovative to play around with...none the less if changes has to be made, i find it better to limit the different sized active speed modules to specific ship sizes than gimping each ship in themselves in a general notice (the svipul was only used as example), with the risc of rendering ships into something less able to reach a decent fit best regards // murkelost"
"please use the correct thread for tactical destroyer feedback. thank you."
"x amount of years ago changes were made to disallow ships to have anything but ammo, scripts etc in their cargohold while being stashed away in a capital ships ship maintenance bay. reason for this was because at that time regular carriers were beneficially used as \"haulers\" and commonly used for transporting vast amounts of high end ore out of 0.0 to the safe space of empire (how safe it might be... ;) ).anyhow, since the scenery of capabilities that comes along with a capital these days in regard of jump fatigue and a limited jumprange, i would like to propose for this limit of what to store in the cargohold of a ship stored in a ship maintenance bay to be revoked.since jumpfreighters are present they fold a much more favourable task for doing logistic work as well.my reason behind this proposition is simply because it would be quite nice to have your secondary modules in the specific subcapital ships cargohold, instead of having to mix it along with the capitals secondary modules in fleet hangar, as well as with every other subcaps modules.just a thought..."
"closed."
"that's a strawman argument and you know it. nothing in game has any effect what so ever on the $19.95 plex price, just regular deals available to everyone simultaneously."
"you just made my argument for me. thanks."
"there is not enough inter-corp aggression as a result of market interaction. i think that seeing the same corp(s) day after day competing with your orders and 0.01 isking you would lead to greater interaction of the shooty kind. again, why not? you already see who the contracting entity is in the contract system. this is similar."
"i would like to know where we are on the margin trading scams discussions at this point in time. i see we all have been talking about this for years and i for one believe it is now time that the talk stops and action is taken. will there be a perfect solution? no. however, the best solution to this problem will be any solution. eve players will adapt. everyone fears change but we will adapt. this problem is a game mechanic exploit. i for one want the csm to fully look into this and come up once and for all a understanding of exploits vs scamming. which one is worth having in the game? next i would like to see a solution. no sitting on your thumbs and listen to all the complainers of omg this will happen and this will happen. always remember eve players will adapt. i really don't care if we remove margin trading altogether. i really don't care if you colorize the buy order as purple for margin buying. do something that will kill this horrible exploit and make the markets integrity strong again. something that should be a constant in the market is integrity. ccp runs the market we just play in it."
"how much did you get taken for?"
"nope.you do not get to remove one of the cornerstones of the game's economy just because you're too dumb to do your homework before getting greedy."
"the margin trading scam is barely a scam. there is nothing there that couldn't be reproduced by someone just canceling or beating you to an order. margin trading is too important to the eve economy to remove on a whim. i wouldn't be adverse to some solution that doesn't break the trading servers while leaving the functionallity of the skill intact, but really csm, please spend your energies on more important things than this."
"first off, i love this game. i have been playing since 06. i have seen many exploits and bugs and what not. i believe this is an important matter. to say it isn't would be foolish. i hold ccp to a higher standard than any other gaming company. they have created a great landscape for us. i see ccp as the overseer and or the central bank of the eve market. when the overseer doesn't believe its important to address an issue that is clearly an exploit but then allows everyone to do it . why do we need to obey the other eula terms. i mean this is drastic thinking but it sets a bad precedence. does this exploit need to be addressed? yes. if we have margin trading then i for one and many others would love to have a margin call. freeze assets until the bill is paid. that is harsh but its a start to another lengthy discussion. there may be other pressing matters like what is coming this summer. the market hasn't seen any love for a while now. i just want a fair trade agreement in high security space. null sec can be as ruthless as they want to be. in high security space this should not stand. we have rules in high security space. take your scamming to low sec or null. come let us reason together."
"either you've just changed your stance or you don't understand what you're saying.there should not be any discounts for people with higher in game standings than people without, exactly how it is now."
"your not very good at this. you need to pick an argument and stick with it."
"might be, if you follow your own advice, this csm bid will crawl closer to the finishing line.swapping arguments like you're doing; first that things you buy with rl money (and perhaps later with isk) should receive a discount - then when others asks you to explain it won't - then when others follow the argument to its logical conclusion call it off topic - then deny that buying cosmetic items (for rl money) has anything to do with buying plex (for rl money) - then then somehow manages to to reverse course underway, such that no ingame action should impact the price you pay in rl money.xenuria, you're arguing against yourself and claiming that it defeats other peoples arguments.ship skins and other cosmetic items are currently entering the game through rl money expenditure, represented by aurum. you argue that ingame standings should give a discount when you purchase cosmetic items from associated factions. that would give a rl money discount to a specific gameplay.others have asked you, very specificly, if you meant with isk/lp purchases alone.that would save your arguments entirely, yet you have not said so and you haven't responded to their posts. one might hazard the guess that it's because it isn't solely isk/lp purchases you mean, hence some confusion.personally, i had expected you to wait a few pages more before denouncing your own platform, but i guess your campaigning \"skill\" is a zero-sum game. when you improve your op, you make a hackjob of the later posts."
"i support this!"
"+1 to this"
"eve was never designed for capitals, the whole reason they die left and right in eve is because they have been nerfed to the point where anything can kill them, killing them isnt some incredible feat, and the reason there are so many is because they were originally made to be rare powerhouses that cemented empirescapitals should just go, until a decade when eve is at the point where ships themselves are dynamic enough that something thats as powerful as a capital is supposed to be, can be introduced without fear of mass production or total dominance. but lets face it, short of an alliance being required to foot a material and isk maintenence bill for every ship they can field, theres no reason to not make masses of whatever is the strongest.the problem with capitals can be traced abck to the fact eve is a game about the individual, there is no literal such thing as corps, or alliances, or coalitions, everything in measured on the individual, and made to allow the individual to empower themselves, which means there is no scaling disadvantage to creating a massive sprawling empire bloated with insurmountable numbers, because it isnt a bloated entity dragged down by its own logistics, its a collection of individuals all equally empowered and capable within the game mechanics, lending mechanics to enforce n+1 in every regard, not just combat, because outside missions with a set pay, there is little (and often times less) wasted potential with a venture no matter how many you stack into it.and on that basic prinicple of eve's design, capitals are an impossible dream, no matter what form they are in, unless mechanics dictate they are powerless and only good with 1 or 2 of each type on field at once, they will always be mass produced until they receive another class wide nerf. and changing them to anything other than what they currently are in respect to roles will just make them even bigger cammand ships, making cammand ships no longer worth their price for function."
"let us reason together: margin trading is as vital a tool for trading as tackling is for pvp. 99%+ of margin trades are not scams, andthe scams are as easy to spot as a ggate camp on an outgate."
"i never said it was not vital. i agree it is vital part of the economy. i want to know when and where are we going to get a fix to this exploit. where is the game mechanic that lets the little guy file suit for false promotion of pricing. where are my space attorneys. lol. i feel a statement needs to be made by ccp on this. acknowledge that its an exploit and anyone caught doing it then gets the two strike rule. why don't they do that? it would take too much man power. if that takes too much man power then this problem is bigger than we really understand. do you not agree? i would like the csm to address this issue seriously. come up with a fix to this exploit. i will be shrugged off because i was scammed or whatever. i am looking out for the newbs. many people have quit and never came back because of simple things like this. the market needs to be solid not ran by a bunch of people who are untrustworthy. ccp runs the market. i hope they do the right thing by coming up with a solution. don't listen to the trillionaires listen to the little guys who made them trillionaires. wars are fought over isk. lets hit the pocket books and see if they can fight a clean fight. i mean come on lets get our hands dirty and see what we can come up with."
"it's not an exploit"
"if you feel the need to prevent the false promise of pricing on the market, i'd like to hear you thoughts on the false promise of see selling you a navy issue megathron when i open a trade window with you.as the good malcanis has said; it's not an exploit. you believe the market to be full of promises - that's your mistake."
"if you decide to invest in and make use of the market, you should be aware of the true price of items you may deal in.this means gathering information on the item, before going ahead with any investment you may make.if people run headlong into a deal and invest before gathering information that is readily available, then the fault falls squarely on themselves if things go wrong.the funny thing with this scam, is it relies upon the greedy, the ones thinking they are going to have one over on another player. they see quick easy money to be made off someone else. the kicker is it's a game of pvp and they soon find they didn't do their homework, were out manoeuvred and ended up losing to the other player.no order is guaranteed. none. so when playing the market the more information you gather, the less chance there is of losing isk. but it's the market and there will always be a chance of losing isk.tl:dr. stop being bad at pvp in the market and if you lose to other players, stop whining about it.oh and it's not an exploit. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"was the question posed to the op in the very first reply too difficult to understand? this might not be c&p but we still want details."
"ccp rise feedback request - margin trading and accurate market uinow is this not an exploit? not calling an exploit not an exploit is ridiculous. come on folks. stop focusing on staying the same and brushing it aside. lets come together and fix this once and for all. bring some pain to those who want to put big buy orders and not want to pay. the risk should work both ways not in favor of the buyer."
"he said that it exploits the mechanic, much like an oil company exploits an oil deposit. he didn't say that margin trading scams *were* exploits."
"it's no more an exploit than suicide ganking is.which means it isn't an exploit. it's just \"creative use of the mechanics\" to prey on the greedy and dumb.oh... myyyyy...you do know that people routinely game the market system... right? by...- buying up all available orders and then putting them back up at prices 10% higher than before... - or by cornering a market within a given area... - or by blowing up any competition (you do know that some of the biggest funders of code and several other \"well known\" merc groups are other industrialists and traders, right?)... - some combination of the above (see: goonswarm's ice interdiction policy some years ago).market \"integrity\" in eve is decided by how big your wallet is or by how much you can blow up.no... no they don'tthey can set how many minerals are required for building something... how much lp and isk you need for that \"special thing\"... and can decide drop rates...but how much those minerals are worth is up to the players.how much that lp (or item) is worth is up to players.how much a player's time is worth to them is decided by the players.and here's the best part... it's all more or less subjective.there are miners out there who think that the minerals they earn are free. that's why so many miners just sell their rocks well below the average price.there are industrialists who just want to unload their stock... and they don't care about taking a loss because the demand of their product is already quite low and won't recover due to the massive stockpiles that other players have (this is why procurers often sell for less than their mineral value).ccp don't \"run the market.\" they just keep it online and let (more or less) pure libertarian economics do what it does best; make as much money as possible, be damned of the consequences to \"lesser people.\""
"you can exploit something that isn't an exploit. when i gank an afk miner, i am exploiting the fact that that player is too lazy to pay attention to his ship, but my actions are not using an exploit as i am engaging in legal gameplay. if i evade concord after that gank however, then i am using an exploit and will face sanction from ccp for exploiting a loophole in the game to escape the consequences intended by the developer. ccp rise is using exploit in the first sense in that sentence. ccp rise has already looked at this and the lack of action means there is likely no easy solution to the issue. removing the skill is a no-go, and any solution to link orders and current escrow amounts is not technically feasible due to the massive overhead it would require recalculating every margin order after every transaction from what i understand. what else do you propose ccp to do then? the scammer already loses the fees and increasing them for failed margin orders will really only hurt legitimate overextended traders as the scammer has plenty of profit margin to play with."
"the issue here is that the client (via the market interface) is essentially lying to the player by showing an order which can't actually be filled.i really think no one cares that the eve client is broken. at least colorize the margin trade orders."
"it doesn't lie to you.your greed does."
"really? it doesn't lie. after a person from ccp says the client lies then everyone dismisses it as not a lie. anyone else out there want to fix this or am i the only one."
"half the things in the client are a lie (see: jita local). we are all well aware of the creative use some players make of the margin trading skill to post misleading orders. ccp rise has acknowledged it as well as you linked so ccp is also well aware of the phenomenon. do you actually have a proposal to fix it? or are you just here to complain about how you can sometimes lose at a pvp game when someone with a better understanding of the mechanics outsmarts you?"
"^ this.another example; you see that ship you are flying? it does not actually exist according to the server. all the server sees is a sphere. your ship literally has no front or back until you move.so whatever \"direction\" your ship visually has is nothing more than an approxamation (sometimes not even that in the case of big ship as they will often warp \"sideways\")... so you cannot always rely on visual ques to know where you are heading.as for seeing a margin scam... it's pretty easy. just cross reference the prices on eve central... or look for historical trends on the ingame market window (no history is a red flag)most importantly, if it looks like you will be able to make any significantly high margin (more than 5%) by buying and selling in the same station... it is probably a scam."
"sigh, no point dealing with a troll i guess, you seem to have no interest in having a rational conversation so i'm withdrawing from the conversation entirely."

"ok so soon we will have had much of the promised stuff done, corps, starbases and much more, so personally i would rather ccp take a few months with a big team once the big stuff is done and finish this feature. as i understand it was quite far along, but the deployment of the feature was too slow and underwhelming and with that it meet with much criticism (a riot in jita ), but with the new dev cycle i dont see having a big team on this to get it to deployment as an issue. there are many people who still dream of their space bar, or being able to have a corp or alliance meeting in an office on a space station somewhere. plus with the new structures promised being able to walk about them would be a nice bonus, having to go to a command center to take control of the weapons would be very cool, or have a situation room where you can plan and command battles that kinda thing would be fun."
"i endorse this product and/or service.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
"i think it can be solved much easyer..if you bought a implant and your pod is destroyed:>>you will have a copy in your clonebay to be used again , i think that would be a much more smarter thing to do in that case you keep the market going and you will have more choices for the next clone in the clone bayand you are not affraid of losing 800 + mil of isk the next time ,so pvp can be more atractive for the people who dont pvp because of that..so taking the pvp \"willingness\" away from the clone... improves the game and yes i am a miner in hs > and refuse to get killed in low (because of the expensive cloon stuff),and yes this game is very boring for me to ...so this is a good topic ..but ccp is not intrested in this kind of behaviour or topicsit is so called player driven they say , ...but it is not...they make money on it so they keep it this way ..but also a lot of people disapear from the game after a while and thats true tofor me personaly my last goal is on the way (own build charon) ,and after that there is none (for me in hs) annymore so i guit perhaps to as a miner (also called carebear) i refuse to get blown up in low with my expensive clone in it"
"rather than removing my options, why don't we increase your options?"
"do we really need to have a method to speed up learning? especially ones that benefit the oldest and richest players? why not just flatten it out and find new uses for implant slots?"
"if learning implants are going to stay i very much like the idea of moving them to slots 7-9. it is the interference with pirate sets that bothers me most. learning drugs would be great but this does favour rich players."
"how do learning drugs intrinsically favour rich players?"
"because they will be high demand items that will have an isk cost. someone like me can buy millions of them and keep them stocked in stations everywhere to stay boosted 24/7.new players probably won't even know they exist and will have to choose between learning faster or buying another atron.and unlike current implants, you can't save money just by playing more carefully. a new player who is very alert won't lose their +3s because they won't get podded in hisec/lowsec. in your booster system the new player will always run out, whereas rich players will never run out."
"how do they not? either they are expensive enough that players need to consider whether they are worth the isk which favors the wealthy, or they are so cheap that they just become mandatory and everyone uses them without thinking. the later case adds nothing but busy work to the game, while the former favours the wealthy. there needs to be some trade off to using them to make the choice meaningful and isk is not the best choice as it favours established players."
"i originally liked the idea of boosters, but the problem i see is the general message to the players. pay $$$ subscription and get a running skill queue. pay or grind and get a faster queue. this is far better than pay or grind more and unlock the fun, but still not good imo."
"you ran into your own law on this one, malc."
"i have removed a rule breaking post and those quoting it.the rules:8. use of profanity is prohibited. the use of profanity is prohibited on the eve online forums. this includes the partial masking of letters using numbers or alternate symbols, and any attempts at bypassing the profanity filter. isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"
"you can quote and misquote him if you wish, it still doesn't help your cause. why you may ask? well because once it was explained to him, he dropped it like a hot potato. you see the market lies about every order, as none of them are ever guaranteed. none. so if any change is required, i would say it is to inform pilots of that fact.but that is quite frankly, irrelevant. because that is not your issue here. your issue is that fact that you judged a single buy/sell order, as reflecting the true price of an item. if you had taken the time to gather more information of it's true value, you wouldn't then have paid over the odds for said item.this is what happened:a. there you were, looking at someone offering a good price for an item and it just so happened someone else was selling that item for less. you thought 'lol, someone's really dropped a clanger and i could make some quick easy money here, off the back of some poor clueless pilot'. you then bought said item for an inflated price and the buy order failed. well if ever someone counted chickens before they were hatched, you did. as no order is ever guaranteed. so there you are, left with over priced goods. which you can still sell at a loss, so that's a bonus. i guess.this is what should have happened:b. you saw someone offering a good price for an item and it just so happened someone was selling it for less. you should have then thought, 'oh, i could make some isk here, let me check to see if that buy and sell order reflects the true value of that item.'after checking you would have said to yourself, 'oh dear, some muppet is going to fall for that, if they don't do the proper checks.' or even bought the item far cheaper elsewhere and still tried to sell it to the buy order. just for giggles.but you went with a and then topped it off with a forum whine, just to show everyone how bad you are at market pvp.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"i would love to understand why i am being attacked for trying to get something done about the margin trading scam or fraud as the case may be. whether i was scammed or not it does not matter whatsoever. i really do not understand the way a faction of eve players value fraud. you can try to divide and conquer me all you want. i will not back down on this issue. when a buy order is up and has a price. the toon or corp. which placed that buy order should pay. they should pay by losing isk or loss of standings or loss of skill points to the margin trading skill. in rl there are severe penalties for margin trading fraud. in eve there is no risk for doing so whatsoever. no risk to cheat the market and the newbs. to me that is unacceptable. i really find it horrendous that we have people in this forum that want nothing to do with fixing a scamming/fraud problem. there is something so blatant in this thread that needs to be looked at. oh this guy is butt hurt cause he got scammed. no, i didn't get scammed. it was pure and simple fraud. fraud is not acceptable in any known market except in eve. that is a problem.i am asking an begging any csm member who reads this to please look at this problem. look at it closely and understand that its the client that needs to be fixed. i don't want the margin trade skill gone. i believe it is good for the game. the eve client needs to represent truth."
"the lack of sympathy you find here is because the margin trading scam is not some exploit that allows another player to sneak into a new player's wallet and steal their isk as you seem to want to portray it. the scam is basically just false advertising, similar to many other scams out there that attempt to trick a mark into making a poor trade decision by confusing, misleading or lying to a player about the value of a particular trade good. it is the player's greed that blinds them the risks of buying some module they have never heard of to sell for a quick profit, or at a price way above the historic value (which the client provides accurately). tricking a player like this is not an exploit my friend, that is market pvp.the problem with increasing penalties is that it hurts legitimate users of the margin trading skill. whenever i trade on margin (which is most of the time as with all serious traders) i already am careful about straying too close to my limit as failed orders are penalized by loss of my broker fees. if you added some punitive penalty it would hurt more market traders than any scammers, but the real problem is what will you say if the margin trade scammer accepts the consequence of the punishment? if some penalty was put in place and you, or someone like you, fell for the scam six months down-the-line, you will come to the forums complaining that the penalties are not tough enough as you managed to still get scammed (just like all those people that lose an overloaded transport ship coming here to demand more \"consequences\" for suicide gankers). and the cycle would continue until the margin trading skill was unusable. i have no problem with adding more information to the client to help traders identify potential problem orders. if 3 years from now ccp decides that they want to completely re-write the market trading system, i would have no objection to colour-coding orders that were made on margin, or that lacked enough isk to cover if they can do that. for now though, everything ccp said has indicated this is not technically possible, and even if it was, it really should be a low priority for developer resources since there are plenty of other ways to trick people into thinking something is worth more than it is."
"because \"fraud\" is in the eye of the beholder.from my perspective... you are removing money from people with more greed and money than intelligence. and you gain intelligence through experience. and you gain experience by going through the situation it yourself. and then you realize that the \"horrible thing\" that happened to you actually made you think, act, and behave smarter. because there is always another such \"horrible thing\" around the corner.(for disclosure: i fell for the margin scam early in my eve life... i now look very closely at anything i buy and sell rather than \"right-click, done\")this isn't real life.the context of eve is a dystopia. it's not meant to \"work right\" or be \"fair.\" it's meant to be an exercise in darwinism. and the market is probably the closest you will ever get to a \"pure\" libertarian market model... which expresses that darwinism mantra very well. i mean seriously... the game is full of megacorporations and empires stripmine \"lush and verdant moons\" to construct massive supercapital ships... sometimes with slave labor... to wipe out hundreds of thousands of ships in single engagements... each ship with crews numbering from the dozens to the thousands... all the while rival factions within each megacorporation and empire send in pirates to shoot and assassinate at each other... or commandeer one of the aforementioned supercapitals and pile drive it into a station to destroy any chance of peace talks... while another faction simply goes out hunting for victims on the spacelanes and literally drain their bodies of blood for ritual sacrifices... and you, the mighty immortal... a being given power through implants that are not even designed for your physiology... a being that is designed to wage war, conflict, and amass wealth in the hopes you will work on behalf of your empire... slaughter all of them wholesale... before making a mistake and losing several thousand of your crew... whose families will never be notified or paid any compensation... because **** you, you have more important matters to look into... like buying a new battleship...*breathes*oh... there is a risk. there is always a risk.however that risk is dependent on other players actually understanding what it is you are doing. and most people don't have a mind for economics... much less economics with few rules or restrictions.but yeah... there are ways to throw a wrench into a market manipulator's plans. and there are ways you can screw over a margin scammer. you just have to understand the rules and toss any rl notions of \"morality\" or \"ethics\"...... which, frankly, have no place in a game. all that matters are the \"rules\" and \"spirit\" of the game, in the context of the game itself.we'll agree to disagree here. some of the best stories of eve are where one person screws over a whole mass of people. or a whole mass of people burn everything \"just cause.\"examples:the end of bobthe end of goonswarm v1the eve intergalactic bank scamsocratic's downfallthe first revenant killgoonswarm ice interdictionhulk-a-geddonpos-a-geddonthe game needs less \"free intel\" and give more opportunities for people to scam and cause more conflict. because conflict is fun!!"
"if rule 1 of eve is \"don't fly what you can't afford to lose\" then rule 2 is \"if it looks too good to be true then it probably is.\"this goes for bait ships, op ships (they'll get nerfed sooner or later), and strangely lucrative looking market orders."
"scams are fraud, so yes, you got scammed. that you keep ranting without sharing the juicy details of the story makes me think we're talking in excess of 10 billion.any chance of the scammer coming forward and telling this riveting tale?"
"no, that is eve.you got greedy and didn't gather all the relevant information, before making an investment. you still have the goods, but paid way more than their true value. no one but you is to blame. suck it up.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"i feel like your head would explode if you knew about fractional reserve banking irl...the real world revolves around margin stuff just like eve does. for traders it's nice not to have 30% of your capital tied to orders that might not fill for weeks.if you do 30 seconds of research, you'll see that it's probably a scam of some sort.then you're mad about not having any repercussions, well there's nobody stopping you from hiring a merc to deal with the person. you could just as easily go after them yourself.ccp won't do anything about this \"broken\" mechanic because there is nothing broken about it."
"i took the liberty of fixing your post."
"in eve, if it looks too good to be true, not only is it definitely too good to be true, but you are about to take it up the keister if you don't move out with a quickness.eve is not a game of fair, with the single exception of everyone gets to play by the same set of rules. how i use those rules to screw you over, kill your ship, steal your loot, and deprive you of your economic opportunities. however, is completely open, and i in no way obliged to treat you with honesty, respect, or any sense of ethical consideration.you are a victim, waiting for the axe to fall, until you come to terms with that.(it took me three years to figure that out, and i still ocassionally get butt plowed when i leap before i look).eve is like an addiction; you can't quit it until it quits you. also, iderno"
"and the continuation of climbing the ladder begins again...."
"no, you're just upset over some pixels."
"hand up everyone in this thread who personally discussed this issue with ccp rise face to face and can therefore claim equal understanding of his intentanyone...?bueller? anyone?"
"as an advancing player in eve online, i have often wondered why there is not an option to pay to have your skill points reset, allowing a player to respend already trained skill points.this would allow one to change play styles and reduce the amount of time it takes to go from one style of game play to another.basicly for a fee of $30.00 to as much as $60.00 once every 30 days, a player could log into their account management website, and pay to have all their skill points reset. except for the basic skill points a fresh character starts with, all current trained skill points would be removed from skills allowing the player to log in and re spend his or her points to the desired skills they wish to have benefits from.as training skills is a matter of time, and money, starting out a player may want to try a bit of everything before they narrow down on a game style path. being able to rest and re spend those skill points no longer going to be used will save them more time and allow them to move along quickly into their new choices.i would gladly pay to have this done. as i have chosen to step away from mission running to go into industrial aspects of the game.would love to hear feedback from others and hope those who can make this happen see it's value."
"because this is eve, where your choices have consequences.if the meta changes from the current sentry ishtars and rail tengus to something more like pulse legions and arty lokis, then it should not take a <U+FFFD>15 payment to ccp to immediately change my skills from a perfect tengu pilot to a perfect legion pilot with absolutely no effort on my part.if you make the choice to train tengus over legions in this situation, then you reap the consequences when the meta shifts."
"this is a terrible idea for many reasons but the most simplest is that it makes skill choices inconsequential. allowing a respec, even for a monetary cost, would remove any individuality from characters as any 60m sp character is exactly the same as any other. if it were to happen it would have to be in a limited form (not a complete reset) and at a penalty like 2:1 or 3:1 sp exchange. personally, i think the value of the individuality and history of each character is more important than some impatient player moving a few million sps around. if you want a new skill focus, start a new account/character or just head to the character bazaar and pick one up."
"how about if i could pay $30 to have all your skill points randomised?"
"i understand, the aspects of your disagreement.but unlike most mmo's, a character going from one aspect of the game to a whole new aspect has little to no effect on the actual character itself. as the player still remains the same.as far as tech 3 ships go, if you don't hybrid then your just an idiot to begin with. as any good pilot in eve knows choices are key when it comes to missions and to pvp.limiting oneself to just one class of ships is kinda not worth it. when there are advantages to training and skilling all 4 classes.by that i mean amarr, caldari, gallente, and minmatar class ships."
"but eve is not real life, and as such, is just a game.it's no different than training a paladin in world of warcraft, find out you hate being a tank, pay out the gold to have your talents reset and respec your character to holy.if you don't wish to pay to change your skills around, then don't.but for those who would wish to try a new avenue of the game without the hours and hard earned cash they have already paid out go to waist to train a new character or to blow isk to buy someone elses character, then paying to have your trained skill points reset becomes valid.it has little to no real consequence to either ccp or the community on a whole. it's another source of revenue for them."
"can you exp;lain why you feel that choices made in a game that is all about the consequences of your actions should carry no consequences?"
"one, the client doesn't currently support his, nor does the new skins system seem to support actually changing the model on a ship.also creating or adjusting models is a lot of work, and creates more work for every new ship skin they create, so it's impractical for them to make different versions of every ship for every player who happens to not like a new model (or an old one, or whatever)."
"yeah, what they said. boosters would presumably be reasonably expensive or they would just be a default (no choice). so people who can afford to pay for a continuous supply are effectively trading isk for sp."
"none of the above. why? because the fix to your problem is already available.like i said earlier, if any change is required, it's to inform pilots that no order is guaranteed.what you are asking for, is a way that means those greedy lazy types, don't get caught out by their own actions, or should i say lack of. you're asking for the removal of consequences, when they try and screw over other market players and it backfires, due to their incompetence.but judging by your lack of understanding of the current mechanics, i doubt that even a warning would have helped you. you would still be here, informing us of just how bad you are at the game. if there was ever a time a corp name was apt, this is it.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"cmon keep attacking me. when there is smoke there is fire."
"the game doesn't need fixing. player ignorance needs fixing. that's what ccp needs to fix. to be fair, the margin trading skill doesn't explain that margin trades will fail on empty wallets. ccp doesn't need to explain the consequence of it; merely the facts. let players piece things together themselves."
"as it seems not many in this thread like what i am trying to do. the basic, mere basic of risk is one sided on this issue. when i say one sided i mean there is 0 risk for the buyer when done correctly. 0 risk for the buyer. his name isn't given out, he is protected. no one knows who he is. there can be no retaliation against him. he is more protected than anyone else in this game. call me greedy all you want but the guys doing the buy orders with ultimate protection are just as greedy as anyone else in this game. the buyer has 0 risk against them. the person many of you are defending has no risk in this game. we all talk a good game about risk but risk should go both ways. i want to know who is screwing me over when i get screwed over. if this is market pvp then i want it like ship pvp. i want to know who didn't take the order. who took their money out of their wallet. if you lose your ship i guarantee you are looking at that combat log. looking to see who killed you. i bet that combat log has the names of those who just shot you. well the guys who sell to these buyers don't get that. don't start with the sellers because that is a different toon that does that. we know the names of the toons we buy from. if a buy order is issued whether it goes through or not you should at least get the name of the toon. that would be risk on the buyers part. i would be happy if they had at least some risk in this game instead of being fully protected and anonymous."
"friend, let the bitterness go. you were tricked by another player and lost some isk. learn from your mistake and move on.even if you knew the name of the character that listed that market order, in all likelihood there is nothing you could do to him or her. as a market-focused character they might never undock, and as the market is anonymous (until a purchase is made) there is no simple way you can know what orders or trades they are participating in. your best bet for revenge is to look for similar scam buy orders where you were scammed and use some of the methods discussed in these forums to mess with that scammer. but really, for your mental health, just chalk it up as a pvp loss and a learning experience and let it go."
"but there is risk.the scammer has just spent broker's fees... non-refundable broker's fees. these fees scale in proportion to how overpriced the items asked for are. they've committed an amount of money to initiate the scam. if nobody bites, that's money lost. further, if nobody bites, they may have an item nobody is going to buy off them. margin trading scams are often done on low-velocity items. these are items that are rarely sold because they're both; crap, and hard to acquire. so, there is risk. it's just not the risk you happen to want."
"very little risk at all. ooooooooo brokers fees. its too risky...."
"so, when you get the letter/e-mail from the nigerian prince about how he'll send you a pile of cash if you provide him your banking information, do you smile and send out your account number, or do you recognize that the deal is too good to be true and trash the letter? same. basic. principle.the market of eve operates under the rule of caveat emptor. your inability to properly research market orders is not a problem for ccp to address."
"ccp has a song written for you."
"you're not even trying to hide your tears anymore. you should honestly just have the isd lock the thread for the sake of your dignity."
"reported for redundancy.oh and no.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"please use the search forums function to find similar threads from the past. this suggestion has come up numerous times. thread locked for redundancy."
"i'm seeing him on a council of 23. compromise?anyway, my point is that he has apparently become vastly more electable without having substantially reinvented himself or his approach. i won't speculate beyond that."
"i dont even have to speculate, theres 2 obvious reasons, 1) a lot less desirable candidates runningand 2) (heres the fun one) people want xenuria elected for the same reason they want the worse of 2 brothers to inherit the british throne, they know it will be terrible with drama, they know there will likely be a scandal by somebody to somebody else because of it, and they are hoping for it. people want xenuria elected so they can open up en24 or themittani and see a juicy drama-saturated article about somebody flipping out at somebody else, or somebody violating nda over a big nono. thats 90% of his votes right there."
"i'll admit, the 25 was an asspull. i knew it was in the low twenties. i wasn't going to go and rerun the process (again) a few times to make sure it was right. and no need to speculate on why:there were some alliance pings saying 'vote xenuria first. troll ccp'"
"thank you for your input steve. i am glad that you still take the csm seriously. also the only people i have seen losing their cool or flipping out over the idea of me being on the csm are the same people who would not be on the csm if my proposed term limits passed. granted mynnna did claim i was somehow magically stalking him from all the way in nj. several people think i am an alt of lex arson and lynchton, gorskie thinks i can teleport and steve; you clearly have convinced yourself i am some sort of \"joke\" candidate. the only people \"flipping out\" are my detractors. funny how that works..."
"i don't think you consider yourself a joke candidate. i think you believe yourself to be perfectly serious./other/ people consider you a joke candidate"
"funny how you can tell somebody something over and over again without them getting it. for a person who claims to be \"allergic to politics\" you sure do use alot of influence stratagems (poorly) in effort to attack a perceived foe."
"implants also have an isk cost.in the event that my proposal was accepted, the demand for learning implants would plummet, if for no other reason than each character would only need 1 rather than 5. the simplest way to protect lp store income would be to add learning boosters to lp stores (as suggested in the proposal iirc) and make them cheap. say 1-2% of the price of the equivalent implant per dose. that puts a +5 booster at, what? 1200lp and 1.2m isk. then they'd be universally available, impossible to corner and widely advertised to any player doing even l1 missions for income.then there's also the issue of granularity. as a rich old player, i can plonk down for a pair of +5s whenever i feel like training extra fast. that +5 goodness is easy for me to achieve, but it's a very high hill for a new player to climb, but that new player can buy a few booster shots and amp up his training speed without making a huge downpayment in advance."
"i disagree.boosters make it easier for new players to achieve higher learning speeds. older players can trivially access that advantage already. they can't be more advantaged than they already are."
"not having to risk high priced implants if you don't want to reduces the grind and means that you dont have to choose between training skills and having fun. anything, anything that undermines the horrible terribads who grief new players out of the game (and ruin eve's reputation amongst potential players) by telling them to grind missions to earn +5s and then \"stay in hi-sec until you have enough sp for 0.0\" is good for the game and good for the new players."
"in that scenario there is no game play choice. you just use the boosters. this would be similar to clone costs which were removed because there was no interesting choice:\"...the current clone death mechanics. they are not a real choice, they are an illusion of choice. a choice between a bad option of losing isk, and a worse option of losing skillpoints.\"this is similar because everyone would just use the boosters.source:"
"there is explicitly a game play choice, because there remain several strong use cases for implants1) my holiday clone! i'm going away for 2 weeks and i can't log in to apply a new booster every 3 days2) my empire mission/trade/r&d/production alt! this guy will never consensually pvp, so why not use implants?3) my character farm! i'm training characters for sale. using a learning implant will significantly reduce my effort:isk ratio4) i live in the ass end of w-space! supplying boosters is irritating, but implants just keep working5) i'm a lo-sec pirate and i know how to get my pod out! why rent my sp gain when i can buy?6) pretty much any well funded character role that isn't routinely exposed to pod loss and wants to train sp"
"what you're suggesting is not a meaningful choice. it's just pointless updating, like a facebook game or the old skill system, or wow garrisons. it's not interesting gameplay either, it's just \"do this pointless task or suck\".and it's taking away a meaningful choice to try and remove yet more risk of loss from the game. this game needs more meaningful choice, not less. it needs less repetitive boring tasks, not more."
"i had not considered this in the context of implants staying in the game. boosters would add choice in that case."
"i would love something that just justifies the risk side of the buyer besides some lame broker fee. give names of the actual buyer when failed at least. if not that then any of the other adjustments i have suggested. i just want this looked at again by ccp and the csm. there is something wrong with this wether you all think there is not."
"yeah... well... ya know... that's just like uhh... your opinion man.the more i think about this... the more and more i see the margin scam as the market equivalent of a suicide gank.you're best form protection is taking precautions (researching) and avoiding it altogether. your best recourse is to use the mechanics against them.hint: as someone said before... buy the item cheap somewhere else and try to sell it to the suspected margin scam buy order. the larger the buy order amount is, the higher the market fees will be.for example: on a 1 bil isk buy order, the market fee can be anywhere from 1 to 5%. without you buying the \"baited item\" from the scammer in the first place (because you bought it somewhere else for much cheaper), that is an automatic 10 to 50+ million isk loss right there."
"maybe the fact that everyone in this thread, including a former csm member who has discussed this issue with ccp, disagrees with you should make you question your basic premise that something is wrong. scamming is part of eve and the margin trading scam is just one variation of several scams that induce players to pay too much for an item.just move on and just be more careful in the future. or better yet, set up your own margin trade scams and make back your isk that way."
"to turn that around, you use alot of victim stratagems to make yourself out as oppressed and virtuous, the sole savior from a status quo refusing to change (aside from all the times theyve voted on change)not trying to attack you here, honest, just again informing you your responses come in 1 of two varieties, either changing/spinning your arguement to claim opposition secretly agrees with you and should love you, or anyone not agreeing with you is just an alt and a troll enforcing some spectre-like rmt cartel status quo"
"i like the flavor of your post. i don't see myself as a victim i see myself as a person who has been disenfranchised by the status quo. your polarizing the argument. it's not me vs them, nothing is ever that simple when people are involved. it's more this..i am a person who has views about things.people who are biased against me do mental gymnastics to rationalize away their dissonance when they find themselves agreeing with me.i am imperfect just like everybody else in this world, but i am consistent. my \"narrative\" if you can call it that has remained unchanged since day 1. you can call it a trope or a theme or even a genre but all that matters is that you can understand the story. if you can understand a persons narrative than you can parse their intentions without them telling you anything. tl;dri am an honest person in the middle of a machiavellian space opera."
"okay, this may seriously come across as a little attack-ish, but it is an honest questionhow is what you just described not admitting you are a self-inflicted pariah with a messiah complex?"
"i am a self inflicted pariah with a messiah complex. the disagreement is in what self inflicted means in this context.my honesty and commitment to the things that i feel are important can and often does polarize people. self inflicted implies spite or clumsiness, this is not the case. i choose to be honest and unyielding in my values, this choice makes me a pariah."
"i think you overestimate your charisma. the vast majority of your votes in csm 10 were troll votes, they didn't actually believe in you or your policies and you've never provided any evidence to support your bold claims of who votes for you (i'll give you a hint, it's nowhere near 90% of all females in game).you could be a decent candidate but your insistence on making unsubstantiated claims as well as attacking anyone who questions you and that's bad for politicians as you need to have a silver tounge."
"i don't attack people who question me, i attack their arguments or their motives for their question. many of my votes were troll votes, i don't think anybody has disputed that. most power blocs vote for whoever the alliance mail tells them too. how is that any better than troll voting?pro tip: it isn't."
"wait, what? why would you have two of them? granted, that does add choice, but it's fairly strange."
"boosters without learning implants just become a 'no choice' option. boosters in the context of learning implants provide an alternative choice for people who do not want to be at a sp accumulation disadvantage but also do not want their 'out in space doing stuff' implant slots tied up by non-interaction learning implants."
"if it becomes possible to have your cake and eat it too, then why keep the mechanic in the first place? that's not meaningful choice either, it's the best of both worlds, and fails to commensurately reward the player who is willing to take risks."
"it is nothing to do with risk. i routinely pvp in implants which are more expensive than a +5 learning set. but every time i choose to use these 'interacting' implants i lose sp because i am not in the +5 set. encouraging people to sit in 'non-interacting' learning implants is bad because we should be encouraged to be in 'interacting' implants instead."
"but there is no choice. if you are a pvp player, there is no other option than to fly with your expensive pirate implants and use learning boosters. the only reason you wouldn't do that is if you could not find/afford the learning booster.that isn't interesting gameplay. the current trade-off - character progression vs. combat advantage - isn't a necessarily a good one which is why we are discussing it, but at least it is a trade-off. just adding boosters just gives you everything with no real decision to be made on your part. might as well remove learning bonuses at that point. if they were a new type of booster (or effectively an insured implant) that took up the corresponding implant slot then you might argue you have more choices. you could use regular implants, or this booster which might cost more, be temporary but persist through death. still, since those are clearly do everything better than the current implants, just more costly in the long run, so they would give an advantage to those that can afford them."
"the decision is analogous to manufacturing with a bpo or a bpc. both have plausible use cases."
"i have outlined several use cases above where the implant remains a better choice"
"pretty much all of your use cases are just balancing your perceived risk of losing your clone vs. the cost of replacing them. it's much like insurance, another mechanic many people think is problematic, where if you don't think you will lose a clone you get the implant, and if you estimate your chance of losing a clone is above extra cost of the booster, you go booster. i guess it is additional gameplay, but practically for most players there is no choice - your trader/industrialist will always go implant, and the active pvper will always go booster. it might reduce the hesitation of those with learning implants to pvp, but still, the pvper has the problem that boosters are mandatory. there is no reason for them not to use them and thus you have to buy and use the most expensive one you can afford. once you identify yourself as likely to lose the clone, or benefit too much from the pirate implant set to go without, you have no trade-off to make except for how much isk you are willing to spend (which favours established players)."
"i dispute this claim, by the way. risk aversion should not be handled by making choices less meaningful."
"i understand scamming is a part of eve but when eve is a part of scamming, this is where i draw the line. typing in the wrong price by an extra 0 is scamming. i will disagree with all of you on this as long as the client continues to protect the scammers and not look out for the ones who really make eve's market a viable place."
"don't like scammers, don't use the market. simple as that. build and farm everything you use."
"your only course of action then is to quit the game. scamming is not just implied gameplay, but intended and approved."
"i can't speak for everyone else, but i used the cfc ballot template & removed the people i don't like from the list. space democracy."
"there are exceptions to ever rule or norm. i would prefer a community that sees the pre filled ballots as a suggestion and not some word on high as to how you should vote. i talked to many people at fanfest who said a variation of \"i just voted for whoever my alliances voted for\" when i asked if they voted for me. most of them didn't really understand what the csm was outside the context that they had to click a link and press submit."
"this thread is tragic but i can't seem to stop following it. i think someone has me drugged."
"right, but you jump immediately to paranoid measures of questioning the motives and secret agendas of anyone who disagrees with you, simply so you dont have to answer the questions of anyone who doesnt already support you. you dont win arguements, and thereby votes, you instead reason that anybody who doesnt agree with you 100% is part of some status quo seeking conspiracy and isnt worth discussing with."
"those are you words not mine. i don't agree with that statement either. the status quo is not some grand conspiracy, it's the result of social norms and associated stratification. psychology != conspiracyi think this is where people get me mixed up. your speaking in absolutes, i try to avoid absolutes which is why you might see me as evading questions. in reality i simply don't feel comfortable answering something at a level of detail in which i can't be certain of its truth. it's a weakness that i have and i agree that part of me lacking sufficient theory of mind leads to misunderstanding."
"i respectfully disagree, you have on numerous occasions called people trolls simply because they put questions in front of you that you didn't want to answer and this includes me personally. you called me a troll simply because i asked questions about your past history.and i think your tinfoil is showing with the alliance voting, the alliance puts out a recommended voting ballot, i will agree that a number of people would blindly vote what they're told to but if you think that people don't have a mind for themselves then you have a lower opinion of the community as a whole than i expected."
"assumptions dude... you make alot of them.argumentum ad ignorantiamyou can't know what goes on inside every single alliance in game, only ccp can know that.ccp decided it was significant enough to make a flavor item to poke fun of pre filled csm ballots."
"ironic statement is ironic. your entire platform revolves around assumptions."
"so, the last topic i can find on the matter is from around two years ago. in which ccp fozzie had the following to say:if i had to guess the re-factor they're referring to is at least partly what's being talked about in this presentation from fanfest. if this is the case is there any new info on the boosts change?"
"that's the refactor they're talking about, yes. as per the presentation, they're looking at a few months from now, to hit sisi (all times subject to change, of course. something might have been missed). only after it's on tq and tested entirely stable, can they look at doing more."
"cool! thanks very much. i wasn't sure if that was the rework or if it was just vaguely related.nice to have an update on this after two years and thanks for being so responsive, loved your fanfest presentation btw"
"there's a difference between scamming and overpaying. if you paid for something and you can't afford for something to go wrong, if the brokers fees are really that high, you shouldn't be buying/selling in that area.there is no way of countering the margin trading scam without making the skill margin trading completely useless. it is a vital tool for trading, and if you were a trader you would understand."
"this is related to the \"brain in the box\" project, right?"
"(note, some of this is speculation and some of this is from memory, i may be largely wrong)going by this post from 5 months ago as well as the presentation \"brain in a box\" is a rework of how character data is stored and applied in eve. right now the node you're on is managing your character and it needs to be passed along every time you change nodes, which is one of the reasons jumping between systems is extremely expensive to the server.the code that had/has to be re-written for on-grid boosts is dogma, which at present doesn't support modifying those attributes on anything other than a node or personal level, so the available options other than a dogma re-work are the current system which goes by node, something horrendously expensive that checks who is on grid before applying boosts, or completely re-wiring boosts as a system which would also be pretty time intensive and potentially technically expensive, not to mention unpopular.if i recall right from the talk about this from when command ships were re-balanced, what they're basically looking at doing is bringing the level a node can operate on down to a single grid, which by extension means they can confine boosts to a single grid (and hopefully fix fleet boost propagation in the mix)"
"so will it remove ogb? .. or will it still need a few months after that?"
"i would assume longer than whatever tech they implement. i wouldn't expect them to remove ogbs without at least re-working the rorqual first."
"well duh... i have never been on the csm so assumptions have to be made."
"show me battlereport."
"eft warrior detected.on contrary, i've been in those fleets. it takes one spy in your teamspeak and/or fleet, and your target is known long before dreads can lock it. tank goes overheated, reps pre-activated, and all those salvos barely scratch the armor.with tidi 10% you can only hope to destroy a couple of slowpokes after hours of \"fight\". and that is the best case. in worst case, you lose all your dreads without even loading the grid. seen it during halloween war in hed-gp.and even (i mean even) if you can hit through carriers, what would you do with motherships? field 600 naglfars? been there, seen that. your guns dont work, your siege runs endless cycle, soul crashing lags and absolutely shity gameplay."
"the thing is, if you make margin trading (which is a skill needing to be trained) illegal, you might as well ban all other sorts of scamming in eve and refund everyone that ever got scammed out of anything and ban the perpetrators.wait, i actually agree with this. would be fun to see cfc membership numbers dropping to about 1/3 of what they are now for them impersonation/recruitment scams."
"eve should have it's own corollary to godwin's law regarding the cfc/goonswarm.eve is like an addiction; you can't quit it until it quits you. also, iderno"
"not to mention - and this cannot be overemphasised - that rather more than 99% of margin trades are \"legitimate\" orders.like the majority of scams, the margin trade scam only works on people who think they're the scammers in the deal. which makes it problematic to understand why one should have any sympathy for them: \"i was going to beat this little kid up for a laugh but then it turned out he had 3 brothers bigger than me. kids smaller than me shouldn't be allowed by law to have big brothers because it was totally unfair to expect me to fight 3 big guys also i have a mental disorder that cripples my self-awareness!\""
"if your platform requires assumptions to be made then you should probably refine it, for example bam stroker's platform was to support the community, player meets and the like which requires no assumptions at all, even tora bushido's platform of fixing wardecs the only assumption that he's made is that ccp will even care what he has to say on the topic.you've made claims with little to no evidence in both csm 10 and csm 11 (and there's not even an election for csm 11 coming up) and when called out to provide evidence to support your claims you call people trolls for asking or state that you've already provided the evidence when none exists.i know i've said this before but when almost the entirety of the people voting for you are doing so as a joke then you should probably take some time out of the spotlight to repair your reputation and spend some time actually getting to know the community."
"my platform isn't perfect and neither is my skill at politics.that said, my reputation is not what needs repair. i have consistently been vindicated of all accusations and scandals. i am not concerned by the kangaroo courts of internet trolls."
"your reputation is what needs repair.whether you were vindicated or not, when your brought up in conversation, people either have no clue who you are, or they know you as a troll who posts weird ideas on the old forums.you have little to zero community involvement, and no community relation. that is why you have little chance fo ebing elected as anything but a scapegoat or as a troll to ccp.if you are serious about csm, and are serious about helping the playerbase. then before anything you need to be involved with the forums, and involved with the ingame communities. you have to become an enabler, have people know you for how you have helped them. be somebody the game would be lesser for if you left. because right now, if you left no one would notice.you keep complaining that the voting system is broken because bloc leaders keep getting elected, or if not them their choices. this isnt broken, this is you again have a disconnection with the playerbase. these individuals worked to become leaders and enablers, names that everyone knows as soon as they hear them, there are very few people in eve who have been here 2 months who would need an explanation of who the mittani, or chribba, or shadoo is, because those are well known names who have made possible well known events. this is why they and their supported runners get elected, because between the people who rely on them for leadership, and the people outside their community who generally respect their accomplishments, people want to listen to what they have to say.as much as i hate the concept of politicians ingame or the real world, they are usually sketchy people at best, it is very much a requirement to be one to approach csm candidacy, and if you are not prepared to be one, and to operate both ingame and out of game in a manner to improve your relations with the greater community, then you have already lost no matter how early you start your csm campaign."
"i refuse to accept being sketchy as a requirement for being a space politician. my relations with this community are better now than they ever were. i am empowered by my honesty not weakened by it. if you have been posting in my thread this long and you still don't get it than maybe you should bow out."
"if all you got out of that is that most politicians are sketchy, its no wonder people dont elect you.yes, your reputation is \"better\" than it used to be, how so? youve gone from being infamous to being unknown. just having your rep \"higher than ever\" does not mean its in a good place, you still have minimal involvement with the playerbase and forum community, that is an issue you need to address if you want your new campaign to succeed."
"it doesn't matter whether you were vindicated or not, you have a bad repuation in the community and frankly your csm threads have done more damage than good. using the phrase kangaroo court doesn't automatically change peoples opinions of you, you need to work at that yourself. i'm not attacking you nor do i particularly care about incidents in your past but others do and that's what matters. what i see as a concern is the fact that you had your csm 11 thread up hours after losing csm 10, you refused to discuss difficult subjects with people in your csm 10 thread, you have shown a pretty blatant hostility towards the community and you seem to spend minimal time talking to people in eve getting your name out there and getting a feel for what people want to see in game. the community are who votes for you and who you are there to represent (not to represent your self serving ideas) yet you seem to want to avoid them.(p.s. calling ccp liars due to not sharing your concern for a design element of the game is probably not a good way to make friends either)"
"i appreciate your point of view but i simply don't share it. you seem to have trouble internalizing that.i am not running on my reputation, i am running on my values. this does arguably weaken me as a candidate but its also what sets me apart from the mainstream candidates who garner many votes on popularity alone. ok, i'll bite.how do you figure i have a \"minimal involvement\" with the playerbase and forum community?"
"that's actually not true or you've misunderstood certain things.because i'm quite sure that if i click on them nightmares on the market for 970mil my wallet will buy that selected item for that exact price. from the seller who was selling it for 970 mil isk. the game doesn't automatically assign you the lowest price. if it did, there wouldn't be any point to all them swindlers setting prices of simple items to 1.500.000.000 isk at the top of the item list.last time i brought a cargo of 75.000 units of morphite to amarr, there was about 6 buy orders with prices higher than the one that actually wanted more than 75.000 units. i set the sale price to match that buy order and the other 6 buy orders weren't fulfilled.what i think you're referring to is the default sell interface, where it's going to offer you the maximum price and clicking sell without adjusting the price sells it to the highest bidder."
"you are correct that 'it doesn't assign you the lowest price'. you will buy the item at the price you specify. but you will not buy it from the seller you click on. you will purchase from the lowest price seller but at the price you specify."
"if you set a price of x, and you're buying, it'll take them from the lowest priced order first, and work its way up, until it reachs your price, or you have bought all you wanted. each person will be paid x times the number of things you get from them."
"which makes _you_ the perfect candidate to ask ccp not to reconsider. @utari: not sure volt/yulai are the perfect examples of great defense fleets, especially since their space is infested with reds on a daily basis."
"yeah, that's ussually how it is. that's what the skill is supposed to be for. so you can place huge amounts of buy orders without having to tie up all your capital. so even if something in jita still isn't producing results, it doesn't tie up your cash to fulfil those orders in dodixie."
"i wish more people would realize this. it's one thing to face a single or a handful of carriers but another entirely to try to take out even a single one in large fleets."
"the obvious catch would be to find a means of making supers vulnerable without outright demanding large-scale fleets aka blobbing.i do however agree that super carriers are a detrimental element of gameplay as it stands and should be reformed or removed asap."
"another problem with super capitals in general is that they are only able to be constructed in sov that has been held for more than a few weeks. in other words, they are only really available to big power blocs or the super wealthy, but i'm repeating myself. making these ship types more vulnerable would contribute greatly towards ending the stagnation of the sov system."
"give us back our range and you can keep the fatigue. +1"
"atm the eve client uses the default graphics chip when you have an intel chip and nvidia card on your laptop.with optimus from nvidia this usually is the intel onboard chip, and it shows up as the (only) primary videocard.i had to manually assign the nvidia graphics card to the eve.exe file and set it as only and primary videocard oog.is ccpgames aware of this, and how can they test eve probe when all they test is the intel onboard videocard ?source:"
"bumping to support this concept again.i would be sad if this thread was locked and the concept forgotten due to lack of attention."
"i am rather liking the changes, but that is probably because i enjoy flying subcaps more often. i do agree however that the nerfbat strike was a little too harsh. as above, it should have been either a pure range nerf or just fatigue, keeping the original range.- just my 2 cents"
"did you do the math with your proposal? ;)"
"i don't care about the math. i know that it's likely the only compromise they'll consider. vov"
"gicen the choice between a bad compromise and no compromise, why do you think ccp will elect to compromise at all?eve is like an addiction; you can't quit it until it quits you. also, iderno"
"this thread has been moved to features & ideas discussion."
"mr ronuken, is the market data for charting on your website provided via crest? would it be possible to either switch, or to provide an option for a candlestick chart layout? thanks"
"sillly thought here?what if a ship's history could be tracked?\"yup, that was the ship i used in 6vt, and it fought thru 50 wars, 700 battles, 173 solo kills - and i just lost it in a f### gate camp of intys!!!\"would it add a useful dimension to the game?would pilots become more 'invested' in their favorite rides?would there be more tears at their loss?would this be a new dimension of pilot skill - avg age of ships vs activity?thanks for your consideration."
"thread unlocked by polite request."
"well all you gunslingers probably won't care, so don't bother to talk - however - some of the industrialists and miners may.1st we get extra amounts of minerals required to build things.2nd then we get increasing craziness in components hell to build t2 and t33rd then you screw over everyone who ever improved a blueprint w/ the blueprint 10/20 schema with no reimbursementfor years of effort.now we get the april 2015 update which is going to up the amounts of the rarest and most critical minerals.do you just want the average player, let alone the new players to never be able to build anything ccp?or is this more of the continuing unspoken war you are carrying out against any one who dares to want to live and work in high sec?or is it the apparent bias of - if you don't blow **** up - the game is not really for you! i'd really rather believe that none of those are true, the economy is awesome, the markets hum along well, inflation is not to bad,and industry actually works - as it is. quit srewing around with it.just get it over with already and completely randomize ore respawn in all sectors of space and quit screwing around with the industry by making it harder and harder.you are not helping - ccp."
"so im taking it you didnt even read the proposalthey are rebalancing available minerals to be distributed in similar ratios as to what is actually required for ship production.so instead of mining for materials, and ending up wasting several hours or days extra mining for a specific mineral (mexallon if i recall was still the big nullsec bottleneck) and having alot of useless excess low and high end minerals, youll instead have roughly the exact amounts you need fo each type for your ship, and be able to ge tthem quicker, since their is no wasted materials of any one type while trying to mine for a now non-existent bottleneck.now granted, i have my own reservations about this change, mostly that previously those excess minerals could be diverted to other projects that didnt need as much of the bottleneck and therefore could make do with lftovers, but whatever.in the end, this *is* a buff to productivity/hour for industrialists."
"i'm curious. why do you think that increasing the mineral requirements is bad for miners? and again, why is it bad for miners to tweak the minerals you get out of an anomaly to numbers you can actually build stuff with?"
"it would shut the game down.the problem with lag in eve has to do with session changes, loading and processing the information from unique id's moving from system to system, grid to grid.this would turn ships from a single object into a complex entity, it would increase lag by minimum 40% per pilot.not to mention you either make it pointless because a repackaged ship loses all its information, or you track it even after repackaging making the database bloat 4000% in 24 hours and make the market non-functioning."
"agreed! i would love to hear if ccp has anything to say about this. this thread has been around for a while now, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive and constructive."
"jump fatigue is a very nice way to limit travel times, which gives traveling the need for a strategic think of what you're doing, but where jump bridges are concerned, it's quite pointless. maybe if ccp were to remove jump fatigue completely, add something else such as fuel costs to the mix, to slow down how quickly you can get from a to b, or make you review whether travelling your 200+ supercap fleet across new eden for an invasion is actually worth it."
"if you make it about cost, pl will be back to hotdropping rookie ships with fleets of supercaps in no time at all."
"op you really have no clue how this stuff works do you. i mean, first off you appear to have completely missed the accompanying asteroid changes. second you seem to have a serious aversion to either buying your minerals or mining outside of high sec. both at once is inadvisable for someone who claims to have a serious investment in eve industry.second, doubling the amounts of those minerals is going to amount to an at most a 3-5% increase in cost of these items, which translates into profit for producers. that's assuming that the new sources for these minerals don't drop the price down. currently the market has at least stabilized but it's really too soon to say for sure.either way this isn't hurting producers unless you absolutely insist on solo-mining everything you need and not buying any of it."
"closed."
"thank you very much.dmc"
"it was about cost originally, if you recall jumps required and still do require isotopes. it didnt stop them"
"fuel costs won't work unless they engineer them to be so astronomically high no matter how many are produced. how much fatigue and how it was gained needs more thought.if the aim was to prevent people dog piling in on a system within 20 minutes of a fight kicking off, then the current mechanics are way to severe and need to be targeted more cleverly. i'd be happy with a compromise whereby the larger the ship mass, the more fatigue is accumulated but in turn the distances that can be jumped needs to be increased and the build up of space aids decreased. it shouldn't have to take a couple of days to jump from tribute to delve in a taxi carrier, there is no fun in that. it's just wasted time but i could live with it taking a good few hours to prevent the whole dog piling thing."
"why shouldnt it? why shouldnt you be inconvenienced enough by local geography and distances to care? why should 1 power be able to go to war with another power on the other side of new eden?answer, they shouldnt. because as long as you are able to reach that power on the other side of the galaxy and remain comfortable, any group or power that tries to build itself up between you and them is easy pickings for both parties, because they are well within reach.the current fatigue system was designed with extreme penalties because some places are supposed to be out of reach! as long as there are areas you cant get to without severely inconveniencing yourself, then there are areas where the map can change."
"yeah well guess what? more players want this to stay in the game than those that don't. you want to affect trading profitability of thousands of players as long as ccp makes you happy. this suggestion has no merit./closethread"
"you utterly miss the point of what i said. you see goon and it's all sandy clunge and hat gons rather than a reasonable and objective discussion. the point was that instant force projection was bad, it's gone. great! however it's just inconvenienced deployment via a capital taxi from half an hour to several days, maybe a week at extremes distances. as long as there is a low sec or null npc station that can be docked in, you can go to war with anyone eventually. imperium just did that with fountain and delve. there is nothing really wrong with that and ccp can't really prevent it no matter what mechanic they add. i'm not saying put it back to what it was but the space aids mechanic was both blanket and too extreme in many circumstances. maybe you're just someone who's never lived in null and is not aware of the reality of how it works, especially with merc groups and the more highly mobile specialised groups which tend to fight brushfire wars. these areas can still be reached eventually but adding the time to get to them by several thousand % has no real positive effect on anything, it's just a pain to move fit ships around and in a worst case you end up with boring ship doctrines like the ubiquitous ishtar fleet (not just because sentries are op or the ishtar is op either but a series of features which mean it's very good in the current meta) and completely rely on having a jf service. it doesn't really add anything and doesn't change an outcome, it just means people spend more time being bored."
"you seem to think that the idea is to stop long range deployment at all. it isn't. deploy away!the point is to make it such that a long range deployment is now a significant commitment and involves leaving in-space assets at risk. it is.half the problem was that it was possible to move a supercap fleet across the map in literally less time than it takes a freighter to cross 9-2the other half was that is was possible to move them back just as quickly.when there is close to zero opportunity cost for moving very quickly, then everyone is your next door neighbour. a situation like this very quickly leads to a two-colour map with zero opportunity for anyone not in one of the two blocs to have any meaningful independent existence regardless of any sov system in place.thus the three phases of the sov rework, the first two of which have completely reversed the situation as it was in september 20141) the phoebe changes make it militarily even possible to have more than 2 powers on the map. pre-phoebe it wasn't.2) the \"fozziesov\" changes will make it extremely difficult (not impossible, but requiring enormous effort) to hold space that you don't live in and utilise. currently it's trivial.3) the 3rd phase will be to rework the local economy of nullsec to make it viable to have a relatively small amount of space support a large number of players.there will still be wars. there will still be coalitions and diplomacy and politics. there will still be long distance deployments and failcascades and battles. what we won't have, if this all works out, is the old stagnant sitaution where everyone sat on their hands for a year at a time, then there was a gigantic lagfest battle that ultimately meant nothing, because the winner didn't even want the loser's space."
"incidentally, if all you want to do is move your \"taxi carrier\", then get a corpie or a friend or even an alt to find an appropriate wormhole."
"to the current csm in office:relating to my crowing concern and complaints of the growing number of bugs, issues, and glitches with the launcher and the eve client:it is becoming my belief that this is being somewhat allowed and overlooked in the great race of mini-expansions and a desire to release the 'new revamp of' that's the current apparent focus of ccp.i am requesting that the csm bring to ccp's attention that there are so many overlooked or outright ignored bugs with a game that, otherwise, is a solid and quite enjoyable gaming experience. ccp is known for quality in their products and caring about their player base as more than simply numbers for the quarterly reports. i would be greatly disheartened if this is become less a statement of fact.the latest release, mosaic, is iconic of these troubles, which many could've been avoided by simply slowing down and working with a priority of quality, not quantity.>>>>>a few examples of places that are lacking in care or attention and it's showing.eve launcher: it has become accepted that the launcher will break or become buggy on a regular basis. as the repair tool is also seeming to have the same update problems, it becomes difficult to correct on a player's end what is coming through our internet connections. i now join the growing chorus. please, either repair the launcher so it is not causing so many complaints and bug reports, or remove it for a different way to login to the game.banning offense exploit list: though i requested this during the latest titan bumping drama and it was noted by a ccp employee as a good idea and that it was in the works, it's not up anywhere as of yet. this gives the impression that there's been no movement on this, or it has been bumped lower on the priority list of changes, upgrades, and things to assist new players who have joined eve online. as there has been a focus on retaining new players, once more they face without all tools available the challenge curve of eve. a simple heads-up that could keep new players (and vets!) from getting themselves banned is still not in place.bugs, glitches, issues: this list is getting that sinking feeling of 'endless,' but it comes down to a few base things. the time spend debugging a new release is lacking, the rush for change in change's name without checking if it's a good and truly wanted change, what appears to be a lack of long term attention to bugs from a release after a week or so, and now admissions that features were left out because 'the devs ran out of time.' that statement alone is more proof than any number of single issues i could point out as a player. time. not enough is being spent on quality, it's becoming a priority of quantity. that does not bode well.connection to tq: if this part sounds 'ranting' or 'irate' i apologize in advance. there have been many waves of socket closed on evenings that are responded to with what feels like the company line. \"it's not at our end so it must be at yours.\" up to a certain point, very possible. there is the ddos issues that have hit ccp along with other game companies over the last year, i understand that as well. however i and if thread postings back this assumption up, there is more going on with the regular disconnects the players are facing. if it is not on the players' end, and it is not on ccp's end, i for one would like the company name that owns the failing routing server so i can aim my complaints at the correct target.>>>>>these listed issues, along with others not listed in this specific post, could be lessened in impact if only a few things were done on a corporate level with ccp. time spent on quality control, debugging, and slowing a little of the priority currently in place of a fast track release cycle, would made a difference in positive directions.tl:dr version!: slow down guys and gals, more bug fixing focus before releases and continuing further out after a release.i understand that ccp is running a business, and that they're not keeping eve up and active in some sort of community service. i'm only a year into playing so i can only go from what i find out going through old posts and talking with longer playing individuals. all i do know is for the year i've been in, the list of personal complaints are piling up and irritation has moved into upset.so, as the elected csm in office, be our voice in this growing problem. eve is known for many things in the mmo communities, a large part of that being both quality in it's product and caring about their player base. i would like that to remain true and factual, as eve online is unique and an otherwise wonderful gaming and community experience.let's all make it even better.>jeven housebenyo"

"i like words, and use a lot of them. prepare for a long-winded post.i'm sure there will be lots of fire and brimstone headed my way based on what research i've done about this topic and the way that players have felt about it before. i'm just going to go ahead and acknowledge that now and move on to the rest of my post.between purportedly leaked emails, monocles that cost more than two months subscription, and just overall player disappointment with incarna content, it's been wholly and completely left in the dust (no 514 pun intended) with even eve developers saying that they've failed with the incarna project.everyone loves new players. a lot of new players love what limited portion of incarna we can see, and want to do more of it. i find someone telling me that they wish incarna had finished, quite regularly, though of course it's usually players that weren't around during the actual typhoon of drama and upset that occurred during the attempt to implement the content. leaving the content unfinished as it is now takes away from the experience of a full, polished experience that a game as big as eve tries to provide. i think that a finished incarna will keep new players around for longer. yes, the game is about space stuff, and i know people don't want to see walking in stations become the major attraction or take precedence. but when you're new, there's a /lot/ of time spent doing absolutely nothing, staring at your skills as they slowly tick up, and so forth while you try and figure out the game. having a mindless social activity to fill in the empty space would really help, as would having a more fleshed out experience that players expect in mmo's: encountering other players and being social with them during downtime.incarna doesn't, to me, seem like it has much work left behind it. the character models are done, the devkit for building interiors is complete, including multiple types of walls and even a few decorations based on what i can see. i'm pretty sure that ccp probably has a folder somewhere with a bunch of incarna content that was never implemented just laying around as well. really, the hardest part, if it's not yet finished, would be drawing up the system for getting people to walk around and sit in the same room. i'd estimate 3-4 months for completion, with 2 months of occasionally mashing some random bug that pops up.hopefully, enough time has passed that incarna doesn't make ccp afraid of it's playerbase anymore. after formal apologies, adding a ship-spin ticker (did you know if you hit 10,000 spins you get a plex?) and putting together the council that i'm appealing to right now, i can easily imagine why the thought of trying to tell the players at fanfest that they are going to work on incarna again would send shivers of fear down their spine and perhaps even incite some to run, apologizing, from the stage in lieu of the reaction. honestly? maybe that fear is valid. maybe people do still spit venom at the thought of this subject being broached again. if that's the case, and the playerbase is still that irate about what occured before then the rest of this doesn't matter. in the replies to this topic, we'll find out if that fear is still well founded or not. personally? i don't want them to fear the players. i love that they take their opinions into account, that they've formed this council, and that they really listen to their fans and if incarna failing helped bring that relationship to the state that it's in today, that's awesome. but anger, yelling, and rabble-rousing is never a good foundation for any decision.people aren't running potato-computers to run eve anymore. i could run incarna on a geforce 580 easily, without any fear of having negative effects on my computer, card, or game performance, with the right video options checked off. there's no hardware limitation like there was before, so the former issues of loading it really shouldn't be getting on anyone's nerves.on some level i feel like refusing to enter the captain's quarters is an elitist 'i'm an old-hat player and i don't need no gorram captain's quarters' thing to do, rather than a choice of some merit that actually shows a fondness or dislike. yes, you may love your ship, but it's still floating there in plain view and there are holograms of it elsewhere. further, graphically, it's the best looking place in the game, full stop, end argument. i love looking out into space as much as anyone else but the textures, details, and so on are simply better there than they are in space as of now. however, some people will refuse to touch it out of spite or, possibly, they really do prefer using the ship hanger. there is, after all, no accounting for taste. the answer to this is simple: incarna always has been and should continue to be optional. there's no reason to make it non-optional or even to have it give some tactical advantage outside of the inherent social interaction: i like that i can do all of my business from a menu when i want to and i'm not asking for that to change, just for there to be more there when i want it.the last reason that it should be done is time is on our side. the above estimate for incarna being finished was assuming that they halted their current projects and focused on it instead. honestly, i'd hate that, especially with the new structures coming out. if incarna was to be slated for completion, i would at least put it after the new structure overhaul due to the effects that update would likely have on the walking in stations content. however, if three to four months is spread out over time, and we're just given another feature here or there on the side, i'd still be happy, and so would quite a few others lingering out there.please don't just tell me to give up. tell me why this is a bad idea instead."
"locked, this has been discussed plenty of times before."
"i made another post on this and then realized this one existed shortly after. that was closed for redundancy so here is that post again."
"all the points listed here. eve's alienating a demographic that doesn't want to me a part of trollish alliances and communities (which is what fills the majority of the 'internet spaceships' community). there's those of us who miss the dark dystopia of what eve once was within it's own lore and not sucking the [insert] of the players to provide it instead.that's the eve that was further promised within incarna, minus the cash shop elements (which have happened regardless). the door was supposed to open the way for that.the only reason we don't more support for this stuff and what diversity we had in the old character editor is because ccp continues to express it doesn't give two f***s for the role-player/single-player/lore-immersive crowd.+1 for all of this."
"open the door. let me walk around my hangar. let me have an office/board room.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
"leave the implants the way they are leave the boosters the way they are and let choice and the consequences of that choice ride on the shoulders of the player.some players will gain advantages and benefits, others will not. some payers can make smart decisions, some players cannot. some players can see and use a tool to their best advantage, others cannot. no, everyone does not need to be \"equal\", because they never will be whether in a game, or in reality."
"the \"choice\" however is a meaningless choice. these attributes have arbitrary, unintuitive assignments that don't have meaningful impacts on spaceships. we could add a pop-up daily trivia quiz that gives you +1,000 sp. it could be really hard to reward players who know eve lore. it would be a choice players would have to perform it or not, but it would be an arbitrary and pointless choice."
"attribute s definitely should be put in a bag and drowned"
"removed."
"edit your post, rephrase everything so we can at least understand it. remove the angry tone and everything irrelevant from the post, otherwise the isd will call it ranting and lock it - at which point your ceases to achieve anything useful."
"redirected from the features & ideas discussion section.yes, there was a discussion for clothing in december from csm. in that discussion, lots of ideas for future clothing concepts were passed on to the three some ccp personal actually giving a damn.much of those ideas were trollish and did not fit the lore of eve in the slightest.i'm looking at the majority of you... with those parrots, top hats, and ******* neko costumes.it's like people are trying to hijack the outcry of those remembering the dark sci-fi dystopia of eve (without the other players) and use it to fill some kind of trollish fantasy agenda of bullying others and the devs into only their vision of eve. if that's the prime reason ccp doesn't care for giving any more clothing support, i entirely can't blame them."
