upper right corner of the screen its a little box that reads search forums and contains a little magnifying glass as far as i know its the job of the isd to moderate the forums not do your research for you
its a wellknown fact that beating a dead horse does not in fact return the horse to life so you can beat it back to death againif people stopped being stupid and actually searched the forum for old threads themselves they wouldnt get repetitive threads locked and then isd or ccps community devs dont have to waste time doing the same searches or keeping a long postit note of redundant thread urls
this tbh so no to the opdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
if people stop being stupidif you can make people stop being stupid we wont have the forum spam issue that needs a realistic solutionif people just be friends we wont have warif people dont sleep around we wont have aids
the background colors of all overview items can be edited in overview settings it would be nice if everything on the hud could have its color edited though
in csm9 he came in 34th out of 36 and in csmx he came 19th out of 75 so im not sure your analysis is entirely accurate
pretty damed good imo
yeh not bad at all going for csm xi next year
you have my blasters
if you dropped a dread blob on a carrier blob and lost you aint doin something right sieged dreads will nuke carriers every time so unless your going one on one which is the epitome of stupidity in a fleet fight you really need to fire your dread pilots and get new ones  you also need numbers like its been stated you dont need a massive dread blob to win but at the same time you cant throw a handful of dreads at them and expect everything to go in your favor and yes neuting carriers does work armageddons are ideal anti cap ships since they got the remake into neut boats you just need to learn to use them properly instead of 1 on 1 only as your using to argue your misguided point  1 neut boat against 1 carrier just makes the carrier pilot laugh and go hey that tickles as it crushes your armageddon with its fighterseditthrowing battleships against a carrier blob without dread support is just asking to be humiliated
nodes are the issue  my dread was cycling guns for dozen of minutes  firing but not using ammo and not doing any damage on paper concept looks goodbut only on paper
a lot of players that never tried eve before see the long skillqueue see the advantages of two 4 implants and they dont want to lose those implants so they dont pvp they stay in highsec and get bored then leave the game learning implants are a real barrier for new players trying to enter nullsec they need skills fast they also need to pvp they also need isk and cant afford to lose 40 million each time they die what to choose why do players have to make this choice fun or isk  so   give us a 4 boost to all attributes the money ccp will lose because of shorter training times will be a lot less than the money won because players fight destroy more ships are not afraid to pvp have more fun and stay in the game
and what do you replace them with to avoid gutting the lp marketnot saying im against the idea but theyre an lp and isk sink that would probably want replacing
no were not going to crash the market just so some people can justify their obscene risk aversion implants are a choice and whats more they are a meaningful choice that is a good thing
if you must know i am a carer for my partner which brings in little money but leaves me with a fair amount of spare time when i am not needed i mine a lot and theorized i can at a stretch including refining manufacturing etc make 300mildaythats 109500000000 over the course of a year subtract 40 for wastage and times i cant make target 65700000000 or approx 82 plex which is a large part of the way if i buy the rest or can just use part cash part plex then i might just have the finds to attend a fanfest for once
i honestly doubt ccp could pull off getting partner groups to accept plex as payment for services or the promise of reimbursement from ccps coffers for accepting plex as a payment even if the partner services accepted plex theyd somehow need to coordinate with ccp to provide ways for payment to go through which would be potentially ridiculous amounts of extra work and maintenance costs for an event that only happens once a year on top of that theres other associated nasties of providing services for space monopoly money thatd make me balk if i was a vendor being approached by ccp for partnering
i suppose a simple way to do it is for ccp to buy x tickets and rooms and accept the plex themselves but then if they buy in advance they risk losing money if they buy after then they risk not having roomsflights available
flights to and from the us need a purchasing customers name and other identifying info at the time of booking so tsa can prescreen passenger lists tsa at least is not going to bend that for ccp bulk purchasing tickets without passenger namesif ccp handles travel affairs for fanfest on a percustomer basis they pretty much turn into caribbean cruise productions and although i would love to see ccp guard and ccp fozzie in resort wear while they slave away booking my vacation thats a waste of resources
dear csmsome proposals for forums updates in the following topicforums  new featuresmay you speak about this subject in your meetings with ccp it would be interesting to have also some news about forums changes in the new updates sitethanks for your time
the second run was the stv thing to find the 2 candidates with the most votes the ones with the permanent seats
no you wontedit just for clarification since you seem to struggle with reading comprehension i said you wouldnt get elected with your campaign my prediction was spot on you werent elected so the only thing majestic about this was the fact that i even graced you with my presence youre welcome ill give you free advice next year too
are you going to run a serious campaign next year rather than the joke campaign from this year
lol its him again marmite fan boys got to love them
ill take that to mean that no itll still be a joke campaign thanks
and again lol he must love me long time

im actually excited about dust514 being profitable i havent turned on my ps3 in ages but when i did play dust it was actually pretty fun for my personal tastes i cant play repetitive things like arena games or lobby shooters i prefer to explore give me a wasteland to explore and find shiny things shoot monsters discover and learn about eve lore somewhere so vast that i may bump into someone or i may not i dont want a themepark experience perhaps fallout 3  witcher 3  mass effect that would be so fun scanning planets and taking the shuttle down but its impossible to be so accurate that you land where you want if someone else is also hunting the same treasure at the same time then they land miles away but youre both tracking to the same beacon one can only dream right 
the only dread that doesnt use ammo per se is the revelation other then that you had to be using ammo cause either the server doesnt let you activate anything at all wouldnt be the first time ive run across that or everything works fine and you arent paying attention ive seen dread blobs butcher carrier groups so it doesnt look good on paper it actually works you just cannot or will not do it properly from the degree of how much it isnt your fault your throwing out there
this certainly plays into the whole do attributes serve a purpose angle id venture to say no they really dont serve a purpose other than to make the oldest players feel good about shuffling some arbitrary numbers around once a yearlearning implants of course exacerbate the issue i completely agree they should go as theyre a risk aversion multiplier and stupidly expensive way to suck time the only really valuable resource away from players and of course older players have the most isk to buy them giving them an accelerating and compounding advantage over their existing skill point head startlearning implants can 100 be removed and replaced with pretty much any other implant and continue to supply meaningful choice as well as isk and lp sinks into the game
i agree and even made a thread about it
i support this
wtf yall smoking you seriously want something for nothing give us a 4 boost to all attributes that makes the implants meaningless oh right thats your intention swing the nerf bat again ccp cause the kiddies cant play in their sandbox without pooping in itimplants are supposed to cost you something simply because they give you a advantage over another player or allow you to compete on their level if your afraid of getting podded every time you undock then this game is not for you you want all the benefits of the implants but not the risk shame on yousoot
the myth that older players somehow get this compoundingaccelerated advantage with implants is falseall implants do ocne you have 20 mil is somewhat mitigate the obscene amount of time that you now have to devote to each skill to get it leveled ratio wise per skill were advancing just as fast as a noob sp wise were going up faster but thats because we have more distance to cover per skill than the new guysnot to mention they are currently an lpisk sink and id venture to say probably one of the larger lp store sinks
as someone flying around regularly with 500m to 2b in implants i assure you i appreciate the riskreward they provide however theres a difference between hardwires and pirate implants that affect gameplay and learning implants you can plug into a market trading alt that doesnt undock theres no reason attribute implants cant be swapped for something with more meaningful gameplay impact
while i can see and agree to some extent on some arguments for the removal of learning implants and attributes none of them include the ridiculous notion that they somehow stopped people from pvplets make one thing clear here you are gaining a bonus in training by wearing them if you wish for that bonus to be permanent for all then remove attributes and give everyone a fixed training amount per hour for all skills just stop with the whole i cant pvp with them in bullst destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
while i am personally a fan of plex for tickets etc i doubt for legallogisticscost reasons ccp could do what you are asking it would basically require them to front the logistics of thousands of players travel arrangements instead of just printing out ticketsbadges etcthat said i will try to keep the importance of plex as a payment option where possible top of mind
they did a test program in 14 where yu could use plex to buy beer and things at some local shops and at fan fest my guess is it either was not very popular or it did not work out so well because they did not see to repeat the process nor expand it this past fan fest so i highly doubt you will ever have them do plex for tickets
100 agree with this article

hello guysive been thinking about the recent announcements about the new sov system as well as the new ideas for structures and they both seem to fit very nicely into a concept i had a while back this might be a bit too much but please give it a think and if not exactly to this maybe look to having a similar setup in the futureheres the general idea most alliances that hold sov ingame have a certain system they use the most frequent and therefore label it as their hq i think that the hq should take a big role in sov warfare as it is the core of an alliances territory where new structures are concerned the hq should have its main structure or only structure depending on the plans for how many structures are allowed in a system anchored to a planet specifically that planet should have 1 district of which that 1 district has an anchoring node that keeps the structure in fine order much how a pos has to be anchored as well as its defences and structures being strapped onto it this node should be conquerable by dust 514 players i know that involvement with other eve games has been a big wish to have expanded and i think that the involvement of dust players in sov warfare should be crucial but mainly only in the hq system most alliances have a dust corp and i feel that the dust corps are going to wasteso it goes like this the hq structure can be upgraded with different modules with some defending it and others giving bonuses to sov in the same region of the alliance that holds that hq for example if braves hq is ge8jv their main structure will be anchored on a planet and on that planet they own a node which keeps the bonusing modules fitted to the main structure working these bonuses should determine how difficult it is to take systems in that region belonging to brave the node on the planet owned by brave is attackable by other alliances with a dust corp in the form of a dust match lets say pl deploys their dust corp onto the brave planet in a match against brave and the match will determine whether brave keeps control of the bonuses on their main hq structure or notlets say pl win the match and take over the node at that point bonuses in the region are shut down as well as any defensive modules fitted on the hqs structure at that point the structure is more vulnerable to a proper attack of which the entosis module is used on the structure and then is taken over brave will have then lost their hq system as well as defensive bonuses for their sov in their specific regionnote one other idea i had was to make it so all sov brave owned in the same constellation of their hq would be taken over also but this would be incredibly overpowered unless if the defence of the hq was able to be extremely goodone more thing the use of capitals seem to be of little to no use in the upcoming changes i had an idea that capitals and supercapitals should influence the difficulty of how easy or hard it is to take a certain system just by having them theremaybe having more ongrid field presence will make it so the system is harder to take or maybe even impossible to take over just because the defending team have a heavier field presence of course this would also be overkill in certain systems so maybe this should only be allowed in certain systemsthats just a brainfart of my hq idea and how to balance out the upcoming changes making it so a bunch of interceptors cant take down a whole grid worth of systemsthanks for reading o7
why should people playing a completely different game on a completely different system with no real way for eve players to actually interact with them have anything to do with how we hold sovby shut down upgrades do you mean turns off all the ihub stuff if so why should losing a dust match kill a titan you happen to have in build break jumpbridges disable rattingmining upgrades and all the rest of it there is absolutely nothing we as eve players can do to stop thisif something affects what i do in eve the counter should be in eve not in dust
please change the 25ly jump range to 4ly there are several areas where you cant move a carrier to a neighboring region without lighting a bunch of cynos to go around or jumping through a gate as for the gate thing caps have always had to use cynos to move jumping gates with them is dumb
you havent provided a reason for the reversal of the nerf it was a bad nerf but lets have something other than its dumbcaps have always had issues with region jumps using gates is a hell of a lot easier than the old ways of getting dreads into fountain or anything over the tenalcobolt edge gap
so just use the gate for those long region jumps jumping through a gate is a heck of a lot more convenient than cynos ever were sure it changed some dynamics but this is an mmo things are going to change over timealso as someone else mentioned you havent actually provided a reason for reverting this change other than i dont like it
dear csm 10 and members of new edenfor quite some time now there has been a disparity between the effectiveness of sp invested into turret and sp invested into missiles i have waited patiently for 15 years since ccp ytterbium said that missile requirements could be a good thing to look at while i understand that this may be too late to get looked at for the missile rebalance that will likely coincide with the release of the jackdaw i hope with the csms help we can fix this issue once and for all in a release soon afterin this topic i will show that a single sp invested into a base missile skill is worth 12 of a single sp invested into a base turret skill i will also show that a single sp invested into a missile support skill is worth 13 of a single sp invested into a turret support skill i will end with making some proposed recommendations as to ways to solve this issue note all training times are at 2700sphourfirst up base skills speadsheet imageissue it takes twice as much sp to train all the base missile skills to v as it does to train any one of the turret based weapon systems base skills to v this means that a single sp invested into a base missile skill is worth 12 of a single sp invested into a base turret skillsecond up specialization skills spreadsheet imageissue there isnt one they all match up yaythird up support skills spreadsheet imageissues not only does it take more sp to train all of the missile support skills 15 mil more sp without controlled burst and 1 mil more sp with it but the missile support skills only apply to a single weapon system any sp invested into turret support skills is worth three times as much when compared to missile support skills because the turret support skills affect three weapon systemsso what are the overall totals for sp invested take a look it turns out that it takes 332 mil more far less effective sp invested into missiles to get the same effectiveness as you would by maxing a single turret system something i found interesting is that drones take the least overall sp investment which is why i didnt make any comparisons between turrets missiles and dronesso what does this all mean it means dont train missiles the amount of time and sp you invest into missile training will be better served training any turret based weapon system in fact the sp you save will put you well on your way to fully training another turret based weapon systemhow do we fix itwhat i am hoping you will recommend to ccp will be something similar to this break up the base turret skills into specialized base skills for example break small projectile turrets into small autocannon turret and small artillery turret skillbooks option a set the training time for each specialized base turret skill to half of what the generalized skill was in other words set small autocannons training time to half of what it took to train small projectile turrets doesnt add any training time option b set the training time of the specialized base turret skills to what the generalized skill was in other words set small autocannons training time to equal what it took to train small projectile turrets doubles the training of the base turret skills set the training time of the base missile skills to the training time of the equivalent base turret skill if you went with option a you will have to refund excess sp that was spent in missiles if you went with option b you will have to give away sp like when ccp made racial destroyersbcs thats all pretty quick and easy and solves the issue of single sp invested into a base missile skill being worth 12 of a single sp invested into a base turret skill solving the issue that a single sp invested into a missile support skill being worth 13 of a single sp invested into a turret support skill will be a little harder and uglier the best solution could take many forms here is what i would recommend unify the turret and missile support skills essentially have the same support skills apply to both turrets and missiles a theoretical example of that this may look like refund excess sp that was invested into either missile or turret support skillsnow i am sure that some of you will be quick to note that there are a myriad of differences between missiles and turrets when i brought up the idea in fi there were many posts about how missiles always hit rapid missile systems dont exist in similar forms for turrets light and heavy missiles both apply to two sizes of weapons due to the rapid missile systems missiles are used on more hulls than any single turret system is and many more reasons as to why missiles deserve longer training times it was pretty easy to debunk these as they are not issues with the training times of the weapon systems but flavor differences between the weapon systems and potential imbalances that should be fixed by buffs or nerfs applied directly to the weapon systems themselves so i ask you when considering my proposal you understand that what should matter is effectiveness gained by sp investment the base skills grant you x effectiveness specialization skills grant you y effectiveness and support skills grant you z effectiveness if xyz for missiles equals xyz for projectiles the the cost to acquire xyz should be the same with your help we can make this a reality thank youi will be watching this thread so feel free to post any questions or comments you have

ccp needs to and not replace them with anything the truth is that leaning implants add nothing meaningful to the game are a terrible choice to make encourage risk averse behavior and removing them from the game would actually improve eve without dumbing eve downlets start with choices eve is not a game of choices if you think eve is a game of choices you are wrong eve is a game of meaningful choices that is a huge distinction a meaningful choice is choice that affects the eve universe beyond yourself for example the choice to fit an ab instead of an mwd is a meaningful choice your decision now is going to affect the fight you and others are going to have in a matter of minutes you decisions during that fight are meaningful choices what you do after that fight will likely be a series of meaningful choiceslearning implants are not a meaningful choice take any situation mining pvp pve market trading etc place yourself in that situation with another person ask yourself these simple questions does that player having no learning implants affect this situation what if they have a set of 1 implants 5 implants under no circumstances does their decision to use learning implants affect your gameplay at all some of you are going to argue that if you podded said player with 5 implants you would feel good because you destroyed something of high value they had you will miss the fact that it wasnt the learning implants that affected your gameplay but the value of those implants if we set the value to 0 they would have little to no effect at all learning implants are still not a meaningful choiceclone grades were a choice between losing isk or losing sp that is a terrible choice to make ccp rightly removed clone grades from the game because of the poor choice they presented among other things learning implants are the exact same choice that was presented in clone grades lose isk or lose sp imagine there was a third choice added this third choice is a no change choice so if i offered you the choice between losing your isk losing your sp and doing nothing and losing nothing a majority of people would chose to lose nothing that may seem a little extreme but the point is that anytime where the choice of do nothing and lose nothing is the best choice it should be altered to not be the best choice in fact the do nothing choice became the only option for clone grades and people rejoiced because a terrible choice was removedlearning implants encourage risk averse gameplay i have trained many pilots to pvp over the years one of the biggest issues is that the players who often dont have lots of isk would rather stay in highsec where they can use their learning implants to gain skills quickly than pvp or do something where those implants would be at risk people should be out enjoying the game creating content for themselves and others it isnt hard to see that removing learning implants will get more people out into space and doing things in space one of the biggest arguments to removing clone grades argued mainly by nullsec and lowsec pvpers was that a 15 mil isk clone was enough to get people to not fly small ships it isnt hard to see why 40 mil isk in two 4 implants is discouraging pvp just as much as clone grades wereask yourself if learning implants were removed and we were given a flat sphour that compensated for their removal would eve be better or worse off i will argue that it would be better off a meaningless and terrible choice is no longer present more people are out doing risky activities while gaining the max sphour they can and more content is generated there are surprisingly minimal costs to removing learning implants we lost a few lp store items i am sure ccp can fix that other than that it is all gains feel free to let me know if i missed coststhe bottom line is that eve will be better off if learning implants are removed i hope ccp can see that removing learning implants is really in the best interest of the game i ask players that agree to speak to their csm representatives and get them to urge ccp to 
noeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
you whippersnappers and your jump drives i remember a day when a dread cost 800mil and we used to jump 3 regions up hill and in the snow both ways just to get a killmailstop being lazy take gates
xenuria has started the next campaign so i think it holds waterand while i hate to be that person sourceof course running on a platform of outsider will attract likeminded people in a regular democracy outsiders might also be able to change the system a little its just a shame that this isnt a regular democracyxenuria would have bleated about change and the 13 other csms would actually improve the game whenever ccp would ask xenuria about something gamerelated hed default to someone who knew the subject at hand as he stated earlier in this threadxenuria if true to his word would become an empty seat solving only xenurias egoproblem namely the problem that xenuria cant get elected to csmand of course xenuria changes positions between each csm election its just a matter of whatever new dumb idea he thinks will solve his problem
19th out of 75 isnt telling the whole story thoughif you want to see a csm with him on it thatd be a 25 person csm he doesnt have any support from people who voted for people who were actually elected gaining a pitiful number of votes from overspill
you know whats pitiful an incrowd so terrified of reform that they take steps to disenfranchise people who represent a threat to their world view reform will happen with or without me that much is certain your efforts are in vain
and what steps are being taken to disenfranchise peopleplease list them or youre just libelling people
situationsupers are imbalanced to game breaking proportions these ships can have ehp that rivals or surpasses a titan the dps of a dread and can be spider tanked beyond the levels of a triage carrier all while being ewar immune furthermore theyUFFFDre the sole ship that can fit the remote ecm burst module this leads to groups whose sole modus operandi is the super fleet if ccp truly wishes to make nullsec more vibrant and allow smaller entities to take space it must be accompanied with a nerf to supers backgroundin order to give smaller entities a chance at nullsec either the bar must be lowered or the effectiveness of these ships must be addressed lowering the bar and effectively giving everyone access to nukes while fun on paper would not solve the problem the height of the problem can be illustrated when s2n was disbanded in july of 2013 and lost sov in 209 systems this was all retaken in 3 days by n3 and their allies with 300 supers more recently we watched brave get evicted from their sov in catch by pl a much large alliance had no recourse against a small to moderate force of supers assessmentccp has recognized the imbalance of supers and has made numerous passes at correcting the issue theyUFFFDve nerfed the hp of supers theyUFFFDve removed regular drones and most recently theyUFFFDve nerfed jump range across the board for all capitals coming this summer theyUFFFDre removing sov grinding altogether ccp understands that a few select groups that hold all the ships that make inhabiting nullsec possible is not conducive with their goals for the game unfortunately theyUFFFDre dancing around the issue rather than addressing it directly recommendationthereUFFFDs an understood balance in the game that a big ship is ineffective against smaller ships iUFFFDve read numerous times where a battleship gets left behind in a fleet and gets torn to shreds by frigates this theme of range of effectiveness has many forms in eve but itUFFFDs a balance of power mechanic that gives eve the rockpaperscissors ecosystem we all enjoy supers do not adhere to this the increased lock time of fighters and fighter bombers is another attempt at correcting this but this does not fix the issue in fleet engagements ccp should look into how they can best restore this balance of power so that supers are effective in their role but are not the i win button that they are today for talking points one could imagine ccp removing the ability of fighter bombers to attack subcaps or a siege like module that would allow a super to deploy their fighter bombers and thus commit to the fight for an amount of time this module would also remove remote assistance but i really think this should be addressed by ccp and the community to decide which would be the most balanced way to address the issue regardless if ccp is truly working towards making a more vibrant nullsec community then they must do so with a nerf to supers
if you feel this strongly about supers could you please tell the class what you think the reasons to own one are once fozziesov comes in
it would shut down the bonuses towards defending that system
see my previous comments why should someone playing a completely different game doing something i cannot oppose be the one in control of how long it takes to capture the systems in which i live
because it would add flavour like i said this probably wouldnt be something that would happen regularly but it would be cool to have that sort of cooperation maybe this could be an optional thing and only those who have a dust army at their disposal could use bonuses to making their hq harder to take this would encourage interaction with the two games which ccps obviously trying to shoot for
how does this add flavour it places the cornerstone of your defence in the hands of console fps players in a game you cannot influence if your fps kiddies lose thats your times cut to 5 minutes all the work you put in to fortifying your home system and grinding your indexes gonenow answer my question why should someone playing a completely different game doing something i cannot oppose be the one in control of how long it takes to capture the systems in which i liveif your answer is some variation on because its cool your idea is irredeemably awfuldoes anyone other than goonwaffe even have a dust wing
if you would like to have this conversation outside the eve forums i would be happy to indulge you so long as its entirety is recorded and made available unedited to the masses
i dont see a need to take it out of the forums here will do nicely unedited and available to the masses
i would prefer a level playing field in the eve forums there are things i am not allowed to talk about but you already knew thatyou aim to bait me into violating the forum rules and removing myself as a threat i might be socially naive but i am not stupid if you honestly want to open a dialog which you have probably ascertained would implicate you than we must do so outside the forums if my claims hold no truth to them what have you to fear from this
then list it elsewhere perhaps on mediumcom if you dont have a blog of your own
that course of action is being considered trust me when i say that if i decide to go forward with that you will be one of the first to know
still a weird system to jump so far
what made you choose the name loreleiany particular history you have with that name
i think were all quite sure large coalitions wont just melt the supers down because they dont necessarily have such a great usage anymore
delete from tableitem where itemtypeid in select itemtypeid from tableitemtype where itemtypename in titansupercarrierproblem solvedyoure welcomeeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
no theyll just unsub the accounts
i support merely combining the basic missile skills into size classes small missiles medium missiles large missiles citadel missiles a little sp refunding would do us some good to even it out turrets had it right generalizing at tech one and specializing at tech two
news flash titans are of super capital classificationand no they arent that broken while more dps is nice supers die left and right in the big battle the only reason why we have so many supers is because of the over production like any other ship or item in the gameive seen people complain about the outrageous amounts of ships they can build between them and their army of alts
your argument is that standings should not affect ship skins becauseplease show me where in this thread i said that ship skins are for your ingame assets its not like buying a ship skin causes a shirt or a coffee mug to come flying out of your computer screen upon purchase your entire argument like those in my csm 10 thread is based on conflation
this is what you saidcurrently we pay for the use of skins and vanity items with aur which can be purchased with isk or realworld money or with isk from someone who bought it with aur there are apparently plans to put skins in lp stores but those arent shipping right now not everyone is aware of thatthe root of the problem is that your op is ambiguous which is why telling people to go read it is unhelpful if i understand you correctly youre referring to something like scaling the lpisk cost of a vanity item in a corporations lp store to the buyers standing with that corporation if so all you have to do is say i was referring to the lp and isk cost from a loyalty point store not the aur cost from the nes and all the ambiguity goes awayon that subject ccp has also floated the possibility of pitching the standings system in favor of something else that doesnt invalidate your idea but it means that implementation might have to wait for and be modified to conform to a new system
clearly being a victim is more important to you than getting the truth outyoure neither a threat nor really claiming anything usefullike the worst of conspiracy theorists you make vague pseudoclaims back down when pressed and when pressed further you claim oppression of opinion and postulate that elaboration is on the wayso lets tell it as it is right your opinions arent oppressed unless you mean by the weight of counterevidence in the cases i have observed your claims of disenfranchisement are based on other things than evidence and when pressed for evidence apparently you might consider doing something somewhere but youre not sure of anything but where this information will not be forthcoming namely here where its relevant you explicitly libel or threaten those who asks for evidence for your claimsin short youre not socially naive as much as a poor manipulator and peoples man dishonest and only out to promote the solution that xenuria is elected to the csm trouble is the only problem this could potentially solve is your battered egorun in csm 11 12 13 14 and n1 i invite youits hilarious to see you flail and fail and i am sure that youll get elected somewhere around csm 25 which will soothe the pain of having been rejected all prior elections
your argument is logical but ultimately based on false information i am not dishonest i am brutally honest my ego is not important to the csm or to ccp in fact my ego is not even relevant to the discussion constantly bringing up ego as a retort to my platform says more about you and the caricatures you are perpetuated than it does me or my platform i would also remind you that if you want to accuse me of something as you have a habit of doing than you could at least provide some proof of your claims you come off as a troll at worst and a well meaning hypocrite at best when you shout for evidence while simultaneous providing none when the burden of proof rests on you to do so i already cited my sources were are yours
lie you refuse to answer questions all the time or give false information your platform is a charicature on its own so thats not really hardof course your ego is a part of this what else would your candidacy ever hope to helpyouve failed to answer numerous questions into even the simplest parts of your platform which is among the reasons why its not hard to see that youre either a blowhard knownothing or a fraud both of which would be easily accounted for by a hurt egodo i need to reiterate the questions or where people asks for sources or is it enough to say that the questions have been asked contrary to you i can quote specific questions that you have avoided or rejected or postulated answered or simply failings of yours giant gaps in your knowledge regarding both csm and electionsahahahahahahahahoh god thats rich after asking for sources for your claims in here several times you now have the gall to claim you have cited themnoi saw you cite a single source that of eve players women make up a specific percentage and the percentage to my knowledge was true this is the only thing ive ever seen you citing and its a red herring at bestbesides im not postulating things outside this thread or your earlier candidacies such as earlier candidacy videos and threads what ive done is point out where you dont cite sources argue against yourself dont know what youre talking about etc likewise did a number of other people some of whom actually tried to improve your platform at which point you called them trolls as wellyoure glorious entertainment and the best weapon against your own relevancy
i suppose there is no reasoning with you
for that to work youd have to use reason true enoughharsh requirement i know but im sure gendler souls like nariya will teach you if you askbe careful though if you get smarter you might come to realise that being right takes both humility and effort
i still have 23 kinda important questions that were never answered from the last csm thread
an in game asset that youre buying with real life money hence out of game purchasesletting someone buy something cheaper based on in game standings is the same as putting a barrier between people and their money your penalising someone for not playing one specific aspect of the game ccp will never do it and for good reason as its an absurd idea for a business to entertain
by that logic plex should cost a flat amount because at present an unfair advantage is giving to people who wish to purchase plex with isk instead of real life money ship skins are not planned to be an out of game purchase as far as i know they can be bought with aurum or isk both of which are ingame commodities buying isk for irl cash is illegal and considered rmt so i dont think your argument holds any water
except plex is a flat rate everyone ingame buys it for the selling price adn anyone can buy it at that price at any given time no one gets a magical 10 off for standingsand plex bought with real cash is the same price for everyone because no one gets an arbitrary discount that no one else gets access to simply because they played one part of the game a whole lotso yeah plex is a flat price out of game and a fluctuating price ingame but its a price that is equal to everyone no one has any 0s added or subtracted from the numberwere saying your proposal would create an imbalance because again using the plex example someone with security standings between 05 gets 5 off plex purchases and people with security standing 510 get 10 off people with low security status would be put at a real world disadvantage against people who have a higher security standing because a commodity would be given magical discounts to people who played a certain aspect of the game and not others so for every plex a pirate could buy to fund his pvp a mission runner could buy 11 plex which means the mission runner is the one determining the standard for plex sales adn the pirate gets no say because he is at an inherent market disadvantage that can only be circumvented by spending more real life cash than his opponent for the same number of commodotiesbasically your proposal creates a situation of pay to win or to more specific pay less to win and penalizes groups out of game purchasing abilities based on their ingame playstylenow if you simply want to argue discounts on lpisk items only discounts not applying to cash based purchases then we have a workable idea and if that is the case please make it understood clearly in the op to avoid further confusion but please i ask of you your csm thread is not the place to break down and discuss individual ideas if you would kindly take your proposals make individual fi threads for them or contribute to existing threads when necesary then link your post in your op statement to show your support for individual ideas that we can then view for discussion within the appropriate forum that would be nice it will allow your csm thread to remain clean and orderly and entirely focused on the actual act of attempting election rather than specific details of each proposal
so ive been considering this for a while and am surprised i have yet to see it brought up to the csm or even for discussion a quick search yielded no resultsthis is a proposal to the community to see if anyone would be interested besides myself in a column added to the market window under buy and sell orders that displayed the name of the character  corporation that placed the orderin the current system the orders on the market are anonymous in order to see who is selling or buying certain items you would have to buy or sell at least 1 of a certain item this is not too much of a problem on small priced items but on larger ones it can be unrealisticas of now i see no value in the anonymity factor except for that of market manipulators who usually tend to profit heavily off of the average playerwhy do i think eve should show who is placing the orders it adds accountability to not only the marketplace but in the entire economy of eve it also adds to the value of namesake for an individual corporations and alliances alike involved in industry youd be able to see obvious market manipulations and who was behind them possibly choose to attempt to not support itthem possibility to lower the amount of market manipulation it aligns it with the rest of the current marketplace namely the contract system character trading etc in which all display the party initiating the transaction potential for more strategy  tactics in pvp  industry by easily being able to identify targets supply lines  economic warfare industrial warfare etc adding to the sandbox effect seems like a reasonable and attainable request for some future patch if ever supportedwhy not although i did think up a few potential cons id rather hear from the eve community on what possible cons they believe there to be for this proposalregardsoslo
you know that currently you cant pick and choose which orders to buy from you always buy from the cheapest and sell to the one with the highest buy price regardless of the price you actually set
of course and i do not propose any change to that mechanici believe your reply is referring to the following statementyoud be able to see obvious market manipulations and who was behind them possibly choose to attempt to not support itthemif that is the case then i didnt mean to imply that someone would be able to choose who to buy fromsell to but simply when to buy or sell time is one of the most integral factors in the marketexampleyoure in the market for a new ship you go to jita or the nearest hub and check the market you either choose to buy from the lowest sell order or be patient place and a buy order waiting for it to fillin the current system if you were not in a rush or had no care for spending isk then youd probably just buy the ship if you were a little more isk conscientious then you may choose to place a buy order or even wait for the prices to drop in anycase you still have the choice of when you purchase an item or place a buy orderif you choose to place a buy order then your best bet for information is the price history tablegraph to tell if the item is over or underpricedif there were names displayed then there is another source of intelinformation to play off of you would theoretically be able to gauge if the market seems somewhat normal or manipulatedfor instance if one name or corporation was attached to the 10 lowest sell orders or if one name was attached to the highest 10 buy orders you could choose not to compete with that entity by simply not placing a buy order higher or not placingadjusting a sell order to below their price this not only helps the average player but also adds flavor to marketeersnow just to note i understand how easy it would be to combat this by using numerous alts this proposal is not meant to cure any single problem that exists like market manipulation it is meant simply as another tool or access to information that i believe should be public the current system of anonymity makes no sense to me or does not seem to serve any real purpose except that of protecting market manipulationalso like stated before it seems like an easy change comparatively to implement and wouldnt take programmersdevelopers away from more important issues like pvp changes oslo
i would love to see this it would add depth to the market and stimulate interaction between marketeers definite 1
surely youd just find out the names of a bunch of market alts with no connection to whoever their main happens to be
you would see patterns and would then be more inclined to start researching which corp they belonged to etc what reason is there not to do it
i dont disagree that there is some information that could be garnered from this but it is pretty limited especially against those doing many of the things you would probably be looking for player name would only work for those traders who use a single character to work the market corp name could provide a more aggregate view related to a player or group working in concert through multiple characters but i think this quickly gets buried by the fact that so many trade alts are from npc corps could it provide some information sure enough to matter probably not would it be a big deal to program from the developers standpoint nothe bigger question would be is this more information than should be available publicly and in real time when you make a transaction in the stock market individuals dont know who they bought from or sold to it is a brokered transaction institutional investors see who is buying and selling but even there it can be disguised to some extentim not entirely adverse to the suggestion here but given the shady nature of eve from a gameplay perspective i highly doubt the developer would view market transparency as something they would choose to endorsebefore they ever get to this i would prefer that they fix what steve was describing you do always buy from the lowest seller but you dont always pay the lowest price if because of volume reasons you select a higher price you buy from that seller along with all the sellers at prices below him however you end up paying the higher price for everything seems a little silly but perhaps its just a feature doesnt work that way on the sell side but v0v

rumour has it that the svipul is getting power grid nerfed in regard of some people using a 10mn afterburner on iti can agree that using a 10mn afterburner on a small vessel is silly but it does not come without having to offline other modules or skip a gun or shield extender or spend alot of isk for a good implant to be able to have a complete fit which meet up with the demand of the capsuleer pilotanyhow with my current setup i have 65 powergrid left and i think that it would be a bad thing to reduce the powergrid at all or to much because then you would not be able to have a decent fit anymorelinking my svipul setup for reference highslot 6x 280mm howitzer artillery ii medslot limited 1mn mwd 2x tracking computer ii medium azeotropic ward salubrity i lowslot 2x gyrostabilizer ii micro auxilliary power core ii nanofiber interal structure ii rigs 3x small core defence field extenter ialso pay notice to the fact that i am using a 5 powergrid implant and a micro auxilliary power core ii which is not apart of the ships powergrid from the start i also have the skill powergrid management at lvl 5 25 bonus to powergridpowergrid implant inherent implants squire power grid management eg605as much as i can agree on its wrong to be able to fit a 10mn afterburner to this ship i find as wrong to render the ship into something useless and not so tactical as the ship is supposed to beso my proposition is as followsmake the differently sized afterburner and microwarpdrives locked for specific ship classessizes1mn abmwd for frigates destroyers and other smaller vessels i havent mentioned10mn abmwd for cruisers battlecruisers haulers and other medium sized vessels i havent mentioned100mn abmwd for battleships and biggerthis would really make the game more balanced without gimping ships in themselves and least it would resolve this issue with small ships fitting oversized modules on them which means there will be no need to tweak ships in regards of this dilemmaproblem and thereby riscing to render them into something really badon the contrary to this proposal the fitting concept of eve online would be quite boring if you would not be able to experiment with different sized modules shield extenders armor plates and so on on various ships and sizes so my proposal for this module size restriction is only in relation to active speed modules this is only because a 10mn ab svipul does about the same speed as a 1mn mwd svipul but the difference there will be no signature increase due to ab used instead of mwd good luck with tracking that on the other hand you could always adapt your fleet composition to counter this issue with specific ships that has long range webifying target painting and energy neutralizing which in my opinion is what is so awesome about eve online you can do anything if you just put some effort into itthe big question is do we want to have a open universe where more is possible or where most things are strictly controlled and less innovative to play around withnone the less if changes has to be made i find it better to limit the different sized active speed modules to specific ship sizes than gimping each ship in themselves in a general notice the svipul was only used as example with the risc of rendering ships into something less able to reach a decent fit best regards  murkelost
please use the correct thread for tactical destroyer feedback thank you
x amount of years ago changes were made to disallow ships to have anything but ammo scripts etc in their cargohold while being stashed away in a capital ships ship maintenance bay reason for this was because at that time regular carriers were beneficially used as haulers and commonly used for transporting vast amounts of high end ore out of 00 to the safe space of empire how safe it might be  anyhow since the scenery of capabilities that comes along with a capital these days in regard of jump fatigue and a limited jumprange i would like to propose for this limit of what to store in the cargohold of a ship stored in a ship maintenance bay to be revokedsince jumpfreighters are present they fold a much more favourable task for doing logistic work as wellmy reason behind this proposition is simply because it would be quite nice to have your secondary modules in the specific subcapital ships cargohold instead of having to mix it along with the capitals secondary modules in fleet hangar as well as with every other subcaps modulesjust a thought

thats a strawman argument and you know it nothing in game has any effect what so ever on the 1995 plex price just regular deals available to everyone simultaneously
you just made my argument for me thanks
there is not enough intercorp aggression as a result of market interaction i think that seeing the same corps day after day competing with your orders and 001 isking you would lead to greater interaction of the shooty kind again why not you already see who the contracting entity is in the contract system this is similar
i would like to know where we are on the margin trading scams discussions at this point in time i see we all have been talking about this for years and i for one believe it is now time that the talk stops and action is taken will there be a perfect solution no however the best solution to this problem will be any solution eve players will adapt everyone fears change but we will adapt this problem is a game mechanic exploit i for one want the csm to fully look into this and come up once and for all a understanding of exploits vs scamming which one is worth having in the game next i would like to see a solution no sitting on your thumbs and listen to all the complainers of omg this will happen and this will happen always remember eve players will adapt i really dont care if we remove margin trading altogether i really dont care if you colorize the buy order as purple for margin buying do something that will kill this horrible exploit and make the markets integrity strong again something that should be a constant in the market is integrity ccp runs the market we just play in it
how much did you get taken for
nopeyou do not get to remove one of the cornerstones of the games economy just because youre too dumb to do your homework before getting greedy
the margin trading scam is barely a scam there is nothing there that couldnt be reproduced by someone just canceling or beating you to an order margin trading is too important to the eve economy to remove on a whim i wouldnt be adverse to some solution that doesnt break the trading servers while leaving the functionallity of the skill intact but really csm please spend your energies on more important things than this
first off i love this game i have been playing since 06 i have seen many exploits and bugs and what not i believe this is an important matter to say it isnt would be foolish i hold ccp to a higher standard than any other gaming company they have created a great landscape for us i see ccp as the overseer and or the central bank of the eve market when the overseer doesnt believe its important to address an issue that is clearly an exploit but then allows everyone to do it  why do we need to obey the other eula terms i mean this is drastic thinking but it sets a bad precedence does this exploit need to be addressed yes if we have margin trading then i for one and many others would love to have a margin call freeze assets until the bill is paid that is harsh but its a start to another lengthy discussion there may be other pressing matters like what is coming this summer the market hasnt seen any love for a while now i just want a fair trade agreement in high security space null sec can be as ruthless as they want to be in high security space this should not stand we have rules in high security space take your scamming to low sec or null come let us reason together
either youve just changed your stance or you dont understand what youre sayingthere should not be any discounts for people with higher in game standings than people without exactly how it is now
your not very good at this you need to pick an argument and stick with it
might be if you follow your own advice this csm bid will crawl closer to the finishing lineswapping arguments like youre doing first that things you buy with rl money and perhaps later with isk should receive a discount  then when others asks you to explain it wont  then when others follow the argument to its logical conclusion call it off topic  then deny that buying cosmetic items for rl money has anything to do with buying plex for rl money  then then somehow manages to to reverse course underway such that no ingame action should impact the price you pay in rl moneyxenuria youre arguing against yourself and claiming that it defeats other peoples argumentsship skins and other cosmetic items are currently entering the game through rl money expenditure represented by aurum you argue that ingame standings should give a discount when you purchase cosmetic items from associated factions that would give a rl money discount to a specific gameplayothers have asked you very specificly if you meant with isklp purchases alonethat would save your arguments entirely yet you have not said so and you havent responded to their posts one might hazard the guess that its because it isnt solely isklp purchases you mean hence some confusionpersonally i had expected you to wait a few pages more before denouncing your own platform but i guess your campaigning skill is a zerosum game when you improve your op you make a hackjob of the later posts
i support this

eve was never designed for capitals the whole reason they die left and right in eve is because they have been nerfed to the point where anything can kill them killing them isnt some incredible feat and the reason there are so many is because they were originally made to be rare powerhouses that cemented empirescapitals should just go until a decade when eve is at the point where ships themselves are dynamic enough that something thats as powerful as a capital is supposed to be can be introduced without fear of mass production or total dominance but lets face it short of an alliance being required to foot a material and isk maintenence bill for every ship they can field theres no reason to not make masses of whatever is the strongestthe problem with capitals can be traced abck to the fact eve is a game about the individual there is no literal such thing as corps or alliances or coalitions everything in measured on the individual and made to allow the individual to empower themselves which means there is no scaling disadvantage to creating a massive sprawling empire bloated with insurmountable numbers because it isnt a bloated entity dragged down by its own logistics its a collection of individuals all equally empowered and capable within the game mechanics lending mechanics to enforce n1 in every regard not just combat because outside missions with a set pay there is little and often times less wasted potential with a venture no matter how many you stack into itand on that basic prinicple of eves design capitals are an impossible dream no matter what form they are in unless mechanics dictate they are powerless and only good with 1 or 2 of each type on field at once they will always be mass produced until they receive another class wide nerf and changing them to anything other than what they currently are in respect to roles will just make them even bigger cammand ships making cammand ships no longer worth their price for function
let us reason together margin trading is as vital a tool for trading as tackling is for pvp 99 of margin trades are not scams andthe scams are as easy to spot as a ggate camp on an outgate
i never said it was not vital i agree it is vital part of the economy i want to know when and where are we going to get a fix to this exploit where is the game mechanic that lets the little guy file suit for false promotion of pricing where are my space attorneys lol i feel a statement needs to be made by ccp on this acknowledge that its an exploit and anyone caught doing it then gets the two strike rule why dont they do that it would take too much man power if that takes too much man power then this problem is bigger than we really understand do you not agree i would like the csm to address this issue seriously come up with a fix to this exploit i will be shrugged off because i was scammed or whatever i am looking out for the newbs many people have quit and never came back because of simple things like this the market needs to be solid not ran by a bunch of people who are untrustworthy ccp runs the market i hope they do the right thing by coming up with a solution dont listen to the trillionaires listen to the little guys who made them trillionaires wars are fought over isk lets hit the pocket books and see if they can fight a clean fight i mean come on lets get our hands dirty and see what we can come up with
its not an exploit
if you feel the need to prevent the false promise of pricing on the market id like to hear you thoughts on the false promise of see selling you a navy issue megathron when i open a trade window with youas the good malcanis has said its not an exploit you believe the market to be full of promises  thats your mistake
if you decide to invest in and make use of the market you should be aware of the true price of items you may deal inthis means gathering information on the item before going ahead with any investment you may makeif people run headlong into a deal and invest before gathering information that is readily available then the fault falls squarely on themselves if things go wrongthe funny thing with this scam is it relies upon the greedy the ones thinking they are going to have one over on another player they see quick easy money to be made off someone else the kicker is its a game of pvp and they soon find they didnt do their homework were out manoeuvred and ended up losing to the other playerno order is guaranteed none so when playing the market the more information you gather the less chance there is of losing isk but its the market and there will always be a chance of losing isktldr stop being bad at pvp in the market and if you lose to other players stop whining about itoh and its not an exploit destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
was the question posed to the op in the very first reply too difficult to understand this might not be cp but we still want details
ccp rise feedback request  margin trading and accurate market uinow is this not an exploit not calling an exploit not an exploit is ridiculous come on folks stop focusing on staying the same and brushing it aside lets come together and fix this once and for all bring some pain to those who want to put big buy orders and not want to pay the risk should work both ways not in favor of the buyer
he said that it exploits the mechanic much like an oil company exploits an oil deposit he didnt say that margin trading scams were exploits
its no more an exploit than suicide ganking iswhich means it isnt an exploit its just creative use of the mechanics to prey on the greedy and dumboh myyyyyyou do know that people routinely game the market system right by buying up all available orders and then putting them back up at prices 10 higher than before  or by cornering a market within a given area  or by blowing up any competition you do know that some of the biggest funders of code and several other well known merc groups are other industrialists and traders right  some combination of the above see goonswarms ice interdiction policy some years agomarket integrity in eve is decided by how big your wallet is or by how much you can blow upno no they dontthey can set how many minerals are required for building something how much lp and isk you need for that special thing and can decide drop ratesbut how much those minerals are worth is up to the playershow much that lp or item is worth is up to playershow much a players time is worth to them is decided by the playersand heres the best part its all more or less subjectivethere are miners out there who think that the minerals they earn are free thats why so many miners just sell their rocks well below the average pricethere are industrialists who just want to unload their stock and they dont care about taking a loss because the demand of their product is already quite low and wont recover due to the massive stockpiles that other players have this is why procurers often sell for less than their mineral valueccp dont run the market they just keep it online and let more or less pure libertarian economics do what it does best make as much money as possible be damned of the consequences to lesser people
you can exploit something that isnt an exploit when i gank an afk miner i am exploiting the fact that that player is too lazy to pay attention to his ship but my actions are not using an exploit as i am engaging in legal gameplay if i evade concord after that gank however then i am using an exploit and will face sanction from ccp for exploiting a loophole in the game to escape the consequences intended by the developer ccp rise is using exploit in the first sense in that sentence ccp rise has already looked at this and the lack of action means there is likely no easy solution to the issue removing the skill is a nogo and any solution to link orders and current escrow amounts is not technically feasible due to the massive overhead it would require recalculating every margin order after every transaction from what i understand what else do you propose ccp to do then the scammer already loses the fees and increasing them for failed margin orders will really only hurt legitimate overextended traders as the scammer has plenty of profit margin to play with
the issue here is that the client via the market interface is essentially lying to the player by showing an order which cant actually be filledi really think no one cares that the eve client is broken at least colorize the margin trade orders
it doesnt lie to youyour greed does
really it doesnt lie after a person from ccp says the client lies then everyone dismisses it as not a lie anyone else out there want to fix this or am i the only one
half the things in the client are a lie see jita local we are all well aware of the creative use some players make of the margin trading skill to post misleading orders ccp rise has acknowledged it as well as you linked so ccp is also well aware of the phenomenon do you actually have a proposal to fix it or are you just here to complain about how you can sometimes lose at a pvp game when someone with a better understanding of the mechanics outsmarts you
 thisanother example you see that ship you are flying it does not actually exist according to the server all the server sees is a sphere your ship literally has no front or back until you moveso whatever direction your ship visually has is nothing more than an approxamation sometimes not even that in the case of big ship as they will often warp sideways so you cannot always rely on visual ques to know where you are headingas for seeing a margin scam its pretty easy just cross reference the prices on eve central or look for historical trends on the ingame market window no history is a red flagmost importantly if it looks like you will be able to make any significantly high margin more than 5 by buying and selling in the same station it is probably a scam
sigh no point dealing with a troll i guess you seem to have no interest in having a rational conversation so im withdrawing from the conversation entirely
there is a door with a button it does not work maintenance pleace the door wont open even after 10 yearsi can not even go to my clan mate who is also in stationwhat a  maintenance is that 
yeah its only been since 2010 that wis has been about at all and we dont have clans in eve
ok so soon we will have had much of the promised stuff done corps starbases and much more so personally i would rather ccp take a few months with a big team once the big stuff is done and finish this feature as i understand it was quite far along but the deployment of the feature was too slow and underwhelming and with that it meet with much criticism a riot in jita  but with the new dev cycle i dont see having a big team on this to get it to deployment as an issue there are many people who still dream of their space bar or being able to have a corp or alliance meeting in an office on a space station somewhere plus with the new structures promised being able to walk about them would be a nice bonus having to go to a command center to take control of the weapons would be very cool or have a situation room where you can plan and command battles that kinda thing would be fun
i endorse this product andor servicei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i think it can be solved much easyerif you bought a implant and your pod is destroyedyou will have a copy in your clonebay to be used again  i think that would be a much more smarter thing to do in that case you keep the market going and you will have more choices for the next clone in the clone bayand you are not affraid of losing 800  mil of isk the next time so pvp can be more atractive for the people who dont pvp because of thatso taking the pvp willingness away from the clone improves the game and yes i am a miner in hs  and refuse to get killed in low because of the expensive cloon stuffand yes this game is very boring for me to so this is a good topic but ccp is not intrested in this kind of behaviour or topicsit is so called player driven they say  but it is notthey make money on it so they keep it this way but also a lot of people disapear from the game after a while and thats true tofor me personaly my last goal is on the way own build charon and after that there is none for me in hs annymore so i guit perhaps to as a miner also called carebear i refuse to get blown up in low with my expensive clone in it
rather than removing my options why dont we increase your options
do we really need to have a method to speed up learning especially ones that benefit the oldest and richest players why not just flatten it out and find new uses for implant slots
if learning implants are going to stay i very much like the idea of moving them to slots 79 it is the interference with pirate sets that bothers me most learning drugs would be great but this does favour rich players
how do learning drugs intrinsically favour rich players
because they will be high demand items that will have an isk cost someone like me can buy millions of them and keep them stocked in stations everywhere to stay boosted 247new players probably wont even know they exist and will have to choose between learning faster or buying another atronand unlike current implants you cant save money just by playing more carefully a new player who is very alert wont lose their 3s because they wont get podded in hiseclowsec in your booster system the new player will always run out whereas rich players will never run out
how do they not either they are expensive enough that players need to consider whether they are worth the isk which favors the wealthy or they are so cheap that they just become mandatory and everyone uses them without thinking the later case adds nothing but busy work to the game while the former favours the wealthy there needs to be some trade off to using them to make the choice meaningful and isk is not the best choice as it favours established players
i originally liked the idea of boosters but the problem i see is the general message to the players pay  subscription and get a running skill queue pay or grind and get a faster queue this is far better than pay or grind more and unlock the fun but still not good imo
you ran into your own law on this one malc
i have removed a rule breaking post and those quoting itthe rules8 use of profanity is prohibited the use of profanity is prohibited on the eve online forums this includes the partial masking of letters using numbers or alternate symbols and any attempts at bypassing the profanity filter isd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
you can quote and misquote him if you wish it still doesnt help your cause why you may ask well because once it was explained to him he dropped it like a hot potato you see the market lies about every order as none of them are ever guaranteed none so if any change is required i would say it is to inform pilots of that factbut that is quite frankly irrelevant because that is not your issue here your issue is that fact that you judged a single buysell order as reflecting the true price of an item if you had taken the time to gather more information of its true value you wouldnt then have paid over the odds for said itemthis is what happeneda there you were looking at someone offering a good price for an item and it just so happened someone else was selling that item for less you thought lol someones really dropped a clanger and i could make some quick easy money here off the back of some poor clueless pilot you then bought said item for an inflated price and the buy order failed well if ever someone counted chickens before they were hatched you did as no order is ever guaranteed so there you are left with over priced goods which you can still sell at a loss so thats a bonus i guessthis is what should have happenedb you saw someone offering a good price for an item and it just so happened someone was selling it for less you should have then thought oh i could make some isk here let me check to see if that buy and sell order reflects the true value of that itemafter checking you would have said to yourself oh dear some muppet is going to fall for that if they dont do the proper checks or even bought the item far cheaper elsewhere and still tried to sell it to the buy order just for gigglesbut you went with a and then topped it off with a forum whine just to show everyone how bad you are at market pvpdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i would love to understand why i am being attacked for trying to get something done about the margin trading scam or fraud as the case may be whether i was scammed or not it does not matter whatsoever i really do not understand the way a faction of eve players value fraud you can try to divide and conquer me all you want i will not back down on this issue when a buy order is up and has a price the toon or corp which placed that buy order should pay they should pay by losing isk or loss of standings or loss of skill points to the margin trading skill in rl there are severe penalties for margin trading fraud in eve there is no risk for doing so whatsoever no risk to cheat the market and the newbs to me that is unacceptable i really find it horrendous that we have people in this forum that want nothing to do with fixing a scammingfraud problem there is something so blatant in this thread that needs to be looked at oh this guy is butt hurt cause he got scammed no i didnt get scammed it was pure and simple fraud fraud is not acceptable in any known market except in eve that is a problemi am asking an begging any csm member who reads this to please look at this problem look at it closely and understand that its the client that needs to be fixed i dont want the margin trade skill gone i believe it is good for the game the eve client needs to represent truth
the lack of sympathy you find here is because the margin trading scam is not some exploit that allows another player to sneak into a new players wallet and steal their isk as you seem to want to portray it the scam is basically just false advertising similar to many other scams out there that attempt to trick a mark into making a poor trade decision by confusing misleading or lying to a player about the value of a particular trade good it is the players greed that blinds them the risks of buying some module they have never heard of to sell for a quick profit or at a price way above the historic value which the client provides accurately tricking a player like this is not an exploit my friend that is market pvpthe problem with increasing penalties is that it hurts legitimate users of the margin trading skill whenever i trade on margin which is most of the time as with all serious traders i already am careful about straying too close to my limit as failed orders are penalized by loss of my broker fees if you added some punitive penalty it would hurt more market traders than any scammers but the real problem is what will you say if the margin trade scammer accepts the consequence of the punishment if some penalty was put in place and you or someone like you fell for the scam six months downtheline you will come to the forums complaining that the penalties are not tough enough as you managed to still get scammed just like all those people that lose an overloaded transport ship coming here to demand more consequences for suicide gankers and the cycle would continue until the margin trading skill was unusable i have no problem with adding more information to the client to help traders identify potential problem orders if 3 years from now ccp decides that they want to completely rewrite the market trading system i would have no objection to colourcoding orders that were made on margin or that lacked enough isk to cover if they can do that for now though everything ccp said has indicated this is not technically possible and even if it was it really should be a low priority for developer resources since there are plenty of other ways to trick people into thinking something is worth more than it is
because fraud is in the eye of the beholderfrom my perspective you are removing money from people with more greed and money than intelligence and you gain intelligence through experience and you gain experience by going through the situation it yourself and then you realize that the horrible thing that happened to you actually made you think act and behave smarter because there is always another such horrible thing around the cornerfor disclosure i fell for the margin scam early in my eve life i now look very closely at anything i buy and sell rather than rightclick donethis isnt real lifethe context of eve is a dystopia its not meant to work right or be fair its meant to be an exercise in darwinism and the market is probably the closest you will ever get to a pure libertarian market model which expresses that darwinism mantra very well i mean seriously the game is full of megacorporations and empires stripmine lush and verdant moons to construct massive supercapital ships sometimes with slave labor to wipe out hundreds of thousands of ships in single engagements each ship with crews numbering from the dozens to the thousands all the while rival factions within each megacorporation and empire send in pirates to shoot and assassinate at each other or commandeer one of the aforementioned supercapitals and pile drive it into a station to destroy any chance of peace talks while another faction simply goes out hunting for victims on the spacelanes and literally drain their bodies of blood for ritual sacrifices and you the mighty immortal a being given power through implants that are not even designed for your physiology a being that is designed to wage war conflict and amass wealth in the hopes you will work on behalf of your empire slaughter all of them wholesale before making a mistake and losing several thousand of your crew whose families will never be notified or paid any compensation because  you you have more important matters to look into like buying a new battleshipbreathesoh there is a risk there is always a riskhowever that risk is dependent on other players actually understanding what it is you are doing and most people dont have a mind for economics much less economics with few rules or restrictionsbut yeah there are ways to throw a wrench into a market manipulators plans and there are ways you can screw over a margin scammer you just have to understand the rules and toss any rl notions of morality or ethics which frankly have no place in a game all that matters are the rules and spirit of the game in the context of the game itselfwell agree to disagree here some of the best stories of eve are where one person screws over a whole mass of people or a whole mass of people burn everything just causeexamplesthe end of bobthe end of goonswarm v1the eve intergalactic bank scamsocratics downfallthe first revenant killgoonswarm ice interdictionhulkageddonposageddonthe game needs less free intel and give more opportunities for people to scam and cause more conflict because conflict is fun
if rule 1 of eve is dont fly what you cant afford to lose then rule 2 is if it looks too good to be true then it probably isthis goes for bait ships op ships theyll get nerfed sooner or later and strangely lucrative looking market orders
scams are fraud so yes you got scammed that you keep ranting without sharing the juicy details of the story makes me think were talking in excess of 10 billionany chance of the scammer coming forward and telling this riveting tale
no that is eveyou got greedy and didnt gather all the relevant information before making an investment you still have the goods but paid way more than their true value no one but you is to blame suck it updestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i feel like your head would explode if you knew about fractional reserve banking irlthe real world revolves around margin stuff just like eve does for traders its nice not to have 30 of your capital tied to orders that might not fill for weeksif you do 30 seconds of research youll see that its probably a scam of some sortthen youre mad about not having any repercussions well theres nobody stopping you from hiring a merc to deal with the person you could just as easily go after them yourselfccp wont do anything about this broken mechanic because there is nothing broken about it
i took the liberty of fixing your post
in eve if it looks too good to be true not only is it definitely too good to be true but you are about to take it up the keister if you dont move out with a quicknesseve is not a game of fair with the single exception of everyone gets to play by the same set of rules how i use those rules to screw you over kill your ship steal your loot and deprive you of your economic opportunities however is completely open and i in no way obliged to treat you with honesty respect or any sense of ethical considerationyou are a victim waiting for the axe to fall until you come to terms with thatit took me three years to figure that out and i still ocassionally get butt plowed when i leap before i lookeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
and the continuation of climbing the ladder begins again
no youre just upset over some pixels
hand up everyone in this thread who personally discussed this issue with ccp rise face to face and can therefore claim equal understanding of his intentanyonebueller anyone
as an advancing player in eve online i have often wondered why there is not an option to pay to have your skill points reset allowing a player to respend already trained skill pointsthis would allow one to change play styles and reduce the amount of time it takes to go from one style of game play to anotherbasicly for a fee of 3000 to as much as 6000 once every 30 days a player could log into their account management website and pay to have all their skill points reset except for the basic skill points a fresh character starts with all current trained skill points would be removed from skills allowing the player to log in and re spend his or her points to the desired skills they wish to have benefits fromas training skills is a matter of time and money starting out a player may want to try a bit of everything before they narrow down on a game style path being able to rest and re spend those skill points no longer going to be used will save them more time and allow them to move along quickly into their new choicesi would gladly pay to have this done as i have chosen to step away from mission running to go into industrial aspects of the gamewould love to hear feedback from others and hope those who can make this happen see its value
because this is eve where your choices have consequencesif the meta changes from the current sentry ishtars and rail tengus to something more like pulse legions and arty lokis then it should not take a UFFFD15 payment to ccp to immediately change my skills from a perfect tengu pilot to a perfect legion pilot with absolutely no effort on my partif you make the choice to train tengus over legions in this situation then you reap the consequences when the meta shifts
this is a terrible idea for many reasons but the most simplest is that it makes skill choices inconsequential allowing a respec even for a monetary cost would remove any individuality from characters as any 60m sp character is exactly the same as any other if it were to happen it would have to be in a limited form not a complete reset and at a penalty like 21 or 31 sp exchange personally i think the value of the individuality and history of each character is more important than some impatient player moving a few million sps around if you want a new skill focus start a new accountcharacter or just head to the character bazaar and pick one up
how about if i could pay 30 to have all your skill points randomised
i understand the aspects of your disagreementbut unlike most mmos a character going from one aspect of the game to a whole new aspect has little to no effect on the actual character itself as the player still remains the sameas far as tech 3 ships go if you dont hybrid then your just an idiot to begin with as any good pilot in eve knows choices are key when it comes to missions and to pvplimiting oneself to just one class of ships is kinda not worth it when there are advantages to training and skilling all 4 classesby that i mean amarr caldari gallente and minmatar class ships
but eve is not real life and as such is just a gameits no different than training a paladin in world of warcraft find out you hate being a tank pay out the gold to have your talents reset and respec your character to holyif you dont wish to pay to change your skills around then dontbut for those who would wish to try a new avenue of the game without the hours and hard earned cash they have already paid out go to waist to train a new character or to blow isk to buy someone elses character then paying to have your trained skill points reset becomes validit has little to no real consequence to either ccp or the community on a whole its another source of revenue for them
can you explain why you feel that choices made in a game that is all about the consequences of your actions should carry no consequences
one the client doesnt currently support his nor does the new skins system seem to support actually changing the model on a shipalso creating or adjusting models is a lot of work and creates more work for every new ship skin they create so its impractical for them to make different versions of every ship for every player who happens to not like a new model or an old one or whatever
yeah what they said boosters would presumably be reasonably expensive or they would just be a default no choice so people who can afford to pay for a continuous supply are effectively trading isk for sp
none of the above why because the fix to your problem is already availablelike i said earlier if any change is required its to inform pilots that no order is guaranteedwhat you are asking for is a way that means those greedy lazy types dont get caught out by their own actions or should i say lack of youre asking for the removal of consequences when they try and screw over other market players and it backfires due to their incompetencebut judging by your lack of understanding of the current mechanics i doubt that even a warning would have helped you you would still be here informing us of just how bad you are at the game if there was ever a time a corp name was apt this is itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
cmon keep attacking me when there is smoke there is fire
the game doesnt need fixing player ignorance needs fixing thats what ccp needs to fix to be fair the margin trading skill doesnt explain that margin trades will fail on empty wallets ccp doesnt need to explain the consequence of it merely the facts let players piece things together themselves
as it seems not many in this thread like what i am trying to do the basic mere basic of risk is one sided on this issue when i say one sided i mean there is 0 risk for the buyer when done correctly 0 risk for the buyer his name isnt given out he is protected no one knows who he is there can be no retaliation against him he is more protected than anyone else in this game call me greedy all you want but the guys doing the buy orders with ultimate protection are just as greedy as anyone else in this game the buyer has 0 risk against them the person many of you are defending has no risk in this game we all talk a good game about risk but risk should go both ways i want to know who is screwing me over when i get screwed over if this is market pvp then i want it like ship pvp i want to know who didnt take the order who took their money out of their wallet if you lose your ship i guarantee you are looking at that combat log looking to see who killed you i bet that combat log has the names of those who just shot you well the guys who sell to these buyers dont get that dont start with the sellers because that is a different toon that does that we know the names of the toons we buy from if a buy order is issued whether it goes through or not you should at least get the name of the toon that would be risk on the buyers part i would be happy if they had at least some risk in this game instead of being fully protected and anonymous
friend let the bitterness go you were tricked by another player and lost some isk learn from your mistake and move oneven if you knew the name of the character that listed that market order in all likelihood there is nothing you could do to him or her as a marketfocused character they might never undock and as the market is anonymous until a purchase is made there is no simple way you can know what orders or trades they are participating in your best bet for revenge is to look for similar scam buy orders where you were scammed and use some of the methods discussed in these forums to mess with that scammer but really for your mental health just chalk it up as a pvp loss and a learning experience and let it go
but there is riskthe scammer has just spent brokers fees nonrefundable brokers fees these fees scale in proportion to how overpriced the items asked for are theyve committed an amount of money to initiate the scam if nobody bites thats money lost further if nobody bites they may have an item nobody is going to buy off them margin trading scams are often done on lowvelocity items these are items that are rarely sold because theyre both crap and hard to acquire so there is risk its just not the risk you happen to want
very little risk at all ooooooooo brokers fees its too risky
so when you get the letteremail from the nigerian prince about how hell send you a pile of cash if you provide him your banking information do you smile and send out your account number or do you recognize that the deal is too good to be true and trash the letter same basic principlethe market of eve operates under the rule of caveat emptor your inability to properly research market orders is not a problem for ccp to address
ccp has a song written for you
youre not even trying to hide your tears anymore you should honestly just have the isd lock the thread for the sake of your dignity

im seeing him on a council of 23 compromiseanyway my point is that he has apparently become vastly more electable without having substantially reinvented himself or his approach i wont speculate beyond that
i dont even have to speculate theres 2 obvious reasons 1 a lot less desirable candidates runningand 2 heres the fun one people want xenuria elected for the same reason they want the worse of 2 brothers to inherit the british throne they know it will be terrible with drama they know there will likely be a scandal by somebody to somebody else because of it and they are hoping for it people want xenuria elected so they can open up en24 or themittani and see a juicy dramasaturated article about somebody flipping out at somebody else or somebody violating nda over a big nono thats 90 of his votes right there
ill admit the 25 was an asspull i knew it was in the low twenties i wasnt going to go and rerun the process again a few times to make sure it was right and no need to speculate on whythere were some alliance pings saying vote xenuria first troll ccp
thank you for your input steve i am glad that you still take the csm seriously also the only people i have seen losing their cool or flipping out over the idea of me being on the csm are the same people who would not be on the csm if my proposed term limits passed granted mynnna did claim i was somehow magically stalking him from all the way in nj several people think i am an alt of lex arson and lynchton gorskie thinks i can teleport and steve you clearly have convinced yourself i am some sort of joke candidate the only people flipping out are my detractors funny how that works
i dont think you consider yourself a joke candidate i think you believe yourself to be perfectly seriousother people consider you a joke candidate
funny how you can tell somebody something over and over again without them getting it for a person who claims to be allergic to politics you sure do use alot of influence stratagems poorly in effort to attack a perceived foe
implants also have an isk costin the event that my proposal was accepted the demand for learning implants would plummet if for no other reason than each character would only need 1 rather than 5 the simplest way to protect lp store income would be to add learning boosters to lp stores as suggested in the proposal iirc and make them cheap say 12 of the price of the equivalent implant per dose that puts a 5 booster at what 1200lp and 12m isk then theyd be universally available impossible to corner and widely advertised to any player doing even l1 missions for incomethen theres also the issue of granularity as a rich old player i can plonk down for a pair of 5s whenever i feel like training extra fast that 5 goodness is easy for me to achieve but its a very high hill for a new player to climb but that new player can buy a few booster shots and amp up his training speed without making a huge downpayment in advance
i disagreeboosters make it easier for new players to achieve higher learning speeds older players can trivially access that advantage already they cant be more advantaged than they already are
not having to risk high priced implants if you dont want to reduces the grind and means that you dont have to choose between training skills and having fun anything anything that undermines the horrible terribads who grief new players out of the game and ruin eves reputation amongst potential players by telling them to grind missions to earn 5s and then stay in hisec until you have enough sp for 00 is good for the game and good for the new players
in that scenario there is no game play choice you just use the boosters this would be similar to clone costs which were removed because there was no interesting choicethe current clone death mechanics they are not a real choice they are an illusion of choice a choice between a bad option of losing isk and a worse option of losing skillpointsthis is similar because everyone would just use the boosterssource
there is explicitly a game play choice because there remain several strong use cases for implants1 my holiday clone im going away for 2 weeks and i cant log in to apply a new booster every 3 days2 my empire missiontraderdproduction alt this guy will never consensually pvp so why not use implants3 my character farm im training characters for sale using a learning implant will significantly reduce my effortisk ratio4 i live in the ass end of wspace supplying boosters is irritating but implants just keep working5 im a losec pirate and i know how to get my pod out why rent my sp gain when i can buy6 pretty much any well funded character role that isnt routinely exposed to pod loss and wants to train sp
what youre suggesting is not a meaningful choice its just pointless updating like a facebook game or the old skill system or wow garrisons its not interesting gameplay either its just do this pointless task or suckand its taking away a meaningful choice to try and remove yet more risk of loss from the game this game needs more meaningful choice not less it needs less repetitive boring tasks not more
i had not considered this in the context of implants staying in the game boosters would add choice in that case
i would love something that just justifies the risk side of the buyer besides some lame broker fee give names of the actual buyer when failed at least if not that then any of the other adjustments i have suggested i just want this looked at again by ccp and the csm there is something wrong with this wether you all think there is not
yeah well ya know thats just like uhh your opinion manthe more i think about this the more and more i see the margin scam as the market equivalent of a suicide gankyoure best form protection is taking precautions researching and avoiding it altogether your best recourse is to use the mechanics against themhint as someone said before buy the item cheap somewhere else and try to sell it to the suspected margin scam buy order the larger the buy order amount is the higher the market fees will befor example on a 1 bil isk buy order the market fee can be anywhere from 1 to 5 without you buying the baited item from the scammer in the first place because you bought it somewhere else for much cheaper that is an automatic 10 to 50 million isk loss right there
maybe the fact that everyone in this thread including a former csm member who has discussed this issue with ccp disagrees with you should make you question your basic premise that something is wrong scamming is part of eve and the margin trading scam is just one variation of several scams that induce players to pay too much for an itemjust move on and just be more careful in the future or better yet set up your own margin trade scams and make back your isk that way
to turn that around you use alot of victim stratagems to make yourself out as oppressed and virtuous the sole savior from a status quo refusing to change aside from all the times theyve voted on changenot trying to attack you here honest just again informing you your responses come in 1 of two varieties either changingspinning your arguement to claim opposition secretly agrees with you and should love you or anyone not agreeing with you is just an alt and a troll enforcing some spectrelike rmt cartel status quo
i like the flavor of your post i dont see myself as a victim i see myself as a person who has been disenfranchised by the status quo your polarizing the argument its not me vs them nothing is ever that simple when people are involved its more thisi am a person who has views about thingspeople who are biased against me do mental gymnastics to rationalize away their dissonance when they find themselves agreeing with mei am imperfect just like everybody else in this world but i am consistent my narrative if you can call it that has remained unchanged since day 1 you can call it a trope or a theme or even a genre but all that matters is that you can understand the story if you can understand a persons narrative than you can parse their intentions without them telling you anything tldri am an honest person in the middle of a machiavellian space opera
okay this may seriously come across as a little attackish but it is an honest questionhow is what you just described not admitting you are a selfinflicted pariah with a messiah complex
i am a self inflicted pariah with a messiah complex the disagreement is in what self inflicted means in this contextmy honesty and commitment to the things that i feel are important can and often does polarize people self inflicted implies spite or clumsiness this is not the case i choose to be honest and unyielding in my values this choice makes me a pariah
i think you overestimate your charisma the vast majority of your votes in csm 10 were troll votes they didnt actually believe in you or your policies and youve never provided any evidence to support your bold claims of who votes for you ill give you a hint its nowhere near 90 of all females in gameyou could be a decent candidate but your insistence on making unsubstantiated claims as well as attacking anyone who questions you and thats bad for politicians as you need to have a silver tounge
i dont attack people who question me i attack their arguments or their motives for their question many of my votes were troll votes i dont think anybody has disputed that most power blocs vote for whoever the alliance mail tells them too how is that any better than troll votingpro tip it isnt
wait what why would you have two of them granted that does add choice but its fairly strange
boosters without learning implants just become a no choice option boosters in the context of learning implants provide an alternative choice for people who do not want to be at a sp accumulation disadvantage but also do not want their out in space doing stuff implant slots tied up by noninteraction learning implants
if it becomes possible to have your cake and eat it too then why keep the mechanic in the first place thats not meaningful choice either its the best of both worlds and fails to commensurately reward the player who is willing to take risks
it is nothing to do with risk i routinely pvp in implants which are more expensive than a 5 learning set but every time i choose to use these interacting implants i lose sp because i am not in the 5 set encouraging people to sit in noninteracting learning implants is bad because we should be encouraged to be in interacting implants instead
but there is no choice if you are a pvp player there is no other option than to fly with your expensive pirate implants and use learning boosters the only reason you wouldnt do that is if you could not findafford the learning boosterthat isnt interesting gameplay the current tradeoff  character progression vs combat advantage  isnt a necessarily a good one which is why we are discussing it but at least it is a tradeoff just adding boosters just gives you everything with no real decision to be made on your part might as well remove learning bonuses at that point if they were a new type of booster or effectively an insured implant that took up the corresponding implant slot then you might argue you have more choices you could use regular implants or this booster which might cost more be temporary but persist through death still since those are clearly do everything better than the current implants just more costly in the long run so they would give an advantage to those that can afford them
the decision is analogous to manufacturing with a bpo or a bpc both have plausible use cases
i have outlined several use cases above where the implant remains a better choice
pretty much all of your use cases are just balancing your perceived risk of losing your clone vs the cost of replacing them its much like insurance another mechanic many people think is problematic where if you dont think you will lose a clone you get the implant and if you estimate your chance of losing a clone is above extra cost of the booster you go booster i guess it is additional gameplay but practically for most players there is no choice  your traderindustrialist will always go implant and the active pvper will always go booster it might reduce the hesitation of those with learning implants to pvp but still the pvper has the problem that boosters are mandatory there is no reason for them not to use them and thus you have to buy and use the most expensive one you can afford once you identify yourself as likely to lose the clone or benefit too much from the pirate implant set to go without you have no tradeoff to make except for how much isk you are willing to spend which favours established players
i dispute this claim by the way risk aversion should not be handled by making choices less meaningful
i understand scamming is a part of eve but when eve is a part of scamming this is where i draw the line typing in the wrong price by an extra 0 is scamming i will disagree with all of you on this as long as the client continues to protect the scammers and not look out for the ones who really make eves market a viable place
dont like scammers dont use the market simple as that build and farm everything you use
your only course of action then is to quit the game scamming is not just implied gameplay but intended and approved
i cant speak for everyone else but i used the cfc ballot template  removed the people i dont like from the list space democracy
there are exceptions to ever rule or norm i would prefer a community that sees the pre filled ballots as a suggestion and not some word on high as to how you should vote i talked to many people at fanfest who said a variation of i just voted for whoever my alliances voted for when i asked if they voted for me most of them didnt really understand what the csm was outside the context that they had to click a link and press submit
this thread is tragic but i cant seem to stop following it i think someone has me drugged
right but you jump immediately to paranoid measures of questioning the motives and secret agendas of anyone who disagrees with you simply so you dont have to answer the questions of anyone who doesnt already support you you dont win arguements and thereby votes you instead reason that anybody who doesnt agree with you 100 is part of some status quo seeking conspiracy and isnt worth discussing with
those are you words not mine i dont agree with that statement either the status quo is not some grand conspiracy its the result of social norms and associated stratification psychology  conspiracyi think this is where people get me mixed up your speaking in absolutes i try to avoid absolutes which is why you might see me as evading questions in reality i simply dont feel comfortable answering something at a level of detail in which i cant be certain of its truth its a weakness that i have and i agree that part of me lacking sufficient theory of mind leads to misunderstanding
i respectfully disagree you have on numerous occasions called people trolls simply because they put questions in front of you that you didnt want to answer and this includes me personally you called me a troll simply because i asked questions about your past historyand i think your tinfoil is showing with the alliance voting the alliance puts out a recommended voting ballot i will agree that a number of people would blindly vote what theyre told to but if you think that people dont have a mind for themselves then you have a lower opinion of the community as a whole than i expected
assumptions dude you make alot of themargumentum ad ignorantiamyou cant know what goes on inside every single alliance in game only ccp can know thatccp decided it was significant enough to make a flavor item to poke fun of pre filled csm ballots
ironic statement is ironic your entire platform revolves around assumptions
so the last topic i can find on the matter is from around two years ago in which ccp fozzie had the following to sayif i had to guess the refactor theyre referring to is at least partly whats being talked about in this presentation from fanfest if this is the case is there any new info on the boosts change
thats the refactor theyre talking about yes as per the presentation theyre looking at a few months from now to hit sisi all times subject to change of course something might have been missed only after its on tq and tested entirely stable can they look at doing more
cool thanks very much i wasnt sure if that was the rework or if it was just vaguely relatednice to have an update on this after two years and thanks for being so responsive loved your fanfest presentation btw
theres a difference between scamming and overpaying if you paid for something and you cant afford for something to go wrong if the brokers fees are really that high you shouldnt be buyingselling in that areathere is no way of countering the margin trading scam without making the skill margin trading completely useless it is a vital tool for trading and if you were a trader you would understand
this is related to the brain in the box project right
note some of this is speculation and some of this is from memory i may be largely wronggoing by this post from 5 months ago as well as the presentation brain in a box is a rework of how character data is stored and applied in eve right now the node youre on is managing your character and it needs to be passed along every time you change nodes which is one of the reasons jumping between systems is extremely expensive to the serverthe code that hadhas to be rewritten for ongrid boosts is dogma which at present doesnt support modifying those attributes on anything other than a node or personal level so the available options other than a dogma rework are the current system which goes by node something horrendously expensive that checks who is on grid before applying boosts or completely rewiring boosts as a system which would also be pretty time intensive and potentially technically expensive not to mention unpopularif i recall right from the talk about this from when command ships were rebalanced what theyre basically looking at doing is bringing the level a node can operate on down to a single grid which by extension means they can confine boosts to a single grid and hopefully fix fleet boost propagation in the mix
so will it remove ogb  or will it still need a few months after that
i would assume longer than whatever tech they implement i wouldnt expect them to remove ogbs without at least reworking the rorqual first
well duh i have never been on the csm so assumptions have to be made
show me battlereport
eft warrior detectedon contrary ive been in those fleets it takes one spy in your teamspeak andor fleet and your target is known long before dreads can lock it tank goes overheated reps preactivated and all those salvos barely scratch the armorwith tidi 10 you can only hope to destroy a couple of slowpokes after hours of fight and that is the best case in worst case you lose all your dreads without even loading the grid seen it during halloween war in hedgpand even i mean even if you can hit through carriers what would you do with motherships field 600 naglfars been there seen that your guns dont work your siege runs endless cycle soul crashing lags and absolutely shity gameplay
the thing is if you make margin trading which is a skill needing to be trained illegal you might as well ban all other sorts of scamming in eve and refund everyone that ever got scammed out of anything and ban the perpetratorswait i actually agree with this would be fun to see cfc membership numbers dropping to about 13 of what they are now for them impersonationrecruitment scams
eve should have its own corollary to godwins law regarding the cfcgoonswarmeve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno
not to mention  and this cannot be overemphasised  that rather more than 99 of margin trades are legitimate orderslike the majority of scams the margin trade scam only works on people who think theyre the scammers in the deal which makes it problematic to understand why one should have any sympathy for them i was going to beat this little kid up for a laugh but then it turned out he had 3 brothers bigger than me kids smaller than me shouldnt be allowed by law to have big brothers because it was totally unfair to expect me to fight 3 big guys also i have a mental disorder that cripples my selfawareness
if your platform requires assumptions to be made then you should probably refine it for example bam strokers platform was to support the community player meets and the like which requires no assumptions at all even tora bushidos platform of fixing wardecs the only assumption that hes made is that ccp will even care what he has to say on the topicyouve made claims with little to no evidence in both csm 10 and csm 11 and theres not even an election for csm 11 coming up and when called out to provide evidence to support your claims you call people trolls for asking or state that youve already provided the evidence when none existsi know ive said this before but when almost the entirety of the people voting for you are doing so as a joke then you should probably take some time out of the spotlight to repair your reputation and spend some time actually getting to know the community
my platform isnt perfect and neither is my skill at politicsthat said my reputation is not what needs repair i have consistently been vindicated of all accusations and scandals i am not concerned by the kangaroo courts of internet trolls
your reputation is what needs repairwhether you were vindicated or not when your brought up in conversation people either have no clue who you are or they know you as a troll who posts weird ideas on the old forumsyou have little to zero community involvement and no community relation that is why you have little chance fo ebing elected as anything but a scapegoat or as a troll to ccpif you are serious about csm and are serious about helping the playerbase then before anything you need to be involved with the forums and involved with the ingame communities you have to become an enabler have people know you for how you have helped them be somebody the game would be lesser for if you left because right now if you left no one would noticeyou keep complaining that the voting system is broken because bloc leaders keep getting elected or if not them their choices this isnt broken this is you again have a disconnection with the playerbase these individuals worked to become leaders and enablers names that everyone knows as soon as they hear them there are very few people in eve who have been here 2 months who would need an explanation of who the mittani or chribba or shadoo is because those are well known names who have made possible well known events this is why they and their supported runners get elected because between the people who rely on them for leadership and the people outside their community who generally respect their accomplishments people want to listen to what they have to sayas much as i hate the concept of politicians ingame or the real world they are usually sketchy people at best it is very much a requirement to be one to approach csm candidacy and if you are not prepared to be one and to operate both ingame and out of game in a manner to improve your relations with the greater community then you have already lost no matter how early you start your csm campaign
i refuse to accept being sketchy as a requirement for being a space politician my relations with this community are better now than they ever were i am empowered by my honesty not weakened by it if you have been posting in my thread this long and you still dont get it than maybe you should bow out
if all you got out of that is that most politicians are sketchy its no wonder people dont elect youyes your reputation is better than it used to be how so youve gone from being infamous to being unknown just having your rep higher than ever does not mean its in a good place you still have minimal involvement with the playerbase and forum community that is an issue you need to address if you want your new campaign to succeed
it doesnt matter whether you were vindicated or not you have a bad repuation in the community and frankly your csm threads have done more damage than good using the phrase kangaroo court doesnt automatically change peoples opinions of you you need to work at that yourself im not attacking you nor do i particularly care about incidents in your past but others do and thats what matters what i see as a concern is the fact that you had your csm 11 thread up hours after losing csm 10 you refused to discuss difficult subjects with people in your csm 10 thread you have shown a pretty blatant hostility towards the community and you seem to spend minimal time talking to people in eve getting your name out there and getting a feel for what people want to see in game the community are who votes for you and who you are there to represent not to represent your self serving ideas yet you seem to want to avoid themps calling ccp liars due to not sharing your concern for a design element of the game is probably not a good way to make friends either
i appreciate your point of view but i simply dont share it you seem to have trouble internalizing thati am not running on my reputation i am running on my values this does arguably weaken me as a candidate but its also what sets me apart from the mainstream candidates who garner many votes on popularity alone ok ill bitehow do you figure i have a minimal involvement with the playerbase and forum community
thats actually not true or youve misunderstood certain thingsbecause im quite sure that if i click on them nightmares on the market for 970mil my wallet will buy that selected item for that exact price from the seller who was selling it for 970 mil isk the game doesnt automatically assign you the lowest price if it did there wouldnt be any point to all them swindlers setting prices of simple items to 1500000000 isk at the top of the item listlast time i brought a cargo of 75000 units of morphite to amarr there was about 6 buy orders with prices higher than the one that actually wanted more than 75000 units i set the sale price to match that buy order and the other 6 buy orders werent fulfilledwhat i think youre referring to is the default sell interface where its going to offer you the maximum price and clicking sell without adjusting the price sells it to the highest bidder
you are correct that it doesnt assign you the lowest price you will buy the item at the price you specify but you will not buy it from the seller you click on you will purchase from the lowest price seller but at the price you specify
if you set a price of x and youre buying itll take them from the lowest priced order first and work its way up until it reachs your price or you have bought all you wanted each person will be paid x times the number of things you get from them
which makes you the perfect candidate to ask ccp not to reconsider utari not sure voltyulai are the perfect examples of great defense fleets especially since their space is infested with reds on a daily basis
yeah thats ussually how it is thats what the skill is supposed to be for so you can place huge amounts of buy orders without having to tie up all your capital so even if something in jita still isnt producing results it doesnt tie up your cash to fulfil those orders in dodixie
i wish more people would realize this its one thing to face a single or a handful of carriers but another entirely to try to take out even a single one in large fleets
the obvious catch would be to find a means of making supers vulnerable without outright demanding largescale fleets aka blobbingi do however agree that super carriers are a detrimental element of gameplay as it stands and should be reformed or removed asap
another problem with super capitals in general is that they are only able to be constructed in sov that has been held for more than a few weeks in other words they are only really available to big power blocs or the super wealthy but im repeating myself making these ship types more vulnerable would contribute greatly towards ending the stagnation of the sov system
give us back our range and you can keep the fatigue 1
atm the eve client uses the default graphics chip when you have an intel chip and nvidia card on your laptopwith optimus from nvidia this usually is the intel onboard chip and it shows up as the only primary videocardi had to manually assign the nvidia graphics card to the eveexe file and set it as only and primary videocard oogis ccpgames aware of this and how can they test eve probe when all they test is the intel onboard videocard source
bumping to support this concept againi would be sad if this thread was locked and the concept forgotten due to lack of attention
i am rather liking the changes but that is probably because i enjoy flying subcaps more often i do agree however that the nerfbat strike was a little too harsh as above it should have been either a pure range nerf or just fatigue keeping the original range just my 2 cents
did you do the math with your proposal 
i dont care about the math i know that its likely the only compromise theyll consider vov
gicen the choice between a bad compromise and no compromise why do you think ccp will elect to compromise at alleve is like an addiction you cant quit it until it quits you also iderno

mr ronuken is the market data for charting on your website provided via crest would it be possible to either switch or to provide an option for a candlestick chart layout thanks
sillly thought herewhat if a ships history could be trackedyup that was the ship i used in 6vt and it fought thru 50 wars 700 battles 173 solo kills  and i just lost it in a f gate camp of intyswould it add a useful dimension to the gamewould pilots become more invested in their favorite rideswould there be more tears at their losswould this be a new dimension of pilot skill  avg age of ships vs activitythanks for your consideration

well all you gunslingers probably wont care so dont bother to talk  however  some of the industrialists and miners may1st we get extra amounts of minerals required to build things2nd then we get increasing craziness in components hell to build t2 and t33rd then you screw over everyone who ever improved a blueprint w the blueprint 1020 schema with no reimbursementfor years of effortnow we get the april 2015 update which is going to up the amounts of the rarest and most critical mineralsdo you just want the average player let alone the new players to never be able to build anything ccpor is this more of the continuing unspoken war you are carrying out against any one who dares to want to live and work in high secor is it the apparent bias of  if you dont blow  up  the game is not really for you id really rather believe that none of those are true the economy is awesome the markets hum along well inflation is not to badand industry actually works  as it is quit srewing around with itjust get it over with already and completely randomize ore respawn in all sectors of space and quit screwing around with the industry by making it harder and harderyou are not helping  ccp
so im taking it you didnt even read the proposalthey are rebalancing available minerals to be distributed in similar ratios as to what is actually required for ship productionso instead of mining for materials and ending up wasting several hours or days extra mining for a specific mineral mexallon if i recall was still the big nullsec bottleneck and having alot of useless excess low and high end minerals youll instead have roughly the exact amounts you need fo each type for your ship and be able to ge tthem quicker since their is no wasted materials of any one type while trying to mine for a now nonexistent bottlenecknow granted i have my own reservations about this change mostly that previously those excess minerals could be diverted to other projects that didnt need as much of the bottleneck and therefore could make do with lftovers but whateverin the end this is a buff to productivityhour for industrialists
im curious why do you think that increasing the mineral requirements is bad for miners and again why is it bad for miners to tweak the minerals you get out of an anomaly to numbers you can actually build stuff with
it would shut the game downthe problem with lag in eve has to do with session changes loading and processing the information from unique ids moving from system to system grid to gridthis would turn ships from a single object into a complex entity it would increase lag by minimum 40 per pilotnot to mention you either make it pointless because a repackaged ship loses all its information or you track it even after repackaging making the database bloat 4000 in 24 hours and make the market nonfunctioning
agreed i would love to hear if ccp has anything to say about this this thread has been around for a while now and the response has been overwhelmingly positive and constructive
jump fatigue is a very nice way to limit travel times which gives traveling the need for a strategic think of what youre doing but where jump bridges are concerned its quite pointless maybe if ccp were to remove jump fatigue completely add something else such as fuel costs to the mix to slow down how quickly you can get from a to b or make you review whether travelling your 200 supercap fleet across new eden for an invasion is actually worth it
if you make it about cost pl will be back to hotdropping rookie ships with fleets of supercaps in no time at all
op you really have no clue how this stuff works do you i mean first off you appear to have completely missed the accompanying asteroid changes second you seem to have a serious aversion to either buying your minerals or mining outside of high sec both at once is inadvisable for someone who claims to have a serious investment in eve industrysecond doubling the amounts of those minerals is going to amount to an at most a 35 increase in cost of these items which translates into profit for producers thats assuming that the new sources for these minerals dont drop the price down currently the market has at least stabilized but its really too soon to say for sureeither way this isnt hurting producers unless you absolutely insist on solomining everything you need and not buying any of it
closed
thank you very muchdmc
it was about cost originally if you recall jumps required and still do require isotopes it didnt stop them
fuel costs wont work unless they engineer them to be so astronomically high no matter how many are produced how much fatigue and how it was gained needs more thoughtif the aim was to prevent people dog piling in on a system within 20 minutes of a fight kicking off then the current mechanics are way to severe and need to be targeted more cleverly id be happy with a compromise whereby the larger the ship mass the more fatigue is accumulated but in turn the distances that can be jumped needs to be increased and the build up of space aids decreased it shouldnt have to take a couple of days to jump from tribute to delve in a taxi carrier there is no fun in that its just wasted time but i could live with it taking a good few hours to prevent the whole dog piling thing
why shouldnt it why shouldnt you be inconvenienced enough by local geography and distances to care why should 1 power be able to go to war with another power on the other side of new edenanswer they shouldnt because as long as you are able to reach that power on the other side of the galaxy and remain comfortable any group or power that tries to build itself up between you and them is easy pickings for both parties because they are well within reachthe current fatigue system was designed with extreme penalties because some places are supposed to be out of reach as long as there are areas you cant get to without severely inconveniencing yourself then there are areas where the map can change
yeah well guess what more players want this to stay in the game than those that dont you want to affect trading profitability of thousands of players as long as ccp makes you happy this suggestion has no meritclosethread
you utterly miss the point of what i said you see goon and its all sandy clunge and hat gons rather than a reasonable and objective discussion the point was that instant force projection was bad its gone great however its just inconvenienced deployment via a capital taxi from half an hour to several days maybe a week at extremes distances as long as there is a low sec or null npc station that can be docked in you can go to war with anyone eventually imperium just did that with fountain and delve there is nothing really wrong with that and ccp cant really prevent it no matter what mechanic they add im not saying put it back to what it was but the space aids mechanic was both blanket and too extreme in many circumstances maybe youre just someone whos never lived in null and is not aware of the reality of how it works especially with merc groups and the more highly mobile specialised groups which tend to fight brushfire wars these areas can still be reached eventually but adding the time to get to them by several thousand  has no real positive effect on anything its just a pain to move fit ships around and in a worst case you end up with boring ship doctrines like the ubiquitous ishtar fleet not just because sentries are op or the ishtar is op either but a series of features which mean its very good in the current meta and completely rely on having a jf service it doesnt really add anything and doesnt change an outcome it just means people spend more time being bored
you seem to think that the idea is to stop long range deployment at all it isnt deploy awaythe point is to make it such that a long range deployment is now a significant commitment and involves leaving inspace assets at risk it ishalf the problem was that it was possible to move a supercap fleet across the map in literally less time than it takes a freighter to cross 92the other half was that is was possible to move them back just as quicklywhen there is close to zero opportunity cost for moving very quickly then everyone is your next door neighbour a situation like this very quickly leads to a twocolour map with zero opportunity for anyone not in one of the two blocs to have any meaningful independent existence regardless of any sov system in placethus the three phases of the sov rework the first two of which have completely reversed the situation as it was in september 20141 the phoebe changes make it militarily even possible to have more than 2 powers on the map prephoebe it wasnt2 the fozziesov changes will make it extremely difficult not impossible but requiring enormous effort to hold space that you dont live in and utilise currently its trivial3 the 3rd phase will be to rework the local economy of nullsec to make it viable to have a relatively small amount of space support a large number of playersthere will still be wars there will still be coalitions and diplomacy and politics there will still be long distance deployments and failcascades and battles what we wont have if this all works out is the old stagnant sitaution where everyone sat on their hands for a year at a time then there was a gigantic lagfest battle that ultimately meant nothing because the winner didnt even want the losers space
incidentally if all you want to do is move your taxi carrier then get a corpie or a friend or even an alt to find an appropriate wormhole
to the current csm in officerelating to my crowing concern and complaints of the growing number of bugs issues and glitches with the launcher and the eve clientit is becoming my belief that this is being somewhat allowed and overlooked in the great race of miniexpansions and a desire to release the new revamp of thats the current apparent focus of ccpi am requesting that the csm bring to ccps attention that there are so many overlooked or outright ignored bugs with a game that otherwise is a solid and quite enjoyable gaming experience ccp is known for quality in their products and caring about their player base as more than simply numbers for the quarterly reports i would be greatly disheartened if this is become less a statement of factthe latest release mosaic is iconic of these troubles which many couldve been avoided by simply slowing down and working with a priority of quality not quantitya few examples of places that are lacking in care or attention and its showingeve launcher it has become accepted that the launcher will break or become buggy on a regular basis as the repair tool is also seeming to have the same update problems it becomes difficult to correct on a players end what is coming through our internet connections i now join the growing chorus please either repair the launcher so it is not causing so many complaints and bug reports or remove it for a different way to login to the gamebanning offense exploit list though i requested this during the latest titan bumping drama and it was noted by a ccp employee as a good idea and that it was in the works its not up anywhere as of yet this gives the impression that theres been no movement on this or it has been bumped lower on the priority list of changes upgrades and things to assist new players who have joined eve online as there has been a focus on retaining new players once more they face without all tools available the challenge curve of eve a simple headsup that could keep new players and vets from getting themselves banned is still not in placebugs glitches issues this list is getting that sinking feeling of endless but it comes down to a few base things the time spend debugging a new release is lacking the rush for change in changes name without checking if its a good and truly wanted change what appears to be a lack of long term attention to bugs from a release after a week or so and now admissions that features were left out because the devs ran out of time that statement alone is more proof than any number of single issues i could point out as a player time not enough is being spent on quality its becoming a priority of quantity that does not bode wellconnection to tq if this part sounds ranting or irate i apologize in advance there have been many waves of socket closed on evenings that are responded to with what feels like the company line its not at our end so it must be at yours up to a certain point very possible there is the ddos issues that have hit ccp along with other game companies over the last year i understand that as well however i and if thread postings back this assumption up there is more going on with the regular disconnects the players are facing if it is not on the players end and it is not on ccps end i for one would like the company name that owns the failing routing server so i can aim my complaints at the correct targetthese listed issues along with others not listed in this specific post could be lessened in impact if only a few things were done on a corporate level with ccp time spent on quality control debugging and slowing a little of the priority currently in place of a fast track release cycle would made a difference in positive directionstldr version slow down guys and gals more bug fixing focus before releases and continuing further out after a releasei understand that ccp is running a business and that theyre not keeping eve up and active in some sort of community service im only a year into playing so i can only go from what i find out going through old posts and talking with longer playing individuals all i do know is for the year ive been in the list of personal complaints are piling up and irritation has moved into upsetso as the elected csm in office be our voice in this growing problem eve is known for many things in the mmo communities a large part of that being both quality in its product and caring about their player base i would like that to remain true and factual as eve online is unique and an otherwise wonderful gaming and community experiencelets all make it even betterjeven housebenyo
what on earth are you smoking
i like words and use a lot of them prepare for a longwinded postim sure there will be lots of fire and brimstone headed my way based on what research ive done about this topic and the way that players have felt about it before im just going to go ahead and acknowledge that now and move on to the rest of my postbetween purportedly leaked emails monocles that cost more than two months subscription and just overall player disappointment with incarna content its been wholly and completely left in the dust no 514 pun intended with even eve developers saying that theyve failed with the incarna projecteveryone loves new players a lot of new players love what limited portion of incarna we can see and want to do more of it i find someone telling me that they wish incarna had finished quite regularly though of course its usually players that werent around during the actual typhoon of drama and upset that occurred during the attempt to implement the content leaving the content unfinished as it is now takes away from the experience of a full polished experience that a game as big as eve tries to provide i think that a finished incarna will keep new players around for longer yes the game is about space stuff and i know people dont want to see walking in stations become the major attraction or take precedence but when youre new theres a lot of time spent doing absolutely nothing staring at your skills as they slowly tick up and so forth while you try and figure out the game having a mindless social activity to fill in the empty space would really help as would having a more fleshed out experience that players expect in mmos encountering other players and being social with them during downtimeincarna doesnt to me seem like it has much work left behind it the character models are done the devkit for building interiors is complete including multiple types of walls and even a few decorations based on what i can see im pretty sure that ccp probably has a folder somewhere with a bunch of incarna content that was never implemented just laying around as well really the hardest part if its not yet finished would be drawing up the system for getting people to walk around and sit in the same room id estimate 34 months for completion with 2 months of occasionally mashing some random bug that pops uphopefully enough time has passed that incarna doesnt make ccp afraid of its playerbase anymore after formal apologies adding a shipspin ticker did you know if you hit 10000 spins you get a plex and putting together the council that im appealing to right now i can easily imagine why the thought of trying to tell the players at fanfest that they are going to work on incarna again would send shivers of fear down their spine and perhaps even incite some to run apologizing from the stage in lieu of the reaction honestly maybe that fear is valid maybe people do still spit venom at the thought of this subject being broached again if thats the case and the playerbase is still that irate about what occured before then the rest of this doesnt matter in the replies to this topic well find out if that fear is still well founded or not personally i dont want them to fear the players i love that they take their opinions into account that theyve formed this council and that they really listen to their fans and if incarna failing helped bring that relationship to the state that its in today thats awesome but anger yelling and rabblerousing is never a good foundation for any decisionpeople arent running potatocomputers to run eve anymore i could run incarna on a geforce 580 easily without any fear of having negative effects on my computer card or game performance with the right video options checked off theres no hardware limitation like there was before so the former issues of loading it really shouldnt be getting on anyones nerveson some level i feel like refusing to enter the captains quarters is an elitist im an oldhat player and i dont need no gorram captains quarters thing to do rather than a choice of some merit that actually shows a fondness or dislike yes you may love your ship but its still floating there in plain view and there are holograms of it elsewhere further graphically its the best looking place in the game full stop end argument i love looking out into space as much as anyone else but the textures details and so on are simply better there than they are in space as of now however some people will refuse to touch it out of spite or possibly they really do prefer using the ship hanger there is after all no accounting for taste the answer to this is simple incarna always has been and should continue to be optional theres no reason to make it nonoptional or even to have it give some tactical advantage outside of the inherent social interaction i like that i can do all of my business from a menu when i want to and im not asking for that to change just for there to be more there when i want itthe last reason that it should be done is time is on our side the above estimate for incarna being finished was assuming that they halted their current projects and focused on it instead honestly id hate that especially with the new structures coming out if incarna was to be slated for completion i would at least put it after the new structure overhaul due to the effects that update would likely have on the walking in stations content however if three to four months is spread out over time and were just given another feature here or there on the side id still be happy and so would quite a few others lingering out thereplease dont just tell me to give up tell me why this is a bad idea instead
locked this has been discussed plenty of times before
i made another post on this and then realized this one existed shortly after that was closed for redundancy so here is that post again
all the points listed here eves alienating a demographic that doesnt want to me a part of trollish alliances and communities which is what fills the majority of the internet spaceships community theres those of us who miss the dark dystopia of what eve once was within its own lore and not sucking the insert of the players to provide it insteadthats the eve that was further promised within incarna minus the cash shop elements which have happened regardless the door was supposed to open the way for thatthe only reason we dont more support for this stuff and what diversity we had in the old character editor is because ccp continues to express it doesnt give two fs for the roleplayersingleplayerloreimmersive crowd1 for all of this
open the door let me walk around my hangar let me have an officeboard roomi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
leave the implants the way they are leave the boosters the way they are and let choice and the consequences of that choice ride on the shoulders of the playersome players will gain advantages and benefits others will not some payers can make smart decisions some players cannot some players can see and use a tool to their best advantage others cannot no everyone does not need to be equal because they never will be whether in a game or in reality
the choice however is a meaningless choice these attributes have arbitrary unintuitive assignments that dont have meaningful impacts on spaceships we could add a popup daily trivia quiz that gives you 1000 sp it could be really hard to reward players who know eve lore it would be a choice players would have to perform it or not but it would be an arbitrary and pointless choice
attribute s definitely should be put in a bag and drowned
removed
edit your post rephrase everything so we can at least understand it remove the angry tone and everything irrelevant from the post otherwise the isd will call it ranting and lock it  at which point your ceases to achieve anything useful
redirected from the features  ideas discussion sectionyes there was a discussion for clothing in december from csm in that discussion lots of ideas for future clothing concepts were passed on to the three some ccp personal actually giving a damnmuch of those ideas were trollish and did not fit the lore of eve in the slightestim looking at the majority of you with those parrots top hats and  neko costumesits like people are trying to hijack the outcry of those remembering the dark scifi dystopia of eve without the other players and use it to fill some kind of trollish fantasy agenda of bullying others and the devs into only their vision of eve if thats the prime reason ccp doesnt care for giving any more clothing support i entirely cant blame them
