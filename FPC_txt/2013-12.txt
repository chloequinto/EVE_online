while it certainly is always good to get newbros involved not every instance of a lowsp ship having an effect is a good thing if t3s were cheap and lowsp we could get newbros into those and have some fun and interesting pvp taken to an extreme why not get rid of sp and let them fly supercapitalsfirst lets think about why we have sp sp is actually a resource every character corporation alliance and coalition has a limited amount of sp and chooses to allocate that sp income every month towards flying certain ships or doing whatever else people do i can spend 61d 1h 42m 50s training for an arazu or i can spend 59d 17h 0m 52s training for a loki there is a decision to be made therea pilot can spend a few months training for a t3 and run lowsec missions a corp can spend a few months training for a battleship doctrine and siege a pos or you can spend one month 15  110 the isk and do both in a stealth bomber and get initial tackle on every gank and bomb battleshipsmy complaint about  lowsp cost is that the utilitysp ratio is too high my entire corp has trained for it because theyre just too useful to skip they seem insanely important because nullsec alliancescoalitions fill fleets of them for the same reasonif stay lowsp no t2 torpedobomb changes they should probably lose some of their utility consider one of my 2 proposals at the bottom of the second post
are in a healthy place they were rebalanced ffs lets try not to make them  againand all ships are op when you have a large fleet of them thats why blobbing is so popular this is regards to their bombing ability that malcanis has said he has brought up to ccpand tech ii frigates should be easy to get into training time in this game is already out of control across the board
did you even read the op at all if so how can you think that bombers are in a healthy place as you put it why is a t2 frigate which is basically free 50m is nothing a better choice in so many situations over ships that should be more specialized for those rolesthere will be neither compassion nor mercy nor peace nor solace for those who bear witness to these signs and still do not believe  the scriptures book of reclaiming 2510
first i would like to thank ccp for their work on the tournaments streams and allowing a practice environment on sisi server despite the cost to the company i believe and hope that they agree that it greatly adds value to the game and attracts new players through the streams of the matches and news coverage thereofas so i believe it would be even more beneficial to improve the already present eve tournament experience why that new esport income 35 million people watched the lol finals eve tournament finals were a slightly less profitable 12k there currently is no scifi esport scene there is a lack of more complex competitive games and eve has both the graphics engine and inherent complexity to sell this 1 create a player runnable tournament match mode there have been player run tournaments and theyve been of two kinds purely player run singularity skirmishes and ccp assisted syndciatecl they both require a singularity client download and either a dev to be online to assist or a player to run a module scanner in order to enforce fitting rules as best as possible both of these are very inconvenient and do not lend themselves to modern competitive gameplaythis could be greatly simplified if eve allowed a mode for setting up a match that included teleportation into a atlike jove space while enforcing implant module and rig rules in a perfect world the tool could monitor boundary violations keep score in local chat and end the match at a predesignated time this would make it much easier to involve new players in the tournament system and build hype for the tournaments something that has been decreasing last 2 yearsthis mode would also facilitate running of tournaments in a season like format something very popular with the viewing audience at large since it wouldnt require any dev presence players could selfrun the matches and stream the results for viewers at regular intervals helping build a steady loyal audience since the matches would use ccp tools they would guarantee that the tournament rules were followed while leaving the option for backstabs and spying that are so crucial to the eve experience2 facilitate commentary and viewer understanding with a more descriptive overlay for above modeccp does a good job providing tools to add information to the tournament streams but that is not available to player run instances in addition i think ccp could definitely do more with their own overview for example a ship overlay that uses icons to let a zoomed out camera tell at a glance what ships classes are being represented by the little blue and red squares would be very helpful in explaining what is happening on screen instead of a scattering of dots it would be immediately obvious as a frigate rush at a logi or something of that sort 3 allow recording and analysis of this overlayccp provided something similar as an ipad and flash tool for atxi this was a fantastic step and it would be great to see more of it with expanded options that easily provide the public information on ships velocity relative transversals shield  visible effects etc4 for your consideration a more stream friendly tournament formatthis is a very heavy request and i would be very happy if it simply got a reading and some dev feedback the eve tournament mode is a 10 minute team fight with very little plot to it for your consideration viewers prefer a more narrative format one that is entirely in matching with the eve gameplay philosophy forcing the players to start in rookie ships and then letting them use eve mechanics like mining and looting to move ore and goods into a home base sell those and buy new ships and fittings would add length and story to the matches it would be also intuitive to the tens of millions of moba aware viewers looking for a more complex and scifi fix upon death in this mode the player should return to the home base as a rookie ship after a set penalty time with the option to use team isk to purchase a new ship before undocking the matches would continue until one team loses their home base if mining with lasers is to be pursued the home bases could spawn pirate rats that move towards the enemy base killing them would yield bounties i dont believe that laning mechanic is necessary but if one was desired it could be set up through 3 warpable to asteroid fields per team each defended by a strong tower rat based on a mission sentry gun set to attack one team but not the other again thank you for your consideration and please pass to ccp my thanks for all their support of the competitive eve scene over the years
one quick additional point i would like to make to the charge that low risk pvp is a violation of eve concepts i would like to point out that ccp already provides a nocost norisk tournament system through the singularity server with the free mods and ban on nonconsentual pvp as so these changes would not change anything about the eve gameplay at allthanks for reading
no it sucks that taxes went up in hs that said what this change did allow is yet another stream of income to highsec warmongers most of the smaller corps that erected a poco are on a ticking clock to make the isk back they spend on the customs office and will continue to bleed carebears dry till they gets war decked and the poco goes boomb the folks that are running the cheaper pocos are just gathering intel to find out who they can war deck will buy their way out in a surrender garnering the corp even more isk manufacturing skills are still profitable less so with your material oprotunity and isk costs rising that is not balance that is isk redistribution plain and simple i see no way for a small corp to get anything but ripped off on this poco thing train the skills to reduce the empire portion of the tax or make buddy buddy with someone in wh or null with odysseys removal of scanning skills necessary to find good ore deposits killed prospecting for me and rubicons removal of scanning skills for exploration with ghost sites is even worse it seems like they are more at odds with explorers than carebear industrialists when was the last time you had an invention attempt blow up and take your ship and loot with it put on your big girl pants i am just a little hs pi alt and with customs code expertise dont know much else my character sheet says so at least dust toons arent calling orbital strikes on your command centers
quotemalcanis1 the csm has raised this topic with the five0 devs on several occasionsand they have made things worse by making the apocalypse another drone ship and adding new soe drone ships gee look lets use a drone ship i dont want excuses and but but but from the csm i want you demanding they fix the game 2 its possible that drone assist has this effect but you dont know for sure also see aboveccp will know and guess what the design concept of drones being equal to other weapons simply isnt holding water  they made drones superior to all others when they added modules and assist guard and kept ecm of the owner not stopping drones from delivering full damage if you dont use drones you are simply stupid currently and guess what the servers cant handle it in large battles i know been there seen the slideshow got the we crashed the server  again t shirt not good enough for a 10 year old game that should at least know how to host a fleet battle by now3 pretty sure the server doesnt render any sounds whatsoever thats purely a clientside operationserver has to tell the client to render sounds from other ships i sat still at a gate in highsec and tested it  my audio was playing sounds from other ships passing with mwd on that means a whole heap of range calculations and instructions to play sounds that are quite simply utterly pointless in a pvp battle where the server cant handle the basics like not crashing4 t2 ships are meant to be specialised i dont know how this comes as a surprise to you hyper specialistion what merely ordinary specialisations were lost with the removal of missile slots from the mael this smacks of mere nostalgia for irrelevent fluffmissle launchers on pilgrim were not fluff they meant you could fit fire and foreget missles to kill a falcon now falcon beats pilgrim 100 of the time if the pilgrim was fighing someone else when the falcon lands tic tac toe game over no unpredictability less fun making monouse fits diminishes the game which jar from the whole point of rigs being added in the first place to increase customization and variation ccp need to decide  are they making ships mono templates like the mael is now with one possible use eg zealot not having the power grid to fit sniper beams so it is only a close range brawler ever no missile options  or do they want to promote uncertainty in pvp by allowing large variation in fittings they need to choose  sandbox or wow its their call but i see them going down a wow path and i hate that 5 pvp happens in 00 sorry you cant farm anoms with the same blithe safety as a mission farmer in a 07 maybe consider organising and leveraging your power as a group the same way the afk cloakers are doingpvp rarely happens in 00 most of 00 is flat out empty nothing nada nix afk camping isnt pvp pvp is pvp you know ship a attacks ship b when you stop people playing eve guess what they play something else and they are  even the mittani seems to spend more time talking about star citizen now than eve online think about it6 instant warping is bad but instant locking is okno nothing should be instant in a pvp game its meant to be a game not an execution of fun i am not ok with the game concept of always works always wins  that is wow pvp in a nutshell the correct combination of keys or one macro means rogue a will defeat class b no matter what the second player does that isnt fun isnt engaging and ultimately isnt satisfying for anyone over the age of 8 why you won because of bad design not skill so i am not ok with instant warping or instant locking instant cloaking isnt ideal either for that matter7 even with the new interceptors it takes 45 seconds to get to an anom if youre playing on a 5000ms latency connection youre gonna have a bad time stay aligned and stay alert oh and do that group thing i mentioned aboveyeah nice thought you are lucky to find 8 people playing in any nullsec system outside of pvp usually it is one player with 7 botted toons following a main or entire bot fleets remember that part about campers and the antiplay style stopping people playing been there seen that living the consequences we used to have 20 to 50 active players in system every day add campers add betrayal by pandemic because they thought we might have gotten a new nice moon in the moon changes we didnt add more campers in our new home and guess what  lucky to have 3 real players and they dont undock because you know you will get hot dropped by 10 is that a valid tactic sure what have all those players done well  world of warcraft war thunder and star citizen as well as many other mini games and the really interesting thing is players on both sides have quit  because it used to be fun to pvp us but now we never undock to fight they dont want to pay 15moth to sit afk in space stopping people playing eve and they have quit too so yes enough already nullsec needs to be made viable for players interceptors are fun but they need to have things to be wary of as well like minefields or maybe re balance sniper ships so they can actually well  snipe p anyway my view  currently this game is tracking down to permanent mediocrity due to bad game design decisions and lack of courage on the part of ccp to face up to past design blunders step up fix it or watch the player base get stripped away by the new games coming online next yearthings i am still waiting for1 walking in stations you know with some point to walking in a station other than to see your boots2 some meaningful interaction with dust marines economy 3 the return of skill 4 5 of players in null
did you ever stop and think that the reason null is so empty id because large alliances want it that waywhat would happen if 1000 new players all moved to an empty system and called it theirsright they would be wiped out form multiple sidesthe large blocks want less people around because it is easier to control that way check the jumpsactive pilots on the map once a day and see where people are take away that and local i will move to null in a heartbeat because i can hide unless someone gets on grid with me i am unknown and can operate more or less solo for s long as i want do something to force the blocks to not only defend but patrol their own backyardoh and a note to the sound issuethe reason you hear other pilots ship sounds is not because the server is sending you the soundsthe server is telling you what ship is where and which way it is heading your local client then renders the correct ship model in the right place and adds in sounds now this is a necessary evil as bumping and shooting at each other is the name of the game
it really sounds like you are complaining that ccp is removing split weapon systems really split weapon systems are generally much less effective than doublebonused single weapon systems it might hurt variety a little but it makes ships more capable in general the interceptor changes have very much enhanced the ability to catch ratters which can escalate into pvp if you ware upset about the lack of pvp in your area then move different regions have different activities and you find less pvp when living in a region with nothing but blues for 30 systems every direction there are ships that get into warp extremely quickly and there are setups that can still catch them however that doesnt mean you lose all the time or have no options come through a gate with an instalock thrasher so your inty cant just warp off then power away generally speaking there are choices you can make to not die interceptors have plenty to be afraid of smart bombing bss instalock alpha ships etc etc there are many nullsec players i recommend using ingame  outofgame tools like dotlan to find them as for your 2050 active members no longer there sounds like you either need to start recruiting again or you should move on to a moreactive group of players that fits your style
besides what mal et al already pointed out2 there is no publically available statistics that could prove this statement right there are other factors involved including the fact that some of the nodecrushing fights that have occurred recently occur spontaneously resolutions to this are fleshed out but very very difficult to implement at least its not pretidi3 really really sound is client side5 show me on the doll where the evil afk person touched you while afk or how you werent able to just move a system over or deal with an afk cloaker appropriately waaaaaaaahhhhh abloobloobloo6 you can combine and mixmatch rigs based on whatever scenario you want how is specializing your ship to effectively increase what you want so horrible its the same as training a skill from iv to v for the additional percentages of effectiveness are we going to get rid of skills too7 yeah interceptors are op if you play on dialup if you cant react to an interceptor coming into a system youre not paying attention to the game and deserve to lose a ship if youre not ready for nonconsensual aggression and finally star citizens isnt even out yet stop using it as a benchmark none of its features are set in stone until the actual game nears a point of alpha or beta release
come on ccp 18 round clip with a 40 second reload time the only thing they are useful for now is cruiser vs frig 1v1
was the csm ever consulted about this change prior to implementation if so would it be a breach of nda if you were to say whether or not you were on board with this change
i would like to comment on the first pointa possible idea that could easily be expandedbuilt upon would be the idea of an arenaesque environment something that players andor a team could queue into for arranged consensual pvp almost like a matchmaking system i know one of my biggest issues with eve is flying around for 2 hours to only get one fight not even a good fight i am talking about those ganky fights where someone wasnt expecting it as of now i dont know time to fly around for hours on end just to find a good fight i think having some sort of matchmaking system in place in which players could enter the queue for arranged fights would be a great advancement in the right directionjust an idea to be thrown around a devccp s thought on this would be awesome dalso i have to blatantly thank ccpdevsupporters for their work with the tournaments it is most definitely the best place to get good fights and those are the only ones i enjoyand of course i cant leave out my 3 fozzietaco
got a compromise here rather than half price for training time half price for half month active and extend the training cool down for inactivity to 1 week that way you front load your queue pay half and train 3 weeks
mining is safe  you make less isk but lose lesseverything else has risk  you make more isk but lose morei dont see the problem here
oh snaps players can abuse other players oh no call the csm to make sure my hs cannot be tampered with
i think you need to wake up and get your head examinedcan you please provide some connection to how any of this is related to wow instead of just using the bad side of mmos to somehow force quicker decisions based on public view
if i remember correctly some of the csm actually supported the change and gave their input to make it what it is now
hurr a hit and run weapon is not designed to be used in a straight up brawl this means its useless111111
trolololololol
i find that the changes to the rapid launchers do make then unusable in most cases now i can see the limited clip but the 40 second reload is not only annoying but  i know it a game unrealistic when a standard launcher can reload 30 missles in 10 seconds
i would be happy with one or the other
i like this post quite a bit i represent sovereign gaming league and are working with ccp to have consistent tournaments in the esports realm you can visit wwwsovereigngamingleaguecom and see our splash page signups for a 1v1 tournament begin january 15th 2014we would love to get more community input on this anyone who has suggestions can send me an eve mail
1 to players being able to launch their own arena matchescommentator tools would also be very helpful in spreading the genre to the twitches and youtube interwebs
the good news are that i wont go after you if your bounty is 100k isk
no training changes require logging in logging in requires an active subscription either have an active subscription or not
bump
this remains an assinine and simplistic mechanic with no effective long term counter however despite thousands and thousands of posts on the topic there has never been a single dev response to any suggestion or change no logical discussion has ever scored a respone so ccp do you understand the environmental impact of encouraging large gaming pcs being left running 237 for no purpose other than random griefing not a good message on your corporate green credentials off the top of my head i cant think of another current game with the same long term detrimental mechanicbeat that
so whatupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked

do you have a t2 bpo then dont bother youre wasting your time you will never be able to compete with the chosen ones more truth than sarcasm btw whom have been granted these legendary items through the liberal use of deck stacking by their friends in ccp theyve got the best moons theyve got pocos on all their pis they will undercut and undersell you every time because their operating costs in both time and isk what is this invention you speak of for t2 junk are so close to zero as to make no differencethat being said there is still plenty of isk to made in old fashioned t1 manufacturing you just have to work with a mindset of quantity over quality sure a single tech2 item might make you a million isk but you know what so will ten thousand cheap missiles when left on a big sale order in a major trade hub if youre willing to wait a couple of days of course this means more mining and less pi but so what neither one was going to win any awards for being particularly fun or interesting anyway one sucks just as much as the other so you may as well go with what worksi know you feel cheated on all the sp that you spent but theres no point in complaining about it ccp would sooner cut off their own nutsacks than refund a single sp to a subscriber and i can feel your pain op i was a dedicated drone boat captain for most of my career up to and including the day that ccp decided that drones suck and then went about making that belief into reality so youre not the only one whod like to get their sp from some skill or another that ccp decided to make irrelevant at some point  in fact i think the vast majority of subscribers have at least one skill that they wish they could just unlearn but again this makes no difference the good news is that you probably already have more skills than youll need to go into t1 mass production
just resubbed prob wont last long my problem is i remember when it was fun to play used to play 10hrs straight on weekends would never do that nowccp long ago lost their way one thing for certain is they only listen to certain groups and i wonder if those groups use anything other than isk generated plex and continually slant towards nul sec constricting hi sec and in so doing making any new additions gratuitoussovereignty is more likely part of the problem and not the solution wh space is more like the original nul sec than nul sec todaysolve nul sec problems in nul sec unbalancing hi sec doesnt do that and if you want a 00 game with free pvp everywhere then good luck 
why and how the hell would audio being played from your hard drive cause server issuesi think your tinfoil hat is of much better quality than everyone elses
i dont want to cast any doubt on your obviously thorough testing and knowledge of how the game code works butfor normal gameplay imagine audio is not even thereyour computer needs to know what ships are near you and in the system rightyour computer needs to know how far these ships are from you rightyour computer needs to know what direction they are traveling in right your computer needs to know what modules the ships near you are using rightdont you think that your computer could possible contain the game code that says when a ship within x km of you turns on module y  play sound zseriously just turn off your audio and stop being a drama queenjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

fellas to sumerize i have only one credit card it happens to be a credit union card thanks to homeland security in the usa everytime i purchase game time my credit union goes nuts are you doing bussiness in iceland what kind of bussiness blah blah blah after twenty minutes i get the green light the credit union blames it on homeland security homeland security blames it on iceland lets cut to the chase and open a ccp bank account in the usa  maybe canada if memory serves ccp bought world of darkness in georgia can a eve banking account be activated there i cant be the only one with this problem no i do not want to open another cc account just for a game 
it sounds like its a problem with your credit union next time this happens ask them why they have a problem with you making regular payments to a single foreign company ask them why they have a problem with the latest payment attempt when every other payment attempt to the same company is a legitimate oneask them why they need to contact you when their records would show the same thing happening regularlyif they try to say homeland security ask for the specific reason why they need to call you up every time ask them why their own records of calling you up in the past are not sufficientif that doesnt give you a good answer then ask yourself why that credit union deserves your business when their customer service is that terribledont expect ccp to spend money just because your credit union is incompetent
pretty much exactly thisanother credit card company would love your business they make it oh so easy to transfer from the one you are on to theirsim sure there are plenty of reasons ahem tax ahem that ccp would not want so setup payments in the usa and i dont blame them they are an icelandic company stands to reason they want iceland to benefit from the taxes they have to payjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
cant you just use paypal or something
if youre on a list that makes your credit union go nuts and blame an issue with homeland security whenever you pay for eve through ccps system youve probably got other more important things to worry about and clear up than paying for an mmothere are other options such as using paypal for the transfer or buying gtcs through a us authorized reseller if your credit union is going to be that anal about international transactions
i wouldnt miss them i rather see real names
have we heard any thing about this

oh really do tell me more
i want to start by saying that as a strategy a home system to provide intel or just demoralize an enemy was a novel and entertaining concept that provided a platform for psychological warfare that did indeed add to the experience in previous iterations of eve but with the overabundance of cloaky campers now nullsec is broken systems has broken nullsec in these ways1 with the network rules that are in place it is possible to simply leave an alt in a system minimize the window and forget about it literally until downtime while everyone in a developed system spins in station screaming and crying to the alliance about neutrals in system2 the skills to get a cloaky alt are simple and quick to obtain making cloaky alts very cheap3 and most importantly there is no tactical counter for this action there is no way a player can mitigate this action or relieve it once it is in place our sovereignty is being violated and there is nothing our pilots can do about it whatsoever4 with 0 risk to the assailant it is a cheap both figuratively and literally tactic that provides far too much benefit for costthe impacts of this breakage are far more profound than i believe anyone intendedneuts in system shut down industry corps they always have and always will regardless of what corps can do the barriers that exist typically result in people logging off or spinning in station even though they shouldnt and there are tactical options to continue mining and operations when it comes to reality these options do not provide a risk vs reward ratio that allows for activity to continuewhy bother conquering an enemy just park cloaky alts in their home system and watch them log off effectively owning the system until downtime when if planned correctly they just log back in afterward to continue the festivities for sometimes days on endback in the days before the sov changes and it was just ratting and mining there were fewer carebears in nullsec that were out there to enjoy the game and have fun now that the system is in place that has created a more inviting environment and made nullsec fun we have this situation where that fun is being taken away by a mechanic that is simply brokeni offer some of the following as possible alternatives1 offer a cloaking jammer that has multiple levels providing protection from different levels of cloaks for instance a level 1 cloaking jammer would uncloak a prototype cloak while a level 5 would reveal a black ops ii cloak2 offer a cloak interference probe that could be launched by covops ironically ships to detect cloaked ships these probes could have a short lifespan but would disable for a short time the cloaking device of any ships within its area of effect3 increase the capacitor use on cloaking devices such that it would be impossible to run them and remain capstable for long periods of time while traveling this would not impact them but would limit their ability to simply troll the enemyremember that we are here to play the game and if were pinned down by trolls it is fun for only one person who is reducing or eliminating the fun for dozens i realize that eve like life is not fair but as a game i believe that more fairness is required to make the experience enjoyable for everyonethank you for reading thisbelloch

a minigame will do the same thing to mmining it did to explorationbe interesting until you have to do it for the fifth time at which point you get bored and leave because the only real change is now you have to make 30 extra clicks for what will be on average the same iskhour you were making beforemining is the afk activity its for people who would rather chat with friends whiel making money its the social or closest to it part of eve exploration used to be the antisocial part of eve but then they turned it into a middleschool version of minesweeper
no it makes ships good at one thing and capable of being fitted for one thing only there was a time in eve where you could use your inventiveness to surprise your enemy compare the old armageddon to the new one now you have radically less choice and lets be blunt lazers are still so useless that nearly noone uses geddons at all they rebalanced a ship with a lot of variability into being a bad version of a dominix so in large pvp we dont see them at allsame as ecm neut ships snipers and laser ships they are all effectively gone from the game if i wanted to put heavy blasters on my raven that was my choice but now we have the wowification in full swing  not only can you not choose to fit surprise fits but everything is turning into a drone ship or being simply dumped by players since the introduction of the abaddon who uses an apocalypse any more the powergrid and cpu of ships is being very carefully managed too to wipe out things players liked to use because they dont fit the classes zealots for example got shredded and are now being used in suicide fleets because its more fun to suicide it than to bother trying to sell the nowuseless hunk of rubbish when i see a dominix fleet in null i know how it will be fitted when i see a rogue in wow i know how it will be equipped because i know their fit and they know mine unless one of us is really bad i already know how the fight will endsee the pointwe are now in a wow pvp era which is all about instant dps whichever dev is most responsible i want his head on a pike for dumbing down this game so badly and i love the nestor design  oh look another dominix clone  we already know noone will bother to put lasers on it for pvp
if you as the csm let that happen then i vote no confidence in you and the current ccp devsseriously no just no if people are not playing in h enough now then work out why and fix that dont dumb the game down morecynos in wormholes will ruin wh entirely ability to hatch a station in one sure with med facility sure cynos no just no never forget that or you may as well just delete wh space entirely let us be very clear making eve easier will not stop star citizen demolishing the player base on launch day eve will only survive if it remains skillbased strategy game that is both unforgiving of mistakes and it must allow people to make mistakesif i want to build a nyx in a wormhole and get it trapped there  so be it allowing cynos in wh means the game is diminished because there will be no risk to invading capital fleets goons etc will simply cyno in roqual with clones and a dread fleet destroy and loot everything over a couple days then move on to the next one with no risk of being trapped in the wh stopping people from splitting weapon types because it is bad is also an example of this diminishing of the game  is it a mistake to mix missiles and turrets usually but players should be allowed to make such mistakes conceptually this is the same design element as in a rpg where putting on metal armour stops a mage casting magic the wow babying approach is to make it so mages cannot put on metal armour at all the sophisticated rpg approach is you can put on the armour but you suffer the consequences eve online is famous for consequences such as forgetting to have enough fuel in your pos in a wh  but it must also continue to allow players to make mistakes if it does not it will doom itself oh while we are at this  sniper ships like apocalypse need to be able to target and shoot out to 500 km and should micro jump drive distance x50level when speeds went up and up and up more the 250 km hard limit on targeting failed to keep up you cant change one aspect of a game like this and expect things designed 10 years ago to remain appropriateso ccp  stop trying to make this a first person pilot game it is not and never will be star citizen is and is from the ground up making combat twitch in eve is just going to make the game look stupid  and admit it that is the intent of the interceptor changes i dont like instant i like skill being required but there is such a thing as too far and recent changes have gone too far without considering other systems such as hard cap on targeting range dont break eve because you know someone else is making something worthy of being very afraid of as that wont workthe way for eve to survive is to be eve online  distinctive strategic chess in space where you can discover you lost many moves ago making it too twitchy or very gimmicky orbital strikes anyone is just going to leave it a muddled mess that makes people want the real eve backso csm  do your job stop cynos in whs before they really do ruin thator get out all quit en masse with an open letter to the developers saying you are done with the dumbing down of eve and ccps designers increasingly desperate measures to counter the threat posed by a first person space game that seeks to have the depth of eve online this game will be absolutely fine if it stays true to its core design philosophies the only problem is that it hasnt done that over recent years and is fast heading to being a theme park not a sandbox that game model works too only when a new ride opens in a shiny new theme park the old park closes to survive add more sand not shiny versions of the same old thing and dont put cynos in wh to make null even more pointless
so you are ok that we have learned how to crash the server to save capitalattacking me personally does not change the simple fact that this game is now facing credible opposition for the first time in 10 years and the recent design decisions by the devs suggest that they are moving away from the original design of eve online in order to try to protect the playerbasethat makes sense only the game is broken when we can crash the server to save capitals there is not meant to be a get out of jail free card in eve online yet  there are and adding cynos in wh will be yet another get out of jail free card added if they do that so yes we will see the design choice crystal clear soonif they add cynos in wh then they are dumbing down the game as you wont need to find a wh and path to get in new fuel just jump it in if they keep true to the design of wh being dangerous unforgiving places they wont allow cynos in there we will see soon enough
you are one of the null alliances actively trying to stop people playing this game and your alliance leadership is actively promoting star citizenanswer these1 eve valkyrie is intended to be a direct counter to the appeal of a first person fighter experience in a rich world as is intended by star citizen yes or no2 given the dust514 fiasco do you have any confidence in ccp having the ability to integrate eve valkyrie into eve online in a meaningful way for my part thats yes and no when a titan can instant pop a carrier there simply is no time window for eve valkyrie pilots to be able to be involved in any meaningful pvp events that and they would just get smartbombed to death anyway so valkyrie may be a lot of fun but like dust it will not be relevant to eve online itself oh and star citizen not being set in stone is actually the problem for ccp star citizens designers are listening and adding things in still to increase the appeal of that game they even have mining ships now by the time they are done  it may look an awful lot like eve just without the 10 year old legacy code and a design that admits you cant put everyone in one system at a time and expect things to still work rather than pretending you can and crashing out on the best battles
no im notso what mittens does on his dumb news website doesnt mean i listen to it or careno its a game some people at ccps newcastle office made as tech demo for the occulus rift in their 20 time no i dont see it as a direct counterconsidering ive been playing dust since the early beta have enjoyed it and still doyes richard garriott syndrome
yeah sure i broke the nda just to score points in a meaningless forum threadstill i hope you have gained some insight into how it feels to have sweeping changes demanded for your game style by someone who doesnt share it
ive stopped using drones for a while now since they tried to stop afk site campers and supposedly drone aggro was fixed but i find anytime i deploy a drone it gets instantly locked before it even touch a frigate word is from what i heard from other players is the aggro is broken again but some players dont have a problem with drone aggro while others are instantly losing them out the bay i would also like to see some kind of module that would send out a signal that would cause pirates to fire on that person using said module to make a tank in fleet mission ops once more a viable position in an attempt to make pve more pvp and to keep afk missionplex campers away the drone ships themselves have suffered huge setbacks not to include the heavy missile nerf because of the tengus range make my command ship suffer in missions aswell having 54km range
you need to get aggro from the rats before deploying drones set them on passive if you dont want the aggroing things without your specific intent monitor them carefully and look out on screen for incoming damage drones are no longer zeroattention damage you have to pay attention just as you do with turrets or missilesthere will not be a module to make the zero attention dps so you need to learn to manage themnb rats really hate ew and rr activity now try using a target painter
oh i do pay attention i take the whole room before their even deployed and i use a painter but they are still attacked no sooner than deployed so i resorted to using a web on a cnr and not deploying drones at at all in the time i deploy and scoop without them attack i lose at least 1 drone with in that time frame death rate increase if i was to other wise tell them to attack something
i think you are too late  they have strayed so far from interesting gameplay now that the only thing to do is wait for star citizen
i must say it makes a refreshing change to see star citizen waved as the give me my own way regardless of opposing facts or aguments club once upon a time it was nothing but not giving me my own way regardless of opposing facts or arguments is eves ngeit got dreadfully tedious reading the some old hackneyed cliche as to why ccp should give random nonentity 53019 their own way regardless of opposing facts or arguments oh god how tedious it got but now we have a new hackneyed cliche refreshing
the actual star citizen that will be released eventually or the wild aspirations of the this is every game ever and will be perfect in every way now give chris roberts another million bucks and hell include another spaceship version
i really have no idea what youre doing wrong then thats not what happens when i deploy vs ratswhich kind of drones are you usingare they set to passive or aggressive
ive had problems with a few elite frigates i would gain aggro and target paint them before launching drones but the frigates would start shooting the drones when the drones hadnt even aggrod the frigates yet i was using small dronesi last had this months ago since i dont do missions anymore but i also dont remember an update in the meantimei remember this happening in the assault level four against guristase in my opinion if there is a problem its that certain rats might have an unexpectedly high aggression towards drones maybe some rats were overlooked when the aggression was adjusted
hello fellow eve online players i spend the majority of my time trading  station trading i am running into an annoyance and have a suggestion to help better the gamewhen i want to sell an item in my station inventory i normally right click it and press sell this itemthen the next step is a window pops up and at the bottom right of this new window i press the magnifying glass with the title click for detailed market infoit is an annoying process because its a 2 step button click process believe me that this adds a lot of time added on unnecessarily especially because i have to click sell this item and then move my mouse around to click the magnifying glasshere is my solution give us the option within settings to enable a new feature the new feature is that we will now have a new choice when right clicking our item in the inventorythe new option will simply be a sell this item and view market details combo this will solve a whole lot of issues such as cutting the time spent on this by over half and having to do an annoying mouse drag and click to manually select the magnifying glasshere is my rough draft for the name of the new option in the pop up menusell and view market details or sell and view details or sell and details those are just my guesses for the namei really do care about improving the economic and market side of the game i love eve online a lot and only want to improve the game i am eager to hear all of your responses and hope you like the ideagriff
now that we have had some time to reflect on the pi  poco changes in this latest update i would like to suggest a few tweaks1 set the npc tax rate to zero when a player corp sets up a poco lets think this one through for a moment  why should interbus the npc get any tax at all once their customs office is destroyed it makes no sense  it is akin to paying rent to a 00 corp for a system they no longer control it also makes the hisec pocos much less profitable for the player corps that have invested the 100m or so necessary destroy an interbus customs office and set up their own interbus deserves nothing nada zero from planets where they have no customs office2 apply customs code expertise to poco tax rates i was not a big fan of this skill in the first place but if you are going to say that training this skill gives you such expert tax knowledge that you can avoid 50 of the customs duty at level 5 then go ahead and apply it to pocos as well player corps can set their tax rates with the sure and certain knowledge that anyone who cares a whit about pi will be training this to level 5 anyway and it makes the skill consistent3 tax free planetary launches throughout history there have been those daring individuals who seek to maximize profits by evading customs duties  they are called smugglers the planetary complex you build full of your own people  should not be sending isk payments out every time you do a planetary launch instead keep the isk and take the risk  make the planetary launch tax free from npc and poco taxes but make the pickup of such a container in orbit a suspectflagging offense and make the materials in the container appear as loot in a smugglers wreck when destroyed this motivates both smuggling and tax code enforcement by corps with pocos flame on
1 absolutely no if i can setup my own poco in highsec and remove all taxes for important  exporting to it then there is very little incentive to setup a poco in lowsec or nullsec highsec pocos are much harder to destroy no caps need a wardec etc and while highsec planets produce less many many poco activites arent centered on direct production but for manufacturing higher tier goods from lower tier goods the tax helps balance using the littlerisk highsec activities from the much higher risk lowsecnullsec activities if you need a rp reason its to pay for concords protection of your poco 2 the skill is fine as it is no change needed 3 what are you smoking smugglers get paid for moving goods you have to pay to move goods from your planet surface to some orbital pickup point and if they call that a tax so be it your not landing on the planet in your iteron and it is silly to not to expect to pay for transporting goods from the surface to its pickup point furthermore the pickup point is usually in a safe location which means you dont have to worry about some cloaked combat person waiting for you they have to probe you first
im gonna make some terrible suggestions based on shaky lore interpretation and rl comparison without any regard for game design and balance
i dont think i need to say more pretty important tbh i would say more so over corp bms badly needed
malcanis as a disloyal constituent of yours i demand that you at this very instant wake upits past the time you should be waking up anyway or youll get crankyvote of no confidence
oh and that bomb flight timeyou are kidding me rightbombers cant bomb interceptors or frigates any more they just warp off before the bomb lands or better yet zip 50 km past while having instantly pointed youand i do mean instant  server speed with all that lovely power of programs maybe its just great reflexes and wonderful ping but if it is then it means eve needs to be free to play for everyone who isnt in the privileged countries because all you do in eve online now is lag and die to instant everything great ping players or you too cheat and do everything at server speed why you lose if you dont interceptors can fly faster than missiles now great so two dominix remote repping with curators and one interceptor instant tackle add good ping and you never lose wow muchso yes ccp  sort this mess out fast is fun instant is not and cynos in wh  that better be a joke because if it is not eve online will be
ok so agree in part dont think we need more type implants we have hardwiring ones for that or we have mods or whatever put it this way we have a ton of different things to effect those stats tbh too manyhowever i agree get rid of learning implants overall and bring in the boosters and remove the remap it would be great just to boost the training just for a small period of time and when i want to for certain attributes so ill 1 you for that
a few points there are a few ways you can look at this these are the facts skillpoints are the primary means for your character to progress attribute implants alter this rate of progression these implants are destroyed when you are podded the ideal way the game works the more your risk the greater the potential reward  if you want to train more sphr you plug in implants losing your pod means you lose these implants this is a very sound implementation for all implants so where is the true issue frankly there issue is us players that game the system we can plug in implants and partake in very risk adverse behavior essentially negating all substantial risks to our implants and maximizing our player progression highsec players with full crystal  slave sets never fear losing their implants in standard operating situations learning implants are the worst as you can make full use of their benefits while being in the complete safety of a station or even worse while being logged off the truth is i have no sympathy for a pilot that wont pvp in their slave clone or learning clone or whatever the whole point of those implants is that if you want the rewards they offer then you accept the risks of losing them at the end of the day the complaints about learning implants or slave implants or any other blingy implant is the same you cant swap implants the way they can swap from an archon to a punisher to suite their current play style this is what honestly needs to change simply make it so you can swap clones without the jump clone limitations several people especially in wh space have asked for a pos module that stores clones and allows this and this is honestly far more ideal than boosters note i am not advocating for the removal of the jump clone timer i think swapping clones should require that secondary clone to be in the same location as you at the end of the day this greatly reduces the opportunity costs of pirate implant sets which is a downside but not something unacceptable
come to think of it thats been my experience as well running anomalies generally i find that larger drones tend to get murdered by little ships really quickly if i use them indiscriminately my solution to this was to carry a few flights of light drones along use them to kill off the frigates and then use heavier drones only when the area is clear of little stuff this also helps deal with the ewar problem which can be really bad in some sites doing it that way i find that lights tend to survive fights where heavies get murdered since the light drones can evade incoming fire while killing the ships that go after themtry it out and see if it helps
since my thread was locked for redundancy i guess ill chime in here insteadbasically we just need to revolt start cancelling your alt accounts one by one until ccp addresses the issue make sure when you cancel the account to put in the reason box ccp has failed to stop cloaky camping and i am cancelling this account in protestmaybe when the layoffs start someone will get off their kiesters and at least give us a cogent wellthought and wellintentioned response with substance on this topic
im not seeing that as a good pathi am a miner by preference usually in nullbefore you can solve cloaky camping you need to solve the reasons that inspire itlong story short it is one of the more well known ways that has a reputation for success against pve targetsgive them a better way to attack pve targets hint something we can actually resolve instead of that useless stalemate effect and you will eliminate the afk cloaky bitupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked

whats the point of a poco if everyone using the planet can do free launchesrocketships arent free you know transporting a bunch of cargo from the ground into orbit is pretty expensivejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
true but there is no cost difference between lifting 500m3 of lead or 500m3 of gold into orbit i am not saying that there should not be a fixed price paid for every launch i am merely saying that the cost of the goods in the container should not figure into that equation as this is not a tax transaction at 500m3 per launch and one launch per 5 minutes nobody is going to get too rich doing this  but it does provide an outlet around the extreme taxation pocos if you want to use it the counter is that they may bust you running around with the suspect flag in a hauler
3 what are you smoking smugglers get paid for moving goods you have to pay to move goods from your planet surface to some orbital pickup point and if they call that a tax so be it your not landing on the planet in your iteron and it is silly to not to expect to pay for transporting goods from the surface to its pickup pointhauling corps with freighters get paid for moving goods smugglers get paid for moving goods past customs authorities without paying the duty the danger mode of hauling would be blockade running running from gate to gate in your cloaky hauler from nullsec to jita hoping you can get your cargo in if it were possible to land on your planet in an iteron in this game load up your cargo and then try to pull a daring han solo escape past the ships camped out in orbit i would be all for it as it is the only possibility for smuggling is the planetary launch system as i noted above there is no difference in cost for launching 500m3 of lead vs 500m3 of gold so planetary launches should be fixed price  no tax affairs all that means is that it only makes sense to smuggle valuable items  duh
if i can setup my own poco in highsec and remove all taxes for important  exporting to it then there is very little incentive to setup a poco in lowsec or nullsec highsec pocos are much harder to destroy no caps need a wardec etc and while highsec planets produce less many many poco activites arent centered on direct production but for manufacturing higher tier goods from lower tier goodsvery little incentive to setup a poco in lowsec or nullsec what are you smoking the huge increase in material extraction rates alone justifies that cost  the motive is profit just wacking the interbus customs office and setting up your own at a 0 tax rate can add enough to your profit to pay for itself yes many of the hisec planets are used only as processing centers  importing raw materials from nullseclowsec and exporting higher tier items you are still collecting taxes from the transactions through your poco and there is still no reason for interbus to get any of it concord protection really they protect everything from noobships to control towers for free all over hisec so i dont see much point in that argument i can make a better argument that buying and burning starbase charters in a control tower should entitle one to faction navy protection as for hisec pocos being hard to destroy  are you kidding i was watching battleship gangs do them in 20 minutes so what if you need a wardec in hisec any reasonable gang can put a poco into reinforced in 30 minutes or less
would you support adding a base tax say 15maybe reducible to x to all highsec activities in order to help balance the risk meaning all refining manufacturinginventioncopying sales lp bounty etcyou know to pay for concord
yes although ccp has already attempted to balance some aspects of highsec via limited resources
ive destroyed plenty of pocos and own a few myself to rf a poco in 20 minutes you need to deal out 65k dps which is 6 oracles given 6 pocos in a system thats 2 hours of structure shooting for 6 pilots in nullsec or lowsec you can use a single supercap or dread if you are brave and rf a poco in half the time you dont have to wardec time  isk savings and you use less player time in highsec there are more planets than is pragmatic to control this means anyone can setup their own tax free poco and have the ability to perfectly produce high tier pi goods from low tier pi goods why would this be good for the game the only benefit that lownull planets would have is much better extraction rates this is good but it is only one part of the pi industry truthfully you are only suggesting this because it helps you personally not because it is good for the game
i agree with ali when looking down the barrel of a huge training time it is nice to know there is something i can do to alter the time even by a small percentagerisk averse folks want to be able to hotswap so they can have the best of both worlds get out and fly cheap or snake when the time comes but maximize training effects when they are docked in other words the best of both worldsi get that    but i think i lean towards the keeping of the implants and all the decisionsfactors to consider that make this game complex i dont want to simplify the game i like the decision process and the balancing of risk and rewardtaking implants away would just then bring the next lamb to slaughter   why do we have skill implants not the path i want to go down so no i side with keeping them and even adding more choices more implants and better reasons to pod a person as well as blow up their shipthis from a hisec carebear    working hard for the sistersmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i ran an apoc so all i used were light drones ive never used heavies or sentries but having the frigs aggro drones when i was using ewar on them and when the drones hadnt aggrod yet was silly
can we just have it alreadyi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
not empty quoting
well that is one reason lets not forget the main point the most used reason for cloaky camping in null is not to actually kill anything but to disrupt game play it is that threat of force projection that keeps many system from being used due to cloaky camping if you cloak in a system and stay there down time to down time there should be a mechanic to hunt you down and kill you this have been a great discussion please everyone keep it up and going once this reaches 10 pages i plan to start pinging the csm so valid arguments for all sides of the issue are welcome
ok lets say for now that you are right cloaky camping has disruption as a primary focus and any actual kills are simply a bonus many would claim the reverse to be true and they cannot be proven wrong eitheryou are missing the real issue by assuming that disrupting game play goes against the spirit of the gameobviously the players only looking at the effect on pve in null with sympathy towards the players claiming they cannot operate will see a problembut does ccp agreethis is eve the legendary sandbox where betrayal and metagaming are actually advertised features not embarrassing secretsthe key is and i know many players who will not hesitate to point out this fact there are players who like the psychological warfare aspect specifically involved with threat projectionis he actually paying attentiondoes he have a cyno fitted on his shipif he has a cyno does he have enough players ready to go currentlyif all three of these can be answered yes then you have the reality of danger which is something many praise as intended to exist in eveif you are uncertain about any aspect then you have potential danger the uncertainty that costs more isk by reputation than actual ship losses themselvesif you know that any of these three is false the threat is empty and you can operate safely with minimum preparation against possibly a single shipbut if you open the door even for the price of effort to resolving the presence of a cloaked ship then you also remove the uncertainty and with that goes the cloaky plus afk combinations effectiveness out the windowtldr  if you can balance the ability to hunt cloaked ships afk cloaking will become manageable if not entirely obsoleteupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i fully agree with most everything you have said and if the a new mechanic was made that made it fully manageable i would agree with everything you stated however i am not asking for it to be easy in fact i want and active cloaky camper to be near impossible to catch without a lot of effort this will make the risk go both ways currently it is not a risk to cloaky camp and many do it while fapping to lady gaga or some other online activity i fully belive in the sandbox i just belive it should be a two way street
shoretened quotes in the interests of brevitywe agree in this case perhaps in many other ways as welli have worked the problem from reverse and done some research into cloakingfor myself cloaking is great for travel assuming one has the correct skills and tactics combined with a properly fitted shipi also explored the side relating to countering my own normal gameplay by seeing how hard it was to catch miners or rattersin null obviouslymy results in hindsight were quite predictablei could not catch anyone details oversimplified here obviouslyoh sure if someone had been traveling between systems at the wrong moment or were not watching local or their intel channels i might have had a better chance but those opportunities are far from guaranteed and can be rather uncommonthen i recalled how i had evaded similar threats while i mined what tools and tactics i had used what my vulnerabilities werein summary i realized that if i was simply alert and planned on what to do in an emergency i was safe to anything beyond a ridiculous threat such as a blob reinforcing pos or outpostand i could simply jc out or leave entirely with my corp in that casemy ideas on how to approach this followed using my insights and experiencethe two threads linked in my signature are intended to be used together or not at allthis third thread below can be used even with local unchanged at all it also does not allow hunting of cloaked ships but does trade better awareness for effort
in highsec there are more planets than is pragmatic to control this means anyone can setup their own tax free poco and have the ability to perfectly produce high tier pi goods from low tier pi goods why would this be good for the game flip it around why would this be bad for the game you can set up a hisec factory planet with perfect production but where exactly do you figure on getting the raw materials or trade goods needed as inputs for it you wont support many perfect factory worlds doing extraction in hisec so you are either extracting in lowsecnullsec yourself or buying the inputs from people who dothe only benefit that lownull planets would have is much better extraction rates this is good but it is only one part of the pi industry yes but it is one of the most important and profitable parts oil companies own refineries and oil fields the refinery doesnt make any gas profits without the input from the oil field why do oil companies explore for oil fields in very inhospitable places because that is where the oil is and that is where they must go to make profits similarly in eve your perfect production planet is not making any profits without the inputs from other planets the raw materials have to come from someplace so the ultimate benefit to moving out to lowsecnullsec extraction is profit truthfully you are only suggesting this because it helps you personally not because it is good for the gametruthfully you are entitled to your opinion  that and 100 gets you a cup of coffee pi is a profit motivated venture why do it otherwise you have already pointed out how a griefer gang of 6 oracles spending a couple of hours can wipe out 600m isk worth of hisec pocos and render your perfect production planets worthless by eliminating importexport without even bothering to put up new pocos themselves my notaxfornpcs proposal changes the roi calculation on a hisec poco and make it easier to justify spending 100m putting one up because you arent splitting income with interbus my customs code expertise proposal just dovetails onto this by making the owner of the poco figure that everyone who cares will train to level 5 and pay half the published rate  so he sets his tax rates accordingly people who do not train to level 5 pay more and he makes a bit more profit on that my taxfree  fixedprice launch proposal merely provides an alternative outlet for those with no customs office at a planet or a poco with prohibitive tax rates

ship fitting is currently one of the most time consuming parts of fitting large numbers of ships for corporationsalliances it can be made better by simply adding an option to fit x of a specific ship provided you have the partshullsammorigsetc availableafter that ccp needs to add a similar update for contracts
1 either option
i open this thread with the intention of fixing a few holes in booster variety currently we have sig radius missile explosion radius capacitor amount shield boost volume armour boost volume optimal range turrets falloff range turrets turret tracking so to complete the picture here i would like to introducea missile velocity bonus at around the same rate as either of the other boosters that affect rangeb ship velocity bonus modifier set quite low and a sig radius penalty that is proportionally and slightly higher than the speed boostwhy should these be added to the game to round out the booster itinerary and give players a couple of more options how to fit their ships especially those who use boosters already i think that if i were a missile user and wanted to push that to the limits i could run withcrash booster slot 3missile ev booster slot 2blue pill slot 1for your typical caldari pilot this set up would be crippling if they got hit by too many side effects theyre effectively exposing themselves to 12 side effects that may or may not cancel out the benefits of other boosters if they get no side effects then theyre applying their damage further and better the same as someone with the turret boostersfor a minmatar pilot they might choose xinstinct and the speed booster giving them the possibility of being scary fast scary hard to hit with side effects they too might suffer too many detrimental effects and ultimately cause their own deaths as a tangential bonus these boosters might encourage more creationconsumption of edge implants which just arent that good frankly
stopped reading here if you cant find a single item that makes money youre doing it wrong besides who would make the ships you get blown up in
your keyboard is ashamed of its owner
if the op could produce solid evidence that these problems exist fraps perhaps i would be less inclined to write this all off as sensationalist rubbishi would also like to see the killmail generated from your encounter with two rr domis and a ceptor partially just to confirm it actually happened and partially to see what you thought was a reasonable ship or ships to take that combo on with
imo the clone timer should be 1 hour per jump away the target system is that would nerf forceprojection like a brick to a window though titans would still be the bars the brick bounces off of but progressbut no seriosuly let us switch jumpclones instantly if were in the same station with 1 hour cooldown for every system away we jump to a clone i would be okay with that
there are plenty of people outside of iceland that dont have problems paying their subscription it may be time to investigate other options
theres a mechanic where rats wont shoot drones below their size only frigs go for lights cruisers will join in on mediums and everything will take shots at heaviessentriesive taken to killing the frigates first with longrange fire because micro jump drive then deploying drones it does seem that the aggro rules arent reliable or vary a lot between missionsive seen times when rats go immediately for any new drones but if i had my drones out from the start ie before i started shooting at all then they ignore the drones other times deploying drones immediately attracts the attention of nearby unaggressed rat groups i also found myself using vespas the other day they were in my drone bay i dont recall putting them there must have been drunk theyre  but they seem not to attract attention due to their awful applied dps on elite frigs
ccp have repeatedly sabotaged me under similar circumstances
how would you specify meperuns there is a lot of variables in that otherwise when you were intending to get x runs with research someone could drop single run 0me 0pe on your buy order
this would be excellent and i support it

my experience is that you get about 2x the extraction rate in lowsec and 4x the extraction rate in nullwh space per head i dont think this difference in extraction rates alone would offset the cost of moving goods from lownull to highsec especially since nullsec generally requires the use of jfs to move goods which adds considerable logistics cost furthermore some people would simply setup alts to milk highsec worlds dry using straight up extractor worlds since moving those goods tofrom a planet would cease to cost anything in the end this would simply be an unnecessary buff to highsec which is the safest area of the game highsec was already recently buffed by the creation of highsec pocos and i dont see the need to buff it again especially in a manner that discourages pi in other sec zones by reducing the profitability of pi overall have you ever tried to conquer someone elses pocos 6 oracles can put an entire system into rf spending several hours of time but then to complete the job they must return at the owners designated time and spend several more hours to finish the job if they dont destroy it within 4 hours of it exiting rf natural shield regen will increase shields to the point you have to endure another rf cycle a griefer group then must alarm clock to conquer the damn thing and the pocos are still fully operational when rfd this is on top of wardec fees the ability to bring in allies and the shear number of available planets and im certain you are being unrealistic about highsec poco vulnerability to be frank the roi on highsec pocos is already reasonable if you are fully utilizing your planets true potential why does the roi need to be improved a longer roi makes it a larger risk to operate one and more risk is exactly what highsec needs
1 to this request dscan should also be able to provide at least a relative bearing to the objects it detects if i as dscanning a 360 circle at 2 au and it picks up a control tower and a battleship it would definitely be nice to know if the control tow
yes and if dscan was upgraded properly we could get rid of local while were about it
my experience is that you get about 2x the extraction rate in lowsec and 4x the extraction rate in nullwh space per head i dont think this difference in extraction rates alone would offset the cost of moving goods from lownull to highsec especially since nullsec generally requires the use of jfs to move goods which adds considerable logistics cost my experience is about the same re extractor heads as far as using the jf to bring the materials back to hisec the cost of doing that in jump fuel is small enough to definitely make it worth it  and is routinely less than the 5 export tax charged in hisec bringing in 450m of precious metals at a cost of 20m in jump fuel works just fine for me and that doesnt even figure the savings from access to a jump bridge network you just cant run a real industrial concern in nullsec without a jf anyway  im certain you are being unrealistic about highsec poco vulnerabilityin think you are being unrealistic in expecting small or midsize hisec industrial corps to have the pvp capabilities to resist a dedicated pvp griefer gang what does it do to your calculations if that griefer gang is 6 rattlesnakes instead of 6 oracles are you really going to hire a merc corp for a 1b isk or so or put 2b or 3b isk worth of your own ships on the line to save a 100m isk poco with a 3month roi to be frank the roi on highsec pocos is already reasonable if you are fully utilizing your planets true potential why does the roi need to be improved a longer roi makes it a larger risk to operate one and more risk is exactly what highsec needsthe risk calculation for hisec pi has gone from no risk to you would have to be smoking crack to think this is a good idea there is no possible way you can compete extractionwise with the big alliances  corps based in lowsec  nullsec if you do manage to get a hisec factory world organized and somehow manage to feed it enough materials to keep it running any large corp or griefer gang can come by and eliminate you with a wardec and just smash your poco at any time to be frank even the changes i am suggesting might not be enough to change the riskprofit calculation to make hisec pi a good idea again the only hisec buff that the poco change made was to buff the ability of the large corps to squash the little guys im trying to level the playing field a bit with my suggested changes
yeah pretty much this

if youre unable or unwilling to assemble the pvp capability to take on six guys youre doing it wrong if you have neither the interest nor the ability to defend your own stuff you should either be looking to find and join a proper alliance that actually will defend its infrastructure or you should not be setting up that infrastructure in the first placejust saying
i agree on the no cyno in wormholes unless youre so lazy you cant warp from ab wh is not part of normal space it is between space so unless you can cause a tear in space which could happen but it would be like a wh end up at a random location yes pvp is being ruined by instant pvp which allows criminals with no fear because they are using alts to mission and mine to supply them and fly their orca loaded with destroyers so that the empire navy doesnt register them in a ship and allow groups of them to push expensive ships 200 km off of a gate and bank itive been playing since 05 no alts dabbled in pvp with horrid fcs or finding no one massively outnumbered or someone in a fleet with booster and logi alts so he doesnt lose his ship ive been in and with many alliances in null wh and empire do many things
bumping
frankly if i have to hear the same crap again one more time im filing a complaint with the un waterboarding isnt this bad
lorewisesomeone has to get that material launched from teh planetyou know the planet now owned by immortal demigods wielding apocalypselevel weaponry with literally negative fucks given about human lifeso yeah you are going to be paying npc residents a shitton of isk to get those goods into space for you and if they see those goods are valuable then of course they are gonna charge you more for their risk
so you transport 450m isk in goods to highsec you require operating a 6b isk jf needing 20m in fuel and certainly encouring inconviences andor risks when moving it alternatively you can earn 14th this 110m isk over the same time frame you dont need a 6b isk jf and you dont operate in risky space paying the 5 tax on your exports reduces this to 105m isk which has marginal effect on your profit line for these goods in contrast your factory worlds which routinely purchase 500m isk in materials to import down to a planet and then export it as 1b in highertier commodities are going to be much more heavily impacted by the importexport taxes it is precisely because of this you wish to eliminate the npc taxes so you can have your perfect factory worlds why do you deserve taxfree factory worlds in highsec you are already enjoying lowrisk operating costs as well as concord protection i dont understand why you should be on equal rewards with nulllowsec hmm lets look at the small or midsized hisec industrial corps what do they have in common they own and operate poss most notably with adv  regular mobile labs these run 60110m each not to mention the 312m  day operating expense these corps regularly deal with griefers you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means that attack them usually for the profit involved in blowing up the pos and taking the labs they put just as much up front if not more they have about the same roi and they cope with the threats that come at them or die hohoho while poco defense is different than pos defense each has their own major benefits over the other again i am positive you are being unrealistic about highsec poco vulnerability 1 oracles are used because they do decent damage 8001000 dps without the need to reload ammo 2 rattlers are tanky but do less dps than an oracle unless fit with missiles if you are going straight dps there are many ships that will outperform rattlers like the talos if you want dps  pvp ability there are also many ships that outperfrom rattlers although they have their niche too 3 you dont need to put 23b isk on the line to take on a 6man gang you need to play smarter not bigger 1 this is and has always been risk when operating in highsec it is still generally low risk though 2 no way you can compete extraction wise my dear friend poco resources are worse than asteroid resources you keep mining the planet and you keep getting resources the difference between highsec and lowsecnullsec is you gain more resources when operating in riskier environments we call this concept risk vs reward and i fully support upholding this paradigm 3 qq  some boogy man might attack your poco for zero profit just to  you off when this happens offer to sell it to him to recoup your costs it save them hours of shooting structures and is generally winwin ive dealt with buying  selling pocos many times then you move your operation somewhere else this is a dogeatsdog world and you submitlose until you are strong enough to win 4 why would the big badass boogyman noone else can defeat be interested in your lameass pocos hint there is very little profit in blowing up a poco and shooting them for  and giggles gets very old very fast pragmatically the only time your pocos get attacked is if you attract attention to them somehow then you rightfully need to deal with the fallout

id like to see these if nothing more than for a loot pinata and tear factoryi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i was trying to find a monolith on the market i even checked jita 44 so started searching on the forums and came across this what is taking ccp so long1
you know that is what i have been wondering since the day i came up with this idea so what i would suggest is start snagging people to support this make contact with your csm reps and try to garner more supporttheres only so much i can personally do matei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

only 1 response  really
tbh that such a no brainer and oft repeated topic got 1 reply should be enougheveryone who has ever dealt with alliances wants these there is no real need for discussion or anything its just a matter of ccp seeing if it is workable and hey it may well be
so mr csm why isnt it done if its such a no brainer and often repeated
thank you i am going to have to try to find more people to help promote this get your corporations and alliances involvedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
support and like this 1
i cant see the point people rehashing posts on afk cloaking when there are literally tens of thousands of posts already
if you are bored because you are too afraid to undock due to neutrals grow a pair of big balls or go play dota meanwhile nullsec isnt safe and it will never be deal with it consider hisec as a afkcloaker free carebearland
ahh yet another flippant and off the hip response with no substantial thought or knowledge to contribute i hope its not these types of responses that keep ccp or the csm from noticing these things i too want to know why ccp and or the csm are not making any comments suggestions or even acknowledging any post on afk posting we are close to the point where i will spam the csm with the link to this discussion provided i get meaningful responses
just one question springs to mind how do you post while afkdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
long story made short it is going to take time and effort but keep the topic going i fully support this and just like my support tug idea i will keep pushing to help see this through 1 and a hell yeahi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
hi im making this post to point out some inconcistency in the venture mastery flow from mastery l3 and onwards it requires ice mining and we all know the venture cant fit ice miners so to be able to acquire a mastery l5 on the venture youd need to go after useless skills for this particular hull
yes i bet as you saw the topic you thought oh god not this subject again for the 100th timeso perhaps we can get this laid to rest and stop the constant posts on this subject there is only one question we need to askis ccp looking to address this or not  not how or when just are they a simple yes or no at least then people know if ccp have any intention to do anything about itthanks

so how come the longest running issue i am aware of with thousands and thousands of pages of posts has never been proposed by csm
same way you kill minersratters while afkmajick
yeah makes sense to me always for additions to the game that take very little coding and art department time
my proposal is simple1 allow discussion of bans andor gm actions on a specific subforum within the official eve forums as long as other forum rules on no personal attacks are upheld i dont see a reason why this couldnt be done furthermore limiting it to a specific subforum would make moderation easy in the other areas alongside explaining that there will be no official action or response based on a forum thread2 create a transparent process for escalating petitions of gm actions the biggest benefit of this would be to encourage uniformity within gm decisions and end some of the arbitrary decision making processes that have prevailed in the pastpart of the csms job is to create transparency and give players a voice within ccp and it does that very well on broad issues but on individual issues it has been my impression that gm decisions tend to made arbitrarily and without requirement for backing up etc this is further stifled by not allowing discussion of said incidents on the forums something which seems extremely draconian and ultimately unnecessary if there is uniformity within these actionsid appreciate any comments or criticisms of this proposal
the primary issue is the additional cost for ccpbanned players lie they lie a lot they will go to this subforum with their fake tale and try to stir up controversy they will manufacture chat logs and do everything they can to convince people that ccp is the bad guy for every case of someone who was banned improperly there are a hundred exploiters explaining how they were banned improperly this forces gms to spend time refuting a constant stream of lies and this costs money
that could be mitigated a lot if ccp introduced some way for players verify what was said say by giving the person the gm is communicating with a link that lets anyone see the full discussion between the player and gm then take action against anyone who starts a thread without providing their link or adjust the forum software to make that automaticif someone fabricates a chat log then bring in moderation first have the moderator paste the genuine chat logs then bring down serious public punishment other posters will quickly get the message that dishonesty is not tolerated there
the thing is game companies are very secretive about how they find exploiters so that exploiters have a harder time avoiding punishment players often arent given the specific evidence that incriminated them so you would get these logs that say something like dear x you have been banned for exploiting y and the player will say something like i wasnt exploiting y it was an accident i was running program z and that must have confused the moderators so your proposal will still require that gms put in more work to create a report detailing evidence against players and it will help exploiters avoid future protectionand i promise you this particular forum would require a ton of moderation even with strict punishments likely as much as the rest of the forums combined you would have angry posters trying to vindicate themselves trolls stirring up these posters and people who love drama picking sides and flaming it would be crime  punishment on steroids
in order to launch missiles that rapidly the launch tubes must be pressurized this takes thirty seconds the other ten seconds is for reloading all of the missiles boom realism
my opinion deal with it rlmls were overpowered and had become a you are an idiot if you dont fit these for fights now theyve been nerfed but simultaneously morphed into a new type of weapon that has some serious advantages with one major drawback eve should be about choices like this
this has nothing to do with homeland security this is your banks antifraud department since you do all your transactions in one place or to popular online sites when you make a payment to an obscure company in iceland they assume the worstid ask to talk to their fraud prevention people and have them make an exception for this transaction for you when i travel abroad i always call my bank first to let them know so they can put a note in their systems so my card doesnt get rejected
fair enough seems like a bug though might want to try to report it that way since its clearly incorrect

why thank you good siri am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this is a non issue it is just another game mechanic people use and some abuse regularly as for ccp response i can some it up in one of the oldest lines of eve dont fly what you cant afford to losebut if i was going to make a suggestion to fix it then just make a tech2 version of the mobile cyno jammer that would jam or decloak cloak a ship entering its field
tbh this smacks of half measures if youre really serious about this you should threaten to hold your breath until they give inif ccp wont give in youll die and that will make them murderers then theyll go to prisonthen theyll be sorry
i think most people have no issue with a pilots ability to stay cloaked afk or not and harass enemies in a system however add a new aspect to the game give us the ability to hunt cloaked ships just like the allies found new ways to hunt menacing submarines during world war one then again in world war two it just makes sense that technology would be developed to hunt cloaky shipsit would add a new challenging aspect of game play too trying to hunt down stealth boats and stealth boats no longer running around cloaked with complete impunitybrought to you by barony of vulnezia mmo micro nation wwwvulneziacom be a part of the worlds first mmo micro nation
finally someone who not only understands what i have been getting at but has found a better way to put it this is exactly what i have in mind
i have long endorsed this as a solutionbut it is not complete by itselfthe reason is in my own and several others opinion that cloaking becomes trivialized if you are made aware of it automatically and can then choose to hunt it based on this awarenessthe world war two analogy did not have the radio shack operator warning their respective ships that a sub was in their region and ships should return to port for safety concernsthe sub had to either screw up and let itself be spotted or be known as a consequence to otherwise unexplained ship lossbattle group commander this freighter was lost contact at these coordinates with no enemy surface assets close by it must be something we could not have seen and we all know what that meansdestroyer captain i follow your point sir ill have my boat and the others begin a sweep with sonar well catch that devilit was also a point that proactive searching was also common around important ships particularlyupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i totally agreethis is why i have not opposed cloaked ships dropping from localit may be another discussion and in other threads as well but if local were not the intel tool it was another method such as programbles scans that can be automated or somthing along those line should be implementedthis also requires paying attention to the scansas far as cloaked ships goes there should be some tell tail that they are there but not a glaring one unless you are actively searching then you should have some reasonable chance of finding the cloaked devil however if he is smart and alert that could be impossible and should be however if he is careless and inactive hunting him down should not be all that difficultfor instance in wormhole space it is prudent to d scan every 5 to 10 seconds or so and in null before i do anything i probe my systems and the systems around me to wormholes so that i can have a reasonable chance of not being surprised by someone
keeping in mind that wh players have been perfectly clear that they want no means to detect cloaked shipsa few often show up in various threads to warn off ideas they see as threatening their play styleccp has implied they would like to see cloaking made into a cat and mouse exchange with ships chasing after each otheri think that would add a lot of interest to the game especially in nullupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
observed the new rhml launcher addition to cal navy lp store it costs the same number of tags to produce 5 of these as it costs to produce a bpc for 5 run 200mm railgunthats a battleship weapon for as cheap as 200mm railguns cruiser weapon how does this make sense at all
if this is such a problem just go buy a refillable credit card and just put eve and the price to keep the card active on it hell it is how i do most of my online anyway
well i opened a support ticket about it and the gm instructed me to post here
imho faction weapons should outperform t2 but only until specialization 3 or 4 for the t2 weapon as fara s weapons go the only kind of modules that should ever perform better or equal to t2 at lvl 5 spec is ded or officer gear faction should be allowed t2 ammo but become weaker compared to t2 after spec 3 or 4 hell kinda on the fence on whether faction should perform so much better as it does than t2 for the other module types as well makes t2 kinda silly in a lot of cases where the benefit of that faction is a better module for triple or quadruple the cost but extra fitting room to make an overall vastly superior fit than if you had used t2 making it a huge benefit but whatever ccp will do whatever the hell they please
yeah first well ahev arenas so then a majority fo people who want pvp will stop doing world pvp and do it solely in the arena where its fair and they can be guaranteed a win ebcause they poured billions into their frigate they ahve maxed out skills for and play 9 hours a day with then people will start whining about how pvpers should stay in the arena and there need to be pvp flags in lownullno if you want some sort of organized mechanic for tournaments make it yourself get some buddies in alpha ships lock up all participants and say hey these are the rules anyone interferes or breaks one and you die here ar ethe rpizes now kill eachother
cost should never be used as a balancing factor what you pay for an item on the market is your decision alone the point of contention here comes from the manufacturing cost from the lp store  taken against the raw stats performance of the item and finally the supply of materials from the sourceas i detailed above  the supply of tags for these items used to be part of fw plexing in addition to mission farming now though the issue is much harder since those fw tags have been removed and all that remains are fw missions and regular missions the average player will not farm tags from fw missions surely because of the immense danger that being in low sec and running a mission alone represents but also because of the loss of potential lp gain and the delay in the rewards from that mission alone running missions like that in small fleets cuts in to everyones profits  its a really badly designed system high sec mission running will produce tags eventually thanks to getting oodles of useless pirate tags first i guess you could go to a border system from one highsec to another and start farming the npc police that come to kill you but that seems slow and inefficient at least nonfw gankers will get concorded i guessthirdly and lastly are the raw performance for faction weapons over t1t2officer weapons not much to say here grab the compare tool next time youre in game and take a look it depends on what faction youre taking the weapon from and what kind of weapon you want faction weapons should definitely not have access to t2 ammo  the only reason to train t2 specialization is because of the t2 ammo faction weapons in my opinion are really our meta5 weapons while t2 are our meta 6 items it would more accurately represent the kind of dedication to their training that when fully decked to level 5 specialization a t2 blaster outperforms a faction blaster once again though i leave those technical details to the balancing staff my concern here is making the supply of faction weapons easier  such that they arent 30 or 40 million for a small neutron fed navy because they dont have to be that costly as compensation for the effort of making them even pirate faction weapons which share identical stats are often significantly cheaper only because theyre so much easier to acquire
we need a drone booster for slot 3 cos at the moment missile users can have the advantage of three boosters with crash being in slot 3
algos  12catalyst  13myrmidon  16brutix  17arbitrator  13omen  14dominix 18hyperion  19despite drone boats having a weapon system that can be disabled and easily left behind it seems tiericide didnt touch them as much in regards to balancing them with vessels their same class the nondrone ships i listed can still use drones though they dont have drone bonuses note how the gila when compared to say the vigilant has the same number of slots because there is no other guristas cruiser this is something i feel the csm needs to talk to ccp about balance wise
i kinda like this idea1we need more stuff like that instead off the bullshit ccp throws out recently
how about you actually do something about the most posted mechanic in the game rather posting trash
i would actually like that ccp carry the same attitude they have with faction ships they want to see more of them in space i support making faction weapons and at least all navy faction modules more accessible much more volume and cheaper 23 times the price of the t2 module not 100x in some cases perhaps remove a large portion if not all of the tag costs it could follow similarly to the difference between fw and highsec npc corp lp store prices as it is with the ships i dont even think you would need to rebalance the faction weapons that much there should a choice between using faction and tech ii you lose the ability to use tech 2 ammo which is a big deal but you dont really gain that much from a faction weapon to justify the cost as it is now slightly higher rates of fire which are almost the same as t2 because of specialization skills lower fitting more ammo capacity etc
uhh why droneboats are already pretty strong why do they need buffing and they have a weapon system that doesnt use slots which is i think the reason they have one less
so you are saying the gila should have one less slot and any ships that use drones should also have a extra slot removedships with a bonus to hybrids for example the thorax can use drones and a ship with a bonus to drones for example the vexor can use hybrids yet somehow the vexor is penalised for using drones as a weapon system slotwise what makes drones so special that a ship has to have a slot removed hybrids have ammo yet for drone boats their ammo drones can be destroyed missiles can be blown up but do you see missile boats with a slot removedecm drones are pretty powerful yet ships with the bandwidth to fit them have the same amount to control as drone ships which is 5 do droneboats excepting the guardianvexor have the ability to control more than nondroneboats who can operate 5 drones at the same time
well the only issue i have with the module now is that you cant selectively change ammo to exploit resistances the primary advantage of missiles although eve is a game where most of the fight is determined before the fight happens so youd have to choose your ammo wisely and set auto reload off to select your damage type every time you reload so i can get behind keeping the long reload time and honestly if youre rocking rlml or rhml youve got a prettttty good idea that youre going against cruisersfrigates cough select your damage type then cough but i really think the rlml and rhml needs the capacity for two or three more volleys and id be satisfied the way they are now it does make it so you have to make a choice and adds a bit of spice for a high dps skirmish option ccp just needs to make slight tweaks to find the gspot in balancing
well if we can actually garner support and stop getting the constant shitposting of abloobloobloo nerf cloaking abloobloobloo maybe ccp would pay more attention to the forums especially if players put forth their ideas in a constructive manner which would reduce the number of questions that could be asked because it was presented in a wellthought out manner the idea is to show that you did some form of research and are willing to put forth some form of effort to actually constructively design something useful rather than something that will unbalance or completely break an already functional mechanici am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
in the interests of full disclosure i must point out that socalled afk cloaking has a definitive meta gaming aspect that has not been mentioned here thus farsocalled afk cloaking is also a tool used by the pve players who meta gamethey set up a fake threat under a different account and unfamiliar name help it sneak into the system and set it up to afk cloakusing this fake threat like a scarecrow they keep other alliance mates out of their systems heck they can even keep their own corp out if they are nasty enoughusing this threat to hold their competition away they can rat and mine to their hearts contentthey can even stage mock battles showing how they narrowly escape the dangerous camper to boost its realismnope afk cloaking can be done by pve toowelcome to the sandboxupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
why should i be the one to raise the level of this terrible whinethreadin essence the complaint is that organised invested groups of players are able to kill a semiafk oblivious ratter wherefore then should i have the motivation to change any mechanicthe ratter can join an active invested pruposeful group and rat with impunity with existing game mechanics
for sure but till ccp rework completly this tool they still can upgrade current dscan and it will not require lot of ressourcesa good idea could be remove current dscan set new dscan as a high slot module that can be activate when cloaked a real tool specialised for hunting
from odyssey there were changes to null industryupdates to the outposts in particular amarr factory outpost increased manufacturing slots  ores arkonor through to spodumain received a significant boost to low end mineral returns from refining following the release of rubicon the players were treated to a statistics about ship losses in ghost sites training for particular skills to achieve masteries stats for mobile deployables this provides us with a gauge that rubicon is a successful release to the player base so where are the statistics for odyssey i would say that the mineral rebalance and outpost upgrades are a failure there is little interest in mining outside of highsec because ratting is safer easier and more lucrative in nulllowwhremoving the volume of cheap high sec minerals provides outcomes of null to developfoster industry increased value to minerals obtained outside of highsec immigration from highsec particularly by industrialists increased cost of highsec ships increases the risk mining frigates will remain available for those unwilling or unable to leave the comfort zone of high sec they also service well for tutorial and learning experience for the budding industrialist introduce a ice turret for ore frigate will enable ice mining to continuei believe that this is a necessary change to encourage greater engagement of the player base outside highsec i look forward to your support
this isnt a terrible idea either what i would also recommend would be the following booster that enhances scan deviation and scanner probe scan time booster that enhances mininggas yield for our combat indy pilots who run ventures into the unknownjust a thoughti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
droneboats have always had one less slot compared to their class counterparts the devs have mentioned once or twice that the sheer versatility of drone boats requires them to lose one slotand as an avid drone user i dont disagree with this dronecentric ships are very powerful and versitile when used in closequarters brawls because unlike a normal ship you dont have to fit it around the weapon systemas for the gila if it does indeed have the same amount of slots as its counterparts cant be bothered to check then it will indeed lose a slot when the rebalance efforts hit it
just to let you know i am still firmly on board with this still trying to work it into conversations with ccpmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i appreciate it i understand if stats have to be altered et cetera but just keep me posted on what you can as for everyone else see if we can get some proliferation of this idea i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
you oversimplify  the issue relates to afk butthurts who camp a system literally for months on end 247  there is no available sustainable counter to this its possible to get a group together once or twice to counter drop  but are you suggesting that a group should target an individual for months on end sitting waiting to counterdrop an active alliance may have a hotdrop fleet up 23 hours a day max and maybe 35 days a week sbs can fit a ship scanner lock up scan you and leave if you have a cyno fitted before you even have them locked if you catch him once they may lose a cheap frigsb which they immediately replace and carry on where they left offthe current unbalanced mechanic has the affect of removing pvp  pve content from the game pve content as afk cloakers in ratitng system arent worth the risk of undocking ratting ships for pvp content  the pve content wont undock recent ceptor changes gave a real boost to small group roaming  shame the systems are empty if they have a butthurt in local

i cannot say i agree for one thing the versatility part is it the drones that make them versatile in which case what about other ships that can use drones saying drones centric ships dont fit around their weapon system is false people that use drone modules like drone damage amplifiers omnidirectional tracking links etc means that people are fitting around their weapon system which are drones putting a nos instead of a gun is also fitting around the drone weapon system vexors are not the only ship that can fit a nos thoraxes can too for example thoraxes can use drones and hybrids too do people reckon that the gila is overpowered compared to a vigilant andor any of the other faction cruisers is a navy vexor equal to a gila andor vigilant it would be good to know because then we can see if a gila with the same number of slots as a vigilant really needs to lose a slot
option 2 looks good to me 1i do wish that i had known about the endless battle mission when i started ah well too late now but a good idea for new pilots
jaxon gryllsyeah most of the event agents within the game dont get a lot of publicity its a shame really especially since theres a very good story plot written in with themthanks for supporting this proposaldmc
bump
if you are unhappy that mining in hi sec with bargesexhumers is so lucrative then get a hi sec alt and start miningpushing sectional interests are the best way of making sure that people will leave eve you play it your way and let other people play it theirs
quafe is a speed booster no need to introduce another
quafe has no side effects just because the nghugeovi blue pill exists doesnt mean standard blue becomes irrelevant
most ships cannot carry or launch as many drones as a dronecentric ship of the same class a normal ship can usually only carry damage dealing drones or only carry ewar drones a drone ship can often carry both andor moreand those that can carry and launch many drones they dont get a damagehp bonus which really bumps up the damage and staying power of drones cute but can you also fit multiple remote reps ewar and utility on a thorax without sacrificing much in terms of dps andor tank andor point defense what about an omen or a rupture can a caracal do thisa vexor can be fit with remote repairs ewar utility and a stiff tank at the same time without giving up any of its baseline dps some 300 with level 5 skills and can also carry spare drones for point defense andor more ewarthe gila has problems that are not related to drones or having one more or one less slot it needs buffs in various areas see it needs more pg and cpu and as i stated before it probably will lose one slot because the devs feel it is necessary due to all the extra versatility drone ships havewith that said except for tanking ability the vexor navy blows the gila out of the water its faster has a drone tracking and speed bonus and its cheaper
i made this name on a trial for the lulz5 years later
lets keep it going guys show that you want thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
hisec mining sucks the only reason people do it is because theyve never done anything else thats made them more isk and dont realize they are at the bottom of the food chain its already bad enough you cant have caps in hisec although i understand the pros and cons and why they were removed in the first place further limiting ship types by security rating is a crap way of doing things its a last resort method and shouldnt be used except in extreme cases and even then it should be used as sparingly as possible its bad sandbox design imhothere are many things that could be done first to help solve the issue that honestly doesnt even need solving but i digress
need moar drugsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
regarding the gila they dont need the damage andor hp bonus for drones when they have their own damage bonuses for their weapon systems and any hp bonuses they also have drone ships may be versatile in the type of drones they can carry but ships that use ammo can be versatile in the type of ammo they carry and there is also the fact that ships can at most control 5 drones at the same time if a drone ship and a nondrone ship can use ecm drones which one has the advantage in regards to having the greater ability of using drones stasis drones etc drones can be webbed cant do that to barrage nonsentry drones are pretty easy to outrun and drones also face the dangers of bombs and smartbombs i do know missiles get blown up by smartbombs but its not really something that missile users concern themselves much withnow i not too certain about thorax i dont use them remote rep abilities but i do know deimoss have used it with good effect
they said that about the amarrian battleships too then they were all tweaked and modified a bitbut that means that the ship is not dronecentric and that drones are merely a supplementary force the same way turretsmissiles are act on droneboats not exactly true you can swap ammos all you want on a turret ship but that adaptiveness is very limited barrage null and scorch increase range but cut tracking and offer limited damage hail void and conflag increase damage but cut range and tracking all the other ammo types either increase range at the cost of damage or cut range for more damageand none of them will affect a turrets sensor resolutionbasically it would be like being stuck using only one class of drone light medium or heavy all the time against all opponentsa drone ship doesnt have this issue if you are fighting battleships use heavy drones if you are fighting cruisers medium drones will apply their damage better if you are fighting frigates light drones will keep up with and track them facing a foe you cannot win against throw out ecm drones and align outyou cant do all of the above with a dedicated turretmissile ship you have to make tradeoffs in the fit itselfas for the other stuff you mentioned webbing drones are terribad i experimented with them for a long time and found out that each web they apply to a target is stacking penalized with all the other webbing drones even with the heavy version which has a 20 web five of them wont exceed more than a 35 reduction in a target ships speed so no one be it a gunmissileship or droneboat will ever use these thingsthe same applies for all other combat utility and ewar drones except ecm drones how often do you see someone seriously use a smartbomb outside of pipbombingdisco tactics and capital warfare i can only remember two instances in the last 2 months and they were nublets deimos cant use rr tactics without giving up some of their guns they dont have a utility highslot anymore they do have a nasty selfrepair bonus though but if you fit the ship around that then you have to downgrade the guns an ishtar doesnt have to choose between dealing damage or tanking it can do both it can even do remote repairs as well
mining lasers do not autorepeat1
sure as soon as guns only cycle once and stop aswell
then what am i supposed to gank when im bored
after building up my first character i started making industry characters to help corp and alliances i had been in making some isk in the process as well and i imagine would have made even more if i had been in a null group at the same time with jf to come in and outi do think the industry needs to be tweaked a little i havent done any mining or industry since they changed the mining barges so i maybe a little outdatedget rid of t2 bpos or make t2 bpos available for everyone i really do not understand why this has not been done and why a lot of other arent off the rails about them being around i like the invention of t2 bpos and the odds or success or fail on them but some people  groups having t2 bpos sitting around and others not able to get them is wrong for a sandbox game where competition in the markets is everything so fix the mistakes made so long ago and give people equal footing if you force them out then you have to give them something to make up for the time invested and such but that is on ccp to figure out or smarter people than myself  what compensation should bedata cores  i would like to see these go back to being free but if you dont do the daily mission you hit a snag and dont gain any of the points for a new data core i would make these missions a little harder a little longer and spawn in a random way as in you get them sometime in the next week not one a day so you dont have to mission for them every day but every day you wait after you get assigned a mission the less points you get towards data cores pi  while i didnt agree with ccp having high sec pocos be taken by player corporations as really it only hurts new players who where looking to try pi before moving it to low or null guess there is still sisi for testing stuff  i still like pi a little i do wish there was more powergrid and cpu for the stuff and i liked the older system when it fist came out to what we have now but pi you can make money and doesnt take too long to train so new people can get into it and make money by themselves or with others if you cannot do anything with one toon make another on the same account train the i think a month or so  on that toon for perfect skills and grab yourself more planets making higher tier stuff i would like to see a tutorial for new players on pi perhaps even giving on of the skill books for it or just link someones youtube tutorial about it in the industry agents missions so for the tldr get rid  make available t2 bpos for everyone data core change again perhaps otheradvanced skills for more pgcpu on pi and a tutorial for pi for new pilotsi have found that i actually usually like industry more than i like shooting others both are fun though and what makes this game worth it to me if you are smart you wont be scammed  in fact just dont look at local or contracts and you will be fine most of the time  and have made plenty of isk selling my items even when giving some to other corp mates and corp for war stocks
if youre cloaked you should vanish from local there now you dont have to worry about the single neut in local
they grind sov like that not because its oh so effective but because they are worried about pl dropping supers on anything bigger grinding sov in bombers isnt fun also bomb runs arent that easy
no if a gm makes a decision it wasnt done in some haphazard way you did it you knew you shouldnt have and whether gm x makes you pay more than gm y is irrelevant stop breaking the rules and then you wont have to worry about gm actionsyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
also siege fleets work well because massive immobile structures mean you can overlook pretty much all of the torpedos drawbacks as a weapon system so it simply becomes a game of what way is the cheapest to bring the most guns
sb are balancedthe training time and costs is in the same range of any other t2 frigate and other t2 firgates are far more versatilesingle sb can be used in a very limited situations basicallyin pve only for 2 scenarios1 blitzing lev 4 fw missions so a very specific subset of missions not any lowsec level 4 mission as suggested by the op and this is only because those missions are designed to be blitzed in this way and have other drawbacks and to do it properly need good skilled sb and torpedo not just only the basic training2 ratting in hostile 00 sb can be a good option not the best option but viablein pvpbasically any other ship equipped with a weapon system can eat a sb any ship able to deploy a flight of light drones can get rid of a sb a sb can only harm bs and bc and all these have dronesbeside few niches and occasional scenarios other use of sb in pvp involves a specializzed fleet so their efficiency come from massive numbers or multiplayers organizzation stating that sb are op becuase 10 sb can beat a bs is silly becuase is a 10 vs 1 scenario i dont see why a single player shoud have by game mechanics the upper hand over 10
exactly a proper bomber pilot will never fly without a group and should never fly without recon support the bomber requires those things in order to be effective or else theyre just a glass cannon that can only really harm haulers and mining ships the people who kill ratting battleships only manage to do so because the rats have done most of the work to begin with the concept of solo bomber pilot is utter rubbish
here are the main issues with your post first off t2 bpos were handed out fairly by lottery those few that werent t20 incident were addressed and resulted in ccp creating an internal affairs group to prevent recurrances of similar game abuses next for most t2 items in game invention is profitable for those that arent the reason invention isnt profitable is because the demand for those items is too low removing t2 bpos will simply increase the price of these lowdemand items for the end user do you want to pay more for an eagle just so mridiotmanufacturer can potentially invent the item for a profit furthermore most t2 bpos today are in the hands of investors that didnt acquire their bpo by luck of lotto but by hard work grinding stealing or whatever the bottom line there is no good reason to remove t2 bpos and i challenge you to come up with one there is one area of bpos that should be addressed note im talking about all bpos their useage needs to involve more risk example idea to manufacture from a bpo that bpo needs to be in a pos lab the major downside of this it would inhibit new players entering the manufacturing field datacores are available using faction warfare lp id love to see stats on the precentage of datacores produced from rp agents vs fw lp stores i could be wrong but im pretty sure rp farming is over and done with frankly i see no reason to remove the datacore cost to be removed it is a good isk sink in a game that needs more isk sinks not less on that line station si lines should have their operational costs increased 100x to create another quality isk sink while also encouraging pos si highsec pocos have generally made highsec pi production cheaper not more expensive there is a skill to reduce npc taxes and player taxes are quite often lower than the interbus rate granted in really busy systems or in periods of conflict and flux the reliability of a decent tax rate is questionable but conflict is good
i never have but inequality between gm punishmentactions is not irrelevant thats a huge issue
the caldari capitals are often the laughing stock of any dreadtitan fleet due to their reliance on capital sized missiles that have easily mitigated damage what if instead of just making them hit harder we give the explosion of these massive missiles a level of aoe of course we should consider the downside of having the aoe destroy the missile based fleets own outgoing dps as such we should have it affect only ships and dronesthis could also be a balancing factor to the large sentry drone fleets we see out there just an idea i had maybe its good maybe it isnt but i believe it is a unique way to bring caldari dreadstitans into more use through a manner that isnt just hurf durf moar deeps lulz
for the same reason titan dds dont do aoe damage2 reasons1 lag alcualting the relative distance of everything to every missile adn factoring whether or not and for how much it would be damaged especially since sig radius or what not is unique for every ship and pilot not just shiptype would strain the server2 it would make logi for the opposing side an absolute nightmare as in larger warfare everyone would be getting hit and this amount of damage compounded from a large fleet would overtax logi quickly making them to goto doctrine for a fleet this would compound with point 1 to provide unfavorable conditions for the server
wouldnt you still be able to speed tank the damage in a seiged dread
