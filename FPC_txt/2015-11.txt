after seeing you in real life action during evesterdam i got to say o7 even if you allied to pandemic legion stop podding me querywhat is your opinion of ccp games getting a dedicated live events team with proper resources to push hisec content every week regards a freelancer
no 1 vote reserved  also take dj yumene bpobpc fetish with a grain of salt regards a freelancerps hisec hisec hisec 
during the o7 show was relayed from the forumswill capital ships be allowed into highsec to attack citadelswe are currently not planning on allowing capitals to return to highsec with citadels having damage mitigation when it comes to large fleets a large amount of battleships should be as effective as a group of capitals when it comes to citadels however this means we can expect huge battles in highsec over citadels toosource
whyif you cant put five battleships on field to break a medium you shouldnt be attacking a citadelif you cant put fifteen on field to attack a large you should probably not be attacking a largeand thats only if youre wanting to hit them for the maximum dps if youre willing to take more than half an hour you can use a lot less shipshave you actually read this devblog
thanks  if ccp has the resources to make a team that focuses on that type of content then that would be pretty epic and i dont think i would have anything against it
letUFFFDs start with personal experience and not focus on forum rants that occasionally spawn a friend and his son tried starting the game having played multiple mmoUFFFDs and looking for something new to play i been playing eve coming off a hiatus from the game and invited them through eveUFFFDs buddy system to get in they started and played out a week before hanging it up basic issues they found with the game frustrating finding where to goUFFFD true the game was trying to prompt a player but the information was busy muddled and confusing they wanted to be able to join up with my experience ships to fly the ropes a bit but hard to do with lack of experience no system to teach them basic survival tactics simple communications were difficult found themselves relying on teamspeak chat to get informationthe steep learning curve detours many as they come through the door a common complaint and one that needs tackled and represented

thumbs upsecond life is uglyeve is beautiful i wand to stare at a battleship fight through a station porthole while sipping quafe
no its not
happy to see some csm love on the link even if its just one guy right nowi dont think weve had that for two cycles
this guy has the right idea also keep in mind citadels wont have access to their nastiest weapons in hisec either
pretty much what he saidthough i do like the idea of every ship size having that one platform which carries a ridiculous payload with obvious drawbacks frigates have it with bombers the newer battlecruisers have it with large turrets maybe the battleship size should get its own variant of oversized weaponry too shrug
ok but just so you and the rest of the csm are clear on this point there are no highsec pvp groups that can bring the numbers necessary to contest an xl citadel here are the active pvp players from the largest highsec groups over the last 7 dayscode 92p i r a t 61marmite 69that is across all time zones none of these groups can come close to fielding the 100200 players needed at one time to take an abandoned xl down in a reasonable time let alone if they are actively defended they will never be attacked in highec by groups that actually base out of highsec and the only fights they may generate will be when the large low or nullsec groups come aknockin i would encourage you to impress on ccp that they should have something in their back pocket for 1218 months from now when the xls start cluttering up highsec because of these massively high hp walls whether that be a new bs like the op proposed or letting dreads into highsec something will be needed to make the xls actually vulnerable to highsec residents
regardless of current highsec alliance numbers i think that anchoring in highsec will create interesting motives for going there for examplea large nullsec alliance goonswarm for example create a xl citadel located close to the trading station within 14au their goal being exclusive stockpiles of good and ships being located nearby ready to flood the market as an alliance or whatver just spewing out random examples eventually their motive will start taking effect and people from nulllow will start heading over to destroy the structure this could generate some seriously impressive fightshowever there are some valid points above i dont agree that xl should be allowed in highsec for the time being simply because their current price tag is still a very spammable price tag you dont want all these super well armed structures taking advantage of peoples wallets immedietly or the richest alliances will dominate immediately i would propose some kind of lead up giving everyone a fair chance of acquiring the technology first perhaps before the initial release sites like the current blood sites pop up rarely allowing alliances the chance of getting a blue print copy and shedding light on the materials they needalternately limit the amount of structures based on a point system blame it on toxic emissions or a dangerous collection of gravity for examplegates20 pointsxl20 pointsmedium 15 pointsand give a system a maximum amount which is increased by 10 for nullsec system with full established upgradesthis way structures have to be strategically placed you might be able to get an xl and a gate but no observatory to detect cloakersyes im going therethis would also alleviate that cloaking issueshield are red armor is too i slapped my heavy neut all over you fingers crossed broken shattered and burned across from the bubble and into your hull
define a reasonable timethe dev blog says it could be 75 battleships to hit the damage mitigation which would be a 30 minute killif youre willing to take an hour thats 38 peopleif you cant scrape up that many pilots hire some mercenaries
its going to take 120 playerhours to kill an undefended xl citadel in highsec vs 15 or so playerhours in lownull with 40 people that is only twice 3h the stated design goal time of 30 min x 3 reinforces per player which might be on the edge of reason for highsec alliances however if these things are manned and defended you are going to need several times that fleet size to attack these things well beyond the capabilities of any highsec group it will never happen as for mecenaries they already dont accept contracts for bashing large poses in highsec because it is too tedius what makes you think they will suddenly be interested in taking such a contract to bash something that takes 5 times longer to kill also even if i were to find a large enough outfit that was willing to take the contract what makes you think i have the tens of billions of isk they would demand to compensate their members for 120 playerhours of their time and all that to kill something that doesnt drop any lootlook ccp can make citadels as safe as they want i will point out however that it doesnt take someone with an advanced degree in game design to see that releasing xl citadels such that they require the largestsized fleets to kill in the sector of space where corporation and alliance sizes are the smallest is not going to result in them being contested very often it should be no surprise to anyone that if on the oneyear anniversary of their release that there are only a handful if any killmails of an xl citadel earned by a highsec group
erwhy do you think that a structure that costs as much as a titan and is being actively defended by its owner should not be difficult to take downhow long do you feel is an acceptable length of time for a hypothetical 40 man highsec fleet to take one down and how can you do this without making dreads as a class obsolete again
i think the original design goal was reasonable so about 1020 people taking 15 hours per person in 30 minute chunks like it takes everywhere outside of highsec is perfectly fine the purpose of these structures is to generate fights not serve as arbitrary and boring grinding so people dont attack out of boredom
xls and arguably larges quite simply do not belong in highsec thats the far easier change instead of adding a brand new ship class
so you want to knock an xl into reinforcement in thirty minutes with ten or twenty people flying subcapitalsam i reading this right
if i was an npc empire or concord i wouldnt even let capusleers plant mediums in highsec ill take what i can get there though so more people can experience space chateaus
no they can require capitals to be reinforced i dont really care how they are reinforced just that it is possible in the same number of playerhours as everywhere else in the game you act like i am posting crazy talk but the original citadel plan called for one person to be be able to reinforce an xl with an entosis link that was 15 hours for a single person to destroy an undefended citadel flying a t1frigate now i understand why ccp changed direction but going from that plan of 15 hours to one that requires 120 playerhours is not one that is a recipe for generating much conflict given the average highsec corp size despite what ccp and our csm friend thinksthis isnt pure speculation either we already have the example of large poses in highsec now which are rarely attacked by anyone these things are 5 times more grindy hey this isnt my call if they are released like this i will exploit the excessive safety the gargantuan hp walls these provide like everyone else but i do find it amusing that in the exact same o7 show segment where nullarbor and fozzie were saying how great it is that supercapitals are now subject to tackling by new players as the ability for everyone to affect the universe is what eve is about they then go on to announce that xls will be released in highsec without counter to the high hp such that they are literally immune to attack by almost every highsec group because group sizes are too small so much for the ability of highsec residents to affect the universe my only goal here is to make it absolutely clear to the csm that the fleet sizes required to kill these things are completely out of the realm of possibility for the current crop of highsec pvp corps perhaps ccp wants it that way so that xls are only vulnerable to nullsec groups i dont know but if they actually expect highsec residents to fight over them something is going to have to change
so are you asking for highsec dreads a massive nerf to xl citadel ehp the dumb battleship the op wants or what
the only solutions i see are to let caps into highsec release a subcap that can do dreadnought damage like the op proposed some gimmick where hp is reduced in highsec or perhaps the entosis link can be used to reinforce in highsec or lower hp in highsec all of these have complications though or are messy so the best option in my opinion is to just not allow xls in highsec until capitals are allowed back into highsec which they say they want to do as far as i can see the only ability an xl has over the l is the ability to dock supercapitals which are not allowed in highsec anyway i am not sure why ccp is so enamoured with releasing them there given the clear imbalance in player effort required to attack them when the attacker is restricted to using only subcapitals and when there is nothing they provide that a l citadel does not have seems like making highsec groups use l citadels would generate more conflict for everyone rather than letting the richer groups wall themselves off in unassailable xl castles at least unassailable to the other highsec groups but it is ccps call if they go ahead i hope they are right and the large lownullsec groups semiregularly bring a few hundred people to shoot them in highsec and low class wormholes or at least that they have a plan b for making these things vulnerable to smaller groups so they dont just sit there in space until the day the server gets turned off

erika has been active with broadcast 4 reps since well since before i can actually recall a truly sweet and kind player through our interaction in the different b4r channels she has also shown that she is passionate about the game and knowledgeable about a many different mechanicsin regards to b4r she is a moderator in all the channels we manage the ig channels slack and discord she always shows respect and a selfless attitude to those that reach out to the channel when less serious things are going on and its general bsing shes humorous and communicates very well two traits i would believe to be imperative to dialogue with devs regarding knowledge of the game erika appears to have intimate knowledge of most mechanics i can think of im also a huge supporter of her comment regarding the pos little things  me how many times have i unanchored a damn silo cause im mashing buttons too fast and omg i didnt realize how badly i wanted indy notifications until nowalthough i focus most of my time talking pvp as a leader in brave i secretly am a big fluffy carebear that still enjoys mining manufacturing and importexport markets on all my accounts industry is the backbone of this game and id love to see it get some tailored love with all the new changes being planned with eve it would be nice to have someone who will be looking at upcoming dev plans whilst keeping the industryminded folks gameplay and experience in mindso yes i am endorsing erika mizune for csm xi one of only two ive officially backed so far good luck erikayou never fly alone  broadcast 4 reps  twitter thecoffeerocks  steam coffeerocks
yes it is more than actually kill marks ship skins or the new propulsion and shield visuals for example they are really nice i like them and you too i suppose but they add no content to the game nothing more or new you can do to spend your time with most of us will even never notice them because of the zoomed out overview in spacethe citadels or the future player build jump gates are also great things but i feel they will be implemented for a minority of the player base who only build and actively use them more will definitely feel their impacts however great that might be in their daily game experience but is that really the big thing for the sake of eve i hope so but i have my doubtsits definitely great for advertising what for giant structures the player can build or fly like titans but if this means that the player has to play thousands of hours for years to gain the influence the resources and skills to build maintain and actually use them it wont keep many players in the game or keep especially new players seduced by advertising to try eve  no its for the hardcore fan who doesnt represent the majoritywalking in stations has the potential to bring more actual game content into the game as presented many times before in this thread for example it can create a place where the current differences in skill points dont matter what is as it seems to be a big issue for some playersat the end its like buying a car people who buy them do it to drive with them from point a to point b there is no need for a radio but miraculously they do sell better with one so will eve with walking in stations because its more funtotally
hi everyonei am here today to let you know that we have removed manfred sideous from csm xthe reasoning for his removal will of course remain confidential between ccp and manfred and we would like to thank him for his contributions during his term with csm x ccp leeloo
will there be a replacement
1 billion on capital leak
damn
i believe it was for leaking the capital changes as well however i am surprised it has taken this long considering he did the exact same thing with aegis sov hell he even hinted at it on the metashow with several ccp employees watchingalso how about a ban for those players that received the leaked information without alerting ccp to it i can think of at least one alliance leader that alerted his entire alliance to the changes days before the changes were announcedheres a hint
not if reddit has anything to say about it
im hoping no didnt they say there was a limit of 3 resignations  replacements etc before they just carry on as is
im glad i bought all this tinfoil
so your own devs leak the cap changes at evesterdam but you decide the best thing to do is go on a witch hunt within the csmclassic lol
can i borrow some i seem to be out
easily first
i have full faith that ccp has hard proof of something manny did or didnt do i would be surprised if this had anything to do with the upcoming capital changes i would hope manny had better judgement than to leak having been in the public eye for a number of years now i will leave my tinfoil hat and pitchfork in the cupboard for now i suggest people do the sameall that being said i really hope we can do away with this revolving door of csm members next term
xenuria
how can you remove someone that was elected by the player base he is a player rep not a ccp rep
builds a bonfirehands out pitchforkssticks giant marshmallow on pitchfork and makes bigass smoresam i doing it right
there wont be a replacement this termas we discussed during the last csm x summit were past the point where back filling an empty position would be productive the csm will run with 13 delegates until csm xi is brought on board in q2 of 2016ccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
dont kick csm members you are effectively reducing places where players can get reliable information about upcoming changes split for the battlelogi carriers was well known before eve amsterdam  like the small buff to dreads
ccp doesnt want xenuria on csm cherrypicking
if he wouldve been replaced i wonder who wouldve been in line 
sigh manny did you market speculate bra 
do you mean to say pl was using insider infothe nerve
does anyone want xenuria anywhere
theres always next year
karmafleet do it seems
yeahbecause manny told everyone
odd thing is that he hardly needs isk hes a leader of a major alliance probably has access to whatever multi trillions they have risk your csm ship to speculate on veldsparif that was the reason thats sillyi dont think it was as it doesnt make sense
so you sack him for some secret reason but you thank him for his contributions can you see how insidious that sounds
icwhatyoudidthere
because clearly making a mistake invalidates everything youve ever done prior to it
i can see how kicking people who break nda affects how players get reliable information about upcoming changes
that depends on how big a mistake we perhaps will never know but forums and reddit will blaze long into the cold winter nightsfang
prooty gud akshualy
i am glad this situation received the appropriate outcome
another one bites the dust
seems legit
why you were the chosen oneeve news chief imperiumnews formerly tmc  host talking in stations show
ccplease stop that csm joke nobody remember what happen in 2007 anyway you dont need that pr damage control anymorethxloyal servent to mother amamake evetetsel
how could this be construed as insidious a person can make meaningful contributions and later violate the terms of a nondisclosure agreement without the latter tainting the former
the only purpose of that csm is to maintain power to big groups in new eden its not what csm was created forits actually a joke
xenurias time approaches new eden will soon know what karmafleet is all about we are what you deserve live fast die  traditional minmatar ethos citation needed
okay
i can confirm that the csm being a group that is appointed due to backroom deals nepotism and bribery and not at all the result of a democratic election using a vote aggregation mechanic designed to minimize vote wasting by uninformed voters has its purpose solely rooted in maintaining power to big groups
uhuh
and umm
why did they kick you off the csm
out of curiosity what disciplinary steps will be taken against the devs that got loco drunk at amsterdam and leaked the changes well in advance
im just curious  if the csm is a democratically elected body responsible to its voters how can reasons for such a change of course remain confidential
because at the end of the day eve online is ccps intellectual property the csm is an initiative that they put in place for their own reasons and while im sure they try to respect the decisions players make things like ndas trump the feelgood democracy theyve instituted
well at least he didnt go to riot amirite guys
because disciplinary action usually remains confidential unless initiated within the democratic process as a matter of protecting the privacy of the person being disciplined get your head out of the tabloid media please
how could removing sideous be insidioussomeone has been successfully avoiding kcolors puns lately i see
pssst there might be a connection there
thats not even a pun or funny v
dear recipientplease accept my deepest apologies for my mistake in regard to state mistakeit was not my intention to create such an awkward and embarrassing situation for you institution the team company etcUFFFDif there was any good that came out of this unfortunate experience it is that i have grown and learned alternative approaches to these situationsplease feel free to let me of your thoughts and concerns over this matter you can reach me at email phone number sincerelysender
are you saying kcolors are
im saying theyre at least puns
well this is disappointing to hear
my reaction when this happens
i rolled my face on my keyboard too
reform the csmvote xenuriaseriously though i said this stuff would happen you didnt listen literal writing on the wall that half the community ignoreda former member of the csm even went so far as to compare my reform platform to the gestapo if the csm is to survive it needs to change and grow like any other system within this living story we call eve online
xenuria for csm
if xenuria is not installed to reform the csm and bring these useless muppetoids inline it will be a travesty of the democratic process and an infringement of our civil liberties and we might riot or something 
dont know what happened but i must say im very sad to see manny go also for you guys wondering i would have been next in line and im very sad that i dont at least get the chance to proof myself as a csm member i understand that there is not a lot of time left but other csms have been replaced around this time as well and ive not heard anything negative from them i would have been a guy to show community feedback to ccp ideas which i think is much needed atm anyhowsss still pretty sad about this situation as ive voted for manny myself
lmao csm is a joke anyway
xxplease pandemic citizens reloaded alliancexx supports xenuria for csm
loreleii might run an antitora campaign if you run again i hope i did take votes away from you this last round
who are you
ugh if you guys are gunna kick people from the csm at least give a hint as to whyfaith in ccp isnt exactly unshakable right now and making people feel like their votes dont count isnt gunna help with the whole not taking the csm seriously vibe going on
xenuria for csm the candidate ccp deserves
replace manny with xenuria youve earned it ccp
this is really daft now everyone is going to be continually accusing us of getting insider information if this is the case you should tell us not only for everyone elses sake but for the people of pl who got very frustrated at manny because he would go out of his way not to break nda you can read our forums if you like dont get me wrong ill be as pissed as you are if it turns out hes been leaking stuff but you need to explain why because this doesnt just affect ccp it affects every member of pl and brings into question an entire slew of things which may or may not have been influenced by this so called leaking we need answers and manny wouldnt tell us because hes not like that so you have to put some big boygirl pants on and sort it out
i dont really know whats going on here but i feel like in the case that anything was leaked posting the leak on a forum would be a pretty daft idea itd be quite a bit safer to do it via irc especially with something like otr protecting the conversationagain my frame of reference for what actually happened is nil but its fairly easy to eliminate a forum as a credible alibi
not to say anyone is leaking anything but anyone whos leaking nda info anywhere not just here whos worth 2 grains of salt knows never to leak anything in such a manner where the source cant be pointed elsewhere and impossible to trace back to the individual which makes the quote in question literally worthless
his name was adam ridgway
beat me too it
knowledgeable keen and enthusiastic  a nice counterweight to bitter cynics like me  definitely have my support
i may have left sf a long while ago but im still very found of both the corp rixx and joffy those ffa tournaments are still some of the most memorable moments in my eve career im not even in lowsec anymore but id vote for you joffy the man the myth the legendstay frostyo7quack

i told you he was a spy
bobmon for csm the leak actually came from cfc but hey awaiting all the haters
xenuria for csmxi
reform the csm
my point was simply to state that he was not leaking anything on our forums which are accessible to most members the more people who were unaware of his accused leaking the better because it means people are not guilty of obscuring the behaviour i said in the tournament thread that i intentionally dont want to know things because the less i know the less i can accidentally tell other people i trust the people in charge to do the right thing so far this trust has not been broken and i would hate this to be the first time it was i am incredibly doubtful that manny leaked anything period i have had dozens of private conversations with him about possible changes ccp has announced and every time i have brought up an alternative he has said something might be in the works but its nda sorry cant talk about it he wouldnt even give me a hint if i was in the right direction and in the end it meant i stopped discussing it with him privately because we could never get anywhere he was that carefuli know pl very well and i can see no kind of indication that anyone has taken advantage of unkown changes to influence market speculation for instance i am reluctant to be proven wrong both because it would mean someone in my alliance was cheating but also because it means my trust in manny was misplaced much like many other people in the alliance who hit an nda brick wall every time they tried to discuss stuff with him the suggestion to read our forums lets ccp both understand what access people had and so what knowledge they had of any suspected cheating and it also shows how manny acted towards most of us when it came to nda rules they can decide if he broke the nda using that but not rule out the possibility of him breaking nda because of things like irc logs what i want is proof proof for my alliance proof for myself and proof for the people who think they have been unfairly cheated because of these suspected nda breaches it brings everything in to question that we have done since manny became csm and that is not okay for anyone
coming from me it doesnt coming from someone like elise who has access to everything it absolutely doesnt its fair to say i dont know everything about pls inner workings and i cannot rule out the possibility he shared something with someone privately that i am obllivious to but i have spoken to him at length in the past and know this is not something he would do flippantly or in order to give pl an advantage the offer for ccp to read our forums was to show that we are being as open as we possibly can be about this hell i know elise has made the same offer in the past ccp want to keep this matter between themselves and manny even though in exceptional circumstances like hydra cheating everyone knew everything and all of the information regarding the bannings in the tournament were completely publicised perhaps because ccp had proof because this is not the case in this particular incident i cannot help but feel ccp does not have any proof this isnt a democracy ccp get to decide what to do but the fact they wont tell us is going to create a bad vibe between us we want to be open on this unless ccp can show us proof then i have to call their accusations bullshit i know manny i certainly dont know the ccp employees who chose to remove him so until anything changes im siding with manny on this and saying that his removal from the csm was based on poor assumption rather than objective fact
there is your first mistake right therehaving faith in ccp if it works break it if itUFFFDs broken leave it and break something else
absolutelypl have no history of ever doing anything like this before oh wait if it works break it if itUFFFDs broken leave it and break something else
oh wait what examples if you say the sphere ill laugh at you
as someone who was in the know he is guilty i know you probably dont want to take my word for it but he very much was
dont take this the wrong way but im not going to take your word for it no especially not considering youre in goonswarm an alliance i would seriously consider to be using csm intel for market speculation if you can show me proof of it howeverthat being said i think its really  of you to come out and say yes he was cheating without saying why even if it is just to say it would not give pl an advantage or the opposite it sounds like youre trying to play petty politics this isnt a personal attack on you but honestly the csm should heh be above politics and a way in which all alliances try and improve the game they play in using it to score cheap points seems like a really crappy thing to do either tell us what you know or dont say anything because you stir the pot and its not fair on anyone
the decission is undisputable but sorry the communication is not good to my eyes an elected csm member must not be removed without a given reason otherwise it questions the whole csm role and process i do not need to know the dirty details but there should be top level reasons like breach of nda poor participation personal reasons etc which do not harm the person who got removed too much but give the voters a chance to understand why their votes are nullified
i can offer ccp access to audit the pl forums if necessarythis includes delltadiff data for a long period back in time this is authenticated with a thirdparty service we use for backups would be very hard for us to fake anything unless we can move time backwards at amazonhowever i seriously doubt manny did anything that is related to pl
i leaked everything in had directly into structures tweetfleet slack for this very reason saying who leaked and what he leaked weeks in advance directly in front of ccp so yes i have proof for the taking if you were one of those 350 people who saw it
nah
the thing about chode is that they are easy prey if you shoot back at them
not sure if this is about forum bullying but your csm xi campaign thread is locked xenuria source
after a year of working for en24 which bobmon manages i can say hes a nice energetic guy with a good amount of experience yes hes in pl and runs en24 but those are both second to eve which i believe he is most loyal to  above all elseeve news chief imperiumnews formerly tmc  host talking in stations show
joffy is not just a good pirate a good pvper or a good eve player  though hes all those things hes also a genuinely good dude that i cant wait to see on the csm my only concern is that the csm appears to be a tire fire these days but if anyone can restore a sense of decorum and make good on the implicit trust we place in our csm reps its joffy
having been in sma on and off for about a year kyle is probably the most open minded neutral party ive never seen him slant anything for anyone he is a very effective diplomat in that he seeks a compromise that both sides walk away from happy i will be the first to admit that since i am in sma that my opinions are slanted to supporting a party line nothing could be further from the truthi have spent time away from sma only to return to them because of the peoplekyle aparthos is the guy that writes well thinks well and on the rare occasion he makes a mistake hes willing to step up in an open forum and say yes i screwed up and not dwell on itmy own voice and not that of the crowd says let this guy come forward with his ideas if i like them i vote for him this is a guy who passionately cares about eve and is determined to make sure that everyone has reasons to care tooi dont know about you but my main reasons on playing are simple i want friends to fly with foes to shoot and finally at the end of a day have a drink with everyone when truly was the last time you went out on a roam and had fun frankly we need people like kyle who have ideas is willing to listen to ideas and wants eve to succeedi am voting for kyle because of the following reasons one he acknowledges his own mistakes two hes got some good ideas three he cares about eve as much as i do four hes awesome to be on comms withremember more neighbors in sov means more content
well if people do not learn ccp just should take legal actionfool me once shame on youfool me twice shame on mefool me more  get fing suedotherwise people will not learn nda is not something to fool around with and it should be made apparent just make an example without any life breaking consequences for the removed cms member but send a message next time it will be serious
i am not a goon candidate i am first and foremost a reform candidate take your foot out of your mouth and check my employment history
i endorse this
he has my full support
actually you are now whether they endorse you or not due to affiliation yer a goon welcome to dodging the very argument you lobbed at everyone elsei am eagerly awaiting your attempts to wiggle out of this with a straight face
you clearly missed my point there i didnt ask why the reason remained confidential i asked why it should would of course happen so for any casealso limit yourself to the point instead of adding nonsense in an effort to make your posts sound cooler please
i have no worry about your ability to be effective nor to communicate with ccp the csm nor the player basemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
alright since this post has seen the good graces of the csm and they have put there input into it and regarding ccps view in ccp falcons post here i will go ahead and lock this to avoid any further issues
1 solid guy who can and will make eve a better place
good guy that will certainly try hard to bring the change that evethe csm certainly needshas my votes from all my accounts 
thanks for the support everybody i really appreciate it i promise ill work my ass off to help everybody and make eve online a better gamethx mike azariah for clarification 
thank you so much freelancer for the support also what is this bpo fetish you speak of
thank so so much coffee 3 that means a lot to me hugs i know you know but i will post here how proud i am to be a part of b4r because it is just such a great asset for the community and it shows again how much this community will do for each other we may be enemies on the battlefield of space but when its time to get serious we stick up for each other and do what we can to help each other outalso i have almost unanchored poss several times since i help manage our corp poss and i cant say how annoying it was each time now i find myself triple checking myself just in case it really is a simple thing to fix and save frustrations indy needs love 3thank you again for the support it means a lot
the learning curve is not only what makes the game though it also functions as a nice screening system  those that dont have the patience to stick with it hang up their space goggles and those that persevere end up playing for years seems fair to me
i am a completely new player i havent played eve before and ive only been playing eve for 3 weeks i decided to start a corporation because i want to do everything in the game i plan on playing for some timethus my experience has been poignant for this discussion and you and eve would do well to listen to what ive seen from the community in a very short timethis community is not like the wow community because this game is technical and the players are therefore smarter and take a more mature approach to game play there is an elegance and a nobility to eve that isnt seen very often in online gaminghowever the other side of this complement to the community is that players take the natural expectation of efficiency and shrewdness that this game demands and couple it with brutality cruelty and even pure maliciousnessmy corporation has suffered devastating blows from spy after spy we have had our entire hangar wiped our entire wallet wiped and we have had 3 war declarations upon us just for recruiting in local chat we have used the access rights precisely as they are intended and the corp thieves did not get the most valuable assets but they still rocked our rookie players and we have lost some of our earliest and prized recruits who were seen as leaders in the corporationhear and listen to a brief and purely candid experience from a first time player the game is wonderful and excellent but the freedom to enact multiple characters within one account is by far destroying this community if alternate characters are not linked within the api keys then it is far too easy to spy there must be limitations on having multiple accounts as well if anything charge a subsequently higher fee for having shared accounts dont make it so easy for players to manipulate the information available to other playersthat is the biggest thing there needs to be public access to linked accounts and linked characters within the accounts there also needs to be a way to submit crimes to concord against a corporation from members within the corporation there is nothing to do but remove them from the corp and hope they dont make another character and rinse and repeati understand that this is a problem mainly for rookie corporations but that is why eve gets new trial accounts that never come to a subscription all you people are just piranhas in a fish tank and since you stayed long enough to sharpen your teeth the game has just become for you a place to cut and bleed othersthat is the problem with this game the general attitude that is fostered by eve and its communityevery time a solution to this attitude is posted one of you has to stop motion towards it because you think it means pvp wont be the same anymore but the solution is in campaigning a different way to play you have to see that this is exactly the problem of our world today  there will be evil people who will just destroy so if you dont see yourself as one of them then you have to stand up and fight for what is right you have to fight to have a stand in eve that is not malicious twisted and deceitful i am beginning this campaign with my rookie corporation endronimy and if eve devs and what not cant do gods job then i will do it for them from the ground floor
joffy is the best i strongly support this campaign joffy has the will and game knowledge required to run for such endeavour that is the csm he has always been friendly and supportive hyper active and organised he will be a great addition to the csm and i am sure that with his work eve will get even better and accessible vote for jofffy 
hi therei personally think that the lesser online ppl at a time can be seen in the industry devblog which ccp phantom has presented following the argument of ccp phantom and previous posts i think that during summer less ppl play than in winter time also some actions like banning bots and other stuff like the change of the training queue limitations is responsible for less accounts online at a time what we need to know to estimate this would be information on how active a user is during his online session doing different things but if ccp is able to gather this they will not share this information with a wide player basethe more interesting thing is how long a rookie player no alt in average stays with the game before quitting it is those players that must be asked why they have quit not the ones staying in the game it is like in any industry nobody ask the guys turning the product their back here ccp has at least the mail adress and could ask ppl help ccp to find the real arguments why they have quit their eve account based on this information an improvement could be done to hold ppl in the gamei dont think it is too hard for newbies to look out for conpagnionship i have no idea if this word exist in english language eve is a sandbox game and too much guidance ends up in quitting a little later after the guidance ends because what do you do as a guided player when you have done all levels of your guided eve you have to evolve like mr darwin saidsurviving of the fittest or marmite in that game adapt or die the evolving begins after the tutorial lessons having the information why ppl quit when they come to that point could be end in an better tutorialcheersmac
this is what i propose for a new and fresh experience for players migrate all accounts older than 1 year into a separate dedicated serverall those accounts can play eve together and all new incoming accounts can start playing eve as though the game was new and after 510 years you can do the same migration and keep people posted so that if new players want to play they can come in after migrationthis will create the right atmosphere for folks who are new dont tell me this just wouldnt be eve when eve would be exactly the same in both servers but there would now just be 2 eves one for young and one for old
hi theregenerally i like the idea of depleting moons what i am afraid of the proposed solution is the fact that i can easily own a pos and do moon mining with my small scale corp or ally if i get unlucky and earn a high grade moon due to depleting mechanisms i know that within days i am getting invaded and wiped out i cannot defend that moon but then this would be game mechanic and wanted but i fear that this would drive out smaller player groups out of moon mining in 0sec it will be the same like the poco thing some time ago you can have a poco but as soon as big groups are having an interest in your business youre out so the mechanic there must be discussed heavilya model where this changes step by step would be better in my opinionlets assume that the harvesting rate changes per moon per time at firstso start with sandstorms or whatever on the moons is possible to let the rate of harvesting sink for a significant period in time at the other side let the output of a different moon in a different area of the same kind rise this means that the power constellations which hold the moons can interact with each other because then a high grade moon ally will start a war with another high grade moon ally and small corps will start a war with other small groupsthis will have influences in local markets if the overall supply is not changed i give also the ability that not only one big group of players control the high end market of moon goo until the end of timesaid in terms of conflicts it is no fun for the goons to wipe out a 20ppl corp who has earned a high grade moon by switching moon gocheersmac
he has my votes
what about teams was good in your opinion
you you are saying you and your fellow alliance member were frustrated when he followed the rules could he have caved in under the pressure of his allianceexcept that open the door for people to ask for reason for any judgement ccp ever does why should pls csm representative case be treated differently than any other disciplinary action taken by ccphow about skype mumble teamspeak external emails phone calls any other communication means that could of been used to leak something while also being much harder to track back which in case of a leak happen to be a rather valuable feature for a communication media auditing your forum is useless unless you somehow could prove there is absolutely no possible way for info to be leaked else where
when i talk with folks about gaming the other ones my age mid30s have all heard of it the college age kids do not seem to be as aware of it the most common quote i hear about eve is thats a hardcore game you can lose everything it requires a real commitment and a certain amount of masochism to play evethe thing about see is that it is so big and varied and unpredictable content can be hard to find i am okay with that but many are not some nights ill log in no one in my corporation is on and i spend four hours solo exploring waving at random blues in local as they pass through other nights its a madhouse of one roaming gang after another
advertising frankly i never heard of eve until my brother told me about it my impression is that only people who actively follow gaming media know about eve if more people knew this game existed then more would play
1 a persistent and reliable candidate
bobmon is a good guy and will have my vote
ive known bobmon for a few years now i know he really cares about the game  he has a big heart for the community hes not running to be the cool guy at the seat he really wants to see the game improve and represent those who feel the same i know if he is elected he will do a good job representing us 1
the way they were implemented imo was poor but the concept of it was good having teams to help with indy projectsresearch what id like to see is having teams effect the corp level corp members with the right access permissions can use corp blueprints that people can see  and if the teams are brought on a corp member level not using npcs it would give corps another way to work together helping in a team would also take one of your slots as well so theres that drawback as their should bebased on your skills is how you can determine what is the best area to help in be it manufacturing research copy ect and also the types of items
hello my name is diana olympos i am here to announce that iUFFFDd love to represent you on csm xitldr nullsec based primary focus trading and hauling french lover of emergent gameplay mercenary coalition member community content generator easily approachable experienced with similar organisations for other games iUFFFDm seeking a seat on the csm to help empower community builders and all the players that make new eden a living placethe detailiUFFFDm a relatively new player in new eden i first tried to get into eve a few years ago i initially hooked up with a french mission running corp but studies took priority and i eventually drifted away from the game however in february 2015 i felt the call of internet spaceships once more and returned to new eden looking for something a little bit different i joined the 3 month old alliance pfr phoebe freeport republic and i was hooked immediately the atmosphere within the alliance and the buzz around the game was compellingiUFFFDve made friends and over the next few months iUFFFDve become an active member running part of the pfr academy program helping to seed the main freeport of nullsec obligatory propaganda reference and learning to pvp in whatUFFFDs become one of the most active constellations in null security space lately after pfr change their direction i decided to try to explore new horizons and joined mercenary coalitionjust after itUFFFDs launch i joined the new tweetfleet slack if youUFFFDre not a member sign up now  it doesnUFFFDt cost anything or need an api key UFFFD as a result i was exposed to what i realised was the most active vibrant and interesting community iUFFFDve ever encountered in gaming itUFFFDs also there that i was recruited by crossing zebras and offered a place as a writerall that activity brought me here  iUFFFDm passionate about the game and iUFFFDm announcing my candidacy for csm xi to put help put that passion to good useletUFFFDs tackle the obvious point first if you ask to a group of people what the role of the csm is youUFFFDre likely to receive a different opinion from each group member with that in mind i believe that the function of the csm is to provide a unique and privileged interface between the players and ccp to act on behalf of all players for the betterment of the game to help provide ccp with a noncorporate method of informal communication back to the playerbase hey diana youUFFFDre a really new player why do you think youUFFFDd be good at thisfew years ago i was one of the leading members of the wargame serie community and was asked to participate in a very similar scheme proposed by the game developers i learned a lot about game design how to be an interface between the players and the devs and viceversa i learned fairly swiftly that members of these groups should not try to be junior game designers most is achieved through rationalising and summarising community feeling and communicating that back to the developers and then providing the same service in the opposite directionthatUFFFDs nice diana so what can you bring to ccp in the past few years weUFFFDve had a dominant presence from established nullsec coalitions and blocs on the csm theyUFFFDve helped ccp engineer and rollout the current nullsec changes over time to address a large number of the perceived issues however now this program of change is fully underway it feels strange to have almost no representation from the UFFFDnew nullsecUFFFD alliances which are hopefully building the empires of tomorrowbeing an active member of pfr i have gained a lot of experience across fields that are involved in building a nullsec alliance  pvp teaching developing markets building diplomatic relationships interactions with different parts of space etc i am confident that i can translate this experience into meaningful discussions about upcoming proposalsi obsessively follow what is happening in eve and in the game design community around it reading devblogs opinion site snippets of dev talks which way the wind is blowing at ccp are all things i try to track i believe that there is a considerable scope for extending the methods for communication between the players and devs and exploring that aspect of the csm would be one of my main goalsfinally i represent one of the many subcommunities in new eden that extend outside of corpalliance boundaries  being french iUFFFDm in contact with the french community and living in the active south west of null i see a lot of them small alliances striving every day to realise their objectives as well as staying in touch as a group on community sites such as slack i hope to be able to provide a mouthpiece for that community and prove that iUFFFDm the right person to help represent them
cool but what would you bring to the csm itselfin real life iUFFFDm a data scientist UFFFD this means diving into mine of information and uncovering meaningful data my specialist area is data it surround it tool usage iUFFFDm used to collaborating with diverse groups of people and leveraging their skills and knowledge for my projects i like to think that this would hold me in good stead as csm member with the remit of extracting ideas and information from the community and ccp alikei also have experience as a moderator and a writer for a french esport company thatUFFFDs given me further lessons on how interact with people how to write informative and useful pieces and has granted me some insight into game design itUFFFDs a skill iUFFFDve had to polish during my time as a marshall for the wargame serie in this role iUFFFDve had to work with people from many different communities and playstyles and act as a soundboard and a communication point for all of them iUFFFDm firmly of the opinion that the csm will have to evolve towards this model during csm xi and that this previous experience will help me fit that rolebut diana will you have time to do all of this around your normal lifeyesarticles i wrotemy opinion on fitting skillsyou can find my view about nullsec and its goal herefor an history of pfr there is a little piece on crossingzebrasinterviewseve guardian intervieweve nt interviewpodcastscsm watch english interviewcap stable fr interviewcsm watch analysis show 3declaration of war round tableif youUFFFDd like to ask me questions post them here and iUFFFDll do my best to field all of themyou can also grab me on tweetfleet slack for a conversation if you preferor contact me on twitter dianaolympos or ingame by evemailing me or joining the dianao4csm channelor send me an email at dianaolymposgmailcomfly like you earned it o7
but rebalancing of all the things no content moar rebalances
how many clear stements by eve eps do you need before youll accept its not going to happenhow many more years of it not happening will it take before you realiseyes it really would take sooooo much work everyone who worked on the wis engine has either left ccp altogether or is fully committed to working on other projects the project would essentially have to be rebooted from scratch which would be a goddamb huge amount of work for the minimal gain of a few oh i guess thats kind of cool fluff features ccp have zero resources to spare and zero corporate enthusiasm to find those resources just let it go man its a shame but we dont always get what we want focus your faith on attaining something thats likely to actually happen
definite no to purchasing a neural remapreducing one year down to six month remap sounds reasonable or get rid completely
o7 space friends i would like to announce my candidacy for csm xi i have experience in all areas of space with a major focus on low sec and null sec mechanics as well as high sec a effect on player retention i am currently aspiring to be a worm holer so i can learn to understand the ways of the great and mysterious bobeve experiencei technically started playing eve in 2010 i was a young newbro in a tristan fresh off the tutorials when i found out that you cant just open fire on any ship in high sec then concorde dunked me and i proceeded to winder what happened for a few minutes then was podded home i saw then that i had only a velator again so i said screw this im out i didnt try again for 2 years and never again on that account  i then came back as a miner and bounced around for a while then moved to amarr factional warfare joined loaded dice for a while until after the ihub defense at ardar after which i join calibrated chaos and began doing fac war with them after a month or two we joined dt dead terrorist alliance which was fun for a little while i then moved to null sec which is where i have been since just before the fountain invasion and then the subsequent delve defense i bounced from the kadeshi to gclub to nc after which time i moved to wormholes and began a new life of honorable wormholing plans and ideas that i will be championing for each area of spacehigh sec because thats where i startedmining 1 mining is a rather brainless or boring afking task a i dont honestly mind belt mining being this way because it allows those who cant completely focus on the game to still participate however anything else that is added needs to be interactive and fun 1 comet mining could be a fun way to do this make the comet continuously moving and un approachable keep at range then make chunks of the comet fly of at random times and explode like bombs doing aoe damage make the asteroid itself worth the effort maybe something mineral found in null sec that would just destroy a marketpve not including incursions 1missioning a missioning is boring currently because of its cyclical nature 1 i believe that every level 4 missioning agent should have its own epic arc or at least something more then save the damsel 13 times 2 i enjoyed the blood raiders event that took place recently and hope to see more of these types of events take place 1 exploration b in high sec is something im not well versed in as i tried it once and couldnt find anything to run i think the biggest issue here is over population 1 if you disagree feel free to contact me i truly want to know more about this areapvp 1 war decs a i love the war dec system but it is not conducive to helping small new player corporations 1 i believe the stacking bonus for per member in the corporation actually needs to be a reverse stacking meaning the less people a corp or alliance has the more it costs to war dec them 2 i also feel the need for a war dec stacking cost penalty exp marmite dec small corp 2 for 1 week then proceeds to re war dec small corp 2 but this time instead of only costing 50 million isk the cost doubles to 100 million and the penalty doesnt have a maximum  however the  it doubles is more a negotiating point 3 if a corp wants to surrender a war without getting permission from the war deccing entity ll they need to do is pay the war dec cost and 10 extra again a negotiating pointincursions 1 riskreward a i know most people think that incursions dont need to be touched but their cost to benefit is to high to ignore the ramifications it has 1 high sec incursion income needs to be nerfed currently it provides to much safety for too much reward especially when you compare it to low and null sec incursions 2 low sec incursions should get a slight buff in payouts and a higher  chance to drop the shadow bpo the revenant bpo also would have a slightly increased  to drop as well 3 null sec would have a much higher  to drop the revenant bpo and shadow bpos but would have lees of a payout from low sec mainly because you cant honestly say low sec it 100 safer then null and you wont be running incursions outside of your own space 3a i would like to see the incursions allow the use of capitals in low and null but that isnt an option because then you have capital escalations in space that can be very easily defendedlow secpvp 1plexes a i will advocate for ventures to be barred from all plexes the ship is not built for combat and should be permitted to troll away b i would also like for all plex to have an anomaly like effect that either disables or gives a debuff to all warp core stabs in the plex 1 if youre not in a and willing to fight you should have some major disadvantages c i would like to see maybe plexes changed so larges are only battle cruisers and down and an xlarge that allows all ship typesmissioning 1 i never did low sec mission so please feel free to contact me through eve mail and discuss it with me if you have experiencemining 1 mining is never a good idea in low sec a unless you have a scout and are in a 1 gate system then you can mine but its just not as useful or smart as high sec or low sec exploration 1 exploration in low sec seemed ok but i couldnt get into running data and relic sites the payouts didnt seem worth the effort ever
null secsov warfare 1 entities dont fight each other because they have no reason too a another isk faucet is not going to solve this problem this is an issue that needs to be addressed i have head of forced scarcity moon goo randomly moving unfortunately these would just cause the little guy to get steam rolled 1 got any ideas id like to hear them 2 entosis a the concept is a good one make it so a small entity doesnt have to have supercaps to take sov 1 i would have liked to see this feature implemented as a way to either capture a structure or just to shut it off destroy it or make it a way to cause a self destruct but if you want to do it with capitals and destroy it with holes you can3phoebe jump changes a jump fatigue is a great plan that still needs some work done and some balance fixes im glad they brought the maximum fatigue down to 5 days i honestly would like to see it become 2 days because unless you know a fight is happening you cant just appear in 2 days b jump ranges need to be buffed or at least reset to post phoebe levels and balance the ranges from there i understand not wanting everyone and their mother on you in 2 minutes but jump ranges dont need to be capped at 5 ly c however if jump ranges are also too long at post phoebe to keep the world from dog piling into one system in a matter of minutes then they would need to be rebalance but not a double nerf like phoebe was d remove fatigue from jump bridges im sorry but that is the most annoying thing for me about phoebe trying to catch up to a group in your space and the second you take a short cut you are immediately punished and slowed down for it if im chasing somebody through my neighbor hood and i knew i could cut him off by jumping the fence i would but this makes it so you jump the fence and immediately break your own leg npc null 1 leave it be for now i doesnt appear anyone in npc null is having any major issues if it isnt broke dont fix itwormholesim learning these right now so feel free to send messages to me

have had a basic idea for wis for a while i agree that wis is not realistically happening still it is an interesting challenge to try to find some way for how it could work oh and iUFFFDm also assuming that legion is comingthere is a basic choice that affects how things could work whether it is possible or not for a capsuleer to jump to a clone with a dusttype implanti think this not only affects the entire basis for wis but also influences how interaction with legion and maybe even valkyrie could work by deciding if it is possible to use the same eve character just with different jump clones in valkyrie or legion or if you have to have separate characters for these games i couldnt decide on which i think would work best so i tried to reflect on both possibilities instead if it isnt possible to jump to a clone with a dust type implant it would only be possible to have avatar gameplay in stations where you can dock your capsule as there is no way to jump to a different type of clone no exploring structures or dust gameplay with your eve character it would have to be a separate character for these situations and in legion and valkyrie you would have to have a different character no combat in traditional sense instations because this could mean permanently losing your character itUFFFDs a bit restrictive but it is interesting from a lore perspective because then one would have to think of really good reasons to leave the capsule and the cq why wouldnt this type of clone jump be possible someone gave a reason for this in a post which was that the dust implant couldnt receive a transfer from a capsuleers mind or the other way the differences between them technically were too big good reasons to leave the capsule and the cq what would these reasons be why would capsuleers want to leave the cq risking everything and if there are reasons what could reduce or even eliminate the risk would other people or groups see it as advantageous and therefore make it possible there are some possible reasons travel from station to station without letting other players know it  using your ship to travel reveals your departure from and arrival at a station so instead you could pay to use ordinary convoy or transport ships going between stations to hide from other players where you are going during travel if you cannot use a dusttype clone because of the reason above you would of course take precaution and be in one of the convoy ships ordinary evacuation shuttles as these have a nifty feature that makes them instantly warp to the nearest station as soon as they are ejected without the need for controlling them so thatUFFFDs where you will end up should the convoy ship be attacked by npcs or other players of course if it is possible to jump to a dusttype clone should the convoy ship get attacked it wonUFFFDt have the same consequences so the automatic warp of the evacuation shuttle could instead be manualspace missions activated instation  missions that need to be given to you directly from an npc even though they take place in space these are sensitive missions that need to be given in person to avoid hacking of the information in the directions sociality and station hub areas UFFFD some kind of informal arenas to meet and to get to know the station could perhaps mean learning something interesting thereit doesnt help with good reasons though if you can be taken out the moment you leave your cq what would make the risk of leaving your cq acceptable despite having good reasons for it there has to be security measures like something in post 210 the short version is that advanced ai in the capsuleer common area detects and prevents attacks and that weapons arent allowed in these places this is not actually something you will see in action itUFFFDs just for explaining why anyone canUFFFDt get hurt in these areaswhy would there exist places with security measures like this in stations they were made by the station owners keeping capsuleers pleased is good for relations with them and business at the station thats why the stations providing this are mainly faction stations and perhaps emerging trade hubs trying to compete with the established ones like jita by making it more comfortable for capsuleers to come there want to mention here that an issue brought up in an earlier wis thread is that setting the right number of stations that would have wis would be a difficulty one wouldnt want stations to be either too desolate or have too many people simultaneously wis could be therefore be restricted to only some stations or types of stations this would tie in with what instation activated space missions are available at a station as well like faction or trade related
another way to increase the security and make the air tolerable for capsuleers instation but outside the ai secured and airappropriate common capsuleer areas could be with a suit these suits were made to allow for capsuleers to enter into the central hub of the station which doesnt have a decontaminated atmosphere and in addition provide basic security in these areas post 215 has some ideas about what one could do in this area but it can be thought of as something like a bigger version of the hub in dust this suit wouldnt have any other function than the possibility to be changed for individuality and to make sense from a lore perspective as you cant actually get hurt in this area at least if one assumes that it isnUFFFDt possible to use a dust clone but if it is possible to use a dust clone then security wouldnUFFFDt have to be this strict although you could still have these more secure areasthe freedom of having a clone with a dust implant puts very few restrictions on the possibilities and mission types for wis safety in stations would no longer be a significant problem you could just have a dust type clone which you use outside of your cq which makes combat more realistic to implement as there wouldnt be issues like possibly permanently losing your character using the capsuleer ships to travel places you could explore structures with a jump clone brought along for that purpose and you could clone jump to a dust soldier on a planet the jump clones would naturally be your character and be identical to your character but have a suit for exploring or missions if you start a game of legion or valkyrie separately you could log in with the same eve character combat instation is another question how that should make sense relies on if jumping to a dust clone soldier is possible or not it also relies on what combat mechanics are possible and if they can be made realistic and interesting in one of the earlier wis threads crafting and industry were asked for also in wis it could be tied to implant manufacturing and research perhaps there could also be research and industry on suit technology used for exploring the skill tree could be similar to that in dust but have skills focused more on exploring possible modifications could be decryptors scanners and sensors are things that seem reasonable in addition to armor and weaponsfor avatar gameplay outside stations the possibility of jumping to a dust type clone or not also influences what is possible and how interaction between eve and legion would workeither if itUFFFDs possible to jump to a dust clone soldier or not you could go on explorer or planetside missions but upon arrival and docking to the structure you want to explore or the orbiting structure that is used for dispatching dusttype soldiers to the planet surface there would have to be some differences if you cannot clone jump to a separate dust type clone that would require that you log in with a separate character to continue with that explorer or dust clone you brought along on your ship in basically a legion level taking place either at an explorer structure or on a planet this means you log off eve and log on to legion so your ship vanishes from the site in eve one could imagine your capsuleer character warps into a safe spot in space in the meantime after setting your legion character off on the structure or planet instead of staying docked and vulnerable for attacks if one assumes that you can jump to a dusttype clone one could imagine that after you have jumped to the dust clone you can remote control the ship sufficiently to make it warp away to the safe spot and call it back again if you make it through the exploring or planet mission if you donUFFFDt then the consciousness jumps back to the capsuleer in the ship at the safe spotanother way is if you bring a larger ship that has room for a shuttle in it you could stay at a distance from the structure you are going to explore cloak up and release the shuttle which you now control with your explorer jump clone of course this would require mission arcs than span across eve and legion one part of the mission in eve the next in legion and then in eve again but itUFFFDs an intriguing thoughteven several players could go in a fleet to the same place and those same players could log onto a legion explorer or mission site items you find at the site could be items you receive back in eve this could also allow for a different way of collaboration in a way that you dont log in with a separate dust character or jump to a dust clone but rather another player does who already has a dust character on that planet or maybe only has a dust character you stay logged into eve and remain docked in the ship but through a new ui you offer realtime support of the other player who has the dust character in the structure for exploring or on the planetside surface with your ship you scan for artifacts and enemies projecting a real time map over to for them to navigate with in addition to finding artifacts and combat the dust soldier can set markers for orbital strikes that appear on your ships map attacking and damaging of the structure that you are docked to seem reasonable but should maybe follow the same principles that exist today concord and sentry guns in high sec and more freely engaging in low and null something that would give a great deal of tension is if your ship is attacked by other players you are forced to leave the support ui you have for the dust player exploring the structure or on the planet and return to the eve ui in order to deal with those attacking lastly something not really important but necessary is that in the character creator height would have to be added
i would love to see you and everyone on csm apply the same logic to sp trading
its outer space and we have clone vats with a copy of our clone in a memory chip somewhere  why do we need to walk anywhere
thats eve you really need to take small steps and learn every step of the way as people do rinserepeat
getting rid of attitudes like the one above who consider every single act of ship shooting as griefing
adding to this consider a grief as a basic step in eve to the hazing you will go through in eve if you are serious about this game otherwise there are plenty of other games people can play instead
this likely wont happen for the simple reason a new player is just as capable as an older player only takes about 2 months or so to become an extremely deadly piranha
ffs no  that would kill eve once and for all one server well apart from china and all of the playerbase apart from the mainland chinese on that one server  thats the essence no pvp areas no instances nothing like that one universe living and breathing and by god is it goodi have to say that your anecdote about your corp being infiltrated by spies and being constantly rippedoff says a lot more about your apparent gullibility and your security bsp or lack thereof ask yourself this if your hangars andor wallet is being cleared out by newcomers should i be granting roles willynilly to whomever wants thembe more careful the problem is not with the game  its with how you approach it
after investing to build a pos its clear that theres never going to be a chance to do soi could join an alliance or corp but if its meant to be an open sandbox game then why am i limited to gh sec to reach any 00 to claim territory is impossible as block by big corps so hhhmm kinda trying to work that one outoh ts is the part you tell me to get the right skills or play with mates  and ts is the part i tell you  i like playing solo and would take years to train to aceve  even tho i obtained a character from bazaar trade to aceve it theres not an option or chance but to do pve unless you join a power corp or allianceiv played on and off for some time with hope ts game will improve its very clear tho that eve is committed to support major corps and alliance tipping favor in there way at all given chancescorp who generate in game currency from hours of game play should have limited space on eve to build there empire or to control the game  where a paying player who plays the game with eve time brought should with a subscription at least be able to build a pos that can not be taken unless the power is down at any given timei do enjoy the game but can only play now and then but would love to own a pos to build titans and capitals as my toon was made to  and i pay with a subscription and would pay extra to have a pos in 00 sec where the surroundings are not controlled free playing pirates and major alliancesyou can and kid youself say what u want at end of day if the paying player takes there money to another game  you lose your job  its pretty simple
you can in fact put a tower anywhere you want because ts is a sandbox game anyone can in fact shoot down your tower because ts is a sandbox game
do some research i currently am living in a wh in a pos i set up a month ago otherwise you are in fact confirming how incredibly dumb it can be to purchase a character in eve
id like to contact advertising standards regarding your corporation name as your poorly thought out rant contradicts the elite in your corp name its blatant false advertising

please explain why you tnk it should be possible to build supers without anytng that even resembles a risk
short and sweetlogi is the lynchpin factor in a subcap fleet logi or lack of it can be a deciding factor in the fight but also even if that fight ever happensthe problem  killboards have become such a thing in fleet and strat ops that everyone who wants to fight wants to be on that km or all of them fcs are partly to blame alliances are partly to blame and ccp as usual is at fault in the majoritythe easy fix put logistics on killmails for ships they rep weve been told and bought the rotten shark flavoured popcorn that this is complicated beyond reasonable implementation its not if it is possible to pass aggression to my logistics ship its easiky possible to pass me onto that kmget more logi out there by recognising them in the fight and you will get more fights simple as that more keres and ewar solutions will be trained more testing of those fleets will happen so more fights will happen i know there are roams fleets even strat ops have stood down across null and low due to low logi numbers please dont reply with whoring drones as a solution because anylogi having to concentrate on whoring is really doing it wrongyes i know its been proposed and ignored completely by ccpyes i have spoken to individual csm members and they have said ccp wont listenbut it goes here anyway and please comment here to keep it live
couldnt agree more 1
its a player issue and not a game issue make your player stop bothering about the killmails and you will get logi if you only manage to recruit people who are selfish and only want to participate when their name will be attached to a kill report you need to recruit less shallow players
spoken like a true goon and ive flown in many goon fleets as a spy and you guys are the worst for linking zkills in fleet and on commsits not a player issue its a gameplay issue did logi save the fleet or at least play a vital roll in allowing more damage application if yes goto make them feel part of the overall experience
started a new project today
i say we roll back before the retribution patch i also want to go to iceland and im a nice guy who plays a villainous eve player i have 8 years experience with the game and have done everythingps if i killed your spaceship in the past maybe we can talk about your feelingskilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
thread closed
the upcoming patch notes includes the followingthe api no longer makes any attempt to fake the quantity of materials being stolen by siphon units if like me you value the ability to wage guerilla warfare in the game especially against the richests of the richest ie moon holding entities go add your voice on this thread
outrageous  what gives you the right to eliminate peoples read paying customers who would probably flock away if this batshit suggestion ever came to fruition choice to either anonymity andor privacy in the name of some perceived problem on your behalf
reserved for humorous yet slightly sad because its so easy lets face it retroactive analysis
agree there is no ccp resources or will for a proper wis experience but 3 ideas that could be implemented with a moderate amount of work add scope videos to captains quarters  use the resources of the eve 007 show and eve trailer production to put together a weekly summery on eve make it voiced and animated by a npc newsreader show it on cq screens would help new and old players get interested in parts of the game they have not tried add a room or wall for display of player trophys  achievements could be 1000 pvp kills get you a trophy or completing 1000 level 4 missions etc etcallow miniature corpse heads or destroyed ship models with inscriptions your best ever kill or most against all the odds victory allow players to memorialize their player experience add cq to citadelsppl need to get out of caves and they will see something new thats where eve is placed not in cave  zoonrkorsairs 
no it is entirely a player issue most large alliances ive flown with use third party apps to track fleet participation so the need to have your name on a km to prove you were ther is pointless additionally most large alliances ive flown with have a policy of 100 srp for logi which makes it possible to profit off losing a logi in battlelastly all logi can carry drones so if youre that hard up to whore on kms assign combat drones to someone with a gun
opi fly logi id really rather not tell everyone who glances at my killboard exactly how much logi i fly and how well i do itstart putting me on killmails and ill have to go fly something else
logi know damn well if they saved the fleet or not if you need someone to pat you on the back after flying such a support role you really need to rethink how you see yourself the issue is the me me me me behavior of players who somehow think they need to be validated by a killmail as i said before if you cant field enough logi get less selfish people in your fleetcorpalliance so the key roles can be filled hell if that does not work you can introduce incentive by yourself so people are more willing to fly those
there is too much handholding in eve as it is you give people 100 million and then when they lose it all its a big losstoo many telling people to join some rookie filled organisation like eve university and not enough on prompting them to take their own lead too many people trying to turn new players into a cookie cutter clone of the last
its probably made that way so you cant lose grind your way to a victory by using alts in the opposing militia ground force
dust has been made now it exists it must surely be obvious to everyone that the chance of any kind of ongoing success for it lies with following through on the vision of integration with the eve universe this is a life support issue for dust and a nice little quirk at least an interesting addition of good complexity at best for eve
you are as free to not like my platform and not vote for me as i am free to develop the reasons why this item is on my platformso if you have any interest about thje reasons that this is part of my platform here are the detailsis the gaming field in eve online truly fair today as the power of a player is multiplied exponentially by the number of unrelated accounts one hasthis was very visible with the thankfully now banned input broadcasting where fleets of bombers handled by one player could destroy a gang of numerous players with a single coordinated bomb run or locust mining fleet could empty a site in mere minutes to the dismay of local residents with a more casual approach to their gaming hobby they were not alts of the same accounts but different accounts organized to operate at the same time in that case they gave away their anonymity to multiply exponentially the effect of one player on the game the community as a whole started seeing that as an abuse two years ago while it had been accepted for many years before but as it started being more visible as more players saw it working for some and duplicated the trend this created a snowball effect that could not be ignored anymore gone is the very visible input broadcasting because it became too obvious but it also clearly showed that some players could afford many many accounts and there are still today many ways that are not as visible to influence the game with a lot of anonymous different accounts and only one player behind them from corps infiltration by clean alts to nonproductive cloaky campers that block ingame activity for local residents to trading manipulated by alts of the same player the power of multiple anonymous accounts is very much around but it is not visiblemy goal with this point of my program is to cast a light on it and continue the cleaning process for a fairer gaming field to all players that the input broadcasting ban started multiple anonymous account is simply put a subtle form of paytowinremoving the anonymity does not mean preventing players from having multiple accounts as i believe this is truly a staple of eve but it will change the impact on the game that these extra alts can bring to the same playerall activities in eve are designed around risk versus rewards anonymous alts is all rewards with no risks where is the difficulty in the spy game today you are not working to turn another player but you are adding a new account and having a real easy no risk involved run at a group of players in their corp that have no other way to protect themselves than not recruiting anymorewhat is the difficulty and the risk of sending a cloaky alt for weeks around totally anonymously so that the recipients cant even know who is behind it and retaliate in other ways a cloaky alt does not produce anything for the game and has a norisk opportunity to jump those that ignore the cloaky camper at the first opportunity why being afraid of retaliation against other productive alts the tenants of this type of play are the worst and most hypocritical carebears of the game wanting to wield significant influence with multiple anonymous pilots and wield an influence that has little risk involved it is not about the number of accounts it is about their anonymity hence my proposition to change the eula accordinglyi am only talking about the anonymity of alts not the anonymity of players only ccp should know the players names behind the accounts of coursethe last point i am adding from my last year post on this very subject is that i also believe the mere presence of anonymous alts stiffles the development of new organizations as the most recent players are condemned to either only play with real life friends or join already existing power blocs and the ease of infiltrating rising groups is only benefiting the already established powers
a side effect of the 1 year term limit which you may not have thought ofit means each year the csm has to start from scratch on knowing who the best people at ccp to talk to about some topics areits a loss of institutional knowledge which degrades the effectiveness of the organisation in my two terms its been evident that knowing who to talk to is really valuable and ive been grateful that in year one i could leach off that from the older members
i only mentioned one term in my platform because i do understand that the current one year term would not be the best with a limit of one term for csm members for the reasons you point out i also support an increase of the term for csm to two years keeping one election every year for half of the members so that the older members can still help the newest members every year this was already part of my platform last year on that subjectmy main point is that being elected only once will keep in check a nonccp employee individuals influence over the game we all share and allow other voices and faces to rise up as younger players become vets there is no shortage of talents in the player base to represent a community that evolves each year
yes yes thats all very nice but what changes do you exactly propose lobbying for
errwhy is this necessary if you go down this route it seems all you want to do is shield 1 man vanity corps dont you think
there are people in eve i respect and call alliesthere are people in eve i call foes but have respect forand then theres holeysheet1 the space equivalent of a court fool you feel bad every time you laugh at him but you just cant stop
i endorse this candidate 100 holeysheet1 is exactly the sort of man the csm deserves
there could be a work around choosing which areas to fight over could require a group not a solo player or possibly a standings level requirement alongside greater lossreward for participating those who grind to win get more standings those who grind to lose quickly fall out of that standing to participate
then form up 2 group and perpetually have the right side lose its eve implementing a system without being sure it cannot be gamed is a bad idea even without the effect on territorial contest being able to choose which system your ground force team will fight in could be used to generate combat in backwater systems firmly in your own side control to generate yourself so rather low risk orbital bombardment for easy lp
i will take your question in a wide scope i lobby for the csm to be a tool used by ccp to communicate with player not the only one not the main one but a way to spread idea feelings and design goals to the players with players words i think the goal of the csm is not to be game designer or doing ccp job i lobby for more communication with ccp about what to say to players how and why to make the nda limits crystal clear which they probably are but its not visible enough for the players and thats all i dont think csm members are here to lobby change to the game at best they can bring up ideas pass concept that they heard about they can talk about what ccp show them but they are not the leaders of eve nor the leaders of eve evolution
deserves does this mean we have been bad or are we being rewarded somehowmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

hello friends of tranquility please hear this plea to allow gms to appoint a new ceo when the current one has quit the game i like many of you currently have an alt in another corp where the ceo has not logged in for years but our alts are stuck there to access all the bpo that are locked downplease allow this very important topic to be discussed by the csm to give ccp the power to help the thousands of players with alts that are stuck in corps that are dead due to an absentee person in the ceo role i propose that if a ceo has not logged into the game for over 6 months that the role and shares can be given to someone else such as a director if any remain if not someone with the most time in the corpthank you all for reading this proposal please vote and let your voice be heard
i vote nopersonally there was a span of a bit over two years where i was literally unable to play the game you dont get to punish someone whos put through the effort to collect all the assets youre mooching off of simply because they might not be in a position in their real life to be able to log on
your first point is irrelevant as personal assets would be in your personal hanger and corp assets should be managed by those playing the game for those that are still part of the corp that is left behind they should still be able to use the corps resources most corps in this state have had all active members leave so what period of time would be acceptable to you 2 years 4 years ive personally been waiting over 5 years
hmm i see what your saying i was thinking it would help smaller newer corps but i forgot this is eve and anything that can be will be abused do you have a better idea to suggest id love to hear youre thoughts on this
csm is a pointless sideshow holeysheet1 is the eve equivalent of a sideshow freak i expect he will provide a more entertaining experience for the community than the current csm members  who spend too much time stroking their egos and not enough time amusing us with shenanigans i expect he will be remembered as the best csm ever
so you feel you should be allowed to loot the belongings of another simply because they dont log on anymore youve already stated that you have access to them for use so the only reason i can see that youd want this is to move them into your personal hangar and make off with them
my circumstance is different that the one you are describing although that example does exist i assume the leadership which i am apart of of my main corp started this second corp as a division due to lack of separated hangers many years ago 8 i think we have always owned and used the assets in question so were not looting our own assetsthe problem we have since game changes a few years ago is the station they are locked down in does not allow copying due to game changes only production i am the only active member left in the corp with director rights i dont have shares to take ceo or unlock them so we are unable to move them to a station that allows copying and are required to have a pos up for copying which we are trying to avoid the cost of if we could move themits been in my case over 5 years since the ceo left the game for us to move these assets
vic jefferson the csm of my heart 3
then file a petition and let the gms decide if your case is special enough for them to intervene devs do not need to be coding in ways for people to steal other peoples belongings just because they dont log in for any length of time
ccp fozzie announced 2 days ago on ccp stream that they will change links so they need to be on gridill watch it closely and give feedback but for now ill keep it on my csm campaignjoffy aulxgao
sadly i have filed a petition every year for the past 5 years this year they told me to come here and get the csm to bring it up they are the only ones with the power to change this ccp wont touch it without csm support
nobumble votes with his feeto
how would you feel if you came back to the game after 5 years to discover that all of your stuff had been stolen by gms  given to another player
it was mentioned at edu that attributes are going away  everyone will accumulated skill points at the same rate
