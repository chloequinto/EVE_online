this fix is a no brainer
back to the topwhy ccp why
i support this idea yes yes yes
not sure what would be the best way to implement a 4th bonus but i totally agree they need their due 4th bonus
i was sad when nobody responded to my concept but here is my idea for how to fix up blastersthe problem of hybrids
supported
lol you guys weve got like 6 people who say they support this but didnt hit the support button its right there beneath your text box and its what the csm looks at i want to take another look at the drone subsystem since i dont know too much about ithistorically amarr have been the secondary drone race after gallente actually theyre the secondary race of several things but thats fine because laser damage is so very limited in any case there has been one ceiling placed on amarr ships to keep them in second place behind gallente and that is their bandwidthno amarr ship with drone bonuses shall wield heavy drones or sentries is the rule ccp set when they started giving amarr ships drones and i actually agree with them i like that the curse and pilgrim have a good amount of drone damage but they cant go over it its a hard ceiling still its kind of sad for the legion to be dealing the same damage as a pilgrim 4 unbonused lasers is pitiful and nobody will fit them even if the drone subsystem swaps a medium slot out for a low slotso this is the bonus i propose15 drone damage per level up from 10 it still wont be dealing much damage5 drone hitpoints per level gallente get to be king of drone durability5 drone mwd speedi considered 10 drone speed but thats probably too much the reasoning is that a proteus or ishtar can drop sentries when the enemy is far away but the legion cannot also drone legions almost always have energy neuts instead of guns but without a range bonus they need to get in close in this situation the drone bonus is all but useless as you dont need your drones to travelthis is just a suggestion please give your support if you think the original post is a step in the right direction then let me know what you think of ideas like this one
as expected gankbears would be totally against this idea
ive never understood why concord pay npc bounties anyway concord are there to police the capsuleers not the npcs if any thing the bounties should be paid by the empires whose space the npcs are in yes that means im in favour of pulling all npc bounties from 00on security status i think the op is on the right lines but actually security status is only lost by killing capsuleers why should it be regained at all by shooting npcs security status is concords method of recognising which capsuleers have performed criminal acts against other capsuleers so why not shift the regain of security status to acts against other capsuleers alsobasically if you want your security status back find and terminate some other capsuleer who has a criminal record should be a good way of generating pvp encounters should it not
it is far to easy to exploit
supported give people reason to go to lowsec and remove the strange fact that you cant really lose sec status in null by being bad but you can gain it quicklyedit adding a thumbs up for the proposal and an entirely different finger gesture to the poster below me
hey dignus you do realize that if you support something in the assembly hall throwing a thumbs up helpsand as far as null sec please tell me who exactly maintains said naughty list i personally do not careeditactually this would create massive chaos and tears not to mention the jewbear population would just cave i am all for this sort of strife
having lived the majority of my time in lowsec as a flashy pirate and living off of my killsransomsi always found that the casual weekend warrior type pvpers were my bread and butter both in terms of income and good fights a large percentage of those players ran solo or in 23man gangs and as such were a source of greater fun than getting 12kills before having to gtfo because of the 515man gang trailing the tackleby making lowsec the only place you can work off the sec hits of casual pvp you will only see less and less casual players do you honestly think that the people who run missions in highsec 75 of the time and can work off the small sec hits via thier l4s will spend as much time making pew pew in lowsec if they risk not getting back to thier mission systems imo the ops idea is really a disincentive in the long runas those players start to diminishso do the players like me because there are other options that are more fun eventually lowsec becomes nothing but gank corps fw and nullsec moon mininglogistics given the already large numbers of these in low space i assume these are not the targets you were hoping to havewhile i can appreciate the drive to get more people into the belts i do not think the op was particularly well thought out in terms of longterm consequencesmaybe i am just a gankbear though edit i might get behind removing the sec gains from null but definately not from high
i really dont think you want the null sec factions not only taking up all the low sec moons but also creating safe areas in low sec where they can grind sec status up after taking someone elses posthis would increase traffic in low sec but it wouldnt provide the benefit you seem to think it would the low sec pirates simply do not have the numbers to mess with null sec alliances you dont want a turf war with them
pfft 1 lowseccer  10 nullseccersbring it carebear besides the whole point is not just to get low traffic but to actually make sec gain not quite so trivial it is a completely wasted feature when one can pirate on the weekends and be back in the black from bog standard ratting deep within a sea of cyno jammed systems  might as well remove security gain for all its worth and let people press a button when they want back into jitabesides it makes perfect rp sense community service in to seek redemption from past crimes highsec gain can stay it is such obscenely low numbers as it is that it can only really be used to correct a point or two before driving a person insane
not supported in the original opthe topic suggestion is a covered try to get victims to low sec if the author is authentic about punishment the only way would be to get less sec boost in low sec and no boost from null sec the logic behind it sounds fair as well in no sec area no security is needed and therefore no sec status gain for shooting rats as the rats still are enemies to the factions bountys are okin the end i agree with the author that regainin sec status is to easy for example ganking a hulk and recovering doesnt take nearly as long as reearning the money for the miner miner are mostly newer players who arent as wealthy probably go broken with a gank therefore ganking a hulk should lead to 3 weeks or more hard ratting in low sec similar to reearning the ship
agreed do the crime do the time in a genuinely dangerous area not in your safe cynojammed station system
i brought it last night and all the little low sec babies ran no i didnt bring a blob just 8 ships the 15 man low sec gang which included two faction ships made excuses that the two logistics ships in my fleet meant i really didnt want a fight i honestly thought we were about to lose the gang to them but they ran to high sec from usi lived in low sec for almost 2 years i still raid low sec to this day you can say what you want we mop you guys up easily with  10 ships again you really dont want null seccers sticking around for extended time in low sec because it will be bad for newer players and it will inevitably end up with more escalations to hot drops in low sec which is bad for everyone
it is a reasonable request considering that those who pvp in 00 get no sec penalties so for pure 00 alliance people it doesnt matter at all those that choose to kill in empire should deal with the consequences in empire
have you considered that we can farm a low sec system for sec status the same way we can a null sec system my corp controlled dominated a low sec system for about a month when we were between alliances and we are mostly industrials that is what would happen to fairly big chunks of low sec null sec pilots have resources and manpower to throw at such thingsno one is pure 00 pvp anymore with tech moons in low sec you will end up with piles of cap pilots needing sec which means youll end up with systems populated by a bunch of caps and super caps grinding standings back up after a weekend of unpleasant pos bashes
make sec status mean something111oneonedo the crime do the time1111eleventyoneyeah because the multiple nerfs to sec status and recouping of sec status over the years have worked soooooo well at penalizing players who violence boats in highsec and lowsec more of the same is evidently needed to combat the currentday onslaught of negative security people
my experience shows that sniper loki is very effective at killing dramielsits achieved without webs or even warp scrambling simply 12 shot them as they try chase you i got me 5 dramiel kills in 1 week that waythats not to justify anything im merely presenting a viable tactic for current situation
yeah too bad the idea is to get some semblance of 1v1 balance back to the frigate class as well as give interceptors and to some extent afs their viability back fact is lots of things kill dramiels you dont need to alpha them in a 500 mil t3 that would 12 shot most other frigates as well duh 50 mil is sufficient for the job tbh but it doesnt change the fact that as it stands the dramiel is dominating the frigate arena way too much and its making the game very boring by now
pikacat speaks the truth nerf without making it boring or useless ftw
its not about counters or tactics everyone knows that counters and tactics exist but it does not necessarily follow that frigates are balancedid do something like keeping the speed but reducing the agility such that interceptors could outrun a dramiel over a short sprint and ehpdps significantly speed is fine as long as the appropriate sacrifices are made for it  but the combination of great speed and great agility is very powerful and adding decent ehp and dps on top is excessive
i still believe that balance to the frigate scene can be returned by significantly restricting supply of dramiels resulting in significant cost increase for the superior shipthat way when people lose dramiels they lose a lot of money making it unsustainable for bad pvp pilots the same form of balance we have with officer mods in pvp
might have made sense 3 years ago before eve got all those insane isk making addition pi moons incursions lowsec bs rats sanctums etcisk was not a balancing factor back then and should certainly not be one now that anyone can put together half a billion in a week  look at the explosion in supercapitals and t3s flying around we are richer than ever beforesupply should be brought down to dd level at least but not for balancing purposes but because it is the right thing to do  ship will still be op in the frigate realm no matter what it costs
i dont like the proliferation of supercaps but i really like that many people use t3 for pvp people invest 500 mil and a few days training into pvp ships  thats a very good thinguse of expensive stuff in pvp makes it more exciting for everyone  for both sides those who fly it and those who eventually get to kill it it is one of the things that allows eve to maintain interest of long term player without it pvp gets boring in a year or lessccp should do more to encourage people to pvp with expensive ships they should also make sure that supercheap alternatives such as drake and hurricane cannot dominate the battlefield people should choose  either be powerful and fly something expensive or be weak and cheap and gain strength through numbers blob tacticsthere should always be something elite for long term players to pursue something rare and expensive and it is wrong to assume that the end game is all in the mega alliance supercapitol stuff the small gang people need goals toodramiel can be raised above all frigs not one of them any longer but something special and as such it should be more rare and much more expensive
as hy says isk has never been a balancing factor think of all the people who used to dump a bil into thier vagas most were not crazy good pilots many lost multiple shipsmonth due to sneaky tactics and being over confident and yet they still kept fitting the sameif something is out of balance it is out of balance making it more expensive just means that only rich people get to have unbalanced ships making them cheap means everyone can have an unbalanced shipunfortunately only nerfing the dram doesnt really change things nerfing the dram just moves the fotm the next best ship there has to be a wholistic approach if you want balance then again balance is something few people really want they just want diffferent if you nerf the dram then the ship that takes its place will be the next thing people complain about in a year or two
isk plays integral part in game balance of eve just a few major changes to costs of various things can totally  this game upas any game with economy as with real life there will be rich people and there will be unbalanced benefits that rich people buy thats just the nature of economicsthe real question we should be asking is does destroying rich guys ship hurts him or not can a smarter more prepared group of people destroy the rich guys source of wealth for most things eve allows you to destroy somebody except when they employ bot army they run level 4s in high sec they won the t2 bpo lottery years agoalliance moon goo stuff pretty close to being invulnerable too eve should have more ways to disrupt logistics involved in transferring the goods from 00 to empire marketsif we are really interested in perfectly balanced pvp game then we should erase economy completely all ships and fittings should be available for free all unbalanced things such as officer mods should be eliminatedbut as long as there is money involved unbalanced things must exist
so if ccp introduced a ship that was totally invulnerable but made the cost of that ship sufficiently high enough it would be balancedcool story broas an aside your diatribe sounds really really familiar did you used to post under a different name like 34 years ago
ccp already introduced such a ship  check out some of the jove ships  like enigmathey exist yet nobody complainswhybecause impossibly overpowered ship is impossible to getsimple extension of the principle that crappy ship is easy to get strong ship is hard to get the power to cost ratio should make a geometric curve
more kills means nothing the point is youre an alt troll and have no knowledge at all of what youre talking about the number of kills isnt the determining factor but knowledge and minigin lying and trolling is simply a fact minigin generally doesnt post if hes not trolling witness the so any change in game mechanics breaks the sandbox lietroll combosee this is the kind of lying and trolling im talking about first you know full well that i have stated facts and you cant refute them so you lie and call them opinions when youre not simply ignoring them you also know that my arguments have not been rebutted which is why you deliberately ignore them and lie in order to troll much like you know that ive never stated that maps are lies and you are trolling what i actually stated was that simply pointing to a map in order to fearmonger doesnt prove anything especially when the actual facts and logic of how jbs are used in the game disprove the fearmongering naturally you are lying in order to troll again seriously anybody reading along should look at the last several posts i made in response to this alt and notice how many times shes lied in order to try to troll me then realize that you cant trust a single thing she says and that the fact is that i object to trolling which is her only mode of argument so she lies and claims that simple disagreement is equal to trolling in my book likewise posters should note that rafia is again lying in order to troll he is posting with an alt it simply happens to be a newly created alt in fact he admitted that he no longer uses his main and is using this alt char instead anybody can check its creation date and stats easily so this is a rather sad lie that rafia is using this is because she doesnt care if she gets caught lying and trolling shes just in it to troll same deal rafia is making a claim guess whether or not its truealso she doesnt understand what analogies are and certainly not what ad homs or appeals authority are standard lying in order to troll never said it of coursebut if rafia is arguing a position chances are its based on a lie more lying in order to troll killboard stats for small gang pvp do not evince experience with nullsec warfare and the fact that minigin is a troll is due to his relentless trolling i even asked him to stop but he then creepily demanded to hear my voice record me and get my ip address or he wouldnt post honestly because he hates the forums and yet for some reasons posts all over them trolling people more lying in order to troll rafia first lied about what ccp said then lied about what greyscale said now shes lying about what ive said because the fact is that it was an informal spitballing session and not an official policy decision from ccpseriously anybody reading this thread should realize that when someone cant even post with their main and lies constantly on an alt to troll that their argument obviously cannot be suppor
obviously but the antibridge crowd arent about enriching pvp despite their slogans theyre about trying to use out of game methods to hurt opponents they cant fight in the game if theyre too smallineffective to fight sov holders with jb networks they want ccp to fix things for them they cant go the pl route of actually being competent and fighting effectively even when outnumbered so they want ccp to help them if they thought that they could convince ccp to make it so that their enemies couldnt even cooperate they would minigin in fact famously tried to argue that we should actually remove redblue standings from the game so he could gank whoever he wanted and people couldnt cooperate against him of course jbs allow fleet combat which is eves main selling point and one they emphasize in pr bit after pr bit but this is an issue where people want ccp to funnel targets into their guns and make it easier to gank people with gatecamps likewise people actually want to try to make eve less fun and an actual job for people and they claim this will make it more fun its of course because they dont have those moons and want to try to hurt those who do rather than forming up a fleet and doing something about it its forum warfare over fleet warfare the forum warfare crowd doesnt realize this they hope that with bridges removed all of a sudden their opponents wont cooperate and finally theyll be able to fight them but not more time consuming and tedious for the forum warfare advocates so to them its just fine and it might funnel targets into their guns and they cant manage to camp jbs or object to the fact that once targets are aware that theyre there they might have to move and exert effort to kill targets on another jb so theyd prefer some easy ganks of course if they actually got the change implemented and managed to claim space if their opponents magically all fell apart without bridges all of a sudden wed be hearing about how awful logistics in eve are and how people need to play it like its their job
holy  ive posted in this thread like 12 months ago and havent read it since then ive just read the last page of the thread and you are still making the same dumb arguments like just cause you say they dont doesnt mean that you are right in fact this is not an argument at allyou keep talking about jb camp being equivalent to gate camps which is totally bs1 once the jb camp is reported everyone simply uses another jb  once a camp of a bottleneck systemgate is reported well you still cant use another gate or you would at least have to make a really long detour in order to avoid it 2 at a jb there are usually pos guns  there are no guns at a gate in 00 yes they can be incapped3 jbs need to be scanned down first  the gates are not that hard to find4 at jb there is a safe pos shield bubble  there is no such thing at a gateand the probably most important argument against the jbs the ability of force projection though i wont explain this for the pick a number time ps use some  references in your arguments and i say you are the toon of glenn beck
for one reason alone ccp should keep bridgesgate lag uhhmm
the differences are mostly minor matter of implementation and easy to changei wouldnt say that anyone is arguing that jump bridge mechanics should remain intact the point is neither of the arguments support the jump bridges removal removing a feature means there is a conceptual flaw and with no way for fix that does not apply to jump bridges though thus whole bridge removal agenda is very much absurd and indeed lacking reasoning to justify such action major part of the issue is failed sov revamp and sacrifiing jump bridges isnt going to help anything supporting this type of bandaids only encourage ccp in their lousy development
no  and i notice that you somehow neglected to mention that simply claiming that they exacerbate problems isnt proof either maybe the detailed fact based argument that ive presented time and again as to why they dont actually exacerbate the problems listed is the argument that ive made ya thinknah it was probably those two words you really believe that too blatant fiction ive stated that both can be camped but obviously an armed pos is not a gate which again proves that its perfectly possible to effect area denial of jb networks and also ignores the fact that not only is there not always a separate arm of a jb network you can use but you can actually camp more than one jb pipeline gasp a pos is not a gate alert the mediaoh no effort csaas arent fair either i guess theyre also at poss have to be scanned down and you cant even incap them without incapping the entire pos no fairive also heard that ccp is thinking of implementing some sort of structure where people can store all their assets totally risk free which grants an invulnerability timer when you leave it and which takes herculean effort to take possession of and which pilots can simply return to and be in complete safetyi think theyre planning on calling it an inpost no thats not right transpost sidepost probably not outpost though which has already been identified as fearmongering there was force projection before jbs theres still force projection without them today hell the drone regions were recnetly invaded by alliances which largely set up shop at a forward hq and didnt use jbs at all in the day to day conflict additionally even the longest jb chains save something like 1520 minutes and those are only the longest to suggest that you can raise a fleet of hundreds upon hundreds of pilots to project force but then they have an additional 15 minutes of travel time so they all go homewell its not particularly convincing is all not that the ayieeee glenn beck ad hominem troll isnt awesome clearly if youre getting your head handed to you on the facts and logic vomiting on the guy eviscerating your argument has to be better than well im not sure what its better than but probably something or another boy howdy
1 it is much harder to camp an armed pos with jb to bubble a jb you need to incap the guns first which reuires a considerable fleet2 while you could stop the traffic between certain constellation by camping only one or two gates you would mostly have to camp more jbs for the same effect  the gates 3 how can a hostile entity know how many jbs you have and how they are connected well one could use spiesthis brings us to the bottomlinejb camps req more intelligence bigger numbers  more fleets on top of that they give the defender the ability to blob the system in order to crash the camp withing minutes after forming up this would be more difficult without jbs especially for big alliences due to lack of motivation to do 10j just to crash a gate campyes the differences are only minor honestly you must be the toon of glenn beck if you dont have any counterargument just write somekind of unrelated bs or does ccp plan to introduce an outpost upgrade that allows you to use it as a gate or a jb or can csaas create some kind of wormholes that teleport you to a certain systemhow can it be identified as fearmonging if i see the proof for it almost every day on our last road trip we moved like 25 jumps away from our home systems to fight another alliance the problem was that we had to travel back in order to rat when we needed to replace lost ships plus another alliance attacked us in our home systems at some point which meant we had to travel 25 jumps through low sec in a sr bs blob just to discover that the enemy didnt show up after 2 weeks our leadership had to cancel the operations due to pilots losing motivation dont showing up to ctas and going offline as soon as a fleet is announced where everybody is expected to participate if he is online
indeed they are minortroll less please
yes only an idiot would deny that jbs offer an advantage and that theyre not the same as gates weve been over this though so what its not as easy to camp many jbs as it is most gates so what again effortso what effort plus a defensive bonus for defenders what is the world coming tohey guys i know youre all spinning your ships and bored but weve found a stationary camp only 10 minutes away and were going to go gank the  out of them who wants killmails and you respond with ad hominem trolling when your argument is debunked after i offer a point by point counterargument instead of addressing it you babble about glenn beck and troll about how i dont have a counter argument its obvious you dont understand so ill explain it to you again the properties of jbs which annoy you arent unique to jbs and arent extreme in relation to the rest of game mechanics the only thing youve come up with is that theyre more difficult to camp than gates duh and yet again changing jb functionality is worlds apart from completely and totally removing them from the game the irony here is delicious of course as its been debunked on factual and logical grounds weve already done the whole gasp look at how you can save almost 15 minutes on an op that might see hundreds if not thousands of people who can prepare far in advance for well known timers thingnot to mention the fact that the dreaded nc jb network ayieee didnt allow the nc to defend its home and attack the drf so claims that they let you fight on two fronts are false and much of the nc deployed to forward hqs from which they launched their attacks into drf space also totally without jbs even looking at vale the actual travel time saves was a handfull of minutes and again there was force projection long before there were ever jbs coalitions too jump clones market alts pve alts you didnt have to travel back at all and even if you actually did pilots can easily rotate out for a few hours of ratting and afford pretty much any nonfaction subcap ship in the game the plural of anecdote is not evidence i could just as easily point out that we deployed all the way across the galactic map to a region where we have zero jbs but our enemies have their own networks and we routinely go on 25 jump roams all over the place because we like it but neither anecdote has anything to do with the fact that simply posting up maps and ignoring the facts and logic involved doesnt justify the fearmongering inherent in the zomg you can save 15 minutes of travel time eve is dooooooomed see i have a map
dont have the time for a long answer right now but this is remarkableyou have basically confirmed all of my arguments and your single counterargument was so whatyou really are a great argument debunker and you really expect me to adress your so what argumentlet me test something the world is running out of oil we should invest into green technologiesyes you are right gas will be more expensive in the future but we dont need new green technologies get a better paying job so what global warmingwe dont need to reduce the carbondioxite emissions just get yourself some sun lotion but this will make sea levels rise oooh effort so what dictatorsyes dictators arent nice everyone knows that but you can still adapt to the system so what waryes living in peace is nicer but you can still survive a war if you hide so whathey it works thxwell ok i stop trolling so your counterargument is basically yes you are right but i dont care and there is really no point in arguing with you about that there is actually no reason why you should care since you belong to the entity that profits form the jb network the most
ah that explains everything i cant have your cake so i whine to devs to take the cake from you
yes totally true you got me i mean i live in 00 as well and we also do have jbs which make oh wait
well then you obviously do not understand the substance of logical argument it isnt enough to identify a fact and then point angrily at it the so what part is what actuay makes an argument a given is impotent without logical conclusions the fact that jbs are not gates is immaterial if you cannot posit and then support so whatthis is logic 101the fact that your only response is this bluster would seem to suggest that your argument does not or can not rise above angrily pointing at facts and hoping that a qed will materialize out of thin airof course not i expect you to be utterly unable to take a set of givens all the way through to a qed and for you then to rant about glenn beck so far you are performing as expected dioxide carbondioxide one c atom two o atomsdont say that ive never done anything for yayou misspelled you are pointing to isolated facts and then doing absolutely no work to build a cogent analysis which proves anything about the relevance or impact of those facts much less what should be done about themeasy typo to makealso funny troling about how i belong to anybodylike ive pointed out fiction fallacy fearmongering and failure
actually i thought it is needless to explain that since many people tried already to explain that to you  it is in the csm notesbut ok bacause jbs  gates they can be considered as tools that support the creation of big power blocks which increase the problem with blobbing because jbs make it easier to form big fleets you said earlier about that something like this is bs because jbs can be camped tooand it is again surprising to me how you first say that jbs are not special cause they can be camped and so on but then you simply say yes of course they are not gates and much harder to camp but why are we talking about this stupd fact i dont care anyway and by the way you guys are all stupid trolling s cause you cant spell words properly and every argument i dont like is illogial
make each jump thru the jb cost 10 million isk from users walletthat can bring some balance to the current situation its like a toll gate for a super highwaymost unbalanced things in eve can be brought in order by economic adjustments
got some folks to agree with me in a big way so adding my own supportthis would imo kinda detract from the fact that the freighter is the only ship class in the game 100 dependent upon skills and nothing else i believe it is meant to be that way so we cannot haul cap ships and is easier on the devs to keep it this wayconsider this sir way back when the freighter was created eve did not have an easy way to warp directly to gates meaning the 5 increase in max velocity was actually a useful boost now that you can warp to zero in any system you travel in this boost no longer has any significant use in our current universe as it is an agility boost will actually make the second skill effect useful once again
not suppotedim an active freighter pilot most of the time i own 2 charon heck i own all the bpolosing the speed bonus for agility would mean freighters could reach warp speed faster which is not where they spend most of their timemost of the time traveling in a freighter is spent on the 125 km distance to the gate and in warpfor example despite the fact that an orca travels in warp a lot faster 27 aus vs 075 aus the orca has a lower top speed than a freighter the orca actually takes a lot longer to travel those 125 km than a freighter the end result is that a freighter travels faster than an orca ive raced them on some long routes to verify itif you want to buff freighters for everyone increase their speed in warp to say 20 aus
true a warp speed increase would benefit any freighter and since you are mentioning the 125km to gate distance this means you tend to autopilot yes switching from a max velocity boost to an agility boost would make an ap pilot slower overall an agility boost would benefit active nonafk pilots only so at this point i guess the big question would be should the skill benefit an active pilot more an afk pilot more or bothoh yes and in case you have always used autopilot there is a nice selected item icon that allows you to warp directly to a gate at 0km
rewarding afk autopiloting is bad you want fast travel time dont autopilotdefinitely support a bonus to agility instead of velocityedit a freighter can carry 4x5x as much as an orca it should be slower than one but that isnt what this thread is about
i support the principle of not rewarding afk pilots with higher speeds rather than higher agility what about higher structure resists
i actually gave that one thought and came to the following conclusion1 if someone is trying to suicide you you either a have some really dumb gankers that will not succeed or b have some really valuable cargo that makes it worth losing 1020 battleships2 if you are wardecced and you are flying a freighter you are either a not the sharpest tool in the shed b being really expensive bait c just dont care about a 750mil isk ship or d all of the above3 if you are flying your freighter in lowsecsee answers abc and d for scenario 2any of the situations that would result in the need for extra hull tank are generally better mitigated by smarter piloting or using another ship for the job and an extra 25 ehp prolly wont save you anyhow so although better resists would be better than higher max velocity my preference would be for agility insteadthe exception to this may be for jump freighters in which case the extra resist may end up buying you enough time for reinforcements maybe
this would indeed make flying a freighter less of a pain and probably help jita congestion
25 extra ehp means 25 more ships in the suicide tank fleet which means you can carry more valuable cargothen again that means more cargo per trip which makes eve smaller and increases the incentive for everyone to trade in jita so scratch that idea higher agility would make eve smaller too
 this
oh im sorry i misunderstood i thought this was about unnecessarily boosting a ship simply to make peoples lives easier now i realise that the problem is solely a wasted bonus because people dont ap in their freightersso id be very happy to support reducing freighters agility by 20 then changing the bonus to 5 agility per level i dont see what this would achieve apart from to annoy nonexistent apers and people without freighter v but thats your argument
i support this idea completelywhile i can understand the benefits of autopiloting in a freighter say a quick biobreak then yeah a bit of autopiloting can be helpful doing it for the entire trip if youve played the station spinning game long enough you should know that that is a bad idea gankers like people who dont instawarp onto the gates methinksthis might have already been harped on before but what could also benefit freighter pilots is a 5 increase on that races tank per level in order to protect against said gankerssure a freighter is a gigantic box in space but does it have to be a gigantic wet cardboard box in space
seriously nobody wants mines back at all or is it that too many people here are too young in eve to remember them supporting my own postmines are awesome
hell im a new player and never heard about mines but that seems an awesome idea
i dont think they were removed for a lack of lovei think they did two different things that were problematic1 they created a massive amount of new objects the servers had to keep track of2 they created situations where someone might leave mines in low sec or null sec and they would pop someone while the character leaving mines was in high sec thus calling in the wrath of concord
i know make it so the mines disappear when you log out and reappear when you log ini can see goonswarm logging 1000 people in simultaneously with mines in the same spot to nuke a titanseriously though mines would need a lot of reworking if they were to reenter the game i dont support your idea per se but ccp needs to start designing new weapons for combat again
not to call attention to another mmo but sto has minesdifference being they launch they deploy they float if someone comes close enough to trigger them they move to intercept and detonate if no one approaches for a few minutes they diewho says mines have to be placed and left forever treat them like an interdictor bubble something thats kicked out in the middle of a battle instead of arranged ahead of timesure you cant mine your happy sov system into impenetrability but you can still use them for kmsooh or just tie them into sovcan only be used in systems where you hold sov
if they functioned more like sto meh okay however unlike that game there is no frontsiderear to ships in eve all directions are equally vulnerable and part of the firing arc so there is little reason to have such a weapon if someone is chasing you and gaining they are in a fast ship so the mines wontshouldnt catch them that is the only situation i can think of for the use of such weapons
someone didnt read my threadbut yeahmake them like smartbombs and bombsthe use of which in empire gets you concorded or restrict them entirelybut put them in 00 with the restrictions i stipulated in my original post
and its perfectly possible for ccp to make there be actual rewards to leaving your hangar and going into a station besides playing space barbie in second space life in fact the lack of any meaty content for it is one of the main points in my op here and many of the proposals i made in the linked mechanics thread fair enough i misread that bit yes but again your argument was that you wouldnt leave your hangar and go into a station if there was any risk at all that means only zero not nonzero if then your objection is that on high security decks or however its implemented it should be very unlikely that you can be killed thats fine why dont you suggest some mechanics to achieve that in the linked mechanics thread well concord is punitive not prohibitive the whole philosophy behind highsec is that theres no such thing as safe space only safeer space and you can be killed at any point but your attacker will also be taken down guaranteed theres no real contradiction then with cops in stations blowing your brains out if you aggress someone else and it being very hard to kill someone on a high security deck but it not being utterly impossible remember even if weapons arent allowed you can still drop rat poison into someones drink just as an example you are misunderstanding the dynamic the payout is higher than the cost of the insurance but much lower than the cost of the ships hull to say nothing of modules it is not injecting isk into the economy its allowing a small portion of the ships cost to be retained rather than lost there is no new isk at all being injected into the economy for example i havent checked market prices in a long while as i get my recons for free so this is just off the top of my head an arazu hull costs about 80 million isk lets say a properly fit arazu costs 95 mil insurance costs about 10 mil and the payout is about 20 thats 95 mil cost plus 10 mil insurance for 105 total cost out of that you get back 20 mil for a total loss of 85 mil even if you werent fitting the ship and just insurance frauding it youd still lose 60 mil on deal thats part of why ccp changed how insurance worked because people actually were making isk off of insurance frauding some battlecruisers where the formula was messed up and you could make a profit off of buying a hull on the market and then insuring and destroying it isk isnt being injected into the economy the lost isk is being mitigated
well honestly as long as there is some sort of insurance on implants and as long as the penalties are as severe as podding then i guess i wouldnt have much of a problemits sort of off topic but im going to have to disagree on this part thoughthe cost of the ship is going to another player so that isk is never leaving the game and the amount of isk in the economy is unchanged the difference between the insurance payout and the cost is isk being injected into the economy by an npc entity
op  i support your proposalwith some very severe restrictions but could you try not supporting it for a whileyour trolling the thread is not helpingoh and no more insurance insurance was a bad idea and adding more makes it worse
serra see the general idea is sound and now the only thing that really needs to be do is hammer out mechanics if you could check the support box thatd be coolother person talk sense how can i possibly be trolling my own thread and what could possibly be gained from it and if course theres the fact that im not trolling you also forgot to check the support box
that may very well be i think however that its important to hold ccps feet to the fire and let them know that we want eves core content to carry over to any new expansion and not be waved off with second space life where we get to play space barbie and accessorize
i completely disagreeon both of your posts not sure why this topic needed twoand from the same person i might add walking in stations is not meant to be pvp of any kind nor should it be it is simply a refinement of what we already have with a few tweaks and perks if you wanna kill someone while walking around then wait for dust to release
rather poor trolling and obvious i might addas already pointed out something like a half dozen times the chair of the csm suggested that i start a second elevator proposal thread that didnt focus on mechanicsthanks for the free bump though
thanks shoopa
supported i guess didnt know this was an issueif nothing happens why not go to an internet cafefriends house and do it there
bc would be nice if balanced right where it wouldnt be to over powering but the piratefaction destroyer idea does sound good
as long as it costs around 500 million definitely not less than 400 then i have no problems with this ideawe also need officer modified medium weapons  probably cost 5001000 million each
i was very surprised to learn there were no piratefaction battle cruiser would be awesome if ccp introduced them
while it would be nice to havesome more faction ships i hate seeing command ships becoming more and more uselessso i approve under the condition that faction bcs are set apart in some way of cs while at it cs could use a small buff and tier 2 bcs could a small nerf
which part of market price is determined by supply vs demand do you not comprehend
first fix both classes the tier 2 bcs need fixing as in neutering the destroyers need fixing as in duct tape
this
the profit margin is determined by free market but the base cost is set by ccp in form of loyalty point  isk requirement for item bpc at faction lp store and ccp manipulate the supply by setting drop percentages on faction spawns
i believe the pirate faction ships were introduced before destroyers and bcs were introduced this is why there arent faction destroyers or bcs a few years back this topic was discussed though this was before they beefed up the faction shipsi support this only if the guristas actually put a little effort in and come up with something more than a new paint job guardian angels and blood raiders have at least one unique hull design sansha and angel cartel have a complete line of unique hulls guristas are apparently just lazy
is there a way that we could consider talking about having a jump command added much the way that dock works now when youre warp distances away from a station people could still warp to within and autopilot would still stop 12km short but if youre physically at the keyboard it would be nice to just jump from wherever instead of having to warp to the gate and then jumping
nahall i can think of is some poor twit in nullsec accidentally pressing the warpjump button and making the fc really madif we want to reduce the number of buttons we have to push why dont we put in a launch all drones button
this is what i have heard as well however there is an easy solution remove the current billboard models from space dont fix the old ones at all  make new ones make the new ones deployable objects by players like cans require anchoring 5 and have some sort of new marketting skill that cant be used on trial accounts make them consume charters use a preapproved library of text images and animated backgrounds and give a simple system for players to make their own 30 second scripted sequences allow players to rent their billboard space out to other corps and organizations awesomeness will ensue
i have to agree with most of your ideas but they cannot be deployable objects the griefing potential for such a system is endless there should be set slots that they can be placed in such as where they are already as well as off to the side of station launch tubesscrapping the original code could also have an assortment of issues how connected to the bounty system is the original coding should they reprogram the bounty system as well whats the potential for screwing up an entirely different section of the game and is the development time sink worth it
i came across a problem the other day where a thief came into my mission and stole a mission objective from a prespawned can usually if a thief steals something from your mission they will get red flagged am i correct so you can shoot them scramble them whatever well because the thief stole from the prespawned objective can they do not get red flagged in my opinion this is not legitimate as you have no chance of stopping the thief otherwise you would get ganked by concorde can we change this so they get red flagged
ive never had people invading my mission space but if this is the case i definitely support this its silly that any normal loot in the mission gives em red flags yet the stuff youre after for the mission they can take and concord will take their side in the matter
hello i believe that any sort of balancingnerfingtweeking of items is likely to anger one set of group and only benefit one setwhat i propose are ui mechanics that improve gameplay for a majority while limiting negative impact to only a certain fewselecting itemsright now you can ctrl a or ctrl click to click multiple items this is a pain for someone who has 800 items and has to sort through them each timei propose a way tag individual items or group of items for current and future interactions and then be able to quickly filter by those groups to only see those items in inventory also these filters would be exportableexamplei have 800 items in my inventory and 40 of those items are items i buy low sell high 40 i buy low to refine and the rest are just random inventoryyou would be able to right click an item add tag and then type in sell refine ect then somewhere on the inventory interface be able to filter to certain categories in this example i would filter to sell and then see the 40 items i tagged for sell i then sell all those itemsso now i no longer have any items tagged sell in my inventory so i log off for the night come back in the morning and because of my buy orders being fulfilled  i select my filter sell and now can see any of those items i got from my buy orders that had previously been tagged sellbenefits anyone who has to manage a lot of items for different categories and gets new supplies constantly this would also benefit quicker processing quicker sellingproposed be able to select your private orders for view to publica basic toggle that would allow you to right click a finished private contract and select make public doing so would allow anyone searching you to see that contract the only thing that would be blocked out would be the sellers name unless they to toggle to make it publicly viewable another way would be allow that to be selected at the contract creation screen while it could be a private auctionitem order others would be able to view the history after completionbenefits contracts are a good way of showing your reputationhistory although it makes sense that you would want to hide some transactions like say the fact that you are secretly buying bulk minerals from a member of a corp you are at war with mainly this would help people who buy and sell items in bulk lets say you are someone who buys bulk moon minerals from independent people since some people are hesitant to say what minerals they have for fear of someone just asking around to acquire intel on peoples moons ect the buyer can be say look at my contract history and see all the contracts ive completed for moon minerals this makes it easier for the buyer to prove his intent and the seller to gain trust quickerproposed notation to mark containers that have items in thema simple notation maybe a green circle on lower left that would identify that a container had items in it optimally it would be rest if you could see to what percentage it is full however that might require a lot loadingbenefit everyonehow many times have you been haulinglooking at assets see a container and go hmm i dont remember that did i put something in there to open it and find it is empty
resereved
signedwhy isnt this thread more popular maybe adding proposal to the front will help i dunno
been requested for ages still hasnt happened
this
or just fit a hull repper in your utility mids as youre armor tanked with low slots
i think thats too small of a niche when you consider how many ships are hybrid weapon platforms over 13 of the combat ships they really need something that provides a benefit in fleet fights something the bleed proposal does not provide them
definitely a better alternative would be a simple allowdisallow list eg mailing list or channel options tie it as an option to the command center and make it so
suggesting spell check before posting
hello every oneas we all know 00 atm is stagnent and boring for every one involved the deffenders and the attackers hence it kills moral and it will kill this game in the long run if things arnt changedthe current mechanics allow and need allainces and players to be in one system and with a huge amount of ehp on all the structuresi propose a change a change that means you ill have to achive objectives and give the attackers and the deffenders the options that you would expectwe need to stop looking at indeviduel systems and look more onto a consteltion objectivenow this is going to need work ofc but maybe its a step in the right direction and with some of ccps input on what can and can not be achived then we will knowso here we gothe way sov will work is still much the same but the way it is taken is different and it should break down like this constelation  attacking alliances will need to block the gates into the constelation so instead of sbu we have cbus constelation bloackade units these will take an hour to online and 100 of the gates to the constelation will need to be coverdonce coverd you then have your options within the constelation and these can be achieved by sbus that have to be anchored at one of the planets these again will take an hour to online and as it has the cbus become vulnthis way we are splitting the fight among the constelation and not just in the systemstations will have duel rf timers as allways but the tcus will have oneihubs should not be allowed to be destroyed unless the new sov holders want it to bethis is an idea and im sure with the input of the eve members this could turn into some much biggermy 2 cents hope it helpsjayro
says the person with what experience in null sec also making it more difficult to take space isnt going to make null less stagnant it will make it more stagnant i do hope this was just a troll
you need to break up the blob or at least make it less viable like removing ehp sovereignty entirely if you want to get rid of the stench of decay in nullbrain fart objective based system1 anchor siege units2 number of with size restricted plexes become available for scanning think fw3 plexes can involve hacking blowing  up or something entirely different think incursions4 complete xx number of plexes and system reinforces or some next level becomes vulnerable  could probably even make anchoring siege units in one system spawn plexes throughout a constellation to really throw a wrench in the brute forceblob approachadd to that the ability to directly influence sovereignty indices with small fleetsgangs and being able to blob for 6 hours a day no longer means you are 100 safe from all comerswould mean that the regionally exclusive alliances either die or hire people from other timezones but when was diversity ever a bad thingin short take away the ehp based sovereignty and the uberblob loses a lot of its reason for being
it should still be tied to pvp not some npcplexmission stuff that has been resoundingly regarded as a bad idea in fwif you want the blobs to decrease in size the objectives need to be less time based the timers are the reason for blobs everyone knows when a potential fight will occur because of the timers so both sides build fleets just before the timer ends if one side cant get the numbers they leave it be if both sides get the numbers they fightvulnerability should be based on small fleet actions then bring in caps to pound on structures it is my understanding that this was originally part of the plan for dominion but they never finished it
depends on if ccp wants it to be like that or not theres no way to know without a dev response which is why i didnt bother filing a bug report yet
i believe the channels for dealing with a problem go like this1 file bug report2 if no reasonable response post on ah3 in no reasonable response fly to iceland and bribe devs with boozehope this helps
for the moment we can only set destination andor add waypoint for a single location if we want to compare distances we have to add them all individually and then optimize for the closest onethis works great if youre clicking in assets to make a pickup route or somethingbut what if youre just trying to get to the closest location out of a catagory1 despite the futuristic setting we dont have the internet we cant order from amazon and we cant buy from ebay so when we want to accept a contract we have to be in the same zip code as the item offeredinstead of setting destination for the target system why not add the option to set for the region itself and head for the closest system in that region then you can get to the contract quicker2 incursions are starting to highlight constellations where previously there was no real significance everything was focused on systems or regions as above how about adding the ability to target the closest system in a particular constellation3 along with incursions is an increase in concord lp spending apparently they can appear anywhere in high sec but only have stations in a few systems as above how about adding the ability to select the closest station of a particular corp not only would it apply to concord and incursion profits but to missioning for particular corps overallideas
yay me
being able to set waypoints to regionsconstellations would be niceregarding 1 we are amazon want something delivered to you make a wanttobuy contracti dont like the idea of everyone being able to accept contracts everywherehowever i wouldnt object to a skill that works similar to procurment or daytrading  just for contracts and regionssupported with reservations
something that has bugged me for a while with the tengu it is not an issue of stats but what i believe to be a graphical error and should be a quick easy fix the magnetic infusion basin is designed for use with rails or hybrids and yet only has one turret point graphically on the fins of the subsystem the accellerated ejection bay is made for missile damage and yet it has 3 turret points graphically on the fins of the subsystem this just seems a little dumb the simple fix being to just swap the looks of the two modulesalsofix the legion
ill update the op a bit with suggestions regarding other methods of gathering intel like skills modules or changesadditions to the scanners both probes and directional

have you checked mineral prices lately try looking at noxciumthe main sources for this stuff is hemorphite hedbergite and jaspet all low sec oresand mining abcm in null sec is still very profitable just not as profitable as some people would like it due to overminingbotsetc
00 mining used to be more enticing before wspace happened lowsec mining was never a good idea for as long as ive played and from what i gather that was because of the drone regions if you want to talk risk vs reward then lowsec should pay more than 00 especially for miners i guess the question is if mining can be fixed by simply increasing the payout or if its conceptually broken to begin with

this doesnt address the situation where you are called away from the pc at all though if my kid is upstairs crying or my wife needs my help waiting 15 minutes for an agro timer to clear isnt an option i need to be able to warp to a safe and immediately cloak up so that i can go deal with the reallife emergency rl  eve and always will bei agree that afk camping systems is teh lame ive personally never done it because i feel its a lame tactic and yes to those who are currently hostile to me that means if im in system im actually there and actually waiting for you to do something stupid so i can kill you  but you need to remember that waiting for aggro timers doesnt help those of us who have to run afk now when you are talking about changes to the systempersonally i think having cloaks do 2 things 1 use cap 2 disable cap recharge make the cap drain small so that you could cloak for up to an hour or so but once thats done you need to decloak to recharge your cap it solvs the afk camper issue while allowing those who have to suddenly run afk to do so they can always come back within 1hr or so and log off
capacitor drain while cloaking sounds good to me still exceptions should be made for covops and maybe recons
thats not a bad idea will add that to the options that should be presented to ccp i agree that the cap drain on official cloaking ships should be lower
you have my vote
good luck prom if you do get elected your only real opportunity to put your issues on the table for transparent and official discussion with ccp will be in summit sessions related to those issues since the csm at least during csm5 drives the summit agenda for the most part assuming they dont just passively let ccp do that you should be able to request a session or two be added to the agenda related to your interests same as i did with low sec back in june assuming of course that csm6 operates in the same democratic manner regarding summit planning that csm5 did
renowned solo pvper runs for csm no question you have my vote good luck
im thinking that with every proposal you will at least consider will this proposal promote small gang and solo pvp or hurt it imo this is what eve desperately needs we need someone who can start explicitly thinking about proposals in this light so solo and small gang pvp doesnt get stealth nerfed out of the game at this point i cant see why i would vote for anyone else
what youre saying is we should add more  to the backlog that will never be addressed right
no but the solution is not to vote one that says that im a real man im going to fix it and then when someone says how he replies with oh dont worry im going to be subtle and act circumstantially because you know i am mittani thus i canyoure going to yell silently you will stare them and change their mind because mittani canor youre just going to act as every good csm candidate
for those not familiar with british comedy shows of a certain age sir humphrey appeared as a civil servant in the series yes minister and later yes prime minister he was an archmanipulator who had as his main aim the protection of his own special interests the power of the civil service and whose primary tool for achieving this aim was the use of misdirection and sometimes deceit on the democratically elected politicians he worked alongsidenaturally the mittani would heroise such a figure
the mittani considering that a great many people live in hisec and lowsec and are naturally drawn towards candidates that will push the issues they care about rather than what the giant powerblocs have to concern themselves withdont get me wrong you guys gotta push for what you guys need jumpbridges and supercapital fixes and whatever else giant billionsofiskpermonth alliances in nullsec have to deal with but lets face it this crisis that youre perceiving with the jumpbridges et al even if it really is this giant gamechanger thats a terrible idea really means very little to the average empire player whos wondering when well be able to get some team pve missions in hisec that dont require superduper ships or guys involved in factional warfare that are just disappointed with how much better it could be or the industrialist with the myriad concerns that they deal withi asked another 00focused goon csm candidate the same question and his response did make sense given the platform hes running on it seems however that your platform focuses more on the csm itself than it does for the gameso when the rest of eve looks at the mittani running for csm and consider the benefits of voting you in what should we be thinking about
well when you put it that waymaybe i should be clearer i understand that making wild empty promises to pander to our dreams is silly there are indeed many candidates promising those in high and low sec players oh ill fix this for you and improve this and do that but those arent the people i or any other thinking eve citizen consider as better optionsits the other candidates who recognize the need to be realistic but as empireexperienced and empiredwelling players also understand and are directly interested in improving the parts of the game that those who arent in nullsec are very concerned aboutbecause lets face it even if the mittani and co fix the csm theyre going to try as hard as possible to address the issues that concern them mostthe things that are the biggest and most unbalanced issues for them thats all well and good and the 00 people should have every reason to vote for him them however the rest of us are ideally looking for someone who isnt about making empty promises but at least has the concerns of empire players dear to their hearts so sure even if weve seen the light and are disillusioned about csm candidates who promise to fix game feature x and improve game detail y we still look at the mittani and see someone who cares very much about eve as it applies to him living in 00 so in this context and not promise to fix this or that i ask in what ways would the average empire player see the benefits of voting for you how will a csm with the mittani in it help alleviate the issues that are relatively unique to the space of gate guns and concord
its been stated multiple times that the csm isnt for solving issues or really bringing them up with ccp again the massive back its a sounding board that ccp bounces ideas off of also we know how empire currently is as most of us have alts that live in empire along with ours in 00 this is because you cant live in 00 without empire due to the currently broken mechanics of 00 so its not like anyone would advocate ccp trying to dismantle empire or nerf it
that may be true but i have serious issues if this is the entirety of the mittanis official stance regarding my concerns
throwing around words that dont mean what you think doesnt make you look smartgoons cant gerrymander the election they can vote as a bloc but so can any group of players with a cohesive membership and a candidate to stand behind fearmongering is for crappy us news networks leave it there boogaloodo you even know how sov warfare works in either the present or past iterations it was a dead horse  but they owned fountain delve and querious for months in that state and the only reason they still dont is because the cf went and brought down the rickety framework holding up the it scarecrow four months im pretty sure the fountaindelve invasion started in january or at most late december thats two at most three months by those of us who still live on a gregorian calendar and the last month hasnt been filled with battles its been filled with mops and bucketson topic i find the attitude of the mittani refreshing and no my main isnt a goon or a testie if you paid attention to the blogs of the csm v folks and their attitudes even here in the forums you would realize that his position is much closer to reality than the im going to save losec for my pirate buddies candidates although i think hell still come back beaten down by the internal bs of a game development corporation hes going to last longer than the others with the attitude hes got in addition goons arent here to ruin eve they claim to love playing the game in fact former goons even work at ccp already so their love of the game itself isnt in question if you dont like the fact that nullsec is tired of being trod upon by an empirefocused csm that says more about your lack of understanding of a huge aspect of this game than their desire to enjoy a game they pay to play

hello mittanii want to know why you hate free speech and democrazy and if you believe that your hate for free speech makes you a good csm candidatewill you allow other goons to pick their gooncandidates in the future or will you continue to tell everyone who to vote like this yearwill you allow other goons to write in the goonforum about their csm campaign in the future or will you continue to threat them with a kick out of goonswarm because you hate free speech and democrazyeditmittani could you please explain why you destroyed the tradition of goon primary elections just to make sure that you can boost your ego on a 2nd class flight to iceland guaranteedplease explain why you support botting in the goon region and how you supporting botting could affect your csm run and your relationship to ccp who are against botting
the assertion that the csm is nothing but a focus group is flatout wrong csm is a stakeholder a status given it by ccp as such the csm has an obligation to be proactivewhich can be very tough given the communications obstacles that must often be dealt with but the csm being proactive can get results off the top of my head a few examples skill queue csm4 recent ui changes prioritization crowdsourcing which prompted the allocation of team bff to spend the current development cycle fixing annoying potholes and limiting of microtransactions to vanity items the csm pushed for these things convincingly and ccp responded positively despite initial resistance in some cases while such victories may not have been as frequent as we would have liked csm5 proved that proactive professional behavior combined with appropriate pressure management can get  doneno doubt there are some within ccp that would prefer the csm be just a focus group but until or unless ccp diminishes csms status from stakeholder to focus group proactive efforts to bring issues to ccps attention and insistence on participating in discussion about how to address them is not only the csms prerogative as a stakeholder but its obligation as a representative of the community
mittani for csm the no bs approach is better than all the rest
waitpeople actually believe this
by people you mean the current chair of the csmim thinking mynxee would be in a pretty good position to know
the mittani has my vote hes an attractive and passionate man
i added 20 lbs  an extra chin to my mental image of this person with every piece of poetry i read
lets just say that since ccp gave us the name we were determined to try and play the csm game accordinglyeven severely hampered by a lot of factors that dont affect any other stakeholder group inside ccp and well aware of the differences between all of them and the csm it will be interesting to see how csm6s take on stakeholder status shapes up after they take office and how they choose to leverage itor not
i support this product andor service because i too want a special hulk that fires disco lasers while it mines
how could they leverage it there is no mechanism in place to do so the whole stakeholder thing is a meaningless gesture by ccp and in realworld terms it has zero effect on the future of the game
shame that the no bs approach mittani desperately claims to have doesnt extend to being honest about the fact that he and his cronies are trying to stitch up the csm for their own political interestsbut hey if youre criminally gullible and want to believe him then more fool you i dont thinks hes actually managed to clearly express what lies he thinks the csm has been telling to date
hi mittens fanboi shame you only know one of the definitions of the word jerrymanderingvb1 government politics  diplomacy to divide the constituencies of a voting area so as to give one party an unfair advantage2 to manipulate or adapt to ones advantagehaha you look stupid on an internet forum
dear page seven did you look at this yet the purpose of my candidacy is to attempt to fix the csm itself by trying to solve the ccpcsm communication problems either through chutzpah or bastardry im not sure which if youre a features voter youre not going to vote for me youre going to vote for some guy who will promise you features to be upvoted which will promptly be upvoted into the backlog and forgotten what you might ask yourself is this what nifty empirerelated features have already been upvoted by csm1csm5 that are languishing in development hell because the csm isnt an effective advocate mynxee points out that the csm is nominally a stakeholder in ccps eyes yet in practice it is only treated like a stakeholder when it suits ccp to do so that power could be grown into a real voice depending on how its played the idea of you vibrating with frustration as you mashed that out on your keyboard just brought a smile to my face i can only hope that this reply equally enrages youoff the top of my head personal lobbying of sympathetic devsincreasing devcsm communication on both the csm forums and elsewheregetting the forum mod rules changed such that discussion of csmrelated activities arent mired in this backwater subforummedia relations spotlighting issues and problems the csm is encounteringcrushing scandals and idiocy from the csm itself so that they dont distract from the messageits pretty easy for ccp to blow off the csm if people are stockpiling thulium or trying to yoink corporate secrets lets not delude ourselves by suggesting that past csms are perfect victims of ccp
dear pubbiesi can compare this years csm election to a perilous time in american history where a subset of the population was discriminated upon for their lack of education their cheap work ethic and even the color of their skin this period of history was class warfare at its finest and two regions of the united states waged a terrible and costly war to settle on the right of the state to endure the law of the united republic where democracy was said to reign supreme this terrible war wages on at ccp and you pubbies are the slaves democracy has failed you much like your forefathers you are slave to a game about internet spaceships this eve online you are chained to its features to its content and to its bugs when ccp fails you you have no recourse except to sing your low sorrowful song when ccp breaks the database your cries for freedom go unheard when the logs show nothing you dear pubbie are powerless to redress let our candidate empower you elect a honest mitten to stand on his no bs policy and declare your rights to ccpyou deserve a great game you deserve a real wage not slavery you need someone to stand up for you and fight for what is right you need a mitten that will unite this previously paralyzed circle of incompetents known as the csm the csm can be strong with the right direction but all previous actions are for naught i have analyzed the results of those attempts i have seen what the previous councils have done for you they have done nothing but appease your smallish immediate desires if you want real change you will elect someone strong someone honest someone who will not turn his back at fords theater to receive a bullet to the head but rather meet your adversaries head on with guns blazing while riding a bear made of spite and steel you need this put aside your trolling put aside your anger and channel true change for the game we all love this cottonpicking eve online

id just like to take a moment to point out to anyone reading this thread to look over the endorsements of both present and running csm candidates thats not just a display of respect trebor has earned itgive him another go in iceland i say hes masochistic enough to put himself through it after all
not masochistic just married with children toughens even the weakest of men to no end
i am conflicted duty says i should vote trebor but wallet demands another tyrannislike expansion
actually being the father of two extremely intelligent but incredibly petulant teenage boys makes me uniquely qualified to be chairman of the csmand it might also help when dealing with ccp as well
you may be able to fool the people slobbering all over you due to your high visibility but those of us in the know are quite aware that you are completely unqualified to act as anything as a secretary for csm your knowledge of game mechanics is abysmal and this is what qualifies a csm not how much ass kissing log rolling and baby holding youve done
i must be fair to say that i had extremely ty opinion of him as a player while he was leading old mc luckily i was privileged to meet him in rl tho again from the opposite side of the table  now as a ccp employee one of the most constructive talks i ever had despite long and intimate sex talks with ccp explorer with any ccp dev was with seleene both during csm summits and fanfest he was extremely dedicated to the game tho on the wrong side as a player later as a eve developer and i am sure he will be the same as csm delegate
seleene is a very good candidate for the csm i can think of no other person better suited his knowledge of the game inside and out from a player and producer standpoint far exceeds any other candidate he has been actively playing the game since beta he was on the inside for 3 years and got to see how the machine ticks he is passionate reasonable and his approach is measured carefully he has my vote
im trapped in a nyx and can never leave to do anything fun but draco hauls iteron vs full of  and beer to me hes just that nice of a guy
draco is cool and has taken much input from our forums to integrate into his campaign has valid points and i personally trust himso vote for him
even though i only pay for this game so that i can post on these forums i do believe that you should vote for this guy he has some valid ideas that are worth a place in the csm
i have to say having heard dracos ideas i fully support his candidacy and believe everyone should null sec has a voice vote draco and it shall be heard
i think a lot of the people who say things like get rid of jump bridges dont necessarily want movement to be tedious and boring hey lets go 30 jumps to do anything they are really saying lets expose movement to attack so we can increase pvp instead of having easy mechanisms used to avoid iti dont think its necessary to go back in time back to the days where movement was irritating in order to accomplish this however
why is kalrand not allowed to post about his csm campaign on the goonforum or tell other goons about itdo mittani and you hate free speech and democrazy that muchdont you think that your hate for free speech makes you a bad csm candidate
kalrand already has my not voteedit where is this argument youre basing this on that hes not allowed to run as a candidate for csm
thanks for the free bumpwhile i wish i could run on a platform of improving the quality of posting here on eveo some goals are beyond achievement
you should read my post again
and youre wrong 
also that platform has been taken
tb is a funny guy and a good poster
then quote the part where i wrote that he is not allowed to run as a candidate for csm pleasevile ratdo you think your popularity in goonswarm is so low that you fear competing with kalrand in the goonforumwill you tell the mittani to consider allowing kalrand to post there about his csm run or will the mittani and you continue to behave like gaddafi and his bootlickeryou should fight for free speech to show that you are a worthy csm candidate
you should totally vote for this guy id know
i already answered your question youre wrong about him not allowed to post on the goonfleet forum ask any spy lol who needs to spy on goonfleet anyways that have access to the goonfleet boards 
since you earned yourself a 010 for reading comprehension again i bolded and underlined a few words for you
what is your position on your positioning on vile rats arm
who says he cant post about his csm run
the mittani will kick kalrand out of goonswarm if he tells people to vote for him thats why the mittani cancelled the tradition of goon primary elections to make sure that only he and his puppet vile rat get the vote and thats why kalrand is only allowed to tell people to not vote for him on the goonforum the mittani and his puppet vile rat hate free speech and democratic competition they dont hesitate to destroy everything what goons and sa stand for just to get their little ego boost for beeing in csm
tbh anyone who believed the crap mitanni was spouting about straight talking and champion of the people was thick as pig poo but if this is true it really is pathetic mittens
you have read my lips zero evidence that he is not allowed to post there about his csm run of course were having a laugh at your frustrated anger that is directed at goonfleets communist dictatorship
well we do have your frothymouthed goon ragepost which is starting to convince me
now now im deaf however i do talk so at times i do have saliva in my throat or the back of my mouth which i need to clear out so people can understand me when i talk but frothy never had that problem in fact people who have that issue do annoy the heck out of me when i have to read their lips to understand them
perhaps he was mistaken and you have sand on your lips
chapstick actually
you really think that a guy whos a member of the something awful forum community is going to kick another guy who is also a member of the something awful forum community out of his internet space guild because of a post on the forums really i could understand if you were thinking of someone whos a bad poster like myself but either you think that kalrand is also a bad poster or you have no idea how goon culture works
i am actively pursuing goon votes and have received no threats from the directorate i know where they live you see
your stupidity knows no limit my guess is that you never left jita
capsuleers pirates traders miners warriors and carebaresi hear about all these plans from the other candidates on how they are going to fix this or fix that and then the critics come out and critique them personally i have no grand scheme or 11 point plan or plex survey contest or any other vote producing scheme if i wanted to do that then i would just give everyone that vote for me 1m isk  no i want to hear from you the player what do you want questions like the one above should drakes be nerfed great question because bottom line my only agenda is representing the player eve is so dynamic i do not or could not possibly know every little scathing detail about every profession or feature and that is why there is a representative on the csm to ccp to channel your concerns so rather than me tell you blah blah blah how i am going to fix insert topic here which honestly would be my agenda tell me what you want fixedand for the critics out there i hate you too and i said it first i am sure i will pay for that remark but eh take a jokevote for butch
if i too make a video of me flying around in a drake set to the inception soundtrack can i be your chief advisor
sure can even with the misspellings kinda neat huh i have the soundtrack in my eve playlistbut even more important anyones avatar that looks like dolph lundgren i want as my chief advisorthanks for the replyvote for butch
ok clearly our strong suit here is making eve videos with music shamelessly lifted from movie soundtracksi recommendflying around in a caracal doing a mission to the soundtrack from toy story 3trading in a station make it dramatic somehow using music from black swanmining in a rokh to sound from law abiding citizengetting podded to whatever the soundtrack to just go with it has on it
sounds good when you posting itin the meantime anyone have any questions for mevote for butch
roc the vote
bumped
finneganobviously if jump bridges are the begin all and end all to your eve roc is probably not going to be your candidate but there are players who really dont care much about jumpbridges so this issue isnt important to them and they will vote for things they care about its democracy 101as for his personal business well its his personal business just because he spent time on something related to eve instead of apps that have nothing to do with eve that doesnt change have you always offered your work products for free do you think the eve community has some sort of natural right to have people give away their work for free  unless it comes from ccp yes i know that is how ccp currently wants it but is that right or goodpersonally i think eve would be better off if they allowed 3rd parties to profit from their work yes i know that may sound horrible to some being able to profit from your work is so mercenaryi wish he would speak up about this because i think players would benefit but it seems it is not on his platform so be it
fyi and has already stated in the articles linked on page 1 capsuleer was a join venture between two people this inherently makes it more difficult to release code that isnt owned by a single person
sadly roc i cant back your candidacyi looked over your campaign and im just not sure you recognize the difference between what you should and should not get involved in you hit on all the hot topics of the forums but not on the wisest approaches and i never saw you say simply i dont know enough to have an opinionsometimes knowing your limitations is the most important feature of a candidategood luck anyway
actually ive said that many times there are many areas of eve i dont know about my mandate is the communication of issues keeping the dialogue ongoingi appreciate your honesty and candor and believe you should support the candidate you feel best suited to the role im sorry its not me but am thankful you took the time to drop me a note
i support manalapan because she appears to be the only person that looks for balance when most of csm are either high sec carebear focused or 00 puppets
supported make eve stronger
you lost all credibility when you said ill refuse to answer these questions merely because you come from an alliance that happens to irk me somewhati hope you get negative votes tbh
just to answer your lv 4 missioning thing you make more doing anomlies in 00 than you do in missioning constant respawn  chance of a faction spawn and a escaltion makes 00 more lucrative than high sec if you got the logistical backbone to do so  or are extremly good friends with alliance leaders of the power blocs
as a matter of fact i did answer kalrands questionsnow i dont have anything against the goons personally but when you see them invade and troll almost every single csm candidate thread on the forums it really becomes obvious that answering their questions is an exercise in futility in most cases
bumping this filthy pubbie
vote for this guy he is not here on a hidden 00 goon agenda
fight for democrazy and free speech by voting for kalrandshow the free speech haters mittani and vile rat a lesson
i second what raw wrote kalrand is the only csm candidate whos a regular poster in the md forum and seems to care about the economic part of the gamei also support kalrands candidacy
if anyone has any more questions please ask awaycheers
so who are you actually
thank you for the question who am i really im assuming you have read my website and post about me playing for 7 years i have had quite a few mains as people call them some in large 00 alliances and some in empire corps etc the reason i did not run for csm on one of those characters is i wanted to keep those lives separate from my csm application as i said on my website their are too many csm runners being backed by large alliances and most of them do just tell their members to vote for their alliance rep now in my eyes that isnt helping the general public in eve its just having someone in a csm position because you are a large alliance and want a place theirso who am i well im eve truth and i intend to represent the whole of eve not just one areathank you again for your questioneve truth
doesnt answer my question so you have my not voteat least you are aware that you are going to be publicly announced who you actually are irl by ccp good luck though
sooooooooo you want us to trust you based on the fact that you told us that youre married and have a kid rather than the one thing that actually matters when were talking about reputation in eve online that of course being who you are in eve onlinei mean i suppose its possible that youre genuinely concerned about keeping distance between your obligations to your alliance and your candidacy but it appears to be much more likely that you know youre lyingi mean its great and all that youre taking a bold step and trying to get on the csm but what kind of response are you expecting when youre announcing your candidacy as an alt
thank you for your postfirst off i am distancing myself from my mains ingame i have quite openly said that i have other characters who do different things in eve im doing this simply because if i put on here my mains names then i will be immediately be put under a banner of an alliance or corp im not running on be half of any corp or any alliance and i do not intend to become a csm pawn for any of them like i have said before i intend to represent every member of eve not just the large powerbases as for trust in eve i completely agree with you the only way i will earn your trust is to try and answer you questions as well and honest as i can you have no idea who i am in game that is a very true unless you know one of my mains in an alliance or corp their is very little other ways i can prove myself to you i have gone down this route of an alt simply to distance myself from any alliance or corp probably not the most popular route i could have chosen but to represent everyone i have to be seen as an independent individualhope this goes a little way to answer your questionseve truth
i dont see why hiding your main allows people to trust that you are not a pawn of the 00 powerbloc attempt to control the csmif anything it may make people believe the worst
if i was a pawn of a 00 alliance why would i say i wasnt surely if i was i would be robbing myself of said alliances votes by not having that link
unless of course the alliance is told via other meanssee either youre lying really poorly about being part of an alliance conspiracy or you honestly dont realize that an alliance can post in their own forums which presumably means you have no clue about how alliances workim not sure which one is a more powerful reason to not vote for you
to be honest you have made a good point i never thought of it that way i know i am not going to be able to stand up and give you a response that will change your mind and to be honest im not sure how i couldi set out wanting to become a csm member to try and relay peoples need in eve not just large power bases i dont think a game like eve should be represented from one point of view 00 alliance warfare etc yes that is a big part of it but their is tens of thousands of players who dont live in 00 and are happy with not being their that doesnt mean they should be excluded from the decision making of their gameif i was going to get a load of votes from an alliance etc then why try so hard to explain why i want to be csm if im going to get their votes anyway why not just sit back and when the voting is announced tomorrow and then just let them vote for meeve if rife with people looking for hidden meaning behind everything and that everyone has some alterior motives i just want to try and help peoples voices be heard rather that them being told to post a thread on the forums and then ccp will looks at it in five years time all i can ask is that people will carry on asking questions and if you wish keep on pushing for hidden meanings behind my csm application please do i will try and respond to everything that you ask me thank you for your post and for making me see some things in a slightly different lighteve truth
hello all serious internet spaceship pilotsim a man of few words any questionsnah maybe a few words then  but i wont go on for page after page about all the things i will make better in eve online if i get elected to the csmmy approach angle to running for csm is that eve online is a great game i really love playing eve i like its complexity and that everyone is playing in the same sandboxbut i get a little sad every time ccp makes the sandbox bigger and they forget to put more sand into the sandbox that why i say lets try not to put more new content into eve but lets try to make what we already have really really good i know there is alot of ppl saying that null sec isnt worth the effort any more or others that want the drake nerfed to get rid of drake blob and probably every eve player have an idea about what needs to be done im not the one to tell ccp how to nerf the drake to balance out pew pewim the one thats gonna tell cpp to make the lag monster go hide under the bed and stop for an iteration or 2 and just make eve what is suppose to bemiops here some commas  dont use then all in the same place  and im hanging out in the galaxy pub somewhere around the bar if you wanna get a campaign beer
friendly greetings capsuleersi will not bore you with long speeches ill just tell what i can do and will do time for action and some serious work 14 years experience with modding from lots of pc games games like cc series gta series fallout 3 and new vegas and lots more second life volunteer for 4 years technical translations visual disability aid and more i have asperger syndrome and with that a high iq i think up solutions and ideas in no time also this gives me the whole day for this specific job i dont have a job at this moment that may mess with csm 6 adding a few new ships and fitting as small update think about new tech 2 itemsships and tech 3 working on several world types like walking around on a station and a planet and a corporation office when office is rented as start getting the eve time cards back in stores currently a lot of stores do not have this some members have only plex left due to financial problems and so not able to pay for online time cards this makes it on long term more expansive for all of us there for this idea adding a inworld office hour where capsuleers can talk to some of the ccp and csm people for ideas problems suggestions and when possible to talk about released information from things to come something like a qa hour but better finding a way to keep pirates out of 10 and 09 space this due to new players being targeted for no good reason and there for leaving the game thanks to the pirate actions there needs to be something to improve this adding inworld stores you need to walkrun to them in a station or on a planet stores that offer clothing jewelery etc all to buy with isk i have a lot more ideas that may be great to have
hi everyonethis is my candidacy for csm6but who am i no 00 alliance to support me no there is not im a rather young hilowsec player interested in every aspect of the game and free from 00 powerbloc influencesin eve i mostly hunt pirates and help my industrial friends during their wars but keep in mind im not biased towards these playstiles i need pirates to hunt them for instance i do not want greedy industrials to be absolutely freed from risks in hisec either as for my pvp activities i fly every race of ship i fc quite a lot in 520 gangs battleclinic for those who want to know morein real life i am 23 years old i studied mathematics science in general and sociologywhat i would like is eve to be better for as many playstyles as possible and thats why i am willing to be part of csm6 i really admire the work of the previous csm the ccp commits to excellence thing was awesome and csm6 should in my opinion keep working that waywhat can i bring to csm6 first of all a voice from empire and not from 00 however hard they might try most of 00 old players running for csm just dont understand empire anymore apart from their alt effortlessly printing isks from t2 bpos and being supported by their powerbloc they could not even if they wantedevery thing i will ever do as a csm member will be run by my logical sense and my wish for eve to get even better i will not leave the csm because of a disagreement with ccp on incarna jump portals or whatever well unless they just intentionnally eradicate small gang pvp which i doubt will happen your votes have a meaning and your opinions too i will listen to all of you carefullyi will not promise anything apart from this runned by logic and love for eve thing i know i cannot fix anything on my own i have lots of ideas but csm is not about bringing fancy ideas to ccp its about making eve players voices loud enough and organized enough for ccp to take them in accounti am willing to work as a part of the csm team i think thats how we csm as a whole could make meaningful changes happen and not only patches or fixes no more spoongate yet in front of a csm made of 00 powerbloc members how many nc candidates already willing to protect some of their priviledges at any cost i will make sure empire players of all kind are never forgotten nor put at a disadvantage i wont try to put some kind of player at a disadvantage on behalf though but it does not mean i will not try to act against some inconsistents priviledgesfeel free to ask for my opinion on any subject you want ill answer giving both my personnal opinion even if it is not really relevant csm is not about personal opinions and why i think csm should or should not bring the subject to ccpand just a quick reviews of some general subjects i think should be discussed at csm meetings if they are not already   supercapital balance jump bridges and capital fleet projection these matters are tightly linked  hi sec pvp wars neutral remotes  keep improving ui corp and pos ui and small fixes everywhere  low sec pvp bounty hunting killrights factional warfare  more hi sec incursions sanshas should aim for well populated systems make lvl5 missions useful again  dominion was meant to bring small alliance to 00 not to bring pets to big alliances something didnt work  eve should be more dynamic agents sending people in less populated systems is good office renting prices changing with system population is good sovereignty bringing more npc belts and sigs in a static system is utter nonsense jita station owners should higher taxes poor systems should have no taxes at all etc

peter is a committed guy he has worked on lots of sexy tools and stuff for finfleetim sure if he puts as much effort into being a csm rep as he does to improving the game for his mates then he will be a worthy addition to the teammy only regret there is only one peter powers in finfleethe has my personal unreserved seal of approval
top notch guy knows his stuff fully behind him
i will wait for the announced csm candidates before i reveal more stuff like mittanis open acceptance of botting where he encourages members to bot in venal and was the one who encouraged test to bot becausefrom moon goo exploits to encouraging botting what other eula violations are nc going to promote it would explain why he doesnt mention anything about botting in his campaign d
faking logs didnt work for teredrum son it wont work for you either
when you say open acceptance everyone assumes searchable by google or on kcom which neither have that fake quote you just made up nice try put up with evidence or shut up especially when the csm candidates are subjected to scrutiny by ccp so mittani is pretty clear on this so youre desperate to lie kalleedit the grammar in that fake quote no way matches mittanis writing style eitherthis would be a good fake quote at the very least goes to show how bad your grammar is kalle
like i said lets wait for the announcement first wouldnt want to put effort on a sociopath unless there is a reason
have you seen the crap they use as platforms i wouldnt worry too much theyll only be getting the votes they coerce or pay their bothandlers to give
youre trying to deflect from the liar you are that quote is 100 fake and you know it bismaru prove it or shut upthis quote is 100 true and im willing to provide proof after the announcement you cant prove me wrong bismaru
as we provedunfortunately even opposing a manifestly unstable candidate who later got herself thrown off the csm for an nda violation and doing so with well researched facts and cogent arguments did nothing if anything it helped raise her name recognition as you are attacking mittens with bull and idiotic spew you dont even have the whole facts and logic thing going for you i think hed make a great chair and i appreciate your work to get him elected keep this thread bumped
so let me get this correct you are comparing mittani to ankh well thats nice to know but i think most people were already aware of his incompetenceoh and i never once said he wasnt going to be elected if anything i have stuck by the fact that he will with 50k people brown nosing him only because of his ticker i dont doubt for a second he will get inhim having any influence on ccp thats a different story oh and as for the bumps you and mittanis lapdog are doing a fine job of bumping this thread maybe vuk should just run for csm again at least that way people will already have facts on how nc are uselessall this because ccp will nerf jump bridges hahaha  thats the funny part of all of this because in the end jump bridges will happen and there isnt a damn thing you can do so you agree that north korea aka nc are on a mission to control all of the csm seats so jump bridges stay intact so they can continue with rmt in peacethanks for confirming that as for me being a liar well doesnt really matter what i say anymore you just confirmed everything in this thread well done i guess theres no reason for me to post if you have just confirmed what everyone was thinking anywaygood luck having all seats in the csm but dont think it means anything
wow i never confirmed anything because i was sarcastically backing up my fake quote by you and yet youre twisting some fantasy in your head that im confirming something that isnt even true im just a regular joe blow with no position of power nor do i have sekrat access to anything so if you want to confirm your fantasy from some guy that has no influence whatsoever fine with me i dont care it goes to show how gullible you arethank you kalle demos  bismaru for confirming that it is indeed you by the way have you figured out what goonion means yet despite the obvious play on words
goonion  state of the goonswhere goons rp and pretend mittani is obama and they are in fact fighting for usa there is a thread about this already however derailing the thread because you are threatened by the truth isnt really a good strategyso lets go back to how nc want to control all csm seats so they can try to protect their jump bridges end pvp in 00 and punish anyone that isnt nc
the different nc candidates seem to be bickering more than they are agreeing of course that could just be some very coordinated sleight of handcan someone please explain what exactly is going on how many goonncwhoever else is with them candidates are there how many are working togethershed more light please
oh my god seriously how dense are you i already know what it means you really dont get sarcasm do you why dont you pm me ingame and we can have a fun conversation together for the hell of it if you wantdisclaimer i am not a director with sekrat access
i would rather be tied to a chair having my eyes scratched out
red dragon style
yes jump bridges need a nerf as do jump portal on titansremoving completly nojump frieghters dont need alteringive been thinking about both sides of this argument for a whilethe anwsers jump bridges need a range nerf and a reduction to one per systemfrom 2 this would mean gate travel would be required between bridges but it wouldnt make logistics take the micjump freighters should remain un altered i know that for loads of corps and alliances who live very deep in 00 they are the only way to get things into and out of system they already have to jump through hostile space to get them outtitan jump portal this should be nerfed to not allow capital size ships through or any ship with jump capability for that matter the reason for this is that if two fleets meet and one jumps in itself the other using the portal one would arrive full cap one with less that a thid unbalancing the combatin making these few changes 00 would be a balance between pvp and carebear
i know of six goons runningthe mittani vile rat helen highwater avalloc myself and apparently twig andberriesthe only two that are part of the whole 00 csm superblock megatakeover whatever project are the mittani and vile rat
i wont vote for mittani but i might vote for the box of melted snowballs
we can deliver on that let me put down some extractors to give you melted snowballs
im not really sure where the jump bridge suggestion initially came from i guess ccp looked at 00 and accepted the fact it is broken based on the csm minutes in the csm reports ccp suggested changing the following things1 jump bridges with no csm including vuk lau queen of nc against the idea of removing jump bridges completely2 number warfare where numbers control the outcomes and skill is unnecessary3 supercap lameage where supercarriers fill most roles and titans well enough are produced to the point where subcaps are getting dddand various other thingswhile ccp havent decided on what they will do they have already confirmed these are things they will look into and naturally got a positive reaction exception being nc now nc are against changes 1 and 2 because it directly affects them and their income jump bridges makes blobbing easier and number warfare makes nc in effect the powerhouse of 00 though not by skill in any way or formthe nc csm campaign is pretty funny though considering ccp have said feel free to check the last csm minutes to confirm this or anything i have written that 00 is broken and they will fix it when however is a different story nc may hold the most space naps and blues but when the minutes were revealed only nc and nc alts were against the issues and majority welcomed the proposed changes even vuk lau queen of ncyou cant really blame nc for hating pvp and wanting to make 00 safer the funny thing is not one of their csm has even commented on the fact that dust will affect sov perhaps they should read the minutes again  and stop focusing on jump bridge changes only
lolyou get my vote for that response alone
how will you go about doing these things
i cannot in good conscience vote for such a bad poster
well mittens my posts have been good enough for you to dedicate 25 of your alts lifetime posting energy into replying
itt if you dont vote for general windypops then you are literally the mittani
killer2 has my full supportafter playing together with killer2 for more then couple of years i had a chance to expand our internet spaceship relation into real friendship he posses everything csm delegate should have  not just the deep ingame knowledge but extraordinary interpersonal skills something without you cant achieve much in relation both with other csm delegates and ccphe will have full support of elvenlord and myself in order to keep continuity of 00 representatives in csmhe has a hot fiancUFFFDe too

to answer the many emails and private comments ive had about this eldaec is not an alt of mine or of anyone connected to me
enjoy the quiet slow death of your thread in jita park
lol and besides md should support an md elite manalapan
the only time you post in md is when youre running for csm so once a year like clockwork
trying to figure this out clearly goons can see your threads here arent the ceos of goon just kind of letting you do your thing also lets say you win and are coupled with the other goon candidates will you continue your obstinacy did i use that word correctly and voice your own opinion even if it does conflict with what the other goons want
rule 0 there is no cabalrule 1 you do not talk about the cabalyour cabal membership is thus revoked
on this board yes please remember that the goons have their own forumobstinate stubborn and independent are good ways to describe me and especially my postsif anything my goal is to bring an economics into the discussion to all of the csm proposals and meetings thats not limited to things that are purely economics but includes any discussion on any topic related to the game in that way its not a matter of being for or against any particular desires that the 00 block may have but a matter of changing the frame of discussion when the csm debates and presents those issues
there are many aspects of eve that are being discussed in other threads however one of the most important topics that has so far been neglected by most candidates is the topic of the economy of evethe economy of eve has always been central to the distinctiveness it is one element that has traditionally stood head and shoulders above its competitors those competitors have never been able to boast that their economy is even half way as sophisticated as the economy of eve however eve is losing that lead the economic model of eve is being increasingly crippled in important areas moon production imbalances planetary interaction unprofitably botting overly centralised market ore  ice products markets undermined by the belief ths some stuff is freequestion 1what is your policy to ensure the eve economy continues as the most sophisticated of any mmog against the steadily rising tidequestion 2assuming that ccp are effective in reducing botting what impact will this have on the economy and what would be your proposals ensure a smooth transitionadditional questions will be added later
this is all an attempt to make kalrand look awesome by having the most economic knowledge about eve than any of the candidates isnt it
my policy is simply that the economy of eve is the single most important part of this game in my overview thread i first posted publicly my overriding policyive talked extensively on the market discussion forum about every aspect of the eve economy from game mechanics to share sales to market manipulations to the ineffective mechanics that players have used in the past to secure investments in other playersin answer to how my policy would serve me on the csm it is simply the way i look at issues not merely how will this mechanic affect the part of the game it is designed for but also what is it replacing what is it crowding out and the mechanics that those second order effects have on the immediate economy and how those secondary changes will affect the manufacture use and demand curve for the components of and products of those items will be affectedive pointed out eleven points that would be examples of directly and tangentially economic issues that id like to see addressed but the real benefit that i think i would bring to the csm is the ability to model understand and see the effects of proposed changes and to bring an economic outlook to player proposals
heh this thread is the kalrand equivalent to asking what would you do to make 00 more awesome and waiting for the mittani to show up
the economy is the engine that drives eve almost every change to the game can be boiled down to an economic level  logistics balance sovereignty pos mechanics and pi all fuel the huge and intricate machine that is the eve marketplace i have a lot of experience in the industrial and economic game and its been endlessly frustrating for me to see ccp continuously drop the ball the pi launch was hilariously badly handled and in the last csm i dogged ccp about it to really drive home to them what happens when they dont do their homework over the course of my last term ive worked with a lot of finance guys in and out of the alliance to make sure that the feedback i give to ccp is wellinformed and accurate i dont intend to stop doing that

very cool idea it would need some testing to see how effective it would be but assuming it works as i think it would this would be a great way to help reduce the lameage of large fleet fights

real men just smartbomb raven outside of jita 44 and then live the rest of their life in null vov1
not sure if it should go to these extremes maybe something like restricting to belt rats only and giving 100 sec status update in hisec or even 125 only small fish there in belts anyway 75 in lowsec and 25 in nullsecin general worth exploring though sec status loss is too easy to regain currently
sounds pretty good to me how soon could we make this start happening
it is called wow mentality
you cant destroy other peoples assets in wow so it has no bearing on this discussion at allall my power  cost arguments are laid on fundamental principle that everything dies in eve if it cannot be destroyed it shouldnt exist and i wont defend it
i thought about laughing at your avoidance but i will give you the benefit of the doubt and reframe the questionif ccp offered a ship to the playing public sold through npc station or something that put out 100kk dps had billions of ehp and could tank active any sub 500man fleet meaning it was nearly impossible to kill but not totally would that ship be balanced so long as ccp had a sufficiently high isk pricea simple yes or no will suffice 
simple answer  yes if the costs were astronomical something in order of 5 trillion isk  and thats only if it was possible to blob kill it with 100 peoplei made a little graph that illustrates my way of thinking better than wordsplease visit your user settings to reenable images
overpowered is subjective here and people are looking at the whole thing from the wrong angle there are frigates even cheaper ones that have equal or better target selection while having worse combat avoidance abilitycombat avoidance ability doesnt mean much in frigate combat if you dont land in a heavy camp with a brick frigate or get caught in a bubbleif we are honest for a second the truth lies somewhere entirely different the dramiel may be the fastest frigate with still decent firepowernow compare that to the machariel a battleship that does outrun not only other battleships but does outrun the fastest battlecruisers and even most cruisers without using anything but t2 modules while having a solid battleship grade tank impressive damage output and flexibility in range if any angel ship needs a good whack with the nerfbat the machariel needs it first no doubtso what is different why is this absurdity of a battleship not seen as a problem the answer is simple the entry level barrier is much higher the mere peons cant afford it
same damage as other af or faction frigs  checkedsame hp as other af or faction frigs  checked50 or more faster than other af or faction ships faster even than inties  checkedno drawback  checkedthere isnt anything subjective here it is clear and simple
players have never had more isk than now the only barrier in regards to ships like the machariel is time spreason why the machariel is not a problem and why the cynabal is often glossed over as well is available counters within its classanything and everything subcapital goes against the mach  that is a lot of options cynabal can have everything subbsbc thrown at it which again is a ton of optionswhen you hit the frigatedestroyer level the amount of options dwindle to less than a handful if that which is why the dramiel represents the biggest problem
yeah it takes some isk to buy hull and submods sadly you only need tech 2 fitting to make them more effective than tech 2 which means you dont need so good fittings there imho its more like  0 a bit like marauders less modules to loot more effectiveness isk is tied to hull which explodes funnily enough salvage does not seem that good either common evelogic its ok to spend isk on ship as long as no one gets looti may be just bitterthese battlecruisers are hardly only alternative if you get creative it is actually good thing there is useful cost effective ships for newbies to fly imho
ephemeron i cant get it are you defending the dramiel in its current statedramiels dominate frigate pvpsome people arent dumb dont participate in blob warfare only and they want to roam solo and get some goodfights  fun no ship should dominate any ship class in evealso nothing should be killable only by ships fit specifically for this situation so no hurf durf but this counters dramiels this is not rigtbump and moar support for this idea please
drams should be nerfed

oh for the love of do you not understand that you need to do more than voice the same debunked bits of bull thatve been regurgitated again and again what are you people on rotation every few days one of you swings by and revises the same debunked nonsense that something is considered something doesnt prove that theres a problem with it or that the solution is total removal you can consider anything to be anything you want and you can consider your aunt to be a yeti that doesnt make her a sasquatch yet again again again again coalitionslarge fleets arose before jbs were ever created they are independent of them they will continue to exist after this because of the evils of math and the horror of human cooperation  massive fleets can be and are raised without the use of jbs the example of forward staging hqs in the invasion of the drf is something thats only been used what forty times now you missed itno i have rebutted nonsense some have spewed about how jbs provide total safety your bull is bull because its not true and you still cant offer an actual argument yes jbs are harder to camp than simple gates again so what nobody has denied that an armed pos is different than a gate but all youre doing is repeating the same basic fact over again and pointing angrily see its harder to camp a jb its not as easy its more difficult its of a different order of complexity its no  now why does that mean that we should remove them from the game
and just how would i be able to bring my capital ships into a cyno jammed system for refits i dont like this change
you wouldntyou sit on the toilets you assume whatever will happen
oh no dont hold your self back mr forum alt and finish iti help you a bitfinn lives in 00 and benefits from jump bridges the most you supposedly live in 00 and you also benefit from jump bridges the most in fact every established entity living in 00 benefits from jump bridges the most it looks like that everyone in 00 is happy and fine with jump bridges they came into 00 fight for their space upgrade defend and expand it their successful effort was rewarded i guess the only 00 entity that does not benefit from bridges are forum alts
oh wait so all the pilots traveled all the way to drf staging hqs without using a single jf i dont think so just because you had to travel a couple of jumps through low probably with a titan bridge after you were able to travel through jbs for the most part of the may does not mean that you havent benefitet from the jbs and thet they didnt support your invasion just because you keep ignoringrefusing to understand an argument does not mean there is non jb let you travel very safetly through your own space i would even say that it is more dagerous to travel through high sec this makes big space holding alliances quite invulnerable against small gangs it is a very simple argument you havent debunked it for some reason you just keep getting mad and talking mostly bs insteadthus my proposal still is or something in that directionin my opinion jbs should be removed and the jump drive of capitals and super capitals should be removed gate travel or nerfedthe timer system should be reworked when a tower is reinforced it can only keep up the big ff for 12h afterwards the ff shriks so that it only protects the tower after the ff has shrunck the anchored modules can be either hacked and stolen or destroyedbecause right now the defendingattacking entity can defendattack a target that comes out the rf and be 15 minutes later in a completly different corner of the eve universe and attackdefend the next target  problem with force projectionwhile it would still be possible to form large blobs it will be much harder to deal with a two front war it would create more strategic opportunities and make the supply lines more vulnerable no very safe jb routes anymorethis was and still is my argument you now can try to present some valid counterarguments or simply ignore it but please stop to bs
yet a lot not yet majority but getting there think that bridges does more harm than good in the grand scheme of thingsthe staunchest defenders of the teleporters are all members of bloat empires as far as i can tell so one can only assume that they feel their way of life is threatened by the suggestion which directly contradicts the arguments that it would have no effect on coalition size and suchbridges certainly have a place but as a supplement to regular gates not a complete replacement which is where they are nownullsec life should neither be easier nor safer than highsec life with hard work and cooperation it should be able to approach but never exceed  not with the null isk potential intact as it demolishes the riskreward conceptif the safety net is so important then one could always adjust the other side of the coin interference from the bridge network prevents pirates from establishing anything but the smallest of bases no more sanctums for the slow people moon yields are halved due to unfortunate chemical reactions caused by subspace radiation from bridgeshow about that then bridge bloat and be poor but 100 safe or accept some risks and be loaded
nope on the grand scheme of the things it is more and more clear that those who cry for jump bridges removal are mostly those who do not own 00 space wanting to nerf the game of others to make it easier for them to reach the cakeif i successfully fight for a space 40 jumps from jita it is fine that people who fought for their own space get tools to overcome extensive distances and so exploited riches as well as personal and corporate assets can be transported in reasonable fashioni understand it may make some gate huggers unhappy and i dont give a damn they did not fight for the space they are camping the idea that you put the alliance together fight over a system and manage to keep it just in order to turn your space into piwat enticement is ed
no it doesnt allow you to travel safely you must be completely stupid remember you still have to get that fleet together just because you can get to a destination quickly doesnt mean that you will get there quickly jb routes are not very safe can you stop your bs
signed  we didnt have them back in the day jump bridges and 00 was fine  more than that it was dare i say it fun we actually had to travel around and you know occasionally fight our way through 00do it ccp
csm all owns carriers or simply lives in that donotbubble area truth is you will  over so many 00 residents trying to make some isk or simply get their stuff around powerblocks already have their titans jumping in fleets and freighters all over 00 they could care lesspeople usually cant be bothered to light a cyno let alone do a few carrier jumps you think putting more emphasis on logistics will make 00 more funor let me put this simply 00 is barely pvp between blobs now its going to be no pvp barely better than empire pve and griefing small people doing logistics
while we at it why not just remove all jbs and stargates from 00 make some random unstable wormholes that link all 00 areas together randomly with occasional wormhole to lowsec  highsecalso new module to titan or what ever wormhole generator produces wormhole from 00 to anohter 00 system if theres a special wormholecyno on the other end wormhole stays up for 15min and is bidirectional and free to use for everyone also this wormhole is easily scannable or needs to be put near systems star also carrier is the largest ship that can move trough this holerest of the jump capable ships stays as they are starmap stays as it is with all 00 stargates removed and routes removed that would mixup the bucket of tears and overhaul the null as we know it if you have to overhaul null overkill itor what ever  its not that im lazy i just really dont care
these are your arguments really so everytime i say something you will simply say no it is not true and you are stupid

i am always shocked when players build sand castles in their sandbox game so insolent
just came back from a long hiatus bought my first kronos to start making plex money and was immediately smacked in the face by the fact that rails are still bad in fairness i know my skills still suck a bit for the kronos and the new ship is a learning process for me this doesnt change that hybrids are still a mediocre weapon system this issue is old like ancientthere isnt much that i can say about it without writing a book thats been written many many times for years now hybrid weapons just feel bad to use and the ships that specialize in their use are suffering as a result i trimmed as much fat out of this post as i possibly could to get down to that bare statement hybrids simply dont feel good to use in almost any situation
afk piloting in any kind of hauler is just a good way of serving your ship up for brunch i fully support the proposal of swapping velocity for agility
agillity or whatever but make freighters look less like gigantick ultra slow easy ganking bricksthere are two activities ive tested and cant do them for any reward you can awford mefreight or mining with something less than an hulkfranckly whats the puropose of those activities in eves universe nothing moore sleeping than those ones
sorry miss i dont really care weather its easier on the devs or notwhat i care about when flying my charon is not being gangedi would be nice to fit a couble of warp core stabilizers and other defensive modules and rigsactually it dosent make sense at all that we cannot fit freighters  allmost every other ship can be fitted
point taken but i could settle for a small improvement that would be easier to implement for now many wars are won not by blitz tactics but by small incremental steps that eventually lead to your goal by this way you can also avoid overdoing it we already have at least one detractor in here who says that this single light step is too much
id like the idea of having mines to deploy but i dont really see the point in doing so if they will disintegrate after 5 minutes i think stealth bombers can do the same job just as wellid be all for proper mines that u can deploy for a long period of time these could have many uses that cant be done with current mechanicsand sure make them 00 only thered be no end to all the crying in highlowsec
could be cool to have mines backsupported

as it stands the owners of t2 bpos are making billions of isk uncontested and practically hold a free monopoly on the t2 marketthe problem is it costs less to make a bpc of a t2 bpo then it does to invent a t1 bpc into a t2 bpcsolutionrequire the act of copying a t2 bpo to require 150 value scaling upward to 400 with the difficulty of invention chance of the datacores it costs to invent said t1 bpcie it costs more to now copy a t2 bpo then it does to invent a t1 bpc but you will always get the bpcthis should at least help those who invested the sp towards invention to gain a small instead of negative profit on invention of items that currently have t2 bpos outalternate solutionremoval of t2 bpos owners of these bpos have profited enough on these this will help the invention marked substantially at the cost of a very marginal amount of whiningalternate solutionreseed t2 bpos and use the invention idea for t3 upcoming invention is a great idea its just unfortunate that theres no profit in it especially with all the sp required for it

you are probably better off submitting a bug report than to raise this via csm
yeah i cant imagine this is the way the game is supposed to work if it is then i support changing it so stealing from the mission can causes the player to be flagged
iUFFFDve just updated the first message
we already have jump drives if your suggestion is more jump drive capable ships people might be okay with that what you are asking for is bad game design
ok if you think is bad all comments are welcome but please explain why it cant work this is good or this is bad are not argumentsexplain yourself thanks
i know its just a game but your proposal doesnt hold any realismthe only way to accomplish it is to put jump drives on all shipsthink about our galaxy our real life galaxy alpha centauri is the closest system to us and its a mere 437 light years away that translates to 2763636 au a raven at 3 ausec would take 255 hours to get there an obelisk would take over 100 hoursedit yeah i didnt read all the posts goes to show the brilliance of other posters
problem one biggest problem the way eve gets around the multiple shard thing is by breaking up the galaxy into systems this allows systems to float between processors to balance the load currently if you fly from one system directly to another system by warping you will remain in the system you started in and never arrive at the other system and that would require a loading screen and possible the transfer of all of your information from one node to another node this would be a huge problem to overcomeproblem two ccp does not want people to be able to access jove space this mechanic would allow people to access jove spaceproblem three this mechanic would allow people to wander through deep space something that decreases player interaction this and some mechanics things ccp and many players are against as can be seen with the removal of deep safe spotsproblem four it should take a silly long time to get from one system to another at warp speed if it didnt it would be a bad mechanic if it did it would be a bad mechanic
agreed there are wrecks already created for many of the ships ive seen them in plexes and missions put them in game but we should also have an option to not render them similar to drones for heavy load situations
this this is not a good idea why maybe because half or more of the reward of a mission comes from looting and salvaging the wreck and how do poeple do that they complete the mission then warp to a bookmarked wreck and salvage everything but what if wrecks continue flying they have to chase them aroundthen ill ask you a question whats the use of a noctis salvaging missions just salvaging missions if wrecks are flying away from your bookmark what do you do will you chase them really in a sluggish noctis if they dont slow down until they desappear they probably are still faster than youthats why i wont support this proposal modify this point and ill maybe think about it
hmmm clearly i didnt read the entire post this part of the idea is bad
then how about if this part of the idea is scrapped and replaced with quickly decelerating main wrecks while the bits fly off that way it wont look so wierd when a frigate going 1kms it doesent look so wierd when it suddenly has no momentum but it will also allow for salvage operation to not cover a hundred cubic kilometersthanks for pointing it out i didnt realize that that would be a salvage problem till you guys mentioned it

discussion now both ships are useless in pvp unless only being augmented to a fleet as dps even then they are uselessadd a second mid slot no questions asked just do it
i agree 100these ships need to have 2 mid slotsa prop mod and a pointcurrently in eve every ship needs a propulsion mod especially a ship unable to mount a webmay get away without a prop mod but they often use a web and a pointthese ships have far far far less ues than the other ships of their class and there relative power is not anough to offset thisa retribution is not signifgantly better than any other assault frigate to warent its in ability to tackle or take advatage of its speed its ship class gives itthe amar destroy fails as an anti frigate plat form due to tis inability to keep a ship eather pointed or within range these ships have no use in a fleetat most the destroyer is used to do level 12 faster until the person can fly a cruiserthis needs to be fixed
if anything give them an extra low
to the csm candidates who get voted inthe following limits should be put in place no more than 2 pilots from the same corp or alliance can be seated members on the csmbenefitsthis will prevent from any singular corporation or alliance from having control over the csm ie be able to pass the issues they want vs what the community wants
you seem to be confused as to what the csm can and cant doyou should probably read up on it as i think your estimates of their abilities to change the game are a little more than wrongthey cant dictate game changes merely suggestions which usually get shelved in some way and or seriously altered by the game devs when they finally go through them basically a corp or alliance could have every member of the csm and the game probably wouldnt be altered at all from the way you see it now
the csm is useless so who gives a  who the members are

yes please
lol what started out as a rough idea on hybrids is coming together quite nicely tbh lovin peoples opinions about this good and bad so keep posting especially if you can back ur criticism up with something rock solid numbers and logicalrational explanationsthinking of fleet fights and the limitations of blasters vs rails i dont think the changes proposed to hybrid ammo and their damage profiles should be either blaster only or railgun only but the way the bleedthrough is calculated should be tied to the ammos range ill be crunching numbers to support this soon bt in the mean time plz post ur thoughts comments criticisms and ideas cheers
endeed in real world at leastrailguns are a very special weapon system that uses energy to propulse the ammo but it doesnt loads it on other kind of energy than the one related to the speedmass of the same ammo wich can make us think this simplykinetic for the mass speedimpactthermic acumulated energy by the mass with speed delivered at the impactbut alsoexplosive  whenever youve used real guns you know that you can get explosive charges or piercing charges just by choosing different materials the explosive effect is a calculation between the densitymass of the employed materials the speed induced and the targets resistance techsso the piercing effect is not unreal or eves impossible and the different types of dmg including em is perfectly rp its just a matter of ccps will
okay i think ive found a nice balancing point for railgun long range and short range ammo typesive compiled this using bs fleet examples as most sub cap large scale fleet engagements tend to use alpha strike bssmy proposal is a 5 bleedthrough using t1 railgun turrets and a 10 bleedthrough using t2 railgun turretsthis is in conjunction with t2 railgun ammo an additional 3 bleedthrough per skill level of railgun specialisation what this means is maxxed skills and a balanced railgun bs fit using a rokh for this example short range alpha is around 2600 using t2 ammo and 1500 using long range ammoas everyone whos looked closely at railguns vs artillery the differences are rather largehowever with my proposed bleedthrough railguns would have a bleedthrough of at max 25 using an example fleet consisting of 20 or so railgun bss short range alpha is around 52000 where as a comparable ranged arty bs would be around 150000 25 of the railguns alpha would bleed through to armour  13000hpusing a sensible fleet setup maelstrom lowest resist armor and hull ehp works out to be around 25000hpnow although this wont pop a maelstrom from a first volley alpha strike alone railgun rate of fire is considerably faster than artillery so requiring a second volley to finish off a target is not out of the questionit can be argued that logistic support may get to the targeted ship before a second volley is received although rof could possibly defeat initial repping cycles the same typical maelstrom 20 man alpha fleet would have a comparable alpha of 150000 able to alpha most buffer fit bss off the fieldexample fleet sizes were chosen to show the average tipping point where combined alpha would be just enough to instapop ships the general fleet doctrine when it comes to alpha fleet setupsthe 20 man railgun bss using this concept wont instapop bss through pure alpha alone it does demonstrate the ability to penetrate through its main tank enough to defeat a ship using the bleed through conceptthe same railgun bs setup at long ranges would require a ship number increase of 75 to achieve the same results but at an optimal of twice the short rangeit can be argued that no other long range alpha setup can achieve this recementing railguns as the optimum long range alpha shipbtw i am sorry for the wall of txt just plz read it entirely b4 criticising it in one sentence thankyouplease

doing what exactly what have you been doing all this time what does that mean did you cause  fix the bootini thing
lol big question i started of as a miner in celestial horizon corporation joining their empire combat arm and fighting in a number of wars vs bdcisharks mercenary frigatesforces dvn votf before moving to 00 and basing in vngju in feythabolis where i initially ran the ice mining department and flew in and fced local defense gangs in more wars like the 5 and a number of other wars after the formation of ascendant frontier  ascn where i was a member of teh high command i got promoted or was that demoted into running parts of our pos defense and industry supply chain running freighter loads of passive targetters from empire to 00 after building them in high sec was involved in the logistics for most of clss outpost deployments as well as the titan deploymenti became the ceo of cls after the collapse of ascn and the retirement of cyvok it was my job to oversee the evacuation of feythabolis after brokering a final surrender and ceasefire with blacklight we then moved to the dorne regions where i handed over the ceo to samuraijack when i became a dev and my characters got renamed and i was no longer allowed to associate with my previous corp mates on an ingame level i moved my toons into an altcorp that i had had hanging about and turned it into a small scale production corp that grew to run a reseach pos and invested heavily into capitalship bpos researching them and running endless copies for sale i also build tech 1 ships for sale from this corp mainly battleships and battle cruisers but some other ships as wellwhen i left ccp i reestablished my contacts with cls and rejoined the corp while still keeping the other corp running as a smaller going concern and isk generation enterprise while in cls i became the sales manager for the tech 2 department for about 18 months this involved the selling of all the produce from cls controlled tech 2 bpos and the results of their invention onto the markets in jita ammar oursleartsp and rens as well as some sales into drone regions i did some experiments with wormholes and such as it was one of the features i was involved with just before i left ccpafter this i got a bit of eve burnout and left cls back to my small corp and took a break i returned about 4 months ago and have been very active again my joy of playing is as strong as ever again i have refocused on industry and have committed deeply into pi high sec based at this time but that may be changing soon hopefully and have also started doing some more market manipulation and sovereignty structure developmentactually fix bootini no but i was one of the 2 qa people on shift when it was deployed the other being ccp mindstar when it was discovered i remember having to call my boss at 1am and wake him up but he went back to sleep thinking it was a practical joke so i called in the cto and did most of the organising of the fix effort until higherups where called in even them ccp mindstar and i where often consulted on the state of the issue as we had the most experience with it i think ccp mindstar and i did a 36 hour straight stint discoving the issue from reports on the forums and in the irc channels finding the actual circumstances of the issue and breaking a number of ccp forum posting rules around not modifying players posts which we where doing when someone posted incorrect information on the issue as it began causing additional problems with the false information going round i was later slapped on the wrist as i broke the rules but as i did it for the right reasons all was forgiven i even hillmar the ceo buy ccp mindstar and i a drink later to thank us for our quick action

would you articulate what some of the small but muchneeded game improvements are also would you spell out the metrics and methedologies you use to evaluate whether something is a problem or notcheers
there are many small but muchneeded game improvementslets start with the ui improvements have been made on that front but far from enough fleet management ui still sucks not fleet finder the fleet management itself the market window well is barely functional come on no way to see my listed orders and their price without opening the wallet the overheating ui is pathetic feedback is delayed buttons are extremely tiny and easy to missthose are exemples of small ui items that wouldnt take too long to modify to significantly improve the gaming experiencethen theres the game mechanics themselves war declaration costs and timings and end terms lots of thinking required probably not that much on the implementation side cosmosfaction items that have 0 uses not even fitting benefits mothership aka supercarriers rebalancing black ops rebalancing pet peeve of mine capital ship selfdestruction timers launching multiple inventioncopyproduction jobs at once corporatealliance bookmark sharingthese are exemples of things theres a url
thanks for the reply if i may i would like to press you on the metrics side a little more how do you know that there is a problem with black ops or logoff timers on capssupercaps what specific evidence would you use to conclude that they have been fixed assuming some changes were made
theres several factors to indicate black ops are a problem first theres very few of them flown i rarely encounter them personally plus qen data says theres very few of them flown and built and i seem to recall we got data from ccp about them last term but i didnt know that when i thought they were broken then theres eft and comparing their capabilities with that of other ships plus my custom fitting tool a substitute for eft comparing the performance difference between most black ops both offensively and defensively doesnt match the value difference with their t1 counterpartsi dont subscribe to the view that a ship 6 times more expensive need to be 6 times more powerful obviously but the low usage combined with frankly pathetic overall capacities for a t2 lead to a perception it could use buffingnow its also relatively subjectivein theory a ship 20 times as pricey as a t1 but with a jump driveportal could be worth it the fact is that it isnt or it would be used pfor logoff timer on caps theres no data to be had really its impossible to sink a siegedtriaged ship before it selfdestructs now in a one on one situation or even 3 against 1 for that matter if the ship is reasonably tanked i could go with eft data to make my point but in this instance theres really no arguing thati appreciate that self destruction can be a valid point to deprive another of a killmail and thereby deprive them of a potential tactical advantage of knowing your fit but when it ceases to be a decision to be made that has consequences at some point in time but an automatism when you know youre going to die and theres nothing the other can do to prevent you from killing yourself before you do it yourself its not much of a choice anymoreid rather see self destruction happen at a time where the person still may have a fighting chance and decides to make it a gamble either initiate selfdestruct now or keep trying to fend off the attackersright now no such choice has to be madeas for the metrics to answer is personal experience eft my personal eftlike toolwhile i understand your question i would think the most valuable question would be why do i think a player needs to be prevented from selfdestructing at will in the first place and thats where balance and gameplay issues arise and where the question of fun reward etc enter and theres no putting figures on that just weighing all pros and cons ie under what circumstances is it acceptable for a pilot to deprive another of the fruits of their labor a killmail in this instancemy job as a csm member arguing that kind of issue is to make sure the data discussed represent the facts and then arguing both sides of the question to make sure no decision is made in ignorance and without having carefuly weighed everything
your reply on bos was the kind of thing that i was looking for and you intuited the deeper question i was asking about selfdestruct timers although the answer seemed a little wishy washy p  so far you have been the most specific and i appreciate thatthanks for your time and good luck with your campaign
hello mittaniyou accidently forgot to answer my questions so i will summarize the most important ones1why do you think that the tradition of primary elections in goonswarm was bad and why you cancelled them to put yourself on 12why you threat kalrand with removal of writing rights andor kick out of goonswarm if he posts on goonfleetcom about his csm campaign3since you believe that you are cool and bright enough to think for all other goons is it not possible to let them at least elect the 2nd place or is it too dangerous considering the low popularity of vile rat4why do you support botting inside goon territory and do you plan to change that if you get elected for csmthank you for taking the time to answer concerns of the voters
i support this product andor service
fyi the mittani has no authority on sa only on goonfleetcom
i just want to know what your plan b is if you are unsuccessful as csm chairman if you unite the csm get it organized and still see no progress what then will you just say sorry guys i tried my best or will you do what needs to be done if after 6 csms there has been no improvement i think csm should be dismantled and the charade ended
thanks edited
the mittani is a spineless confused nerdhis tactic is to present himself as a strong leader when in fact he is not at all the fact that he is leading goons atm says something about the state of goons not the mittanis abilitiesgone are the romantic notions of  the system what goons have now is a calculating disturbed postteen snake who confuses napping the entirety of eve with being rational in a broken gamethis is a nerd who confessed there are exquisite pleasures to be had in griefing people out of this gamepeople who are obviously hilariously ed ofc
flattery will get you nowhere i have larping and a puppy to fill the void that you just cant hit right
this may be too hard for you so let me rephrase the mittani is an idiot and all who follow him even more
heh
ima pour a forty on the sidewalk for my  the mittanii suggest yall do the sameshonuff
did youwhether you wrote it or not it is interesting what this person said after the nullsec alliances gave up on the csm ccp started to listen food for thought isnt itperhaps negotiating with people in a game is a bit of a different animal than negotiating with professionals about their multimillion dollar company i mean is it surprising that folks at ccp did not jump when the null sec alliance leaders were ruling the roost of csm moreover whoever said what was attributed to you also gave no indication that they understood why ccp is beginning to listen to the csm i think more than a few people have a clue about what brought that on but then we read thisyeah do away with formal meeting minutes and just talk on skype i have to say i dont think you understood why ccp decided to start listening to the csm i have a hunch you need to do some thinking or you will be very easy for ccp to ignore i also think you would be well served to stop posting for your campaign and just tell your goons to shut up and vote for you remember no democracy just do what daddy tells you im sorry if this is insulting to goon players but they seem to be your view you apparently think your alliance will vote like you tell them and you dont even need to explain a thing about what direction you think the game should go ah yeah lets all believe that will work fine with ccp unfortunately history tells a different story null sec leaders who are used to snapping their fingers and having a thousand lemmings jump never accomplished much with csm it was only when the current crop of idiots took office that ccp started listening actually i dont nor does csm or ccp thanks but no thanksas for me im with one of the current crop of idiots who said
ooooooops too bad that helen highwater of csm5 already stated that most of the work and important dialogue with ccp came from the internal csm forums mail threads and private conversations
you realize that our directorate doesnt force us to vote for anyone in particular right our official support of a candidate boils down to a link on at the top of our forums once the polls open if we are running two candidates it gets more complicated if your username has an odd number you push one button if your user name has an even number you push the other button we dont hold voting ctas or fire the red pen people can choose to vote for someone else or not vote at all the official candidates just make it easier most eve players dont bother to vote at all our method just makes it as easy as possible for the common goon to do his civic dutywe used to run primaries the problem we had was that sometimes a guy that lost the primary wouldnt drop out this caused dumb goons to mill about in confusion and sometimes push the wrong button last time we managed to muck it up enough that we didnt win a seat at all just an alternate  this year we are making it as goonproof as possible by eliminating the primaries all goons that want to run are still allowed to do so the wont be kicked from the alliance or have their pods shot or anything nasty like that they just arent allowed to split the vote using goonfleetcom resources any goon who is actually interested in the election can easily find information about all the candidates here nulsec players are a minority some players in highsec want to make the game less fun for us purely out of spite so if we want to get any representation on the csm we have to work together we cant afford voter apathy or confusion if highsec players decided to band together and only vote for 10 guys rather than splitting their votes between every single eve player who has a passport and a wants a free trip to iceland then they would easily sweep the election every year organize a successful highsec heritage party and no nulsec player will ever be elected to the csm again
you dumbs heu were not voting for the nex wuphs world united presidence and humanity slavery are we we had enough with the last economic trashcrash shitscum are capable of thxno we dont just you are you trollin
dearest mittens if i werent voting for seleene i would vote for you are vile clue in bonus section here is why you want mittens on the csm marshall mittens is what ccp fears as a csm delegate i have 0 doubt in my mind that mittens will poast alot the thing is when mittens poast people pay attention matter of fact he draws alot of attention this fine neckbeard will have people f5ing articles forums and blogs like crazy as he exposes the hypocrisy that is ccp ccp doesnt like bad press and there is nothing more mittens enjoys than taking peoples dirty laundry showing it to everyone and then funning up with good gimmicks and tildes to humiliate his subject you can guarentee ccp doesnt want this im pretty sure they will tread carefully with mittens and be willing to work with him
wait hey mittens send me 500 million isk and i can get you into the csm
goons who do not vote properly will be purgedwere requiring a video of each pilot voting for our candidates unedited of course or they are expelled from the corporation
ifthis sigle point was true then id vote for this personbuthas you already know but not the whole mittens its not the truth
would you articulate what you see are the specific ccpcsm communication problems that need to be solved also using specific examples address both 1the times when previous csms squandered thier opportunity to solve these problems in the past and 2a couple of different ways you would have handled the situations cheers
seems obvious to everyone having 2 eyes and being able to read a minimum in english that comunication problems exist seriously take example on some threads existing since 2years now without any answer from ccpresulting from the same threads 2 different members of csm incapable to present something serious to ccp likemember one ho about this stuff seems doesnt worksmember two yes it does i mean it seems it doesccp ok so everythings fine whats next about jump bridgescertainly another candidates alt and a raging onei could ask you the same thing on the other sense even if i have nothing to win with could you seriously do it i dont think so or youre realy fool
how about when a ccp developer brings up the craptastic idea of removing jump bridges and not a single person on the csm says anything about it the whole idea of the csm as a stakeholder is a sham but the csm can be used to provide feedback on what the devs are thinking about the direction of their game if nobody tells them how stupid their ideas are they might just implement them
interesting campaignim intrigued by the reasoning to do good for all by getting some teeth onto the csm technical teeth in regards to haggling with ccpthe only question i got for the mittani is this what do you do if you find that the problem lies within ccp itself its internal communication and organisational structurewhat are you gonna do my thoughts here run along the lines of no matter what you do or achieve ccp itself is in troublei mean i dont believe you can change the corporate structure of ccp on the other hand i dont even think youll be able to get this kind of insight
so mittani fears free speech and primary elections on goonfleetcom because he thinks goons are too stupid to voteand what is the advantage of having 2 goon candidates that goons dont elected to candidate some other over 2 goon candidates that goons want to candidate some othermittanii think my questions have been to negative in the past i respect the fact that you dont want to answer any critical questions and favor questions by bootlicker alts that allow you to describe your greatnesslets talk about your achievements instead of asking critical questionscould you describe what your achievements are other then destroying the tradition of primary elections for your egoboost letting everyone in eve know that you think goons are too stupid to vote losing goon systems and ruining goons ingame in general
halp im being oppressed
who cares but you the goonswarm dont give a flip what other people think except goonswarm if you read
goons do they just dont want to lose their membership in fact the number of goons caring is so big that mr egoboost is afraid of free speech on goonfleetcom  not the behavior of a loved dear leaderthats what primary elections are for to find out what is goonswarms best interestno thats the new dear leader structure that mr egoboost just introduced by destroying the primarys but i dont expect you to know anything about how this was handled in the past since you are still relative new and only fed by dear leaders views
prove it that goons care about the csm election i dare to you prove it in fact theres two threads mocking the csm election on the goonboard announcing their notrunning for csm campaign youre a riot dudei want you to apply to goonswarm immediately and start campaigning that goons have a choice please do apply i certainly will not sponsor you thoughedit i am not new to goonswarm nice try buddy if anything im just a regular joe blow who will do what dear leader wants when im playing ingame right now he can go take a hike because im at work at the moment
according to your dear leader mr egoboost you are not intelligent enough to vote just listen to him when he tells you what buttons to click and you will do fine it requieres a certain level of intelligence to realize that you are beeing oppressed according to mr mittani most of the goons dont qualify for that level
so mittanis no different either anyways so i dont see your point goonswarm will follow the leader in a similar fashion that all scientologist members follow david miscavige bad comparsion since one organization actually has decency and the other does not as i state its in their best interest to keep winning harvesting your pain and frustration why because its fun youre just mad that youre like a two year old not getting his way screaming this is not democracy
no thanks the idea of wearing a sign that im too stupid to find a descent internetforum that does not cost dollars would embarrass me i said relative new not newi will respect that suum cuique but you should also respect that other goons dont want to play eve in braindeadmodedo you think that mr egoboost did well with this in the pastwere goons more or less powerful when they had primary electionsmaybe its possible that goons were winning more fights when there were primary elections
posting in a mittani thread
wow 10bux for permanent membership unless you are really dumb and get yourself banned in like 2 minutes because you spam lol every thread there is on something awfulagain im neither youre basing this off my employment history but youre still wrong keep flailingthats why we have squads where people can do whatever they want to do we dont even have call to arms like alot of alliances do because participation is voluntary and encouraged goons have choices you dont saythis isnt mittanis first time as ceo of goonswarm in fact this is his second time leading of course you know so little of the history behind goonswarm that youre just flailing and trying to impose some control over goonswarm which will not fly
look at this guy trying to get us to be offended by our own stupidity
i guess todays generation is happy to pay it but a lot of people who started using internet 20 years ago would never do it its not because the amount of money its on principle yeah but thats not the question the question was if you think that goonswarm did well in eve under the rule of dear leader mr egoboostwhat kind of control a lot of goons already started asking questions internally which is all i wanted to achieve
yes overthrow the notoppressive leader viva la revoluciUFFFDn
do what you want to do as long as what you want to do is follow the leaderits one thing to follow an fc in a combat situation or a leader on a strategic level that is agreed but being told how to vote about the direction of a spaceship gamei dont think goons are oppressed no one forces them to do this it is just amazing to me how many people are so eager to fill that submissive role for some other individuals gain we shall see how the votes come in ccp creates a game where you are immortal and can be whatever you want in this science fiction universe result thousands of people decide they would like to be storm troopers ruled by a selfdescribed ruthless manipulative metrosexual bastard not only ingame but even metagame i cant say i understand it but it is interesting
a bunch of like minded individuals follow another like minded individual we are literally all zombies now
what gain do you see someone getting out of being in the csm other than internet space ship celebrity status
what a tool
a few pages back i mentioned my concern that the issue might be one of managerial technique since based on some of what ive heard from past csms ccp doesnt appear to have any real best practices system at the coding level this might have something to do with the reliance on the flavor of the month scrumagile setup there might also be some issues with institutional memory or lack thereof since the firm has expanded massively in the past two years people like oveur and torfi have been there for ages but theres a lot of midlevel newdevs who have only been kicking around for a year tops this is my most serious concern that all of this  the backlogs the bugs the halfimplemented features the schizophrenic development cycle  is a symptom of a hidden disease that the reason why the csms have only gotten a few peripheral things done is that the underlying causes havent been identified or dealt with in which case its a simple matter heavy sarcasm for those who do not understand scare quotes of diagnosing the methods by which the dev teams interact and communicate or dont best practices and focus attention on that
have you worked out what this great big lie is that were supposedly being told yet because so far your entire campaign seems to based on raging against some massive elusive problem that youre not able to identify let alone solve just look how little clarity there was in your post above all i can gather is that youre really angry abouta the system you hate systemsb minutes you hate minutesb bringing in fresh talent with new skills to ccp god forbid that recruitments a good thingc some as yet undefined communication problem the precise problem here seems to change a lotoh and jump bridges youre very very angry about jump bridges if you really are such a fan of honesty mittens then practice what you preacha and admit youre doing this for political purposes
it is really really clearly obvious that his problem is that according to him the csm is ineffective and broken because it doesnt have enough power andor sway over what ccp does with evei mean say what you will concerning whether or not hes correct or comment on whether you believe electing him will solve anything but you absolutely cannot claim that hes being vague or that he hasnt identified the problem hes rallying against
i like the sound of that disco hulk my support goes to you and kalrand
i feel like if theyre both elected theyll be staring intently at each other every time they meetif there were disco hulks around i think such situations would be somewhat diffused
so thats the solution then bring in the disco hulks
goons are scammers i wouldnt have a scammer in the csm  and even if he says everyone else lies doesnt mean he will be able to do anything better this seems like only a measure to get voted up for even if i think i agree with him
what other possible reason would one announce ones candidacy for an election if not to draw attention to it and garner votes
you are playing eve online right scamming is part of the game sos lying stealing undercutting your market opponents kamikaze attacks assassination spying contract dodging and sheep futteringmittens is glorious leader glorious leader is always right glorious leader will lead us to an eve with no glitches or lag glorious leader will make hisec and nullsec come together and dance the dance of love with lowsec in a glorious meeting of the minds glorious leader will make all right again forgot what i was going to originally post
mittans i have one questionhow do you propose to overcome the risk of ccp simply not telling you or informing you of certain projects because they are aprhensive of a negative reaction of such an antagnistic csmi also enjoyed the 10 ton hammer write ups may not agree but you do know the game and you would be an active csm rep
this is an outrage goonswarm is a proper christian spaceguild and we would never break any of the ten commandments
everything you think you know is a whitewash and none of us outside of the csm and ccp will ever know the exact truth has the csm ever lived up to its stated purpose we catch mere glimpses of the true answer but signs indicate to the negativei believe this man can add value to the csm i have never known him to lie in the time i have known him irl i believe his past experiences will be a benefit to all causes as the man is trained to lay out such causes in a logical manner and then present them to a person in power you will not find anymore more qualified to give you the straight story and you will not find many people that care more about this game if you want to know where the dirt lies you need to look under the grass
bump
standing again matecool and good luckaka the friendly bump
can i infer from the second part of that sentence that you deem popularity as reason enough to proposefight for changes to precieved flaws if not then would you briefly describe how you evaluate something is flawed in the first place i am more interested in how you think then necessarily what you think on specific issuescheers
if priority were determined by how many whine posts have been made about it on the forum eve would be a very different game what i and others on the csm have been doing is that if something pops up either because its posted publicly mailed to us privately or because ccp asks us for our opinion about something is turn to the people around us  in my case corp mates and many friends all over eve and ask them what they think of it if thats not enough some crowdsourcing may be useful trebor has been busy with this see ah it is by no means based on popularity
do you actually believe in the csm the nda and the role you have is neither showing any of the transparency to us players as it was supposed to ccp likes to present changes and ideas as we have discussed this issue with csm  but eventually they end up doing what they want with it anyway if you guys agree chestbeat if you dont at least they have discussed itmy point isi usually agree with most opinions you have regarding capitals sov and unlike the whiner early in this thread i too think that a change to logistics is necessary perhaps by making local production easier for example both for supercap production as well as capital warfare  but i dont believe in the csm in fact i have proposed in these forums that ccp should put those resources to better use hire a professional spokesperson andor communicator that can be a dialogue between players and ccp not so much for ideas and changes but he could rather be presenting ccps ideas to avoid the usual misinterpretations when ccp does a changeso tell me what can csm really do apart from being a decoy for ccp to point at to get less angry customers on their asses i see more issue with why i should vote than who i should vote for so my initial statement stands do you actually believe in the csmedit oh and out of curiosity do you want any changes to lowsec at all or think its fine as is and if any changes which and why
do i believe in the csm in my own way yes but i do not believe that it can do what some seem to expect from it in csm 4 i was really optimistic but after the iceland visit and talking to many vets i grew suspicious the confrontation with oveur in june the whole 18 months thing shook the place and if i am to believe some its still rippling out through ccp in december again the incarna talk caused a lot of rabble which i am confident will turn out to have been a good thing so i do believe that the csm is necessary to provide a voice to ccp to let them know when we think they are screwing up and get them back down to earth when visions of awesomeness take them adriftthe resources spent on the csm are trivial compared to the cost of running a scrum team for one development cycle so i disagree that those could be better spent the csm provides a unique and relatively cheap perspective and should be used as much as possible by ccpon the topic of lowsec i think a lot can be done by introducing a more suitable gradient of riskreward for missions complexes moons et cetera worm holes offer a great way of getting in and out of lowsec while bypassing the usual camps and this could be expanded upon by for example adding more connections between hisec  losec  00 for many people the thought of jumping into a 4 and losing your ship immediately after uncloaking because there happened to be a hictor  friends hugging the gate is quite appalling
mr sokrateszwith all due respect to taking the time and effort out of life to pursue change in a virtual world i was sorely disappointed at your lack of performance and quality of work in csm5the above noted quotes were selected out of context for a particular reason we would imply a group curiously and on many occasions i found your lack of feedback and attendance to csm meetings without any prior warning disconcerting at best and downright irresponsible at best true emergencies arise and bills need to be paid a quick notation to the team advising of such is that that was asked and consistently ignored such actions or lack thereof raise concern as to your belief in accountabilityfurther to this implying that you are available any time and through various methods is in my humblest of opinions a load of steaming warmed leavings of a male bovine if i recall correctly quite a lot of initiatives were launched and completed during csm5 none of them were either championed or actively supported by you of course this perception could be way off the mark and incorrect depending on whom you speak with however bear in mind that perception is everything and not being out in the spotlight is highly noticedif i may be so bold and using purely hypothetical coulda shoulda woulda i would have fired you from csm5 on the grounds of poor perfomance lack of accountability and general shenanigans that were in my view simply an effort to derail and disuade the progress and gains made by the other members of the teamyou sir most certainly do not have my votewith regardsjw
u mad about spoongate still
rionnag didnt join aaa this season imo the outlook is grim for sokratez
im wondering what are your plans on this point has ive already mentioned it but i do understand some general words must be said for the meanwhilewhat is your opinion on this precise point knowing youve already worked with some former csm people and for someone like me when he reeds csm repports where you can read one of them asking ccps position about rails and the other ones aswering its ok or all alike seems there are some comunication trouble between you people isnt it youcsm
what about industry  and the crazy crazy fluctuation in the price of ore  dont you think players should have more info about internal ccp decisions that seem to affect all vastly
got a question for you and i feel this is very bad game mechanic that i will be asking all the csm canidates how do you feel that reps are balanced shield and armor as such should armor be like shield applied at the start or should both be applied at the end shield is obviously the better rep as the alpha is king in eve at the moment would making reps the same help balance this out in your eyes
supporting a great guy who really does knwo a lot about the game
importantly this mans name is an anagram of partridge
must say i really enjoyed your blog
campaign blog at
can you elaborate on making local configurable low sec balancing supercaps what ideas for these issues do you favor
customizable local should give you an answer on the firston lowsec and balancing supercaps i will release multiple blogposts tomorrowcy
and those of us not in the know would like to be a part of thatexpose and shame if there are actual examples that is i wouldnt know
i am wondering what things you have done in 00 from what i have heard you are mainly a highsec and industry guy and do not have much experience with pvp please prove me wrong have you been in any major 00 corps or even small onesalso what are your plans for improving the games ui i am really interested
would you be so kind as to explain the metrics and methodologies you employ in evaluating what mechanics designs etc are in need of revamping i am not so much interested at the moment in how to fix xyz answers but more interested in how you determine something is a problemfeel free to use your desire to push for iterations and design changes listed in your original post as working examples to illustrate your processcheers
this guy here has the right question make sure you all quote him a lotnobody on the csm is qualified to have an opinion on pvp unless theyre a pvper or 00 unless they live there and have done so for an extended period of time
i have been a member of sane industries currently part of initiative mercenaries for over 2 years and before that leap a closely associated corp and have been mostly living in nullsec for almost all of my time in eve my personal preference is for smallgang pvp my circumstances are such that it is difficult to devote a big block of time to an eve session particularly after getting elected to the csm which is a total timeblackhole so i dont get to pvp as much as i would like the result has been that i have gravitated towards logistics roles helping keep my corpies who are excellent at pvp fighting because this can be done in short active sessions and longer semiafk ones while i work on rl stuffi also have a highsec alt on another account that does logistics industry and an occasional bit of tradei personally would like to see a rewrite of the ui that for example addresses how eve is going to handle nextgeneration devices such as ipadstyle tablets with touchinterfaces as part of that i would some form of userwritten addons ala wow to leverage the resources of the playerbase in a similar way that the api permitshowever for that to happen will require a highlevel commitment from ccp on the scale of the incarna project in the meantime i am concentrating on pushing for more resources for small tweaks to the ui that make life better for large groups of players ie good bangforthebuck lowhangingfruit by doing things like prioritization crowdsourcing for example the ui low hanging fruit proposal and encouraging devs to engage with the players as ccp karkur did during her menu revamp projectwhile i am more than happy to inflict my opinions on anyone foolish enough to ask for them my work on the csm is not about getting ccp to do what i personally want but trying to help ccp allocate their limited resources to things that provide the most benefit for the players thats what all the crowdsourcing was about
elitist much i would say that null citizens shouldnt be asked about anything not related to rat balance since that and forming huge fleets is all they are good for  see how that works want pvp advice ask a veteran pirate no one else even comes close to the same level of understanding of the factors involved hint blobfleet combat is not pvp it is a fc contest
history shows that these are not incompatible outcomes
strange how all but one of the current csm seem to completely disagree with youcare to back your asserion up with some facts
is there any proof for any of this searching real genius i cant find any proof of that and wiki articles wont count as proof for well anything encyclopedia anybody can edit and all thathow is this done  from a mathematical standpoint just curious im not quite sure that i like the imagery here this seriously smacks of an old school roman politician getting peoples votes by handing out their winnings from the most recent conquest why are you running a lottery in your csm post because its the new thing to dothe botting issue that has been brought up and your solution to it every account has a resource extraction license is what other games eq2 comes to mind vitality have been doing to try to smooth the difference between hardcore and casual players it may work it may not i think it would personally but this isnt about me since this is the flavor of the month lets address this i would like for you to expand ona how an activity system would work i have activity in system x so i keep sov in it how is that any more fair than the current system where if ive got the activity to defend it i keep itb organic blob limitation i understand the idea diversify have tankdpshealers but how is that going to work and why should an entity be forced to essentially turn people away from fleets and what stops an entity from having say 2 or 3 or 10 fleets in the system to avoid penalties while were at it we should drop the cap on people in an alliancecorpc adjustments to forceprojection and logistics which are not the same thing and which have subflavorsd improvements in manufacturing infrastructure to reduce the dependence on the jita titc and d are intertwined  how do you have a lack of forceprojection which is a bad thing i guess and still have the logistics that would allow an improvement in manufacturing infrastructure in nullsec im sorry if this comes off a bit harsh but eve is a game im passionate about and id hate to elect someone that im not 100 sure about
read the minutes if you want to know what trebor knows about this game it should be obvious to anyone paying attention
as an average voter i cant be bothered with sifting through large amount of text on my own can somebody highlight the relevant parts
would you really see ccp scrap all the work put into dominion for another sov expansion from scratch bearing in mind that they completely failed in their objective the first time to break up large fleets and structure bashing from the original sov system and instead made the issue worseseeing as how a sov rewrite is highly unlikely what are your suggestions on adjusting the existing sov system structures and all to better prevent lag and huge fights
so what exactly is the problem with logistics and what is your fix
well a big part of being a csm is bringing player concerns to ccp so the starting point for individual issues is usually the forums though players also contact me directly typically im looking for issues that are generating significant support that are interesting to me and look like theyve got a shot at getting done big bangforbuck helps a good example of that kind of thing would be the learning skills proposalhowever that just gets an issue into the csm backlog where good ideas go to die as some might say so the next step is organizing the backlog by crowdsourcing prioritizations and this is something ive spearheaded in csm5the prioritizations give our advocates at ccp ccp xhagen and ccp diagoras some useful metrics to point at when they argue for csm issues to be added to the expansion release schedules and i think there is significant evidence that they have been useful for example the november prioritization got a lot of support from ccp login banners news items and 3458 players participated and during the december summit ccp took some of the top playerranked items and ran a prioritization game with csm where they added to the mix their estimates of how much development time each item would take some of that feedback helped team bff when they were choosing what potholes they were going to try and fix during the next expansion development cycleif im reelected to csm ill make sure the crowdsourcing and prioritization keeps getting done
what are you going to do about nullsec jumpbridges more than last year i hope
thanks for the reply if i may i would like to ask a follow up questioncan i infer from your statement regarding likes on forum raised issues and the crowdsourcing initiative that you undertook that your main metric for analyzing issues and therefore pushingraising with ccp is based on populist desire in other words change supported by the masses is always a necessary change obviously assuming that it is even in the realm of possibilityhope that is clear i have not had my morning coffee yet cheers
obviously i would tend towards the minimal set of changes that would reasonably be expected to achieve the desired goal seleene would be the person to ask as to whether the complete dominion sov plan as opposed to what actually made it into the game would achieve thatmy opinion regarding activitybased sov systems is hardly unique the problem with structure bashing is that it tends to concentrate large numbers of people into a small area at a single point in time which is of course a recipe for blobs  and thus lagon a more global level lag will never be tamed until sov and combat mechanics are altered so that the fleetsizefleetpower curve starts to flatten out when you reach a certain fleet size so that yeah you can have your huge blob but the best use of your resources is to divide your forcesbut the bottom line is the ccp game design staff gets paid to come up with the best solutions to these problems as a csm i have consistently argued that no matter what they come up with they should make their plans public when they are still just on paper so that player experts can tigerteam the proposals and point out potential pitfalls i have also pointed out that csm may be ideally suited to the task of organizing playerexpert focus groups to provide this kind of feedback
i believe that both of these questions stem from the nullsec discussion during the december summit which has been often quoted out of contextthe context of that discussion was mainly the issue of force projection  the ability to project force across the map and be back home in time for tea any particular change was discussed in the context of a package of changesso if ccp told me that all that they were going to do was nerf the hell out of jumpbridges id object strenuously on the other hand if they presented a package of changes one of which was a jumpbridge nerf i might consider it reasonable but as mentioned in an earlier post id strongly urge them to let the players tigerteam the proposal because no game design survives contact with the players ccp often forgets how players take every quirk in the game and drive it to the bleeding edge of insanity and its far easier to do the first iteration on the madness when its still on paperwith respect to logistics similar concerns apply for example if ccp decided that hauling stuff from jita to nullsec needed to be made more difficult an obvious question i would ask might be what compensating changes are going to be made to make local manufacturing easier
you got one of my two votes available for sure edittotally forgot to ask might even fall under nda dunnodo you think ccp has internal communication and organisational problems and that the csm is able to address those for the greater good or even should try to achieve something on that field as you pointed out in one of your blogs the company grew at a neckbreakingspeed which imho just has to cause frictions and inefficiencies on several levels
i like allot of your ideas both here and in other posts you have made what follows reads somewhat like a rant but it is not directed at you in particular but i would be interested in your comments and relates to this quoted portion of your post you say you want to see everyone have an equally enjoyable game experience whatever there play style i think if you really mean that you will push ccp to do something for people who like small gang and solo pvp because compared to the other play styles ccp has left that one to rotlet me explain in more detailplaystyle 1 industrialist we have seen ccp create worm holes which yield new types of tech 3 things to produce wormholes also provide a whole new place for industrialists to base build poses and mine etc dominion also lead to new opportunities for industrialists in null sec planetary interaction also provided industrialists with new materials to produce etc im not an industrialist myself so there may have been other things ccp has done to make the industrialists game more enjoyableplaystyle 2 shooting npcsmissioning they can shoot npcs in missions in high sec low sec or null sec they can shoot rats in fw missions or in belts there are also the improvements in upgradable sov space to shoot rats then ccp brings in sleepers for wormholes and now incursions a whole new way to shoot rats again ccp has done allot to make this playstyle more enjoyableplaystyle 3 large fleet pvp everything about sov holding null sec revolves around this this has been the center of ccps concern from day one it seems dominion is geared toward making sov warfare more important obvious the lag hurt this so it is a huge priority of ccp to fix same with the work on supercaps etc could it use some work i suppose as i hear there are many naps but if ccp cared as little about large fleet pvp as they do about small gang and solo pvp they would have been saying they will get to lag in about 18 months ccp obviously cares allot about this style of playcontinued in five minutes
playstyle 4 solosmall gang pvp this is basically low sec and npc null sec space but it can happen anywhere what has ccp ever done to boost this play style what mechanics promote this 1 fw plexing2 possibly worm hole collapsing based on size although we will see this is an extreme stretchas far as fw plexing it needs fixing and has been basically ignored from the day it was put out it is really primarily a method of pve instead of pvp i could go on and on with the problems but why everyone agrees it is broken yet ccp seems insistent that this will be low priority thank you ccp for the broken mechanic to promote solo and small gang pvpas far as wormhole collapse to promote small gang pvp  well saying this was implemented to promote small gang pvp is a real stretch it was much more likely implemented to promote small corps being able to put a poses in wormholes in any event according to the latest economic quarterly very little pvp at all goes on in wormholes compared to null and low sec so if this was somehow an attempt to help small gang pvp it failed thereso am i missing anything that has been done to promote the solosmall gang pvp play style anything other than one broken mechanic fw plexxing that has been acknowledged as broken for yearsi recognize that since ccp has taken no interest in promoting small gang or solo pvp there are few of us left so to the extent you are just pandering for votes this wont be a great topic but to the extent you are interested in balance in promoting everyones style of play in a non partisan way it should be obvious that the play style of small gang and solo pvp is way overdue looking back at how the game has evolved they almost always seemed to ignore this style of play imo ccp has been quite partisan against small gangsolo pvp if you are truly nonparisan i dont see how you can look at ccps track record and disagree thats why i think if you mean what you say you should champion this play style otherwise you are just following ccps very partisan mo
youve made some interesting points and i do agree with the need to sort out outstanding issueshowever a lot of these items are pvp related  which is fine but i am seriously interested in what your thoughts of how you see pi going and its influence over dust given that pi is halfbaked concoction at the moment i would like to hear what you think about making this worthwhilepersonally id like to see pi wielded in such a way as to resolve another outstanding issue  that being the stupidly ridiculous moons
with the approach of incarna comes an environment where we can walk around in our internet apartment alone just like we do in real life with this exciting new environment comes the opportunity for exciting new mechanics like watching tv alone or sitting alone in the dark or maybe we can take a shower while this might be everything that makes the common eve player happy with the exception of showering i think we can demand something more because ccp listens to the csm and implements their good suggestionslets dare to dream lets get fish tanks for our space homesfish have been a staple of science fiction for a long time they were in mass effect 2 hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and that star trek movie with the whales which are sort of fish they would also be pretty cool in eveplayers could start out with a basic fresh water fish tank the number of fish they could put in the tank would be based on their skill level in fish husbandry there would also be skills in fish diplomacy since some types of fish dont get along and need to be carefully managed so they wont attack each other also cleaning reduces the amount of cleaning you have to do feeding reduces the amount of feeding you have to do and i dunno maybe water management so your fish dont get sick tech 2 fish tanks could handle salt water there could also be mods for fish tanks like rocks seaweed and little floating divers or maybe spacemen because this is a space game basic fish could be extracted from ocean and terrestrial planets using a specialized extractor third world children since thats mostly who catches them in the real world specialized fish would be rare drops from faction spawns and officers like hakims modified trout or maybe they could even add ded 11 and c7 wormholes where deadspace fish and mysterious tech 3 sleeper fish could be found it would also add vibrancy to the new eden economy as players buy and sell the rarest most desirable fish to take back to their apartment and watch in their tank aloneanyways if elected to the csm i will go to iceland and i will bring back their promise that they will fix blasters and give us fish tanks in incarna
youve got my vote
youve convinced me you have my vote
thanks for all the fish
this is pretty much the best idea ive seen on these forums for as long as ive been playing
what kind of training time multiplier would fish husbandry have
fish husbandry is a pretty basic skill allowing you to manage from 1 to 5 fish so probably a 1x training time but advanced fish husbandry and fish empathy would be higher level skills allowing you to keep 3 fish per level and 5 fish per level respectively and have 3x and 5x training times because have you ever seen a tank with a lot of fish in it i bet not because thats really hard to do
question what about supercapital pilots will we be able to install a fish tank aboard our ships so that we too may enjoy the art of fish husbandry
will there be corporate fishtanks for storing and viewing corp fish
i think each ship could have its own fish tank that reflects it like frigates could have a bowl with a goldfish faction ships could get a salt water tank with some colorful fish and capitals could have one of those really big salt water tanks with maybe an eel or sea turtlei think supercapitals should have something even more special like a wall converted to a fish tank so every time you walk around your supercapital home you feel like youre in a really classy chinese restaurant
i think there should be but thered have to be a special director rank for fish management youd want someone trusted to manage your fish that wouldnt forget to feed them or steal them and put them in his own tankwoah check out these fish some of them look like theyre from space and would be good designs for eve fish
could we have like different racial fish looted from npc wrecks with like t2 faction and officer fishalso i dont see the lionfish which is the most outerspacey fish everalso sleeper fish from wormholes and incursions
i dont know how much about fish might ultimately be covered by the nda so i have to be careful but as a sneak preview im just going to say angler fish draw what conclusions you may
what is your plan for t3 fish i saw that new piranha movie the other day and i would really like to make a fish like that so that i could have it fight other players fish perhaps this could be part of incarna fish fights
i think the wonderful thing about a fish based system is just how much it can be expanded in creative new directions maybe tech 3 fish could be produced by breeding different fish together then having them fight i dont know the world of fish is huge and just contemplating all the directions we can go is exciting and a little humbling
fish offer a clear direction beyond tech 3 as well what mysterious fish have the jovians created from their mastery of genetics during their millenia of isolation do you dare find out
also what surrounding goods would be created are the fish just fish with the system just involving the fish or is there going to be pi involved to make fish food and bpos for t2 fish tanks
as i mentioned in the op youd need rocks seaweed little floating dudes pirate treasure chests and even coral fish tanks are a very modable environment
how would you deal with automated tankcleaning and fish management programs such as hfish and tankripper
thats pretty tough but personally i feel that taking proper care of your fish tank is an important part of owning it how can you build a proper emotional connection to your fish if you use a bot
also i think the eve soundtrack should be redone by andrew wk do i want to party hardhell yeah i do
do you think we could have a fishgrowing interface like that old educational game odell lake
what is your stance on the duck billed platypus
do those even go in fish tanksi think it would be very dangerous to expand the feature too much but then again maybe this lack of ambition is why im not running for the csm
my vote for draco

bad posting should be rooted out and destroyed wherever and whenever it is found
its official the jasmine revolution is the new wwii
dis
we saw what you did to boatand the flask
would you explain the metrics you employed in arriving at the conclusions you have re what is wrong for example what metric do you use to conclude that a lack of ccp assigned goals is a problem how would you know when the problem was fixed feel free to use a different example from your list in post 2 if you wishcheers
please use full sentences doublespace your work and cite your sources
also 12pt times new roman font with 1 marginsis it that obviousi really have to stop posting from work
whoa whoa i advise not produce besides youre clearly a maven in such things
hey it was your ideaand may i compliment you on your use of hebrew most rakish of youvote for butch
vote for butchget your ballots ready
what metrics and methodologies do you employ in determining when a mechanicshipmodulewhatever is somehow broken for example your bounty hunting thread begins with two statements 1bounty huunting is not a viable career and 2bounties are a joke how did you arrive at those conclusionsto be clear i am not interested in the ideas you have to fix nuetral rr bounty hunting or taxes at the moment i merely wish to understand how you as a csm rep might process informationideas presentedcheers
my primary analysis of determining if something is broken is if it is not balanced this means elements of the game i consider broken are those that interfere with the intended operation of itself or other mechanics with your example 1 bounty hunting is not a viable career as there is very limited in game mechanics that support the career and mechanics such as concord and security status create large barriers to viability of this career the conclusion in this example was that bounty hunting needed mechanics to support the viability of this career2 bounties are a joke was determined by practice this often where imbalance is found as i have accounts that play all elements of the game i run into most exploitable or imbalanced mechanics this one in particular is that bounties placed on my 10 character get collected by another character of mine when they are higher than the value of the clonei am always open to ideas and thoughts on current issues and my proposals many of my proposals are results of complaints from friends and sometimes enemies in eve you will find that i have dramatically changed my proposals after discussion and have even removed elements after presented with reasoning my open view on all ideas related to eve and my vast experience in many elements of eve allow me to see problems from multiple views and determine most importantly a balanced solution if one is necessaryi hope that answers the question if you feel i spent too much time on an example let me know and i will be more specific my primary goal is balance in eve
thanks for taking the time to respond hopefully you will not mind me asking a follow up questionlets imagine that ccp decides to implament some change in bounty hunting the example is just for ease of conversation 6 months later ccp asks csm how things are going and if they need to adjust anything else how would you determine the sucess or failure of the initial changescheers
just to be clear on one thing im not applying for csm on the wi ticket aureleos is the wi candidate im not standing to split the wi vote but im standing as an independent anyway what i offer is experience working in environments similar to csm and getting things done im not a seasoned campaigner or a politician i am an experienced software development team leader and a pedant  i question everything and make sure that the best outcome is achieved rather than my own personal agendaso vote for me if you want to be represented by somebody with a broad perspective of eve who knows how the development process works and who wants whats best for the entire eve player community
with all the people running around in tinfoil hats wouldnt it be smarter to claim you are trying to split the vote might confuse people enough to vote for youon a more serious note do you think that there is a conflict of interest with being on the csm with all the juicy inside details that are covered under the nda as well as designing other games are you really a wow employee sent here to sabatoge eve or figure out ways to siphon off clients tell the truth
bad at keeping things at the top
confirmed  white tree  best tree
i support things
just say no
support checking in
would you please take the time to articulate why your intro line and 11 points need some sort of changeimplamentation actually you can leave out the points on bots and ui i am not interested in specific proposals of how to fix something i am asking about the metrics and methedologies you employ in your evaluation that something is a problemcheers
i support this product andor service in all seriousness though you sir have my vote
confirming my support for kalrand
so this means that youll be revealing your main now right rightno youre just going to keep up the flawed path you started on even if you dont have a valid reason to continue doing so yet still ask people for more questions and concernsyou and ccp seem to be made for each other well folks youve seen it here this man here is about the closest you can get to the ccp experience if youre interested in a candidate who will listen to your concerns and then do whatever he wants anyways look no further then eve truthremember folks a vote for eve truth is a vote for stubborn stupidity eve truth for csmhey if you take the last phrase of the last two paragraphs out of context youd get eve truths first recommendation
well thank you very much for posts and for your free bumps
i suppose if bad publicity is the best your candidacy can get thats what youll be satisfied withthats so niceyour stance of lets just be satisfied with the status quo just what people look for in a candidateenjoy your free bump since apparently those are what you consider campaign successes
should say a bit about the real me    i am a teacher have been for 20 yearsguess that makes me old    in my 50s nowi have union rep experience know roberts rules of order can run or participate in a meeting without derailing or sidetrackingi am persuasive enough and patient enough to manage to teach science and math to teenagers i am young enough to enjoy this game in all its aspects old enough to have realistic expectations of what can and cannot be done i understand that this is a game to csm but a business to ccp and that the meetings we have are always trying to bridge that great dividei think that one strong person in the csm is not enough nor is one leader and a bunch of loyal sheep we need a team to present a strong front each member of that team willing to think and speak for themselves but all with a common goal of making this game better for all of us    for hi low and null for pirates and carebears for the bitter vets and the new guys just wondering if this game is worth tryingif we want this game around for a long time we have to look to grow we must be willing to try new things because in the market of games it is always grow or begin the slow decline into oblivion and i do not mean a bethesda producti take a long view of things and then try to find the short term actions to achieve distant goalsyou should vote for me because i am the right person to represent youm
we cant stop here this is bat country 
i dare to speak out against pirates griefer kind and i dare to stand my ground difference between a pirate and a griefer is the obvious rule that a pirate will use hisher head instead of a happy trigger finger my ideas are not against the pirates that do know how to play a game in a honest way its against the few that think they need to mess up the game and not think about what will happen if they succeedi do not sign up for things like this for the free things actually i really couldnt care less about it i have the skills and i like to share those with the world improving it for any and all lying i can hardly do due to my autism and really isnt there anyone that wants these points realized i mean come on show some back bone show some guts you can at least think for yourself instead of running after the pirate griefers because you are afraid of thema good csm member is not about 1 group but alla good csm member is not thinking about what heshe gets but what they can do for everyonea good csm member is willing to talk about more then the guidelines ccp sets a csm member needs to speak out instead of sit and shut upnone of the other candidates seem to have this besides me and just because i am against the griefers i am ignored shame on you all think about what you need not what they need
so in short youll willing to work with the members of the nc who make it to csm in terms of being stalwart and making the csm more effective but come from a hilowsec perspective
i will work with whoever makes it to the csm but it doesnt mean i will always agree with them i think the way mittani and others wants to make the csm to act more united to have more effect on ccp is really interestinghowever i do not think a csm with only 00 people would be a good thing for either the playerbase less representativity or even for the csm ccp is not dumb enough to trust the csm if its only made of 00 players elected through their powerblocs
it doesnt matter if the people on the csm are all from 00 or notwhat matters is that a unified voice is presented to ccpthis is easiest if the parties involved are similar
the risk being that these parties are completely biased if all of them come from 00 and are elected thanks to their powerbloc everything that remotely threat their priviledges will be wiped out of csm meetings and everything that will only profit to empire players will be less prioritized than things which will benefit to their powerblocsempire players do not want this nor does ccp aware that more than 80 of players are empire playersa 100 powerbloc csm could even threaten the very existence of the csm cpp noticing that because of politics issues the csm lost its only meaning to represent players
as has been stated prior most 00 players are also empire playerswe dont want to nerf highsec isk faucets because we use themthats the lowsec elite pvp bunch that want to get rid of nice things in empire and force cheap ganks encourage good fights
thats why i said 70 instead of 85 assuming 15 of eve population are empire alts of null sec playersim not saying 00 powerbloc players want to nerf hisec they just want their priviledge in 00 to stay the same and they dont care about hisec much apart from production and trade they makes part of their money fromlow sec pvper i think you dont really know them they just want fights and their space to be populated again not by nerfing hisec but by making lowsec attractive again which is not the case righ know powerbloc 00 being both safer and wealthier with no real drawbacks apart from paying a rent to said powerbloc
3rd party tools is a essential part of what makes eve worthwhile you got my vote mate
10
i have known peter in game almost since he started and i have to say that he does what he says he will do i know that he will do his utmost to put his points across and get things donehe gets my vote
so your implying that the csm should be controlled by a bunch of hisec carebears who have no idea of whats going on down in null
they dont
hes probably blind to anything that is south on a mapfor kalle  bismaru
nc  who are they who are the botters in there every one seems to liek those debatesthe ones with 1500less 1500 members and over 35 outposts or those with morelikeless members and less outpostswhat are you trying to prove with those silly numbers
hahah ohh wow you know most alliances since dominion only claim space in their influence based on what is there right my comment was based on regional control next you will say nc dont have the most members as dc are not on the same team
no it wasnt here you are changing the goal post again to suit your anger  hatred at the goonies if you were stating that dc  nc have more members per capita of space owned ya you might have a point but to state that nc  goonswarm have the most space you were most definitely wrong
no it wasnt  words wtf are you on about anyway the announcement has been made of which csm were accepted which means your poasting can be made with your main on caod as i really dont care about non csm stuff in this thread and tbh neither should you
i dont care about much things unlike you wailing about conspiracy regarding nc  dc in your headare you saying im not posting on my main what gives you that impression kallebismuru
youre speaking in some language that no one understands no wonder why no one listens to you kallebismaru
yet this thread has reached three pageseditwait what do you mean there werent any posts by other actual people who were concerned about the situation and for whom this thread brought their attention to this giant conspiracyhuh youre right its filled with alts and trolls i guess no one is actually listeninghey everyone look in this thread bump bump bump
hes fun hes like the redheaded step child that every organization has even on eve
my machinations are timeless your stupidity will only add to my intelligence
being blue to the nc doesnt make you part of the nc hey bismaru isnt it against the eula to avoid forum bans by using alts
hello space jesus
i am the mittani
according to your post history you have a serious problem with goons and the nc are you making a real effort to get on the csm to improve the game overall or are you just trying to keep the nc and their allies from getting their voices heard
itt devoting x percentage of your posting lifetime replying to bad posts makes those posts less bad
btw u mad
no hes the mittani cant u reed bro
zerozero space checking in owe need some 3 too
killer2 dont you feel it a bit anticlimatic to even bother posting a thread here in jita park or do you believe there is a chance you will not be elected
im treating this election serious and taking nothing for granted players who believe in what i represent should vote for me regardless of who they are affiliated with
i have known k2 for a number of years you have my vote
my vote is yours siri think its majorly important to defend jbs from the ccp nerfbat and i cant think of any better fc to lead the csm in that op
k2 got my vote o
supporting killer2 for csm holla
supporting o
yeah i also think that a small noob nasty gang should win over a huge friendly experienced gang but i fully support this guy here
you have my sword i mean voteworking with government agencies guarantees you experience you need to handle ccp i urge you to try to curbe ccp brains before they pull a nge on eve making game playable is much more important then making it colorful
supporting our passionate killerhe has everything a csm candidate needs vuk has made sure of that during those long nights and a neat gifvote
you have my vote killer2
ok so whats your stance on some of the other issues not surrounding simply 00 space ie the current botting issues renting issues encouraging players to move from 5  00 etc its fine to say yes im out for 00 and i can appreciate that your a 00 player but as a csm your also meant to be the voice for every one how are you also going to help those who are in low sec and hisec space and how are you going to approach ccp in regards to the current problems with botting etc
to answer some other questions ive hadare you an official goon candidateno im not an official goon candidate there are two of those and neither of them are me i am running on a generalist platform of improving the quality of feedback that ccp receives across the board rather than as a boughtandpaidfor alliance advocate nobody in goonswarm should be voting for mebut youre a goonyes and i was while a member of csm 4 and csm 5 too somehow i managed to curb my kitteneating instincts i stand by my record of contribution to those sessionswhy arent you putting forwards ideas for changes to the game like some of the other candidates arebecause they dont matter ill happily tell you what my position is on anything you care to ask about but my ideas for fixes are largely irrelevant to the process ccp doesnt care what they are and neither should youi googled your name and it looks as though you are a huge nerdyeah i am
who am imy name is domania ive had my concord issued pilots licensed for the fifth year i started my career in duripant at the federal navy academy school during their four year training to become a pod pilot soon after i became certified to operate a pod i broke off and became a freelancer starting off with an industrial corporation where i got to learn my bearings in the harsh universe soon enough i found myself getting into more and more combat in my later months and then found myself pirating in the placid region there i learned to not fear death as it had no meaning to me anymore as long as i was within my pod however my paradise that i found soon came to an end as the federation started to step up its patrols in the region i found it harder to continue my business of controlling the area by means of force i heard stories of empires growing in the far reaches of space also known as null sector space for concords inability to enforce their law there i did my research and found the perfect place to call home behind the reaches of minmatar space int he curse region there i partnered up with a outlaw group known as the angel cartel that had a contract with the corporation i was employed with at the time there i got to get my hands on research far ahead of the other empires i was able to obtain untapped resources from the area i became far richer than before it made my business of pillaging trade routes near the outskirts of empire look like a joke that soon came to an end since i left the area the angel cartel set me hostile to their faction i sooner or later found myself back at the start freelancing i did a lot of trading lead mining operations to manufacture war machines many years pass now my time is spent studying cosmic anomalies such as wormholes and the unknown sleepers empire that disappeared from existenceso that still leaves the question who am ii am just like you a average playerive played this game for a full 5 years with no signs of stopping i have done everything from mining solo pvp group pvp 00 wormhole space leading a corporation trading industrial work pirating peon in major 00 conflicts and missioning i currently own two accounts that could be because i am crazy addicted to the game in the game as of right now i do wormhole exploration and small gang pvp along with the occasional large pvp more than 40but what can you promise mewell thats the extremely hard part i could go ahead and promise you to fix hybirds new ships destroy macro bots boost gallente boost cladari fix bugs create universe peace buff missions etc however that isnt feasible to do the issues get so complex itd be impossible to do all of them with a simple flick of the switch it requires thinking together to make it a feasible plan to tackle saying that there is something i want to do for you i want to work to become the eve communitys voice and help be ccps ears i want to make this game even better and to help ccp take this game to a whole new level by working with you and them to collaborate both ideas and suggestions to improve this game like never beforeso what can i do to helpvote to make the game even better speak up by voting me in to be your voice to ccp to help improve the game like never before together you and me will help improve the game for us and future generations of players coming into the gamedont hesitate to contact me via evemail or on my blog at domaniaevepresscom with any questions or suggestions or if your lucky enough to catch be not afk you can convo me directly in game
just because its time for someone newjust because its time for a changejust because its time to stop fafing around and start getting things done enough of verbosity keep things short keep things precise just do itjust because its time for the little people to be heard the inexperience to have a say and the experience to share just because you can vote ksmithy
just cause 2 was a fun game
given that ccp has said that dust not eve is their highest priority why has only 1 of the candidates mentioned this in their statements on the candidates pagethis seems one of the biggest issues in eve even the last csm mentioned it in their minutes as a concern
where did ccp state that dust is a higher priority than eve link to a specific quote please
dust and eve are not the same developers the guys in iceland work on eve and i believe shanghai works on dust someone can confirm that
lol eve politics is crap for sure like mittani says we are all going to lie to you if you expect the typical democratic process but honestly getting a block of guys that works together to block the horset ideas that get thrown up by every body who thinks their opinion matters is ultimately the most useful function of the csm which otherwise is a worthless organization some of the horset ideas come from ccp itselfultimately they want a free vacation to iceland which aholes do you want to give it to what intelligence level do you want in the peeps that go to the csm and on the flip side do you want intelligent council members who would love to screw up the game for everyone as part of a larger grieferstyle metagaming scheme or do you want intelligent reps that will spoil the plans of those metagame fapping ahatscaring about the game is one thing the fact ive spent three years playing shows that but you have to be realistic about what the csm can or cannot do unified front is the only way to make it do anything 00 needs to sweep the csm in order for anything to happen or be stopped from happening that we dont want as 00ers
i dont lie i know some others dont either theres enough candidates with valid programs that can stand on their own without needing to resort to backhanded reallife lying tactics at this stage maybe it will come but the time is not that yetnow as pointed out in many posts made by me or other the csm is no vacationpicture thisarrive on the evening before the meeting or during the night3 days of meeting starting around 830 ending around 6pm 1 hour sessions facing fresh dev teams every time delving into details constant focus required thats a grind if ive ever lived any after 3 days every csm member who paid attention is exhaustedevenings are spent with devs discussion more eve matters sharing stories from both sides of the fence albeit in a more relaxed mannerthe morning after the meetings plane takes offno time for vacation ccp extends as a courtesy to members the ability to prolong their stay on their own dime to visit iceland but then its not a free trip anymore is itand thats not even taking into account all the time spent prior to the iceland meetings to read and discuss all player proposalsid expect anyone touting the free trip aspect to be labelled an idiot for thats all it is theres enough reports now to be able to determine that there is no such thingmeissa anunthiel csm 2 3 4 5 and maybe 6
so you dont deny that you will likely be pushing your 00 blocks agenda you also presume that no other candidate knows anything about economics
kalrand for president  or whatever
i didnt deny anything im also bad at answering questions posed with double negativesim not part of the 00 plot to take over the csm im part of the kalrand thinks the economy should be paid attention to plot to take over the csm
can you give us an example of how you would deal with ccp from an economical perspective specifically suppose that this discussion about implementing fish tanks in eve was actually taking place in iceland or in the private forums between a ccp serious about implementing the idea and the csm what would be your opinion how would you react and how would you work with ccp as the idea was being brought to fruition
kalrand does enjoy the confidence of md as a whole so your confidence in his economic knowledge is probably well founded however that doesnt preclude other candidates from demonstrating theirs
simple question simple answermostly nothing unless you want it to change directionit is already one of the most complex game economies out there probably the most complexone issue that is economic in nature is the amount of fixed resource faucets available theres too little ore in highsec or if macroers disappear raw ship output could be increased theres too few moons holding t2 materials or once again increase the output through various means those are 2 issues i have for the rest the economy is working fine by itself barring a few snafus like the pi introduction one of the first thing we bashed ccp over at the first meetings of csm 5 trust isnt enforced but thats the nature of the gameto be fair to other candidates with little to no knowledge of economics over the past 4 terms there have been a number of economy related subjects but none of them required a degree in economics to understand supply and demand secondary markets a few extra definitions if were pushing it a candidate could use knowledge of things such as productionpossibility frontier and general equilibrium theory but thats pushing it any decently intelligent individual shouldnt have issues herewhat ill add to the subject is that knowledge of economics per se is pointless if one doesnt understand the conditions under which the products are used unless one is content having fun doing nothing but trading but as far as csm members are concerned its not just the economics that are interesting but what happens because of those what does it mean that the price of t2 components increases by 300 what effect does it have on gameplay its how economics tie into balance that things get interesting
i think part of the problem is that a lot of folks forget that decisions in eve balance on the rl economy first and its own internal economy takes a distant second decisions that change how well the company will do whether it will gain new subscribers or lose the ones it already has is the lens through which ccp is forced to lookif that lens points towards the game economy then i think they have a right to be proud but they also need to take a close look at some of the more nagging issues that are growing such as market bots sure i know how the 001 isk game is played but i have a very hard time believing that someone is out there finger over the send key waiting for my movefor the internal economy to be viable and for the external game economy to keep the players who prefer the market pvp over the spaceships one i think the first order of business in the economy side of the game is to try to address the bottingm
the retribution and coercer need a second mid slot no discussion csm address this issue and you have all of my votes
1 i agree with you single mid slot is fail2 any csm who promises this is an idiotcsm cant make balnket changes like this and any promise to do so illistrates they do not undestand how the csm worksasking csm views on ship balance and there general opinion on things may let you know who to vote for better
then youre asking the csm candidates to promise you that theyll do this but they will never push what you want because that isnt their job
has anyone ever made improving t1 destroyers part of their platformi dunno it just seems like they dont really have a place in eve
i agree with you the retribution and coercer need some attention as do the other dessieswe have requested ccp puts this on the list of items to check for rebalancing during csm 2 and 5 i believe it is likely to happen shortly but can make no promise to that regardno csm member existing or candidate can make promises about results never ever no more than any lobbyist canand never can we tell ccp this needs an extra slot or it needs 5 more damagewe tell them ship x needs some attention we think it could use this or thatthen they come back to us and tell us the outcome of their evaluation we give our feedback on what they have in mind suffices or not and we take it from thereso yes they need attention will that attention take the form of another mid slot i dont knowbetter get a correct answer than empty promises i hope
two really wow maybe the csm really is brokenor maybe ccp really doesnt care about t1 destroyers
i think it was 2 may have been 3 dont remember exactlypriorities csm 2 is the time dominion was the focus it got left a bit on the side at that time and the csmccp communication wasnt what it is now as such promoting our issues was not as efficient as today hence the delay the csm obtained other things in the interimmeissa csm 2 3 4 5 and maybe 6
so why wasnt the issue revisited later once the big fancy flashy features were discussed and implemented
because it was already in the backlog which means that the csm agreed that it should happen and agreeing all over again doesnt change anything ccp sets the schedule and if they decide that ship balance passes arent going to happen soon then thats how it is the csm can try and influence the schedule to some extent but not on the micro scale like fix these two specific ships in this specific way its more like there are a lot of outstanding hull balance requests from players and we think that you should put that ahead of other thing 765478 that you want to do
has saying that worked in the past
in some cases yes but the csm does not control the schedule the 1000 little things initiative is an example of the csm putting pressure on ccp to allocate resources to something that we felt was important
dear capsuleersneeding your vote so that i can best represent your interests to the developers at ccp will review all questions and help the best way i can will attempt to answer any questions you may have have been playing for more than a year been mostly working on upgrading technology ingame working to raise items not yet taken to tech level ii or iiidavidnorell

as soon as i saw a link to win isk i coudnt take you seriously as a candidate
to be fair its worth an entry you should see the god awful e thats been submitted so far at this stage you could just write windy for the win on your gentleman sausage and photograph it youd probably win
are you saying that you literally cannot get people to help you with your campaign even if you bribe themouch ouch
no im saying that eve players are fat and unphotogeniclinkage
whoa whoa nothing on there says that the picture has to be of ourselves this explanation doesnt entirely explain why the situation is as it is nowhint check two posts up if you cant think of another reason
whether it is intended or accidental is beside the point  its a good mechanism regardlessafk cloaking is one of many mechanisms which encourage cooperative play if you have an afk cloaker in your system and youre wanting to go about your business you will need to make sure you have backup ships that can fit a covops cloak and be sitting in your sanctum watching you generally have weak tank dps or both so its not like theyre a huge threatthere is very little pve content in the game that cant be soloed in the right ship encouraging people to work together is what eve is all about  it is after all a massively multiplayer gamethis is my stance on afk cloaking anyway  working as it should
its abolutly not any kind of solution to the problemdo i have some nojust ask ccp to people who need to merge the multiple alts acounts in a single one and make them be abble to train normaly for each char with his own attributeswhat would this change tons of alts accountsif you need a scout alt then youll still be doing like every one else trial account with a fake nameblah blah mail adress or an alt with your second account or youll ask it to any newbbie this means less people afking missionyouporn tv film catch superbowl or whatever leaving their hulk mining ice for 15mn before he gets filled or a simple bot that will not answer you more than the guys ive mentioned beforeno not true and im pretty sure youre realy belive what youre sayingbut youve got screwedeveryone in low00 space will learn you this when you are flying an industrail whenever a neutral apears either you turn your cloaking device on or you just dockreturn to poslog outthis is how it works and its not the 21st centurys new all you guys are doing is screw the local intell mobilise forces to search stupid cloakers while they could do much better of their game time playthx to you no reasonable miner or whatever with a striplazer miner will ever deplete a single rock while your scum alts are thereyou think youve done something about bots you didnt youve just shited once more on real players
i am a personal fan of afk cloaking and would hate to see this aspect of the game changed in any way its a good way and reminder that in 00 you are in 00 i dont think that ccp intended for 00 to be a care free zone if someone is cloaked in local go some where else cause you never know when those afk cloaky people are actually not afkpoint and case here not really afk cloaked
if ccp makes it impossible to bot then i will support getting rid of afk cloaking if they do this without making botting impossible then people will simply build bots to make afk cloaking feasible again just saying
who cares about bots
im sorry afk cloaking only effects botters that is absolute bulltell me you ed high sec puppies if im in my null sec system with no station and want my ship to be off scan so they dont know i have my nyx not that i have a nyx but anywayin system but i also satyed logged in cause chances are 200 people have me o na blacklist trying to kill me i will afk cloak my arse off to save my shipdont be stupid and ignorant and say afk cloaking only affects botters when you really have no clueon a less ing point yes csm need to ahve a good sit down and talk about it for better or worse
some candidates want your vote because its a free trip some want your vote because they have beef with ccp and really anyone who truly plays eve will have some beef with some broken featurethe difference between them and me is i dont want to go yea i have some issue with some of the broken content but it doesnt mean i want to spend 20hours on a plane i dont see why the csm cant have more ongoing direct communication with ccp like weekly skype conference calls or some other jazz there is what 7 years of backlog of player suggestions for fixes and you really think 2 summit meetings a year can cover all thoseno what the csm needs is more direct continual communication and involvement where the csm can have active discussions with players on the forums or in game and bring important feedback directly to ccp without waiting 6 months for a summitccp has stated that with each issue brought up they have to run the numbers and check if it does in fact solve a balance issue or create another one hence the delay in dealing with so many of the issue brought forth by previous csms i say let the csm run some numbers give the csm a small test server and someone at ccp that can implement player suggested changes on a small 10 system server let the csm test hybrid changes ship power grid changes and other issues on the forums let the csm test these changes on a basic level and then they can have some experience and numbers to present to ccp to give a direction for a fix rather then just giving a complaintthe idea may not be perfect but its a start its just one of hundreds of ideas to open the door for communication and change with ccp based on player feedbackand thats what i want to bring to the csmso while some other candidates may express the exact issues you want fixed theyll be hard pressed to see it resolved but a vote for me will increase the chances that the csm will be able to represent your issues with success to ccp
how would this compare with the current situation with the internal csmccp forums and the csmplayer forums basically just less of an emphasis on the summit meetings and utilize the other means of communications more
just want to lay this free trip myth to restthe csm is not a free trip let me tell you how it worksyou land usually the evening before sometimes the day of the meetings head to the office have 8 hours of continuous meetings with different teams they switch every 1 hour so theyre fresh you have to stay focus continuously multiply that by 3 days every evening we have meals with devs what do we talk about eve more lobbying its a bit more relaxed but theres still the discussing things as viewed from either side of the fence aspect to thingsand when the meetings are done you fly backccp offers the people the ability to prolong their stay on their own dime but thats not free anymorei have never taken that opportunity lack of time or lack of money as such ive never seen a geyser or whaleits no free tripand being on the csm is continuous work both outside the meetings in iceland and in preparation for those its really no leisurenow letting you go back to your own candidacy sorry for the disruptionmeissa anunthiel csm 2 3 4 and 5 and 6

bump for a good ideaand yes both covert cloaks and black ops ships should be exempt from the penalty
supported
i still believe that since the purpose of this whole idea is to prevent cloaked capitol ships from jumping without exposing themselves it would make much more sense to introduce capitol size cloaking device and simply prevent regular cloaks from activating on capitols have like a maximum mass limiti support the main idea but not its implementation
i was going for the low hanging fruit thing by introducing a brand new module you have to do a new blueprint what it takes to build etc i was just hoping for a couple changes to the normal cloak we have now thought that would be easier it is the reason why i think all damage controls should just be flat out passive then there is the argument that neutralizing a capital shipwhen they log the damage control turns off so it can be killed a new capital ship damage control could be introduced that uses capacitor and the normal damage control could be set to passiveso i guess it really just depends on what would be easier for ccp to do i honestly dont think non capital ships would really suffer at all if they could not regain capacitor or shield while cloaked they are safe and that is all 99 of everyone who warps off to a safe spot cares about after all its why they call it a safe spot not a cap recharge spot
great idea ensures the game is playable in otherwise laggy situations and allows ccp to work on reducing lag without constantly being shouted at about how lag is breaking the gamei like that idea especially since it will force the fight to be broken up across multiple systems something ccp has said they want to see reinforcing fleets arriving on the scene too late will have to fight in near by systems unless they want to just sit around and wait for the temporal distortions to end there should probably be some time delay between when a system enters bullet time and when it gets locked down though that way if youre planning to hot drop on someone your bait fleet doesnt get hung out to dry when the system suddenly gets locked down
truly if all ship models were scaled to meet their currently listed volumes this issue would probably be corrected but a halffix is better than none sosupported

hes just trolling badly we used to use dramiels a lot solo too but it got boring because they are op in fact looking at my statistics dramiel is the ship i have the second most kills in after taranis and iv flown all sorts of stuff since 2007 i can also fly all frigates at the same trained skill levels so personally i have nothing to win in the boostnerf game i just like a more interesting and level playing field its a fact that dramiels ahve ruined the frigate bracket balance
mines want them back please
mines could be fun but the should have a deployment range from objects such as 5km from a gate and maybe 1km from another mine kinda like cargo containersbut otherwise i like the idea the time limit would be good too also make mines non discriminitory you know if anyone gets close to it it goes off
slave collars for minmatar
as what some might call a carebear i support finnagain zeros vision wholeheartedly i wish i could quote all the highlights nothing annoys me more about this game than that there are highsec sanctuaries for those that wish to cause havoc in highsec ccp should allow an endrun around the protections that concord affords those who prey on the weak in high sec an i think the instation environment is the best forum for this allow the noobs to get their revenge there if no where else if ccp wont apply equal rules to all space in eve the lest they could do is offer an alternate forum for disputes especially in high sec where their rules do more to protect the villians that disrupt society than those that participate in it never has any government taken the stance that concord and ccp has it is highly unrealistic

what a deployable module which you can drop into 00 that will remove local chat in that constellation until it is destroyedwhere drop it in any system the jammer is a celestial object like a cyno anyone having their local blocked by the jammer will be informed of what system the jammer has been deployed inhow warp into a system containing the constellation you want to jam spend a few minutes deploying the jammer prepare for fights and hunting as you remove local and broadcast your evilness to the people youve just jammedwhy allows for the localfree goodness that people talk about without forcing it on everyone want your local chat and associated intel back go blow up the jammer want to kill those punks in botting alliances drop a jammer and bots are forced to stop or risk death
gankfest item spottednot supported unless system based not constellationor really really really expensivemust be shiprestricted too like warpbubble for dictors
thisshould be both system based and expensive also must have low ehp otherwise deploying one in your own system next to a d1ckstar pos with blob backup to jam your enemys system would be far too exploitable also must void cyno on grid or it would turn into easy bait for lazy people
ok the concept overall is good however i would make a couple of modificationsfirst off i would like to see 2 variants on this one type is similar to a mobile warp disruption bubble as far as anchoring deployment and sizes sml these will only block local channel in the system its deployed in for 24 and 8 hours respectively until they run out of charge like scan probes or are put offline by the deployer and brought back into a ship for a recharge then redeployedthese would be primarily used in an offensive manner blocking local intel while the assault fleet jumps in etcthe second type is a pos structure requires sov to activate but can be turned on and off instantly at the pos by the controller so the system owners can keep local off for hours or days at a time and then when the desire for a local snapshot of intel is needed can turn off the jammer then back on there should be 2 types a system jammer requiring system sov and a constellation jammer requiring constellation sov to activate needless to say a specialized skill should be required to activate these devices being on the cutting edge of new eden technology and all gleaned from our encounters with the sleepers in wspacegood idea with refinement i am for supporting it
general concept is very good
if the item is expensive and destroyable it means that would be tool that favors local mega alliance powers  not roaming gangs not weaker invading forcesif you are a weaker entity wanting to attack local alliance coalition as soon as you anchor it all the bots and farmers safe up the alliance is alerted alliance organizes a blob uses the jb network to quickly go to troubled system quickly kills the expensive local jammerlocal alliances may be interested in anchoring these things in their 00 empire border regions  where they mostly camp for empire noobs enteringthey may also use these things in major fleet battles where both sides are strong enough to defend an anchorable local jammerbut in majority of cases these things wouldnt be used and they certainly wouldnt make defending alliances any more vulnerable from weaker hostilesedit this local jammer idea can work only if the module is cheap  5 million or less because its destruction is certain it has to be expendable
not supported  all steps should be towards getting players to know more about those around them not less but very definitely not disclosing contact infothe arguments that eliminating local will increase the frequency of pvp just dont hold water  and theyve been discussed over and over  whether you agree with them or not the agruments are presented thereimo  increasing pvp will be best accomplished with carrots luring people into vulnerable positions via the greed factor  how to trigger those without the evils of spawn camping and how and where to removereduce existing iskloot drops to compensate for the new faucets are where the heavy thinking should go i do think misinformation in local is a good idea add signal to noise having people appear falsely in local in ways that make people use social reasoning to guess whether or not its likely that those peoplel would be in their space at that time of day etc  this would increase the importance of chracters knowing about other characters in the game while still making things more difficult for bots and step up incrementally the importance of intel channels etc without forcing people to take shifts watching gates et
diomedes calypso all serious arguments for game design changes deal with quality of pvp not frequency frequency would be a byproduct of quality pvpif this game was designed properly from the start all ships would have roughly 15 au radius of radar visibility  a sphere volume of known space people entering the scanner range would be known people outside scanner range would be unknown thats how nearly all space games operate and they do it for a reasonits stupid that eve is like the only game where scanner range is system wide with no ability to hide from it  even with cloak im pretty certain ccp admitted they didnt design it that way on purpose it was a mistake
we are not talking about entering a ship in space we are talking about entering a ship stored inside your pos ship maintenance array there is a number of ways to implement this for example a ship that you take out of maintenance array will have its shields recharge on its own for the duration of 5 seconds this shield boost ammount will have to be huge or they could make a structure that instanly boosts shields to maximum to balance it you could have this shield booster structure to put pos shields offline or have it enter a cooling period that lasts about 510 minutes so yeah there is really dozens of ways to fix this i support this thread in total

hey leave all my t2 bpos alone im getting filthy stinking rich off them with absolutely no effortliang
not supportedbpo proshigher profit per unit produced from the bpo copy or manufactured itembpo consvery expensive initial investment limited productivity per bpoinvention prosmuch faster bpc generation rate much lower initial investmentoverall higher productivity ratesinvention conslower profit per unitso yes a bpo owner is more or less able to print money from his bpo however the initial investment combined with limited productivity for each bpo means that for t2 items with a high turnover rate invention can actually be more profitable over a given time span the trick as always is to find out which inventions are profitable and which are better left alone as for inventing solely to sell the invented bpc there are way too many industrialists in this game with the skills to invent for themselves to make that line of work anything better than marginally profitable and before you can say that i am a t2 bpo owner who is trying to defend his cash cow i cant afford to buy one of those bpos either so i make do with invention cause i can afford to do that
t2 bpos should have been removed long time ago alreadyfor some odd reason i have hard time believing many csm members want to make stand for it thought2 bpos are bad because in many cases its not even worth inventing bpcs anymore this is how it naturally was going to be at first place
great show of ignorance dbxgoobacopied t2 bpo are the last thing influencing t2 prices the copy time of t2 bpo is longer by a big margin than the production time even using a pos and the copy speed implantsyour problems are one or more of the following1 you are producing stuff with low demand so there is really a competition from bpo owners2 you are competing with guys that think that the datacore they produce the minerals they mine and so on are free3 you dont do your potential profit check before inventing 4 you are inventing ships without checking if decryptors will help you essentially you are doing it wrong and use the t2 bpo as a scapegoat of your errorsjust to add to the list of your failures removal of t2 bpos owners of these bpos have profited enough on these this will help the invention marked substantially at the cost of a very marginal amount of whining t2 bpo are brought and sold regularly check the wts forum so the new owners dont have profited from them beside that you will still find invention non profitable as the reason 2 3 and 4 will still cause you to fail reseed them and use invention for t3 why because you fail at inventing i make plenty of isk inventing and will not like to see my cash cow removed invention t3 use reverse engineering
i only ever got one some silly small ammo thingie which was useless so i flushed it had i only kept it for the four years in anticipation of the recent ammo buff i could have made  ummm a few hundred million or sothe profitability of invention has nothing to do with the existence of bpos if you want to make it better then allow for improving invention me results through a postinvention step andor move all current moon mining materials to pi alchemy gives you the direct invest for bigger margin andor partial selfsufficiency in building materials removes bottlenecks and hurts bpo holder which at this point are null alliancesindividuals by making them either work for their materials or buy off market like everyone elseedit yes that was one across the bow of the holy golden calf of null
alternate solution switch to inventing marauders or hics since there are no t2 bpos for those ships you will make the kind of profits you can expect from other lines if t2 bpos were removed
this also imagine if you accidentally click a gate that leads into sov 00 you could be killed in an instant
if you missioned in lowsec then you could shoot looters griefers etc with only a slight loss of sec statushigh sec is supposed to be noob space if youre still in highsec by the time you can fly a ship that can easily be probed out by griefers then youre playing eve wrong
have you heard of carebears you are the useless one missioning lvl4 with a bs is the easiest way to make moneyand if highsec is a noob space why are there lvl4 missions there
if you mission in lowsec they wouldnt take the mission item theyd gank your shipthere shouldnt be absolutely zero risk for stealing a mission critical item make the can spawn claimed by the corporation of who opens the mission
you want this to avoid pirates whats to stop someone from parking an interdiction sphere or something on the route stupid idea is stupid
yes i know thats why i said that it need a new technology of warp drives to reach enough seed to travel that distances
openspace works as a node like a standard system i think that the session change coud be made while warping making it transparent for the user no you cant reach areas that are not accesibleits not free flyingstargates are there if you want to go fast from a point to another one openspace increases a lot of time needed for travel a secondary route only two reasons to be there avoid dangerous stargates or explore null sec area that are opensapce in both cases you are vulnerable to be detected there
why is this needed i dont see a need for this seems like a useless feature if the gate you have is camped go a different way it will take longer but is saferid rather see ccp fix stuff than do thisnot supported
first game mechanics would need to be changed and i dont think this is even worthy of a patch or a spot in an expansion second pirating would no longer be profitable third too much timeand 4th and most importantly lag
use your edit feature to modify the current trajectory comment in your initial post to say maintain current direction but lose half of its speed every 3 seconds or so so a ship travelling 3000ms will come to an eventual stop or near stop about 20km away from where it died this way it meets both the drift and scatter eye candy effects but also maintains reasonable salvagability now the little scattered bits having no real game effect other than eye candy should jet off the main at random direction and velocity eventually disappearing after 2030sec or so with fewer jetting bits as time goes on for say a minute or so then just the salvagable core remains this allows good visuals of a ship in its death throes now all of these effects except for main body drift should be adjustable in graphics settings to allow for personal preference and graphics card abilitiesneedless to say the slower the ship is travelling at death the shorter the driftdo this and i shall edit my own post to support edit change made support added

edit proposal generalized to simply improve orbitingthe purpose of this proposal is to allow a ship to transistion smoothly into an orbit imigo montoya below suggested that the orbit command takes the current vector into account for the starting vector rather than seemingly picking a random path to orbit with below is my more complicated wishit would be nice if eve had an off set orbiting featureby this i mean one would set an orbital radius preferably at the ships optimal for speed and then also set an near pass distance from the target preferably at the optimal range of the turrets certainly this would be impracticle for many ships by for ships like the vagabond with a 30k falloff it would allow the ship to maintain the speed that is so essential to its survivability while allowing it to bring the full potential of its guns on the target at least some of the time and with that 30k falloff range it would still hit at better than 50 even when its orbit brought it to its farthest distance from the targetclearly if a vagabond pilot could control his ship with say a joystick he would fly this way if he was taking a pounding from missiles so i would suggest that if we are not allowed joystick control then at the very least the game should allow us to setup an offset orbit wishful thinking perhaps but i for one think it would be a nice feature
for clearification this is a tactic that a gunboat would use against a blob of missileboats and it is a tactic i have employed manually with some success but due to the games manual flight controls it is very difficult to achieve and is often counterproductivewhen approaching missileboats transversal doesnt matter you want to get into range as quickly as possible but you then want to smoothly transition into an orbit at best speed if you could hit a nearpass or offset orbit button then you could approach the target nearly as fast as possible hit optimal turret range and then smoothly transition into an orbit for best speed all without risking coming to a complete stop when you hit the orbit button
in general a preset orbital mechanics routine that is programmable before you go into battle wouldnt be a bad idea say set elliptical orbits or as you say the charge in and smoothly transition routine then its select target and then hit whichever orbital piloting tactic you choose then the big thing would be to try to program counterpiloting routines making prior strategic planning just as if not more important than onthefly try to adjust at the limitations of a clunky piloting uidecent idea gonna support it even though i have serious doubts that ccp will put a high priority on this at all too much work in the code
as a modification to that and possibly a better solution overall i would suggest that the orbit command takes the current vector into account for the starting vector rather than seemingly picking a random path to orbit withthis would ultimately give the player more control of their ship
this would difinitely be an elegant adjustment and i would be happy with it
this would be nice  
every ellipse can be defined by its semimajor and semiminor axes ie the maximum and minimum orbit radii let the pilot set both if theyre equal then its a traditional circular orbit
more control for players ships is always better
yes
nice but im not really talking about an ellipse for my tactic the ideal orbit would still be circular only the target wouldnt rest at the center of that orbit however a close pass elliptical orbit that would smoothly degrade into a circle would be an improvement over the current gameall in all i think imigo above gives the simplist solution an orbit command that takes the current vector into account for the starting vector rather than seemingly picking a random path to orbit with

compulsory to make fat nerds cry
i suppose i am undecided i would say optional if station interaction via a 3d interface is simply vanity if however new landlubber skills will be introducted that will make it risky to interact with the crowd in station then i say it should be compulsary though i must admit that i know practically nothing about the plans for incarna
optional for existing game mechanicswhen i came to eve from eb i found it a feature that i didnt have to run from station terminal to station terminal to do the things i wanted to doill never miss trying to find the re terminal through the mob that was forever clustered around itfrom the standpoint of immersion finding that shady character off in the corner of the station was kind of ruined when there were 20 other players talking to him at the same timeand if we have to go talk face to face with our agents to get missions toras egassuo in motsu had better have an auditorium for an office
undecidedif its not particularly slow and it doesnt involve needless running around it shouldnt im happy to have it be eitheri would prefer them to do whatever takes less dev time so they can get on with adding actual features
bump for further consideration especially point 1also perhaps for station items sorting by date placed in teh hangar ie items you never use would show up at the bottom items you just put in andor take output in frequently at the top much like date modified sorting for windows folders basically by default new items append the end of the list but as soon as you resort everythigns a mess again it would make sorting new loot easier i think might stack up on cache for the auditing though
well my troll sensor is screaming but i will humor the stupidity why does it need an extra low and not a mid which would make it useful
which slot are you going to lose to compensate on each ship low or high
neither of those two ships problem is the single midslot
if you are unable to burn a frigate down with 250300dps20km at your disposal then the fail is in you and not the hullwhat she said how do you propose to gimp the preeminent damage projectors of the light class for the unique ability to solocoercer is godly when fittedflown right and retribution is a fat pregimped obsoleted ship read af which is supposedly slated for an update no point to this request
the retri and coer are fine and do not need a second mid if you want a ship that has a second mid go fly another shipifwhen the 4th frig damage bonus come i hope ccp realize that the retri is a pure gank and tank ship an will give it a 4th damage bonus rather then give it an extra midpeople who suggest it lose its utility high for a mid are also gimping the ship further actuallyretri is a very nice af specilized for mid range dps and well tanked it peforms well in gangs and thats what it should keep doing
it should be left up to the voters if the community votes for so many cadidates from a single entity that is what the community wants youre also ignoring the fact that ccp is going to ignore the csm if the only thing that they make is lol proposals that benefit only the entity they are a part of

i posted a new post on my blog and am answering tons of questions over on scrapheap see this thread 
here we have a member of the ally found guilty in the most notorious exploitusage in wormholes to date particulary that bug with infinite turret range in magnetars member of the ally dreaming of allwh domination who will likely continue serving this ally as a csm member with all his work there being first of all with the idea of his allycorp and only then of all the other wormhole dwellerspersonally i do not understand not only why he is here criminals should not get to politics but why he was not banned together with everyone else in his corp for that exploit usage
i personally am outraged about thisjust kidding i have no idea what youre talking about a shame really theres probably all sorts of fun drama that like 4 people know about
4 people description of what they were doing
lynch em
i actually talk about this a fair bit on my blog we were punished by ccp if you dont agree with that punishment take it up with themmy intention is certainly not to just represent the interests of my corporation for this election the residents of 00 space have decided to run their own slates of candidates to try to control the csm agenda i think the significant fraction of players that live in wormhole space also deserve some representation
so honest question any thoughts to the interaction as we noticed on shc between you and the other csm 6 candidate meissa dont take it the wrong way but your posts there were rather a case of backpedalling but since that is shc and this is the eve forums maybe it is better here to give some insight into the whole exploit topic without things like this post there
well the official list is out and i am listed nicely in the middlewhat is interesting is the number of new zealand candidates that are running this time i should contact them and see what we have in common and organise drinks or somethingwhat is also interesting is the number of i will represent your issues candidates buy this i mena candidates that have expressed only a desire to represetn the eve players while i personally find this laudable i think candidates should also have opinions on something why else would they be doing this just my thoughts would be interested to hear what you think
so back to afk cloaking i would assume the problem is not people just leaving the pc cloaked for a few hours in a system but people who go afk all day deliberately probably with alts covering several systems to be annoying while they go to work or whatever  not just afk but afh away from home with no mouse clicks or anything i know it irritates me im surprised that if there isnt any activity on an account after 2 hours that the server doesnt boot them surely its unnecessary load on the server
1 logistics apparently ccp think its too easy its about time someone sat them down and made them do a logistics chain see how easy they think it is when doing long boring freighter runs to keep 00 systems and markets stocked i also would love to see the csm pushing for making ihubs and upgrades smaller to allow jfs to carry them if ccp truely want small allainces to populate 00 then they need to change teh current mechanics which heavily favour the omg we love your tears griefer crowd who have no interest in sov but happily camp the empire00 pipes2 poss badly needs redoing completely seperating from regular corp roles so there can be more security with private poss eg pos roles not allowing global access to build slots etc maybe even allaince roles reviewing to allow research poss to be useful3 pimarket does eve seriously have enough marketindustrialists to support a fully player driven market given the huge spikes in pi goods specifically pos fuels maybe an artifical cap of the npc sell orders would be in order i also worry primarily about the market as eves new chars will be hard pressed to get equipment if they all have to go to jita to get rare mods that no one else is interested in eg reg t1 gear
i would agree here people leaving to deal with reallife is not an issue in my eyes others might see it different as for the afh i can agree that it breaks my riskreward concept of eve i have always seen eve as a balance of riskreward for all activities and the afk cloaking offers little to no risk for a large reward in disrupting your targets operations hence my oposition to it if it is someone there actively hunting then that is different
1 although im probably biased as i know you from cls im quite sure you would do a great job were you to be chosen for csm2 on planetary interaction  ccp needs desperately to simplify the way it currently works i already have a job and the complexity currently involved inpi is too much like another one perhaps all the manipulation needed to make a final product could be done by entering values into a speadsheet ap or by making choices on a few drop down lists paying the isk and supplying the modules to make it all happen although pi is currently very lucrative the time involvment is too high for a more casual player like myself and probably many others who play eve for a bit of escape from the real headaches of the workaday world
knowing sj i read this as questions about my stand on these issues 1 00 logistics is hard time consuming and risky even counting the changes of jump freighters and jump bridges and titan bridges there is still a large risk thus alliances take large actions to reduce teh risks blobing the freighter runs up and having large escort fleets this in turn means the attacker has to bring more firepower to attack the logistics train so the defender brings more defense  rinse and repeat all this does is add to the blob mentality supply chain and the riskreward in operating them is something ccp should be constantly monitoring am i against jump bridgestitan bridges no but i think the riskreward level needs to be looked at to balance it with other logistics options if these means introducing other logistics options then i am more than willing to try that and give feedback to ccp2 agree completely poss are no longer the mainstay of holding a system they are an industrial resource for mining and production and need to be rebalanced to align with this use as for the interface adn genarl pos system i agree and have mentioned the flogging a dead horse pos thread a number of times as something the csm should be taking to ccp3 as a heavy investor in pi i like theisk i am making but i think we need more information about the uptake and use of pi like mnufacturing to meet supply maybe we ned to allow those that are doing it to do more easier or make it easier for others to do to get them interested this certainly needs looking at i know that balance is unbalanced because i can make more on a time invested basis from my pi than i can from a time investment for mining minerals  and that is not right as for making it easier to get more people doing it i put a couple of suggestions into the 1000 papercuts thread the primary one is allowing players to import and export to corp hangers from pi starports a lot of time is spent collecting the output from the planets and then moving it round to secondary manufacturing points i know personally if i could export it all to a corp hanger and then have a single character fly round and collect it then that would be much better
thats what ive done past years looking from the outside as for voting it hasnt started yet
think prom is the only csm candidate that is running for more then a social circle jerk i cant see someone who clearly puts so much time effort and emorage into solo pvp not being the best candidate
definitely an important voice in any csm discussions about rebalancingtweaking the pvp aspect of eve has the practical knowledge to see how any potential changes will affect things and the conviction to really force these issues best of luck
i like your focus on command ships i maxed them and maxed fleet command then they came out with tech iii i agree they crafted tech iii such that it steps on too many tech ii toes and all the training that goes into tech ii ships i thought the purpose of tech iii was to give adaptibility in one hull not adaptibility and superiority to tech iialso it appears goons felt threatened enough by your views on combat mechanics and political devolution in the game to bring their propaganda attempts into your thread although i could be wrong not having read many of the candidate platforms yet and they may have done so for every nongoon candidate  i also like how you answered them we are going to need that on the next csm loaded with goon and nc most likelyi started out my voting process this time around with a bias against voting for any candidtate in a 00 powerbloc but im impressed enough with your views and abilities to answer bull that i may vote for you anyway notwithstanding my bias
notsureifsrsjpghavent read your website cose well its too friggin hard to read are you serious dark grey font on a black bg feels like a big troll to me
you shall have my vote
thanks a lot not tamberjust to clarify one thing during csm 4 there was still a term limit in place and i wanted to absolutely be in csm 5 to have the chance for continuity on my efforts in csm 3 the terms were 6 months then so it was a case of either not running at all or run for an alternate seat no limit on alternate seats so i went with that and purposefully ran for an alternate seat for csm 4 so i could still participate in the debates and have a hands on approach but without the iceland trips which i knew from experience to still be an effective place to be
dont take this the wrong way youre a leavel headed guy and it is clear from the summit minutes that you can participate quite clearly but if elected are you planning to participate in the meetings and in the general communications to us players more than before i mean you really give a strong impression that you just show up just before and after events and for the rest youre completely invisible and often absent as well if theres one lesson from csm 5 it is that constant consistant and transparant communication is a must in part for reasons of dealing with ccp pressure management see the example of the backlog and the hansoft case but also in keeping players voters informed in general theres more to life than just a convo or private talk especially if the idea is to get a job well doneim sure you get where this comes from its just we rarely see anything from you  except just before and just after events and well that leaves gaps
valid concernstldr yes sorry communication is part of the job yesfirst and foremost i wasnt a public personna before running for the first time and have never been interested in being one i didnt post much i was more of a lurker for none of the past elections was there more than minimal interest in my candidacy thread and thats fine really what i did was campaign on a more personal level reach out to subgroups that have their own different forums on which i post or contact people directly or have them contact me directly those are the places where i communicated the mostfor the rest i dont think repeating what others have said to bring anything of value chiming in me too just to get attention really isnt my style so i post only if i have something meaningful to add defend a point of view that isnt represented or provide informationclarification when arguments are going on about things i know to be untrue that kind of thing posting isnt a hobby of mine reading is howeverbut yes ive come to recognize lately that some expect me to be more active publicly that seldom is well received however because i insist on holding a moderate point of view recognising both sides and that usually irritates people who tend to have one sided views cfr the posts i had made about incarna mynxee qualifies me as too diplomatic its just my nature i cant do dichotomy pthat being said once held i defend positions tooth and nailsas for some of my absence mid last term theres been a number of rl constraints that led to some absences indeed i wont elaborate on that here however also the periods that are not beforeafter meetings are usually slow but yes ill be happy to say youre right i have no excuse doesnt mean i was ignoring my responsibilities the minutes of the iceland meetings dont say who saiddid what and thats a good thing but i can assure you i was well prepared on all the subjects brought up made significant points during discussions etc i post on the csm forums in csm email correspondences etc all in line with my usual way carefully thought to the point and constructiveas far as your statement about communication i agree that it requires constance and consistency and i do believe it has had that csm communication usually is precluded by a series of email about it and i post my comments there to make sure csm messages represent my position the last point on your comm list is transparency thats one point where ill beg to differ a bit theres a clear advantage to being able to have discussions behind closed doors sometimes like on the internal csm forums where we can have clear unpoluted and civilized mostly p discussions with devs are invaluable yet theyre not open the outcome is transparent howeveralso keep in mind communication is only half the job the more important part is getting stuff done to talk about thats where i shine
cc having a moderate delegate or two on the csm is not so bad it does tend to tone down some of us who may tend to be a bit more cough stridently onesided in our opinions its clear from working together on csm5 that you arrive at your opinions only after careful thought and examination of all angles that was very helpful at summits and also in one or two of our more energetic internal discussionsgood luck in your bid for a csm6 seat
i think you are missing a point though i appreciate the candid response either wayback in october last year there was a lot of talk about pressure management as part of the instrumentation provided by most notably ccps ceo i cant take credit for coining that triangle of transparancy consistancy  communication but they are the foundation to any interaction between a company and an external stakeholder but on two levels within the interaction and outside of that interaction  because there is more than the loop between the stakeholder and its hostthe csm can communicate even consistantly and transparantly with ccp as you say behind closed doors that is productive and constructive it is needed but it is but one side of the coin as without the pressure management instrumentation an external stakeholder has only the individual will of people in the host company as both validation and sanction this is why smart companies put emphasis on providing an instrumentation of pressure management for the external stakeholder ccp has done sothe example posted in mittens thread of the backlog issue which was a case of vague statements and excuses lets be honest is a good example it was not until the csm made the matter transparant to players by means of communiccating on it and engaging on the topic in a consistant manner the topic being out there created a noticable pressue on its own but once players picked up on it and one guy did the work himself the pressure management case was complete up to that point there had been personal appeal argumentation discussion etc but no results once the pressure management was put in place there were results and that pressuree management was enabled through applying those 3 concepts to the interaction between the csm and playersmaybe that clarifies it more on that particular topic the outcome was for a long long time not transparent at all until pressure management was applied i trust you see the difference between this approach and that of hurf blruf fist on table which has nothing to do with pressure management whatsoever on the contrary ccp walked out of eve a long time ago because of it the consequences of which we face today still if there is one thing positive of all of it from csm 5 it is the visible efforts from zulu to rejoin the dynamic of eve once again something which is significant in its own right for many reasonsat the end of the day the one thing i hope to see in csm 6 is for that csm as a team to never shy away from applying the so very needed accountability in these things not because of absence of trust in ccp but because it is what works and ccp can handle that well after all that is exactly what their company values are about
i like theoretical considerations as much as the next home philosopher but ill try and keep the wording simple and not delve into side definition considerations as the first instance of my reply was heavily into  so first i dont agree with your assumption that that triangle transparency consist  comm is be the foundation to any interaction between a company and an external stakeholder at least not the kind of transparency or communication we were talking about in the previous post ccpcsm as opposed to csmplayers or ccpplayers and consistency is frequently a synonym for immutability i expect someone i go the trouble of talking to to be able to change opinions in the face of sensible arguments and therefore to be by definition inconsistent i however people to be consistent in their engagements bah definitions either way i agree they are vital in their amended formi think the backlog issue getting resolved didnt happen the way you describe it we requested it in csm 2 where we got told not a chance in hell paraphrasing csm 3 said maybe later for our own issues csm 4 made csm a stakeholder csm 5 made it clear we needed it and we got it saying it happened all of a sudden during csm 5 because of forum rage amounts to ignoring the contributions past csm have made in getting ccp to accept that idea in the first place it didnt happen as a consequence of the people outrage and outcry the public reaction was a symptom of our own continuous frustration but there was a clear indication we were heading there even without the public manifestation of exasperation im outside my country for work atm ill find the relevant sections of csmccp meetings later if you wantin that instance surely comm  transparency ccpcsm played important parts but not transparency csmpublic not that im saying it doesnt matter its extremely important but it wasnt a cause here rather it helped reinforce the public belief in the csm doing what was required to perform its perceived function as player representation and was therefore a correlation onlyalso i do agree ccp zulu coming back or rather coming to the front is a godsend in ccp following your magic triangle not being sarcastic just humour attempt it is significant it is welcome and it is a very good sign his predecessor barely bothered to show up during csmccp meetings zulu is practically always there bless the mani expect indeed csm 6 to be able to keep putting pressure and hopefully to cease being seen as hostile by some but rather really a stake holder in the pure sense of the word someone to work with rather than fight against weve made great progress on that front with one high profile roadbumps but heh i just hope the elected members manage to keep their ego and sense of entitlement in rein because theres lots of potential for that among the candidates
not him i hope to god im not that terrible at huge posts his shc posts are usually right on the mark tho even if they make everyones eyes bleed with walls of text its not a theoretical consideration either way no philosophy required p its a common concept in stakeholderhost interactions it is a little bit different with ccp since they took the democratic angle but yeah well i suppose it fits with eve as a sandbox where players drive the events either way no need to reinvent the wheel we can be happy that ccp acknowledged these things i was part of the firaxis team for civ v and that was a classic example of how not to run a stakeholder group for a software service product we had the exact same issue you describe where consistancy becomes immutability the result of which was the publisher interaction grinding to an immediate halt the results of which are well rather visible in civ vas much as there has been an evolution of sorts for csm as an experiment unlike virt i dont think the first csm implementation was one of damage control on top of honest intentions to end up growing into a useful instrument but one which part of ccp seems to have serious trouble with i dont think we can take it as a continuity case while bits and pieces went from one to the next each csm broke a chain so to say hence why i hope that from csm 5 to csm 6 that will not be the casei agree with bartholomaeus on shc btw that csm 5 really did wake up ccp in many ways not so much along the lines of holy  rage tbh i saw more from csm 5 last year to keep rage constructive and directed than what i saw from ccp but in a realisation among many that 1 ccp at a time moved away from the environment they created and 2 ccp had lost the understanding of applicable perspectives rather than pure metrics but it is also clear that ccp got split in a way with csm look at the difference between team gridlock and team incarna not as people but as cases of interactionthats where i fear for csm 6 got to be honest there csm 5 did not through intention highlight and show insight into a lot of causes of issues we players have had to deal with over the last few years ive seen ccp for a fair few years now and there is always a reaction against that usually that of the cold shoulder and often that of playing the party trumpet  while neither gives any opening for getting anywhere other than the next awesome media showwhich takes us back to pressure management unlike barth and virt i do not think that ccp still are honest in their company values i think they lost those when they went from medium sized company to a multi national distributed firm but maybe i am wrong but i would damn prefer to see people on the csm 6 who can constructively engage in pressure management based on those 3 simple things applied to both directions simply because without that were back to square one with ccp especially in the aftermath of what is going to be a struggle with wht sch calls team awesome that does not conflict with nda or facetime it reinforces itand that is why i asked you my original question because well you always seemed to drop out of sight and where one person can reach for a convo the common capsuleer userbase does depend on independant media these days for information and insight maybe now its fully clear
while obviously i believe that all your votes are belong to me if you have your heart set on meissa then your vote will be well castmeissa has a sharp mind and a detailed knowledge of eve he defends his positions both well and fairly weve disagreed about things but those disagreements were never arguments and were always productivei hope well both have the opportunity to serve on csm6good luck meissa
that mittens is a moron but youre too much of a  to post that
im voting for mittani as this is internet spaceships and whats the worst that can happenbut one quick question for mittanii have read a few of your tentonhammer articles and you assert dominion sov is brokenspeaking as someone who has not really experienced sov battles or maintaining sov except for a few weeks in what was initiative spacein what way is sov broken
it is interesting your point of view about the csm electionsi agree that have been a lot of misconception about what the csm really is like you said it is not about getting me a hulk with more power or whateverbut everyone goes in the same direction 00 spacei know for a fact that goonswarm is the big one in eve i know you operate in 00also most of the candidates always focus on 00for me that is frustrating what if i donUFFFDt want to play my gamestyle in low sec or 00should i be happy about whats going on in high sec nomore and more ccp gets more content more 00 stuff what about the reststop the content for a while balance the game fix the bugsthis is what i think everyone not only the candidates should doim so tired of listen people talking about 00 pvp is not only in 00 you knowbad boys kill us in 00 with big guns and big ships and we the no00 guys kill you in high sec in the market in manufacturing and so onbut for the regular player that dont even have a feel for pvp im one i prefer to play at my pace doing what i like the problem is the game have also itUFFFDs problems in high sec be that the economy that is not balanced the bugs and many other problems sure eve is a better place that it was like 3 years ago when i started donUFFFDt take me wrong please but iUFFFDm tired of listen to people talking only about 00 and whatUFFFDs going on in low sec or wh space in fact i do like whthere are many things for a high sec player that should be improved but it seams no one talks about it when some new stuff gets developed by ccp about 70 of a update is stuff about 00missions sux for example they are unbalanced and most of the times the rewards sux sure i know in 00 things get more rewarding i dont want to mine jaspet in 09  i understand very well the riskreward ratio and i agree with it for a noob the game is almost impossible to learn unless you get some help the interface is very confusing and you get lost searching for infoi got a couple of friends that are really nerds about gaming and every single of them had problems learning the gamesure i admit the eve is complex but do really the way a player interacts with the game need to be so complex tooitUFFFDs almost impossible for a relative new player to venture into low sec with out having a huge corp to back it up like it is almost impossible a med sized corp to conquer anything in 00 because years of playing made the big ones king there goonswarm included  not that is all badi think if you really talk from the heart and it seams to me you are you understand many aspects of my point of viewdonUFFFDt intend this as a critic to you your corp or alliance this is a general critical about my view of the game and of course to short since this is not the placeif you can assure that you kick ccp ass providing good and honest feedback to them about us the player base you have my votejust remember you and everyone there is more then 00 space and more then a sound bugbest regards and fly safekar
i have a pretty good relationship with the ccp staff ive met over the years though usually its in the context of lets go get completely ed up rather than you are a dev and i am going to hump your leg about spaceships i think you may be mistaking my pledge to be a manipulative bastard to be a promise to bang my shoe on a podium and throw a tantrum which wouldnt be particularly cunning manipulative or bastardy this is something that cropped up earlier in the thread as well you can zealously represent the playerbase without antagonizing your ccp interlocutors needlessly
mittens gets an ork votefix it big man
christ dont even get me started the dominion system was intended to have two halves to its features the idea was that you would cut out the old poswar mechanic with the ihubtcusbu system on the one hand and increase the population density of 00 with upgrades and an automated treaty system on the other the treaty system was there to help larger alliances shelter and develop smaller alliances either through rent or tribute or whatever it had a locational standings system blue in this constellation and this pipe neutral elsewhere as well as an automated payment collection setup when dominion was released the entire treaty feature was thrown into the gulag of the backlog never to be seen again this meant that you had the solidify power segments of dominion invoked  upgrades sbu system ihubs etc  without the mechanic to get new alliances started in nullsec power has solidified and with the exception of bort theres no real new blood in nullsec its just us same old grizzled great warriors hanging out on jabber pursuing ancient grudges actually theres not even grudges to fuel us its a lot of hon and lol and wot also while im not a game designer and the csm is explicitly not for game designer wannabes people dont really enjoy the sov system much alliances lose their sov when they cascade through other means usually griefing not because of headsup conquest thats because the structure shots are just so utterly boring ughin the predominion system goonswarm at its peak held 10 regions even though poswar was a pain it was fairly entertaining and you could enjoy conquest for its own sake in dominion theres not much impetus for serious conquest just because its so boring goonswarm holds one region half of which is given to our allies at any given moment plus some jump bridges down to fountain we have a tight sov footprint and while thats probably better for the game than us owning half the galaxy like we used to its highly unlikely that well lose deklein ever also supercapitals should die a lot more death to supercapitals they enhance the dominion sucks experience and they have a tremendous lagwake due to fighterbombers and god knows what else ugh words
i snipped some of your post so i can have some room to reply while i am the leader of a nullsec bloc i am not a nullsec only candidate there are a scandalous number of features lost in ccps backlog and only a tiny proportion have anything to do with nullsec theres an even greater number of proposals the csm has approved that are in an separate backlog ccp comes up with ideas implements half of them and drops the other half by patch timecsm upvotes player issues a tiny proportion get implemented the rest languish these are the two vectors by which the backlog grows so yes  im from a nullsec bloc i lead one i know a lot about nullsec even though i am secretly a big pve guy i wish eve had pve half as fun as wow so i could actually have fun in this game when not at warmurdering people in pvpdying in pvp why should you care about my candidacybecause im not promising to add features to the backlog im not saying hey i can do xyz for you empire guy instead im going to try to make the csm into a more effective advocate to get the things lost in the shadows from csm1csm5 addressed  and a ton of those features and player proposals impact your game if youre in empire or in lowsec theyve already been approved by popular acclamation theyre just rotting wasting away ugh anyway thats the poop
i dont like goons i dont trust goonsthat said you have done a fine job returning goons to nullsecyour organizing abilities are provenit will make me sick to my stomach if i vote for you questiondo you believe that forming an coalition between alliances be like a wardec and be paid for ive read posts on this subject and was wondering if you had any thoughts on thisi like to see more work done on the ui hud pi and the bounty system keep up with the bug fixes and lag issuesgood luck in the votingrhed gbc
i support this product andor service
how would that be enforced exactly if two alliances informally agree to not shoot each other are ccp supposed to sneak a gm into teamspeak to monitor which targets are being called
oh wellif im falling for a trap might as well fall for the most obvious one
im willing to vote for mitts but theres a 300 mill isk prevote security deposit hell get it back right after the electionplease send 300mill per vote up to 5 to this character thanks
theyre all in the same backlog which is just a hansoft database in that database csm items are tagged so that they can be identified as csm items and so that it is easier to do a query for all csm items in the backlog to produce a working list of what has not yet been selected for implementationrelated to that a useful effort by csm 6 would be to identify backlogged csm items that have become obsolete due to eves evolution there are likely to be at least a few such items in there ccp doesnt seem to do any focused weeding out of items however it is possible that teams who are reviewing the backlog to identify stories to propose during sprint planning could notice obsolete csm items now that they are finally identifiable as csm items and bring them to the csms attention but at the end of the day this is a task that the csm should probably do as a special project maybe every other term would require working from a list provided by csm advocates since csm does not have even read access to the backlog although that has been requested via our advocates and directly to ccp oveur in the october meeting
why would it matter if the items are obscure or not ccp obviously isnt working on it as it isgotta walk in stations guyswalkinstations
i would imagine he wants people to have to pay upkeep for blue standings in which case red would become the new blue if it cost to have standings at all then all of the northern coalition alliances would simply disband and their corporations join morsus mihi and if population numbers mandated morsus mihi 2 morsus mihi 3 etc the problem with trying to get players to suffer a negative thing is that players affected by the new negative thing will do their best to avoid it
as i understand it the backlog is a living list of stories in the agile meaning of story that is constantly referenced added to updated and reprioritized during each development cycle so its not exactly accurate to say that ccp isnt working on the backlog items from the backlog inform each development cycle problem is the stories that players may desire to get some attention dont always manage to bubble to the top and get assigned to a sprint team still csm5 had some real successes in getting ccp to implement a number of backlogged csm items we wrote a devblog about that and there have been other backlogged csm items implemented since then as well
sure why not got a vote incoming from me
if youre not voting for the mittani than youre voting for the terrorists
the mittani has my votenone of these internet spaceship pixels are real its a game games are about fun this dude makes me laugh players is what makes this game fun clicking on a target and pressing f1 and waiting till it asplodes  is like microwaving baked potatoes  boring this guy adds tinfoilquestion for you mittani  who would you like to see on the csm with you
im glad he makes you laugh you should already know the people he wants to be on the csm with him as hes orchestrated the whole block voting process with them already ya big dufusenjoy your freedom such a rebel
i believe he might just have a list
i love all the political ignoramuses who think that a vote for mittens is a vote against the system really fills your heart with hope for the future of the world when people are that easily duped
would you like to tell us how the csm came to its existence please detail the events leading up to the formation of the first csm seriouspost
thanks for the replybest of luck with helping to fix eve
dude its a game 00fake edit double posting like a boss
dear mr sokrateszspoongate has nothing to do with my negative perceptions of your capabilities only your direct actions or lack thereof for that matter have any bearing on my decision to firmly say not a chance in hell and shout just so from the tallest amarrian spires
based on your campaign message you are one of my top five favorite candidates congratulations precently ive focused heavily on trading and processing pi commodities in and around jita this has been very lucrative for me increasing my net worth from 100m to 1100m in just two months it is a very complex and financially risky way of making money and i have a massive excel spreadsheet dedicated to it but i am beginning to master the art of jita trade coming from world of warcraft i absolutely love eves free market system and intuitive market interface but there is a key element of my moneymaking that i find absolutely horrible the planetary interaction interface itselfccp made a couple important improvements with incursion but almost nothing to aid people like myself who overlook harvesting completely and focus on processing what others have harvested and have put on the market with 123 advanced industry facilities and 24 launchpads on my six planets in sobaseki switching schematics and routes to account for shifts in the market can take upwards of 3000 clicks when it could feasibly be programmed to take a tenth of that excluding any clicks outside of the pi interface on top of that i have to wait ten seconds each time i wish to import or export from each of my launchpads a feature intended to prevent lag i assume which may only make it take about seven minutes longer than it should but is still a headache there are other less important grievances i have with pi cant view the contents of planetary customs offices without being in the same system etc but i feel like ive ranted long enoughand so my question to you is this do you share my feelings about further pi reform being absolutely critical to the economic and industrial aspects of the game and if elected will you lobby ccp on behalf of me and all the other planetary industrialists in new eden
and we didnt do it for that reason in the past but the rumour sure is persistent pthere have been several proposals originating from the community that dealt with the clickfest and to my knowledge we approved them all we were under the impression that there was some iterating going to be done there but recently its been pushed to the background a bit with all the incarna rabble so it needs a status update if fanfest does not show signs of improvement its time for some action because this is a returning concernabsolutely crititcal  not sure if i agree there but it definitely was a nice a ddition that just needs some more development to become mature it also has the potential of giving more power to the little man if ccp finally decide to do something about moongoo
it was more of a funny poke then a jab i wish ya luck sok
thought so  thanks
not exactly looks like just one pi proposal that csm5 raised and voted on granted it was an omnibus which collected together a bunch of pirelated ideas from players is pi iteration something you will specifically pursue during csm6 and if so how will you go about that
well yes it was just one proposal my initial statement wasnt entirely correct but if you look here
thank you for your support thanks im enjoying the process so farwell im not on the csm at the moment however i agree that communications can be improved particularly coming from ccp its 3 on my list of goals im going to pursue with them in facton the csm side teadaze has done a great job keeping up the csm database particularly the meeting minutes if im elected thats a job im willing to continue and im willing to host that database during csm6s term tea treb and mynxee also kept blogs during their term though semiinfrequently updated and if im elected that will be something else that ill be doing is regularly and frequently blogging regularly about goingson and as ive already stated ill run regular player roundtables to gather player input on csm topicsi track mineral values pretty religiously because of what i do industrywise in the game the qens are a good source of info about the causes of market fluctuations though i tend to think that the qens represent one persons opinion about those causes rather than actual facts sometimes i do think players should have had more input into the drone alloys nerf and the mission loot nerf  that second one especially as a former l4 mission runner its something that i would have pressed ccp on pretty closelythis is a great question youre right that alpha volley damage is playing a huge role in eve right now if we continue to see alpha tactics being used to overcome logi moving the armor rep cycle to the top of the cycle rather than the bottom would probably be a good ideathese are all really good questions keep em coming
i dont believe most people relize just what a time commitment a csm isare your able to make these time commitmentshow much time will you be spending on the csmalso i would like to say you are one of the better runners as you have a real undestanding of what goes on your short post however fails to encapsulate your platform and i sugest people actually read that
youre absolutely right the summits in iceland get a lot of press but the csm does a ton of work in between on their internal forums with ccp at the monthly meetings and keeping eve players aware of their activities in talking with mynxee she has told me to do a proper job as a csm delegate requires 56 hours per week of work im willing to commit that time and probably a bit more if i pick up the responsibility for keeping up the csm database from teadaze something im willing to dothanks for your support people are interested can read the posts tagged jester on my blog that cover my positions and opinions on the game there are 12 such posts as of today so its a good spread of material the critical ones are also linked on the right side of the page under csm6 candidacy
in an easy week  it can go way up when prepping for a summit addressing a special issue that requires a lot of discussion and possibly research or writing official csm blogs and minutes but of course that depends on how much you choose to participate in such activities i have every confidence that you will be a substantial contributor lets hope that csm6 has a bigger ratio of such contributors rather than delegates whose participation in csm group work amounts to nothing more than yeah looks fine

based on your campaign message you are one of my top five favorite candidates congratulations precently ive focused heavily on trading and processing pi commodities in and around jita this has been very lucrative for me increasing my net worth from 100m to 1100m in just two months it is a very complex and financially risky way of making money and i have a massive excel spreadsheet dedicated to it but i am beginning to master the art of jita trade coming from world of warcraft i absolutely love eves free market system and intuitive market interface but there is a key element of my moneymaking that i find absolutely horrible the planetary interaction interface itselfccp made a couple important improvements with incursion but almost nothing to aid people like myself who overlook harvesting completely and focus on processing what others have harvested and have put on the market with 123 advanced industry facilities and 24 launchpads on my six planets in sobaseki switching schematics and routes to account for shifts in the market can take upwards of 3000 clicks when it could feasibly be programmed to take a tenth of that excluding any clicks outside of the pi interface on top of that i have to wait ten seconds each time i wish to import or export from each of my launchpads a feature intended to prevent lag i assume which may only make it take about seven minutes longer than it should but is still a headache there are other less important grievances i have with pi cant view the contents of planetary customs offices without being in the same system etc but i feel like ive ranted long enoughand so my question to you is this do you share my feelings about further pi reform being absolutely critical to the economic and industrial aspects of the game and if elected will you lobby ccp on behalf of me and all the other planetary industrialists in new eden

no just that popular support is one factor in the filtering process that eventually results in something getting added to the csm backlog and lets be honest a backlog item without significant support from players is just going to lie there and rot  especially now that the prioritization crowdsourcing is giving ccp some metrics on what changes the players want the mostalso csms are elected to represent the players so we should be responsive to player concerns we cant very well complain about ccp not engaging with csm if were not willing to drink our own koolaid and in my case that means a lot of time monitoring threads occasional posts in them asking questions or making suggestions helping players format proposals and so on
i have been toying with pi since its introduction so i share your concerns in fact one of the significant proposals i raised during csm5 was the planetary interaction omnibus proposal which was aimed at giving ccp some feedback to help them with the iteration of pii see no reason why another proposal cant be put together and even improved by a little prioritization in other words a pi version of the ui low hanging fruit proposal and theres no need to wait until csm6 takes office btwwith respect to the rerouting clickfest i think it would not be hard to generate significant player support for some sort of autoroute feature where you can specify what kind of products p0p1etc a storage pin provides and accepts then reconfiguring your production would be a matter of just changing the schematics filling up the source storage pins and telling the installation to rebuild its routesas for the importexport delays it cant hurt to ask ccp if these can be relaxed now that they have more experience with pi load factors it may be something that can be revisitedfinally it was suggested to me by another player that i create a thread for gathering science  industry microtweak ideas similar to the one ive been running in missions  complexes for the last few weeks ive done that and you should consider posting the importexport delays change there as it would seem to fit right in
as far as i know this man has the biggest credit for making the csm believable and deserves a place in csm6 probably as far as public perception is concerned trebor could be thought of one of the founding father of the csm and his name will shine along other stars in the history of online gaming i can continue trebor but this will cost you some isk otherwise you can take this as a captatio benevolentiaei get to the point have you ever considered a different approach about the nullsec problem you cant defend yourself if you dont put up a blob whats the problem the blob or the fact that you cant defend yourself otherwiseusually we think that the blob is the problem and the natural solution would involve some measures to nerf the ability to form blobs but if i were able to defend my structures otherwise i would not need to put up a blob potentially i would even be able to say screw you to my blues far far away because i would not need them the central point is anyway achieving security of my stuff in space in a non conventional way semi  invisibility based on chance would be one there could be others if i am reasonably sure that my structures can run for at least 4 days giving me a net profit even if they are destroyed afterwards i will use them i have a dream a nullsec map covered by the colors of alliances that control sovereignty stuff outposts poses and moon goo and a guerrillasmuggling parallel underworld living on small semiinvisible installations whose survivability is bound to invisibility and chance some possible consequencesnullsec life would be less empirelike but at the same time population would increaseregular sov holders alliances will fight their internal enemy on a daily basis while their sovereignty poses and outposts are safe smugglers and small entities would be able to survive even if with some difficultiesof course there are some things that should change possibly local chat to reduce visibility to the smugglersguerrillas possibly pi should be allowed for everybody others must be created pi warfare new semiinvisible installations while other things will remain the same jbs outposts moon mining substantially should remain sov holders prerogativeshere i exposed you my most up to date toughts on nullsec what do you think
having put most of my net worth into the lottery i can offer only a meagre 1 isk per word but 2 iskword if its good latinwith respect to your nullsec ideas i think that as with any plan that involves big changes it will have to attract significant support in the community and survive a lot of hard debate before it even has a chance of attracting any attention from the devs particularly in light of the players dont do game design philosophy of some at ccp
i like the way you talk
the secondary issues you speak of are high on the list of things many csm candidates want to address the key thing to communicate them convincingly and even that is subject to the whims of ccps resource allocation as for the united front causing things to be forgotten you neednt be worried this wouldnt be the first time the csm has shown a united front members of all past csm terms have come together to present a united front on many issues its not a novel concept the only time when i can see it being an issue is if it were to involve a group mindset of not caring about communicating with the community at large not just some group of constituents in corpalliance forums that is something that i will help make sure doesnt happen
cearaini love a good rant as you put it  the thing is i cant be all things to all players in terms of expertise what i can be is someone that listens to players concerns and expresses them very effectively to ccpchampioning small gangsolo pvp is not news many want it ccp knows they want it but other priorities set long before csm5 was in office and probably extending past csm6s term to be honest affect how much the message will resonate with ccp think back to the june summit when it was clear incarna was getting the lions share of development resources hopefully after incarna 10 rolls out there will be more dev resources available to look at some of these play style concerns like small gangsolo pvpim not going to bull folks and promise you unicorns and fairies what i can promise is to keep bringing these kind of issues up that are widely wanted and well supported by players more importantly i want to encourage more regular and substantive communication from ccp about their plans theres that word again for that play style among others and how they want to address it in general terms
what are your views on the new supercarriers and fighterbombers do you see any problem with how far they were buffed offensively
of course i see problems i already touched on this previously and ill quote part of what i said againwith the exception of one minor tweak to fighter bomber damage to sub capital targets the entire mess has remained untouched for over a year by mess im not just talking about supercaps but dominion as a whole its a half finished mess and saying half is polite no tweaking no iteration no balancing no treaties no motherships no losec expansion of the sov system but hey we can shoot at fleets of sansha ships nowmy views are that its all tied in together its pretty ed up and i hope to have the opportunity to work with a group of people on the csm that feel the same somehow i think whoever gets elected will have similar thoughts
a couple of quick ones before i take time to fully read your blog and articles1 destructible outposts  yes or no2 local chat channel in 00  remove delay or leave it like it isyou are already on my shortlist being an ex dev just need to know the answers to these questions since those are the two most important topics for me if you agree with my views on those subjects ill dedicate some time to reading what else you have to offer thanks for your time
this is something i can actually give an informed answer to without massive changes to the eve code base as in a complete rewrite the actual destruction of outposts isnt something that youre going to see the more practical reason for this is a scenario like what if a player comes back from fighting cancer for six months only to discover that all his stuff is gonethe answer to this is something that has been tossed back and forth for years and the seeds for which were really planted back in las vegas in 2009  wreckable stations the idea is that after a station exits its final reinforcement timer you would have the option to either capture it or blow it to hell after a nice micheal bayish explosion youd be left with a wreck much like the one normal ships leave the wrecked station would have all services disabled save one  undocking if you were already in there when it blew you somehow luckily found a broom closet to hide yourself and your stuff in maybe some of it got shaken up and damaged you can undock but thats it hopefully you stuffed a freighter into your broom closetthe option would also exist for someone to rebuild the station by simply dropping a similar egg next to it and filling it with magic pixie dust etc then after dt yay station is rebuiltthis idea was one of several planned features that should have been in dominion or iterated into the new sov system afterward it is a prime example of why the sov system was changed from the evolutionary dead end that it was to something that could actually be iterated on treaties and wreckable stations are things that have been publicly discussed by ccp on multiple occasions and are just parts of whats laying on the cutting room flooryour question assumes that there should be some kind of blanket mechanic for this in sovereign space which i do not believe there should be i would much rather put the power in the hands of the players by iterating onto the sov system with intel management tools its your system you are paying the stargate maintenance fees and such you should be able to develop a proper infrastructure that lends to how day to day life in your space works if you dont like random people ting up your local during a major fight shut it down for a time if you prefer delayed local over local that is always on tell the comm relay people working in the stargates to turn the dials down a bitthe choices should be yours the players as much as possible if you can fit a ship in eve why not fit a star system with the features you see fit and pay for there is endless potential for iteration on these concepts
exellent campaign ill toss a vote your way
bump for a good candidate
looking forward to see what youll be able to do from the other side of the fence
at this point i think you are the best candidate seleene i think you have the right ideas and i share your vision for how to best encourage ccp to fix the game of eve we know and love consequentially youll have my votes good luck
i like the cut of your jib youve got my 2 votes
so question i read on shc that you were a part of the design team that gave us wspace well cheers i guess that was a really nice thing to add to eve but i am curious do you have any thoughts as to building on wspace as a game niche i mean we all remember how faction warfare went down the drain and while the qen shows that wspace has grown a little bit it still remains well a small niche a fun one though
i dont really believe in those sorry
this is an excellent idea i for one love fish sticks and enjoy having them in my mouth
vote for draco
vote for draco as we need to get the eye of thundera back from iceland
i support this product andor servicealso confirming im ghey
confirming that draco llasa is the voice of reason the csm needs
first off thanks for the question1 for example what metric do you use to conclude that a lack of ccp assigned goals is a problema for an action to be fun there has to be a point you go to 00 to get access to the best minerals heh the best ratting the ability to build or conquer outposts so you can have a little piece of eve with your name on it theres a reason to go there and engage in combat that somebody somewhere wants to fight you to have this creates conflict which is the lifes blood of the game you cant say the same about lowsec however you cant take outposts the ratting is ty and if you were inclined to mine youd be wasting your time trying to mine there lowsec ends up being a place to go if you arent big enough to take space and you dont want to be somebodys vassal or if you have no interest in the goals 00 provide and want to hopefully find something to fight there are no goals however theres no point this needs to be fixed for both lowsec and for nullsec as well as if you arent a large power bloc you dont have access to the majority of the goals that 00 provides2 how would you know when the problem was fixeda when there is a point when people want to go to lowsecnullsec and have achievable goals that cant just be one upped by a much bigger force of people stomping them down no im not saying small groups should be able to beat large groups in fleet fight im saying there needs to be goals where having a large group provides you no great advantage over a talented small group that element of the game needs a lot of attention
hello jita park denizens this is my official announcement about my candidacy in the csm i am running for csm this year because like most other candidatesbelieve i can bring a balanced viewpoint to the table after 6 years of gameplay i have done most everything the game has to offer like manyi started by mining and progressed to missioning dedspace complexes pvp pirating trading ganking and manufacturing i would like to see fixes to current content as well as balancing and of course new content all of these pale in comparison to my number one interest removal of bots and rmt accounts ccp has ways to detect these cheaters and yet they persist why if we cannot get them out of game at least we should expect a definitive answer as to why not bots and rmt accounts are ruining eve for everyone you might not think they affect youbut the truth is that they impact every aspect of eve take my assurances that it is my 1 priority currently in game i am diplomat for the brick squad alliance battleclinics rated 49th place alliance i am a member of interstellarexodus ranked 21 in corp rankings from battleclinic for the month of february my corp although only ranked 21got more kills than any other corporation in eve we work hard and play harder we are fighting the drf and allies in 00 space we are allied with the northern coalition my personal stats on battleclinic are rank 2201 with 4449 kills and 1010 losses kill point total 13695 and 6960 loss point total if you see me in a combat ship in 00expect me to engage without reservation or regards to number in your or my fleet i have lost almost 40 billion isk worth of my own personal ships and expect that total to rise many of you may know me from some of my posts on these forums i have over 100000 reads total for my postsand yes many of them were trolls i have enjoyed trolling and many readers have enjoyed these trolls themselves below are some links if anyone is interested on the record i promise not to use my position if elected to troll the eve community the following video is my official campaign video depicting my approach to ccp in the video i represent the monkey and ccp is represented by the goat the video is only 123 longbut pretty much sums up my whole campaign and my approach to the election
i like darius
i like bots i make billions of isk a week why would you want to remove themfistpump
i know darius i love darius bump because if elected hes gonna smash the back out of that bird from the ccp videos
first let me say i find your site quite all right and actually looks quite like that other one given as an example of a good sitesecond i agree of your stance on unified voice i think its the very reason why the csm is more than just one personthird it is because at this time that you seem to be the only candidate to make sure the rpers perspective and side of things isnt overlooked that you will probably get my votestill i would like to know more about what you think the biggest issues for rpers and immersion are in eve
as a minmatar i dont expect to vote for you so what will you do for minmatar communities to get their votes 
shipmates my candidate profile is complete i know you are all anxiously waiting to vote
roc the vote
i was kind of surprised that you didnt have anything written about rp because i think rpers are people that are hardly represented in the csm i was kinda disappointed to see you hardly mention it im going to assume that you will probably overlook the rp side of things as much as almost any other candidatei might yet change my mind if you write about your view on rp in eve what is good what is bad what is uglyotherwise im left to voting for the one candidate that actually knows rpers exist and wants to represent them and improve their experience too please give me a choice
hello
krutoj for csmthe guy is extremely knowledgeable about the game and is in a constant struggle with ccp to get stuff fixed hell  them off until they have to do something3
support from a 130 man corp renting russian space 
vote for me or you can no longer bot in the drone regions
bots dont care actual players income got nerfed bots farm belts not 1010
i dont see why you bother making this thread why not just change the botting software so that they autovote for you
hahaha you funny
a couple of questions if you dont mind1 whats your stance towards local chat channel in 00 should it be removed delayed or stay like it is2 destructible outposts  for or against3 will this include continued fight for afs fourth bonus4 will this include fixing nighthawks slot layout and power grid issuesall questions have already been presented to the previous csms i want to see your positionthose are just a few questions that really matters to me it would be great if you took a minute or two to elaborate your stance towards those issues thanks for your time
no thank you for some questions it almost feels as if people are afraid to ask me any1 i dont feel like it should be changed as it is now its fine people still catch raters and i think that changing local might turn 00 into a complete bubbled gotry simply because as it is now few people place bubbles to protect from roamers but with delayed local everybody will be using them and i dont really think thats what people want and in low sec am trying to get people to rat in it return to it not to have them get ganked with no ability at times to tell if there is a hostile in local this would only benefit one small portion of people probably people like me who dont rat dont and can just roam anywhere and any time normal people need time to make isk and to roam and if they cant safely gain isk they might not even play the game2 ccps stance on it is that a lot of old subscribers stuff is in those stations i know that you can have that stuff transfered away or something but some are still in the alliances that own those stations and ccp wont take the risks to implement such a feature i think it could be great and on top of that allowing up to 23 stations per system cost wise it will be like killing a supercarrier but i just know ccp wont go for it we can try ofcourse this is what partly csm all about 3 i find afs fine i fly caldari ones though though worm vs af has afs at a disadvantage in a way it will simply come down to numbers of people interested in that and the worry of afs replacing interceptors somehow as well my stance on that however leave it at that they are being used for running 210 and small roaming4 nighthawks could use some loving at least the powergrid issue needs addressing for sure imho slot layout is by caldari standards though
phrasing this as neutrally as possible its a serious questionmany of your renters are known botters as such your alliance derives significant income from botting and you have a vested interest in its continuation why should anyone believe that you will not go out of your way to hinder or derail any antibotting measure that might be proposed by the csm or ccpedit and a followup question lowsec is more densely populated than 00 or wspace and also more violent in terms of kills per head of population on what basis do you say its broken and in need of fixing as opposed to just not offering gameplay that you personally enjoy
i am sorry i find it very hard to vote for someone who is part of the leadership of alliance which is infested with rmt activities on large scale which have been documented on eve related forums it is such scale that it is hard to imagine how that same leadership would not be at least partly involved in those activities to put it quite openly if you would get elected i would consider it as an obvious and utter slap in the face to eve community itself who is disguisted by rmt as a whole because your ticket would be payed by ccp or actually by us honest players of eve07
for those who trying to blame krutoj for rmt i just want to remind you that if he would be caught at this activities he would probably be banned and couldnt be a csm candidate so if he is not banned and running here  your charges are groundless im pretty sure ccps internal security can handle to check a 4 years history of a csm candidate when he applies to the csm so stfu or get a proof and petition it
to be honest this whole calling someone rmter deal is fishy im used to politicians that win a certain number of parliament seats not because they have a program or any idea what they should do when they get in there but they get votes just because they point at other candidatesparties and blabber about how bad they are and what nasty things they have done in the past without any proof ofc i always wondered who will fall for that trick but in the end they still have their seats in the parliamentthats why its best to ask direct questions about candidates program things that matters to you the mostso far im very satisfied with his answers to my direct questions
to be honest you should post with your main not some alt you made yesterday if youre going to throw around such baseless accusations as krutoj being an rmt lord which is bull
while i do respect you and uaxdeath krutoj i want to raise a couple of issues for example
maybe things are better on the other side of geminate where do i sign up 
just google eve macro bots easy for krutoj and co those guys give so much to this game
i would gauge the failure of changes based on how it fixed the problems it was originally faced and whether more problems were created as a result of these changes in the example of bounty hunting i would gauge the failure on whether or not there is an increase in the number of pilots that act as bounty hunters in eve and not a significant change in the number of pirates if there is an increase in bounty hunters but most of the pirates stop being pirates then the system in not balanced and overpowered for the bounty hunters while there would definitely be more elements i would go into this would be how i would gather my first impression if it is a mechanic that does not effect my normal play i would look to the forums because when something is wrong there tends to be a lot of people complaining about it and that would give me sense to at least look at the problemsit is important to know that i never talked about it being a success this is important because saying that it is a success implies to an extent that nothing is wrong i think this about any change in eve as some change may ruin another mechanic and not be seen for years it is by no means a criticism of ccp it is definitely more an analysis of a game that will be perpetually getting new content and fixes that may cause substantial and possibly unforeseen conflicts for other mechanics
i wholeheartedly support manalapani have been saying for years that eve is a virtual space suited to predatory play more than any other and manalapan and friends have shown via killboards and metagaming that they get it and they are prosback when wired interviewed me
null sec power bloc tears best tearsarden has my votesand my axe
i have an issie with arden he says that theyccp have only been improving the game play for the pve side of the gamebut hive only seen him taking full advantage of the pve side and seems he only hangs in high sec and goes after the young and much less experienced players to me arden and many other ninjas are like high school kids that that go play basketball with 5th gradersthen brag when they beat the crap out of them not only does he prey on the 5th graders and beat the crap out of themthen he turns around and says they should play by high school rules my question is arden why dont you go to the high schoollow or null space and play with the other high school kids the 5th gradersyounger eve players will be to the high school eventually you gets no more respect from me as a 2 year old eve player beating players well under half your agethan i would give a 22 year old kid and respect for beating a 10 year old in a sport the point is why would anyone vote for a bully that only picks on the younger and smaller kidsgo play with the people your own age and earn some real respect
first off paragraphs pleasein any case thank you for illustrating what most of the people i shoot down act likeeveryone plays the game they want to in their way if you enjoy getting blobbed all the time or blobbing up yourself then please by all means go to nullsecthe thing is we enjoy doing what we do and were good at it ive tried nullsec i have a 10 sec status alt there called ekusu kariba but to be honest i enjoy tearing up stuff in highsec the rules are fundamentally different and when hunting you have to know what youre doing comparing high low and null to each other is an exercise in futility theyre just so different from each otherthat said i do wish to point out that most of us go after just about anyone it doesnt matter how old their characters are if we get the chance we take them down period we dont aim after age specifically but after stupidity and carelessness of otherssure we play it dirty but whoever said eve is fair needs to get his sanity checked
i couldnt even consider using the tactic of confusing people to vote for me that would simply be dishonest no conflict whatsoever none of the games ive published or even been involved with have any competition with evetinfoil hat spotted
based on your campaign message you are one of my top five favorite candidates congratulations precently ive focused heavily on trading and processing pi commodities in and around jita this has been very lucrative for me increasing my net worth from 100m to 1100m in just two months it is a very complex and financially risky way of making money and i have a massive excel spreadsheet dedicated to it but i am beginning to master the art of jita trade coming from world of warcraft i absolutely love eves free market system and intuitive market interface but there is a key element of my moneymaking that i find absolutely horrible the planetary interaction interface itselfccp made a couple important improvements with incursion but almost nothing to aid people like myself who overlook harvesting completely and focus on processing what others have harvested and have put on the market with 123 advanced industry facilities and 24 launchpads on my six planets in sobaseki switching schematics and routes to account for shifts in the market can take upwards of 3000 clicks when it could feasibly be programmed to take a tenth of that excluding any clicks outside of the pi interface on top of that i have to wait ten seconds each time i wish to import or export from each of my launchpads a feature intended to prevent lag i assume which may only make it take about seven minutes longer than it should but is still a headache there are other less important grievances i have with pi cant view the contents of planetary customs offices without being in the same system etc but i feel like ive ranted long enoughand so my question to you is this do you share my feelings about further pi reform being absolutely critical to the economic and industrial aspects of the game and if elected will you lobby ccp on behalf of me and all the other planetary industrialists in new eden
you forget that if he is elected he doesnt have any power of change apart from the ability to give his yea or nea vote on any changes ccp put forth to the csm csm does not give ccp ideas they are just a sounding board for ccps ideasaside from all that you seem like a decent bloke with a good perspective on how things run  apart from the above mentioned areas  and will probably get my vote
key word was meant to be lobbying assuming youre addressing me the way i understand it csm is supposed to bring the concerns of players to ccp give feedback on ccps potential fixes and help to prioritize said fixes
i feel your pain my experience pi is that when i tried it i found it so horrendously click intensive for the return that you get that i havent done any since my corp does a lot of pi and the feedback i get is that while it can be profitable it is a choreto me this is poor design  both in terms of game and interface design i quite like sid meiers definition of a game which is a series of interesting choices pi has that but unfortunately its wrapped up in a longwinded and tiring implementation that its just not fun or even particularly productiveso to directly answer your question what i will push via csm is the steamlining of anything that requires large amounts clicking pi included more specifically anything that has a high click to decision ratio  each decision you make should be able to be communicated to the game with a minimum of commandsclicksand in response to decus  yes the power of the csm is largely limited to a sounding board for ccp however it is the voice we have and a lot more than a lot of other gaming communities get so i intend to make the most of the influence we have as players those who are at the coal face as it were to help ccp make good design choices and avoid disasters
and you forget proposals made by csm members and voted by csm members as you were

based on your campaign message you are one of my top five favorite candidates congratulations precently ive focused heavily on trading and processing pi commodities in and around jita this has been very lucrative for me increasing my net worth from 100m to 1100m in just two months it is a very complex and financially risky way of making money and i have a massive excel spreadsheet dedicated to it but i am beginning to master the art of jita trade coming from world of warcraft i absolutely love eves free market system and intuitive market interface but there is a key element of my moneymaking that i find absolutely horrible the planetary interaction interface itselfccp made a couple important improvements with incursion but almost nothing to aid people like myself who overlook harvesting completely and focus on processing what others have harvested and have put on the market with 123 advanced industry facilities and 24 launchpads on my six planets in sobaseki switching schematics and routes to account for shifts in the market can take upwards of 3000 clicks when it could feasibly be programmed to take a tenth of that excluding any clicks outside of the pi interface on top of that i have to wait ten seconds each time i wish to import or export from each of my launchpads a feature intended to prevent lag i assume which may only make it take about seven minutes longer than it should but is still a headache there are other less important grievances i have with pi cant view the contents of planetary customs offices without being in the same system etc but i feel like ive ranted long enoughand so my question to you is this do you share my feelings about further pi reform being absolutely critical to the economic and industrial aspects of the game and if elected will you lobby ccp on behalf of me and all the other planetary industrialists in new eden
why is this thread not two pages yet  everyone else seems to be at two pages except you please hurry things along
i think it is because kalrand had another 3 page thread in md so posts have been dividedbut this post should push him onto a second page here
good stuff you get my votescrew the bitter eve veteran trollers here
i wasnt sure if i would vote for kalrand as he had not yet reached page two for this thread i can now officially feel confident in voting as this has been remedied send kalrand to iceland also 1 for skills in making your avatar look exactly like you its uncanny
i swear to god i hit random a few times and went holying and went with it
im waiting to see how the pi reform related to the change in resource extraction shakes through the pi economy before proposing any new changesbut beyond that im a bit perplexed why your factory planets have so many launchpads factory planets tend to be cpu constrained and not grid constrained so try switching out some launchpads for silos part of your problem is that it sounds like you have your planets set for the highest effort setup possibleyoure really the first person i know who complains about the effort of factory planets so i think you might be doing something wrong here
ill go one by one and try to expound on the thinking behind each point ill pull the bot pointin all honesty this is less of a direct economic point and more of a secondary one by providing more end game content to smaller bands of players it will increase their demand on the market for ships and supplies consumption is the underlying engine which drives the eve economy and giving players what they want forces them to consume to get to that point people want their small to mid size corporations to be able to notch out their little piece of the galaxy goodthe orca is a wildly popular ship for high sec logistics but it currently has little applicable use in 00 or lowsec space it also has a singleuse skill attached to it that could easily have the level v part of the skill unlock a t2 version of the ship we have a popular ship a relatively unused skill and a need for more midsized logistics ships this seems like a nobrainer for something that can be added to the game and give people what they wantas anyone who has ever lived in a wormhole will tell you not being able to switch out their t3 subsystems severely hampers the usefulness of these ships on extended trips through wspace i also dont see why a small corp that is living mining and otherwise spending their time on a long deployment to wspace cant build and fit the very t3 ships that can only be made out thereone common theme that i have is that there is a large jump from group play in highsec to that of null sec what is needed are steps that a group can journey up together to increase their coordination ability to work in teams and secondarily force them to consume more to move up in the game this particular point would be a good first step to take a band of otherwise mission runners and give them something to do together if l5s became a miniincursion that took the resources of a small corporation to complete it would encourage players to band together for a new reason this will in turn create a niche for smaller corps to fill and give them the ability to grow their skillst2 battleships have extremely niche rollseither in 00 logistics or in high end l4 mission running theyre some of the least piloted ships in the game when they are also the end game of the t2 production and invention chain giving them a better defined role would increase the demand for them leading to an initial price spike but an eventual leveling of prices as the supply curve rose to accommodate the demand in blunt terms we have something useless in the game now why not fix it
the noctis being implemented with such fanfare shows that players both like new content and there is a niche to be filled by a salvaging ship taking that a step further by adding salvaging drones would add new content to the game and increase the ability of salvaging to be a professionthe supply of technetium in the game is far below the demand for technetium even at this point and this has been going for months also the fact that tech is only found in one small region of 00 means that it has been controlled by a relatively few people for this entire time at a minimum the in demand moon minerals should be spread out evenly through 00 space beyond that technetium was a r32 level moon mineral and the r64 ones were designed to be the rare moon minerals the moon product composition of t2 components needs to be refactored again hopefully this time someone does the math like several people in market discussions did and prevents any one area or any one mineral from having such a dominant effect on the entire eve economyas i stated before in my answer about the level 5 missions and small corps in 00 these two points would be another example of a steps that a small to mid size corporation can take as a group as they move deeper into multiplayer pvp these are early points where their actions could have consequences on their area in the game but not be as severe as they would be in 00 space this would hopefully push people deeper into the political and pvp aspects of the game and would be too small for the current superblocks to care about

hi thereive read your point of view on 00 lowhisec but im curious about your thoughts on ccps vision of making eve the ultimate spacegame meaning the introduction of incarna dust 514 and other features that depart from the internet spaceship style that defined eve to this day how is your take on thisbest regardsmcvain
i look forward to incarna i honestly think if its done right it could be a fantastic part of evebut i will definitely as a csm member oppose to anythink making incarna mandatory i think no one should be forced to step outside his pod in any way to have access to existing featuresmany capsuleers just dont want to leave their pod and i completely understand them no single feature available in game at the moment should force them to do soi think the captain quarter will be great but it is already forcing people too much i would really act with the whole csm to try to convince ccp this is really bad ideaincarna should in my opinion be a magnificent expansion making anyone willing to step outside their pod but it shouldnt force them to do so in any way
as a selfdescribed empire and lowsec dweller can you explain how your lack of experience with these issues will help any discussion you might have particularly jump brides
jump brides i dont know i have no personal experience with these mechanisms well cap projection a little but i know they are an important matter right now for 00 and thats why i mentioned themi will never pretend to have some experience i havent but i will be able to look at it from the outside while 00 players are too focused on the way they use it right now and the fact they dont want to lose their advantagesi honestly believe a fresh look on these issues could bring a lot to the csm
so your idea of not being biased is nerfing sov upgrades and putting more incursions in high sec also what is wrong with level 5 missions they seem to make good iskies of those who will mission in low sec instead of highsec
i dont ask for a sov upgrade nerf but for a new repartition of resources in 00sov upgrades just bring more money to people who already have it and encourage 00 alliances to ground themselves in some overly protected systems giving too much advantages to defender and preventing from real 00 epic warsand the fact that they bring more natural resources with upgrades is just dumb and illogical  00 have immense resources because its far from populated areas and it is not farmed much sov upgrade are against this and imbalance the game greatlyincursion are about sanshas trying to enslave populations why are most of thethe most powerful incursions aimed towards the less populated systems then  nonsense00 incursions are not even completed if they dont threaten some big alliance headquarter while hisec incursions are completed far too fast incursions arent a threat to hisec at all right now while according to the trailer they should and it would be so much better to see sansha ships really attacking people everywhere in a systemlvl5 missions are not rewarding enough when you look at the risks in my opinion compare it to 00 or incursion in hisec or 00
ill do a question quick answer with
hii like 3rd party apps but i dont understand you seem to be saying if you like 3rd party apps vote for me id like you to go into more details on how you can improve the 3rd party app universe by being on the csmwhat plans andor suggestions will you be putting forward
peter powers and the 3rd party developers have my vote  thanks for all your work
i like hearing opinion from people who dont know how to fit supercapitals and use white noise  fits instead top notchplease list your supercapital characters thanks
pssst closer 3rd party developpers usually already benefit from a more direct line to developers through the forum the number of posts by devs answering technical questions is higher than in other subforumsnot saying yours isnt a valid position the csm has already made efforts to increase the information available improve the api some of those efforts as recent as the last december summit check the minutesi have a question for you considering that the vast majority of the time spent on the csm is spent talking about things other than ones pet issue what is your background when it comes to things other than 3rd party applicationsgood luck with your campaignmeissa
he has my vote
actually its more through the chat than through the forumsbut talking to the developers does not put one in a position to talk to the guys who decide about the time the developers get to spend on certain thingsi am fully aware of that but i believe this can still be improveyou can read about my background at my campaign site if you have more specific questions well just ask 
if your a dev doing 3rd party tools peter powers is your man to speak your voiceand he has done some awesome cool stuff for finfleet so he have my votethanks again peter for your work
peter has my vote for surei work with him here n there when doing things for evscoevekillnet hes a quality guy  is really good with the things he does not gonna go into detail but had the pleasure of talking to him 1 on 1 about my life as we know everyone has a crappy life so to speak hes helped me out a grate deal  im glad to of met him if it wasnt for eve i most likely never would of met him either so for him to wanna help the community in anyway he can then thats awesomepeter 4 csm
this thread is and has always been about nc want to control all csm seats because they dont like the idea that ccp might remove jump bridges and will encourage pvp please stay on topic
if that logic was true youd be a genius maybe a bigger genius than kanye west since you think of goonies and northern coalition as a bunch of idiots but good thing its not true and you like to play up fantasies in your head please keep writing more terrible conspiracy theories for me and other people to read here or there everyone knows how terrible you are anyways
trying to keep the nc and their allies from getting their voices heard are you serious as leaked on many forums and even confirmed by mittens he and his allies have made a very deliberate ploy to take control of the csm not just to be represented on iti have made it extremely clear that this is the core issue for me i put myself forward for this election primarily to raise awareness of the blatant attempt of the nc  goons to gain in game advantage by monopolising the csm and the access that their nondisclosure agreements will give themim under no illusions here i very little chance of being heard over the sheer numbers of nc  goon members and ive always recognised that fact the alliances im trying to expose have tens of thousands of votes that they can call in at the drop of a hat however i shall continue to use this platform to try to alert the community to the fact that theyre sleepwalking into genuinely gamebreaking situationhow can it possibly be good for the game if one group of alliances controls all the major assets in game will have advance notice of game changes through the nda which they will use to consolidate their ingame monopoly and will be the primary mouthpiece for the players
well my posts have been good enough for you to dedicate 100 of your lifetime posting energy into replyingactually im bored of that riff new challengers please
you have my vote k2 o7
ive voted for vuk long before i knew anything about morsus mihi let alone considering to join it it wasnt about which block he belongs to it was about the program that he offered as a candidate since you claim that you are going to continue his and elvens work that will be enough for my vote
as a fellow aussie you have mine vote
i can say with upmost certainty that i have maintained and will continue to maintain a zero tolerance when it comes to macros there are no exceptions to this rule my belief is that incarna should be focused on fixing the real issues eg macros lag that weve wanted for so long now not implementing new functionality such as captains quarters in stations there is only so much csm representatives can do as they do not have the authority to dictate what is implemented in the game what i will do as a csm representative is serve as a check to ccp everytime they talk about new functionality i will remind them of the backlog and that there are real issues more important issues that need their desperate attention
bonus points if you do it in are we there yet style
i played with k2 for a couple of years and tbh hes wasting too much time playing so i believe he would do great as a csm member
goodluckhope you get enough votes to get the pos changes and all those other good ideas to ccps attention
dude you sound like a gangstar but you are white so why
reykjavUFFFDk works on eve shanghai does dust 514
lol no
dust is scrapped thats why theyve dropped the ludicrous idea of competing on the console fps market now if people like you stop posting questions about it it can just start slowly fading away in time with the rest of ccp delusional ideas
source please when did dust514 get scrapped besides the highest priority has always been world of darkness
hmmmm i can only imagine you guys have been living under a rock for the last 18 months or youre just in a state of complete denialabout a year ago dust was all ccp talked about but after some pretty negative reaction from the eve community and the reaction by the csm to the incarna plans its hardly been mentioned in the last 6 months its almost like it was a media blackoutthen the live dev blog on 24th jan 2011 this accidently slipped outccp omenccp soundwaveccp omen being asked about a specific new featureccp soundwavelink to logsstill waiting to hear what the csm candidates have to say about this
lol
you are a bad poster and you should feel bad
lots of outofcontext quotes does not make for an argumentwe already know they got at least one team working dust link plus the shanghai office doing the game itself and thats likely to increase once they get closer to release but what are you suggesting csm do about itccp cant change that now after such a heavy investment no more than they could drop or delay incarna due to wod
im sure your constructive attitude goes a long way in making you a quality and popular candidate
please explain which quote is out of contexti thought the csm was to represent the players not ccps commercial interests they already have people that do that i dont see much popular demand for the dust link and certainly not enough to make it a higher priority than flyinginspacemore focus on eve development is what i want to see the csm champion its a little bizarre that some people find that so wrong
really you rather be pets than renters and you call it fair play what the hell dude my renters have more rights in my alliance than you oh sorry your ex pet alliances rage and ircplus you gonna judge renting alliances for giving people that said chance to experience and make money in 00 do you know what kind of work is involved and how many people are happy that there is that option your platform is either a big troll or a joke
i am going to add my voice to the dissent to your posti am not in this for a free trip to iceland fo rme it is not a simple flight it would involve 3644 hours of travel from leaving my door to getting to the hotel and then the same on return it sucks but i am willing to do it for a game i lovenor am i interested in getting hired by ccp as seleene has said been there done thatwhat the csm needs is a group of people representing the whole of the eve players that can understand their common goals accept differences and still work as a teamhow do you think ccp will react if all the members of the csm are from goonswarm and the nc or similar 00 blocks they will be able to say this is not an accurate representation of our player base we do not need to listen to them and that is one thing i never wish the csm to become the work of the previous csm members especially csm5 members has been outstanding in building the relevance of the csm as a resource for ccp to make use ofthat could easily be destroyed by a badly select csm built for 1 reason now do not get me wrong i agree with a number of points from the mittani the csm does have to work together they have to be united but this does not hinge on him being the chairman if he gets to be the chairman and builds a csm team then congratulations to him but i also think there are other people that could do the job just as well vile rat has valid points about the state of 00 warfare i agree with most of his points i do not agree with some of his fix recommendations but that does not mean that if i was on the csm i as a non 00 player would not support him to get the issues fixed the actual solution comes down to ccp i would support any issue the csm as a whole brings to ccp to have resolvedeve is such a complex game that no part of it can be said to live in isolation changes in any part of the game are going to have ripple effects in all other parts it is trying to understand these and make sure that they are thought about and if they will be a negative impact then dealing with them before they become an issue a crosssectional csm is going to be better able to work as a team to do this kind of thought process than a single factionso agree on unified front from the csm but strongly disagree that it all needs to be from 00
your forum posts say otherwise m8 
lol i have worked for ccp before great bunch of people very cool company to work for if you want to work in the computer gaming industry i can not recommend ccp highly enough as an employer and as a group of peoplebut personally while i enjoyed the experience i am not looking to return to iceland fulltime i rather like my current job in nz and am settled and really do not want to move 12 way across the world again 
so why should i vote for you what is it that you personally plan to bring to the csm process other than a very concise version of mittanis mission statementhal
clearly old boy has fell of his rockersad thing is this has been the best topic on the coad for weekswell in before lock
only thing i see wrong with this is that he accidentally has goon and nc as two separate entities
you probably unironically think everything in the op is true
there are a few things that are true in this game which i actually find humorous yet sad as wellbotting is ruining the game as we all know yeta because the majority of the active player base are nc sheep they wouldnt do anything to disrupt leaderships activitiesb ceos in most of the large alliances directly benefit from botting so there is no incentive for them to stop itc most believe that ccp benefits as well and therefore wont simply remove local which would crash bottingthere is obviously more to the topic but the simple fact is that ways in which we all made isk over the years are no longer an option because the return is not worth the amount of time spent doing it when youre competing with an army of botsthe politics of eve 00 are just a bunch of old vets keeping each others bot kingdoms safe sure they throw in a couple wars here and there but we all know thats just a distraction to keep the sheep busyif i was running my only ticket point would be to get rid of local i might think of a few more but thats probably the one that would change the game the most and for the better at this point all the other  people cry about is just background noise supercap proliferation jump bridge networks circling 00 and just about all the other stuff people make up to be issues in 00 would be solved once local is gonei say if the nc wants to take over csm let them the only thing they have done for eve so far is  it up with giant sheep and botting farms i say why not shine the light on them so we can all sit back and listen to how they plan to clean up the mess they have made00 was always supposed to be the most dangerous place to live in evenow its the safest place to live
moved from caod
awww look at that poor old windybutt still trying to look relevant in eve online i think his meds need adjusting to get his rabid paranoia under control
the only bit i got wrong was saying that the spin doctors would be slick and the smear campaigns organised
i for one am interested in how the internet goldfish fit into the market modeli personally would like to know how much a clown fish will go for
in all honesty crap like fishtanks in your captains quarters seems like perfect stuff for ccp to focus their efforts on microplex in game purchases theyve made it clear that they intend to start doing those things and something innocuous like this might be the right outletits the perfect example of something that has no effect on the game economy wont change a players performance and people might like why not hopefully they dont need to jam five developers on it for months at a time
you seem to be implying that such a feature if implemented would have to be entirely isolated from ingame items of worth such as lootable fish upgrades and items that could be bought and sold for iskplease elaborate or clarify your stance on this issue
not only is this not implied but actually the opposite of the implications pertaining to what he suggested plex arent separate from the ingame economy why would microplex items be the use of that phrase says it all readingcomprehension
im making the broad assumption that the decorations in your captains quarters dont give you some kind of a buff while piloting your ship lootable fish upgrades seems quite silly but could replace the stupid useless loot that drops on some missions now being tradeable for isk itself isnt a problem being a substitute good for something already in the game would be anything that can be bough or sold using plex or whatever mechanic ccp comes up with to separate people from the contents of their wallet should have no effect on their abilities in game when it comes to their interaction with the large gameif people want to log in to stare at a fish tank then good for them
csm6 dreipniir  fresh meatq are you doing this for a free trip to iceland a hell yea all the free snow you can eat and volcanoes trying to kill you who wouldnt want that who am i in eve i actually think i have been around since the start ofcourse i have had my ups and downs and battles against the never ending learning curve of doombut until this point ive seen pretty much all of what is to be seen it is a huge universe but a very narrow pathive been both victorious in my goals and had my share of epic failures ive tried the high sec carebear life massing my wealth by missions and trade and ive spent parts of my futuristic life in 00 trying to make your life suck even more  cmon who doesnt love those explotions and the feeling of blowing up 15 bill of someones ratting tengu who am i irl my name is per stengUFFFDrd im 27 years old and im freezing my ass off in swedeni canUFFFDt say that i have eny fancy pants game designer skills but what i can say is that i might have a fresh mind about things my real work is actually being a saddlemakerleather crafter so i work to create new things most of my time and also too see that it gets 100 perfecti have also tried alot of different games during my mmo years and ive seen most of em fail for the same reasoncontentso to get to the pointgoals during csm 6 first of all im not going to promise you enything else then my hard work to try and make a differencecsm is a sounding board not somewhere we can demand change its just a polite requestso most games ive followed thrue the years all go down the same road when the players start questioning the content the game creators starts creating new content new expanionssadly leaving all the old content and areas untouched and unfinishedwhat deserves most pve or pvp  my point is that both sides needs to be fixed as all other games the player base is balanced between the two for pvp yes ship balancing ofcourse all ships should be vital to a fleet at this point its all drake blobs or the fotm maelstroms wheres the love for all the ships in pve doing the same missions all over and over or afk mining or whatever you want to do it needs to be adressed there is alot of questions to be answered and over a forum like this its insane to even try im open for ideas im open for conflictsim sick of seeing eve fall into the same deep hole that all others arewhy wont they fix what they allready have ccp has one hell of a game but they need to slow down and look back at what they havefix the existing content before implementing moresure incursions was a nifty idea but can the systems handle it live events  awesome200 or more pilots in same system and it goes down the drainfleet fights it would go faster doing the fighting in paint to end it all i say is fix what you have dont leave it lying in a dark cornervote for me  dreipniir
agreed that ccp needs to turn their car around and see whats in their tracks
death  is only way outon the serious note 00 is bleeding right now due to numerous amount of problems and bugs not even mentioning the lag we have to try to fix it or at least bring this to ccp attention so here im stood up for it many of you may or may not like me but it will not change my path ill not go into details as i stated before its a numerous amount of problems starting with1 claim claim warfare2 corporation management3 ships balancing4 rtm and botting 5 citizens management and applications6 lags7 pvp warfare it selfand that list is endless i cant promise you that all this will be fixed  if i say so  it would be a lie what i can promise is that i gonna fight hard to get this stuff into their ears
death sounds scary
eve is a dark place
ironic coming from you
enlighten us all how many citizen alliance have u made and controlled
if that is his official blog then im sorry but i cant support anyone who thinks that aoe weapons are a good idea like old titan dd
uaxdeath what do you mean claim cliam warfare ps can you make an english version of your blog
my goals for csm6i make this list as some point that i would like to introduce to ccp some of this proposal is suggestion from my corp mates and mine im opened to hear yours and i would fight for it fix old feature content i would like to introduce an upgrade to the autopilot i suggest a warping distance to the gate as 5000 m this would help to short the time to approach to the gate making it little more secure to pilot to jump i suggest a new feature to the fleets making it more fearless give the power to the boss of the fleet to be able of cloak the ships 3 to 5 if each pilot has the skill of cloaking make as a choice if pilots want pvp in high sec meaning we can keep the security for other pilots that dont want to do it make the wh able to stay open for more timei want to hear from you let me know what else i can do for you im open to other suggestionsmy web

technetium and neodymium two moon minerals in two very geographically specific regions own them and you own the game you make so much money from them that your pvp players effectively fly for free an outsider in empire cant compete with that they never have to take a break because the money flows so easily the south where it and atlas and aaa and init have been is rather poor alliances there dont have the income to compete because technetium is a northern region mineralcoalitions between empires cant be broken by just taking away standings so to fix nullsec the rest of nullsec should be made worth morevote ms pacman
the antikartel csm balance nullsec by making all of nullsec worth more technetiumneodymium jumpbridges can only be used by own alliance making it much harder to maintain coalitions of alliancesin nullsec only own alliance will appear blue the termination of renterspace as it is today the elminination of powerblocks vacuums a fair chance to empire corporations alliances to settle in 00 space a stop to the mafia extortion of paying for space an avg of 140  190 worth in plex isk to pay rent a month to the superpowers in order to be able to obtain a few systems in nullsec br this has to be stopped and if needed by a change in the eula see my page at evelopedia for more information  fair play more challenge  if deep in your heart you feel im right then dont vote for your alliance this time but vote for me
ccp navigator once said
if it became an eula violation for alliances to rent space then you would see one of two things happen either the existing superpowers would kick all of their renters out of their rented space probably by force so they could smash and grab some assets or the existing superpowers would absorb their renters into their own alliance and still charge them rent via arrangements made via outofgame communication which is not much different from now but then what about the blatant eula violation you ask couldnt the disgruntled joe citizen just petition the evil alliance overlord yes he could and then he and his corporation or block of corporations that came from the same renter alliance would be kicked from the superpower alliance the aforementioned smash and grab would probably occurthe problem with your ideas is that there is no feasible way to reasonably enforce any of them any sort of social construct that is disallowed by the eula could be circumvented entirely by using outofgame chat programs email or forums to communicate the arrangements the outofgame rules posted for every alliance would include if they dont already that the number one rule is a zerotolerance rule for screwing over anyone else in the alliance with the inclusion of filing petitions this is a rule for goonswarm and i cant imagine that its not or wouldnt become in the hypothetical you present one for the other large alliances
its not expected that a csm will come up with the genius solution for all problems but it will be good to have a csm within csm6 that will trigger ccp and stimulate them to work on a better solutionthe game can get a lot better for everyone and much more challenging
the fact that ccp navigator stated this in a forum thread does not say it is no longer an issue for the csmthats exactly one important reason why ccp implemented the council of stellar management
not on a demographic identity why would ccp go out of its way to introduce nonplatform bias
because its difficult to give stats on platformsalso since most of the time spent in meetings is spent talking about things that are not a part of your platform as such you want to elect people who have well rounded knowledge of all things not people who know just the one thing and stay silent the rest of the time or spout nonsense and how do you assess thatmeissa anunthiel csm 2 3 4 5
you dont assess it through irrelevant demographics ask yourself how each of those points impacts on knowing things then ask yourself which ones even relate to knowledge of the gamefor good measure why not help ccp complete the list and give them your height weight and sexual orientation
how do those interesting statistics bias me towards any candidates exactly
the same way if for example they announced that one candidate was a black transgendered midget it may not bias you at all or it may completely but no body holding an election in good taste freely volunteers demographics which have no other potential than to at worst introduce bias and at best be completely irrelevant those sorts of things are left to the media
how can it bias me if i dont know which one is a midget
how does it bias you if you knew the average candidate height or the average weight in any case its in bad taste to include such irrelevant information in a candidacy announcement as if it were relevant things you include during an announcement of candidates perhaps even a word or two about their platform things you dont include their hair colour
yes this is basically what i am asking
im not saying it does conversely ask yourself how does knowing that one of the candidates is blonde impact your vote and so why should such information be included in an announcement of their candidacypicture any form of governing body issuing a similar announcement that summarized candidates in an upcoming supposedly democratic election by their race and sexual orientation is it interesting to know yes does it belong in an election that hopes to be taken with any degree of seriousness or good taste no and maybe thats telling of csm elections
that is exactly what you saidand if it doesnt bias you which you now concede it doesnt there is no harm in including it and unlike the facetious attributes you have used as examples the statistics ccp supplied are interesting in fact the distributions of gender age and to a lesser degree country of the playerbase in general are discussed on the forum from time to timeso what we appear to have here is the release of some completely harmless and relatively interesting statistics and another random stab at the validity of the csm election process
where i said it biased you is completely an artifact of your reading comprehensionlike the attributes i listed yes the statistics are interesting but like the attributes i listed are also irrelevant and in bad form for an announcement on candidacy to take your poor example among many distributions of eves playerbase another nodoubt interesting one and also often discussed is weight yet having the average weight of the candidates listed is clearly to be avoided despite its interest value a players race is also of high interest on the forums that often discuss reasons for bloodline selection yet listing the average race of candidacy another obvious nonoif you dont understand or see the problem then hopefully you are alone in that otherwise i submit that is exactly why stabs can be taken at this process because when you release announcements such as that for supposedly democratic processes you are playing with knives
so on top of managing to release statistics which are interesting but which are unable to cause bias ccp have also successfully avoided others which would by their very nature be taken poorlyseems like they were really on the ball with this oneapparently not given how fast you are backpedalling on the bias issue
why are they bad formwhat statistics would you have wanted to see insteadso what is the problemall i see is a list of demographics that suggest that the csm candidates seem to present a fair crosssection of the eve population at large and in particular a good representation of those who are at all interested in the csm process how is this bad
and if they had 57 male candidates from a single country and age what then or if one candidate was transgendered would they then have listed that too or perhaps naits not the kind of information you include especially when in lieu of any real pertinent information such as platform statements it is made to seem the primary focus it debases the entire process and in ccps effort to brag about their diversity at a completely inappropriate time theyve only shot themselves and the validity of csm in the foot
begeezuseffinkrist lighten up you nimrodthose statistics are indeed not relevant to csm candidacy and just because they are wholly irrelevant to it there is no nonplatform bias in presenting them to the general publicpeople dont vote for a csm candidate because hes young or old or a certain race out of game they vote because hes popular as a character or champions some cause the voter cares aboutit does not hurt anybody that runs for csm to have demographic statistics of the many candidates posted but it does help enlighten regular users as to how serious the whole csm schick is for the general player population by having a relatively high for a game agebased stats on candidatesso shut your trap hole and find something seriously bad to complain about this one is nowhere near even remotely bad
then i think it would be really really hard to be biased based on their gender age or country
does any democratic agency for example the us government proceed an announcement on elections with a report on how many blacks and hispanics versus anglos are running for office does it report the average age of the candidates does it see fit as a talking agenda the sexual orientation of its candidatesyet these are all interesting statistics that show the crosssection of the population it governs and likewise this information is often made known through proper outlets at the appropriate time either media or separate announcements and not during candidacy announcements especially at the lack of any pertinent and relevant information to their candidacy
you are comparing a video game company to a government see below for one reason why this doesnt holdand who exactly is going to have these statistics other than ccpif you intend to say that ccp themselves should do it another time dont bother nonsense
yes maybe indirectly but yesstill sort of yesnot usually but yes it happensin a rl election you already have all the demographic data you could possibly want available to you you know the real name and can obtain pictures of all candidates and any personal information about each of them is more or less freely availablethis is not the case with eve candidates which are usually anonymous up until candidacy time
and if you intend to imply gender age and nationality  and primarily that information  belong in an announcement on candidacy dont bother youve already shown why the validity of csm is continually questioned
im sorry i cant hear you over the sound of you trying to ignore my counterpoint to your last post
how many run on probotting and how many antibotting candidates are there
i would soooo totally run on a make botting legal and supported via client hooks platform 111oneone
moved from general discussion
i dont see the harm in them doing this they havnt pointed out who is what in it tho it probably wouldnt be to hard to figure out after having the information it shows us that the csm candidates vary greatly from all different aspects and that eve still has a handful of women per region the part that 35 are from diffferent alliances and 12 are not in an alliance is an interesting and useful fact for us to know the age of the candidates is possibly the only thing that could have been excluded as some might go  whut an old fart screw that he dont know what we want but if anyone is actually paying attention to the csm candidates they would know thier ages anyway regardless of if ccp made the post or not its not like csm candidates stay hidden in a brown paper bag the entire election until we vote then winners pop out and we burn the rest
yes because there is an assumption that a political body that demographically correlates with the demographics of the voters will be represent the people better and because any significant disconnects between the two indicates that there are structural prejudices or just outright discrimination at work that keep certain groups from being heardand thats long before we get into the politics these political players represent after which this debate comes back why is it that political view x is so strongly supported by group a and shunned by category b why does not party z let type f citizens rise to top positions etc etc etcno but thats mainly because sex is a taboo subject in us politics or actually yes exactly because sex is a taboo subject its just not debated so much as gossiped about
you will be hardpressed to find any announcement of candidacy from a governing body about its candidates individual or aggregate gender age or nationality secondly you will be lightpressed to find in those same governing bodies that the candidates quite often do not match the demographics of the voters but that is neither here nor therelikewise sexual orientation isnt mentioned not because its taboo and it is and it isnt but rather because it has no place in an announcement about candidates running for an officeno candidates arent hidden youll see and come to know them but if and when their personal characteristics and demographics are detailed it will be by them or a disinterested party and certainly not in conjunction with an official announcement on their candidacy its bad form and the wrong kind of emphasis to place on the csm election process
i understand where you coming from tho a bit it is bad form on ccp part to be doing the info giving as they had something like eon magazine published by one of thier writers and not quoted by ccp is somewhere that should belong ccp would be like the government body and eon fox news and the gov shouldnt do that as u said even if it doesnt do harm when the info already out there
at the risk of further feeding the trollmost governments do not release personal information on this nature thru official channels because as they are very much in the limelight due to being political figures all that stuff is known about them anyway due to the media fulfiling the public intrest so yes in the real world we already know the ageethnicitygenderetc of candidateswhy does the public want to know this because they want to know all they can about the person who is going to be representing them to their governmentnow on to the csm statistics you are saying that the release of these statistics is innapropriateincites biasimproperetc please answer the question belowcan you give me an example of one csm6 candidate who has had information specifically about their genderageethnicitysexual orientationetc released to you by ccpim willing to bet that you will be unable to find any instance of this being the case therefore i put to you that the release of these annonymous statistics will have zero bearing on who i may vote for as they impart no information on specific candidates in fact all they do is provide a brief illustrative statistical insight into the demographic of the csm6 candidatesto close you are making an issue out of something that is patently inconsequencialhal
not really noif they dont do it the watchdog groups will and more and more agencies have come to understand that its in their own interest to be the first on the ball and control the narrativewhich is why people keep compiling those aggregates to demonstrate that there are inherent biases in the selection system and if there werent people would compile the aggregates to show this fact and pat themselves on the back over it instead what ccp has done is to indicate that this isnt so much the case for the csmagain why
because agencies responsible for the voting process politically disinterest themselves in the candidates demographics and any information that should not take part in the voting process no you wont see governing bodies do it and no you wont find where such things are mentioned in official correspondence yes other groups will reveal this and that is completely irrelevant let those others do it and on those terms every candidate that has ever run for any office will most likely have things such as their family kids sexual orientation age gender and so forth disclosed but i guarantee you apart from ensuring they are legal age none of that information is disclosed by official government correspondence surrounding the election and for good reasonin fact those groups exist exactly for that reason to disseminate partial and unpolitical information so that it isnt interspersed with official correspondence as another user suggested the place to mention unpolitical details such as demographics hair colour and favourite foods is in a media outlet like eon or in the very least in a separate post under that bannerwhere you dont mention it is in the same post where you are announcing qualified candidates and seemingly above and beyond any real information that might relate to their qualifications or reasons for candidacy
i was never asking fo results i was simply saying that whatever csm presses the issue or at least promises to bring it up to ccp has m vote
whats the point in raising an issue if you dont want results do you work for the us govt by any chance lolbut seriously the csm doesnt have any effect on things like this  their a pannel of judges ccp can bounce their prosepective changes upon and see the reactions  thats it

cost is not a valid argument as it is driven by supply and demandship isnt as effective  less people use it  cost goes downpeople saying we need an elite ship make me lol what makes a ship elite the fact that is singularly better than every other ship in its class  what your really saying is i need an i win shipit defo needs a slight tap from the nerf batyou didnt tick the support box p
james1122 ccp control base costs of all items then if supply is abundant the price of item remains near base costin case of faction ships the base cost is set in terms of loyalty point  other items required to purchase bpc from lp store thats primary factor secondary factor is the bpc drops from loot which are actually very rareall ccp would have to do to double the dram prices would be to double the lp required for purchasing bpc or just drop plain 100m isk requirement in addition to lpif you want a real world analogy think of the interest rates that bank charges for loans theoretically interest rates are set by supply and demand but the government can easily manipulate the rates using fed  by setting the overnight loan rates the government can raise and lower prices on a whim in what seems to be a free market economy ccp do same thing

currently not meant for pvp of any kind not with instanced barbie dressup cq anyway doesnt mean it has to stay that way
thats why i had the smallmedlarge for mobile comm jammers smalls would be reasonably priced for a smaller group but would only last about 2hrs or so medium and large ones meant to perhaps hide the immediate presence of a gate camp or the like for 4 or 8 hrs but is priced similarly to mobile warp bubbles the pos module type would be about as expensive as the large mobile comm disruptors for a system jammer provided you have sov and a constellation jammer would cost about 23x a system jammer but is only usable with constellation sov
1 notice local is gone2 rabble in intel channels 3 summon the blob monster4 eliminate jammer
would only agree to it if a cant be anchored at a pos b acts as a grid wide cyno jammer otherwise bait  hotdrop would be too easy c make a smallmediumlarge which is completely inline with bubbles in terms of cost and m3 d make the size of the item effect area they cover ie smalls do the system they are dropped inmediums do 1 jump out of system they are dropped in must be same constellationlarges do whole constellation i like the idea but i cant 1 it in its current formalso whilst on the old subject of removing local anyone ever thought of or suggested a blinded local ie you can clearly see how many people are in local but have no idea who they are until they talk 
wow that would spice up the game a lot lol

support for new hulls dont care whatbutfirst off the reason pirate stuff is weird and awesome is because it takes two faction skills to fly bc and destris all have the same skillbook unless they rework the game to require racial skillbooks on the bc level the multirace awesomness of the pirate bcs will be dilutedalsoconcern for an ubertanking guristas drake that can do good damage through drones
not supporting imagine a navy issue drake
support more faction ships just make eve that much deeper and whats with you guys not supporting this based on your own halfassed predictions about their stats what are you an idiots
there is no room in the lineups to accommodate faction bcs the only way to do it would be to gimp the tier2s severely and even then a faction version would trample all over the lower bs tiers domaincould theoretically make them t1 command ships with bonuses to augment the different factions ships and builtin ability to field two ganglinks but straight up faction bcs are insane to even considerjust imagine how stupidly op an angel or serpentis bc would be  some things are better left in the dream realm

great suggestion  with modificationsthere should be some form of direct warp to destinationhaving to travel the univers system by system using gates is old technologyit should be possible to align directly to destination and activate warpit may require several warps to reach destination depending on distance you never know where you will stop  where cap runs out and you have to wait for cap recharge before activating warp again this may actually solve more problems than just zzzzz  37 jumps to destination  afk zzz damn slow freighterbeing able to warp directly to a bookmark in any system will provide a lot more of a challange for pirates than just camping a gate and waiting for easy pray it will bring a lot more life and fun to low sec and null sec
had to reply to thislets take a normal frigate warps at 6ausec and you want to travel 1 lightyear which is not terribly far say for discussion 10 jumpsthe 1 lighyear warp is 63239 au that would take your frigate which has faster than most warp speeds 10539 seconds or 29 hours you also cant do that in one warp say the maximum warp a frigate can do is 250 au varies on fit and skill but use this for discussion you would also have to perform 252 warps to successfully complete the distance because of cap requirements this is assuming you 100 recharge cap in your warpso being able to do that is not really viable with game mechanics let alone the session system present in eve news flash eve is huge i bet the average warp spanning a single gate jump would take 20 minutes and several warps jump gates are really the only viable tech to travel warping the distance would be old school
on numerous occasions ive been in a fleet that was ready to engage another fleet and one side ends up running away or disengaging because were going to get hotdropped or they outgun us or we dont have anything to counter their ecmlogi i think eve needs to introduce a matchmaking system that allows players to challenge others or sign up for pvp slots in a predetermined manner that makes it fair for both sides these opposing fleets could have access to a temporary deadspace pocket that only allows those on the list im tired of playing the shipup game or having people worrying about if were going to get dropped on id just like to pvp and test my fleet vs another fleet without taking into account the fairness of the fight that so many people worry about you could have different brackets frigs cruisers etc or do a system similar to the alliance tournament im all for the random encounters and leroying into the great unknown but i wouldnt mind just signing up for a fight sometime and blowing the hell out of some ships without somebody leaving system because one side doesnt feel like they have a fighting chancetheres no satisfaction without action win or lose its better to fight than to have not fought at all
i do like the idea of a matchmaking style feature  more pew pew means more ships go boom which is always good exact details of how this is worked out would be up to ccp but eve is built around the construction and destruction of ships
oh god no get on the test server if you want to test your fleet fits
a matchmaking system has nothing to do with eve fleet combat or piracy or suicide ganking or roaming gangsor etc etc if you want to organize arena stile duels you can start a matchmaking service for interested players or lobby the assembly forum to get an arena feature where players enter combat for prizes it could be a nice unique feature for low sec back alley blood sports but it should in no way touch the oher forms of combat
no that would go against everything eve is
haahahahahahahaha hell nogoback2wowbye
i think its a great idea this doesnt eliminate or change the rest of the game as the others seem to think just a tournament style fights maybe team and single ranking system to go along with it if you try to warp out or go out of range while the fight is in progress you go popit would be a way for people to really test their skills without worry about 10 more of their friends jumping in suddenly to slaughter you that part of the game is all well and good and i am not saying change a thing about that but its not satisfying also as mentioned it would definitely stimulate the ship destructionbuilding cycle also it will give you a chance to pvp without having to spend 4 hours trying to find one or two ships to actully fight
errrr no
its a horrible ideea there should never be instances in eve you might as well be asking for separate servers eve is about pvp for a reason and with consequences fights that dont matter have no place in it thats what sisi is for
okay but for consistency ban the alliance tournament and the 4x4 one at fanfest
if the fight doesnt matter to you then why do you care you dont have to participate its not game breaking in anyway its just creating one more venue for pvp people are not going to stop pirating in low sec care bears are not going to stop flying through it so what exactly is the problem saying hey thats a bad idea is rubbish if you think its a bad idea explain yourself or dont bother and further what does any of that have to do with wow
then form an arena fight nothing to stop you ccp doesnt have to put anything new in the game to do this
theres something called test server especially for that dont make this game like world of warcraft please
try starting a channel that is specificly designed to hook up duelistsgangs no new feature needed
the shortbus to wow is just waiting around the corner if you hurry you might still catch it
i apologize for on behalf of everyone for the rage against wowtards whether they want me to or not we dont want this feature because it is too much like the combat system in other mmosother mmos tend to be designed so that only consensual combat is allowed through use of a challenge system like you are proposing people are scared that this new idea would take away the total immersion that people love about eve its hard to explainin eve online you are at risk every minute of every hour that you happen to be outside of the station this makes it feel real to the participants i dont know why but we seem to like being threatened with mortal terroreve online sells itself on being unscripted the duels you propse smell like a scriptmost of all were scared that if this gets inserted then it will eventually become the only way to pvp because enough people cried i know you are not suggesting that but you are opening the door for someone else toi canot support your idea i apologize for the rude guys who share my point of view though i do not excuse their actionsis it so hard to keep a civil tone guys
a bit yes when you hear the same idea over and over and over and over and over and over again even though we have a well known very efficient 3rd party search function evesearch the urge to flamebaitridiculeexplode someone becomes nigh irresistible
spot on
i know people have asked for similar things butif youre ever part of major fleets one of the most obnoxious things is getting information out to people just joining every fleet chat channel should be able to create a fleet motd that comes up the moment you get into fleet and can be refreshed as needed i am very aware of other tools already in game and out of game but lets be honest most of them are highly ineffective by comparison in unison with this request bossfcwcsc should be able to moderate text abilities in fleet chat as needed they should have the power to dictate text color of their type and silence people who shouldnt be talking
there is a nifty little thing called fleet description that already serves this purpose and it does it very wellunfortunatelytheres no way yet for ccp to augment players brain cells so they check fleet descriptions like they know they shouldalso no theres nothing more enjoyable than whiney fleet spam as your fc screams at you to shut up

if youre having troubles avoiding pirates at gates youre either using the wrong ship or you using the right ship the wrong way either that or you need to arrange an escort that can smash the pirates it is a massively multiplayer game afterallas has been said before jump drives are one of the many ways to travel through space other than using gates there are also wormholes which very much fill the going off the beaten track desirethis proposal will just open up a whole lot of design both game and technical architecture issues to have to be resolvednot supported
i really thank you every commentthat helps me a lot to understand other points of view about openspace proposal and other alternativesbut i dont give up at all i know that maybe this is not the way but i hope for some day i can explore the space mores as a sci fi classic universe without gates this proposal was born from different needsat first the idea was to remove stargates but later i thought that could be great to have both travel systemi want to travel this way without being a veteran player i like to explore that areas from second oneand so many that i know that are only personal thoughtsi thought that i was not the only one who likes this idea andall this negative supports really surprises me but i have to understandanywayi like to hear more alternatives to this proposal

i guess i disagree about my posts there i think i have been pretty consistent about what happened with the tracking disrupter bug i made mistakes my corp made mistakes ccp made mistakes i would of course like to talk about other things as well since i am not running on a boost tracking disrupters platform wormhole residents need a representative on csm we have unique playstyles and run into bugs and annoyances that other people dont
good luck and free bump for wspace
to make mistakes is humanto make mistakes intentionally is even more human
sorry but i dont buy it someone really loving this game and wanting it to become better would never get down to using exploits for sure gms made a mistake but that should not be a pardon for using a still clear exploit besides it is evident from the two steps blog that he is well aware of bots and injections fucntions aware to that stage that even gives examples where and for what purpose did he get that knowledge may i ask who can garantee that two step and aharm do not use such modifications to get an upperhand as thay have used an evident exploit beforein the eve game universe little can be worse then exploit and macrouser but what is worse for sure is an expolit and macro user in csm and i hope it will not happen
in my opinion wormholes are fine at the moment the mechanics behind them make life in here fun and mostly excitinghowever if you have any suggestions that you would be putting forward to ccp regarding wormholes if chosen as csm i think other residents would like to hear them before casting a vote
actually being aware and pushing for some client defence is a good thing though its usually uphill battle  as long as client remains ehm a client  it should be considered compromised at the moment ccp has a way to detect malicious code operation though in some examples they have broken their own architecture concept of thinclient which left some holes open for exploiters
of course i am aware there are folks in wormholes using them right now we have a clear corp policy that python injection stuff will get you kicked from corp we will not tolerate it at all all of my information was gathered from publicly available sources in fact i have had several idiots ask me where they can learn more about the stuff i mentioned which is why i didnt provide linksoh and ace i will be posting my wormhole improvement list later todayalso i will be at the ccp gathering at pax east on march 12th hopefully i will see some of you there and can talk in person about what i can bring to the csm
i agree that wormholes are fun but that doesnt mean there isnt more that could be done to make them even better i just put up my post on what i would like to see ccp address on my blog
another blog update this time a post about ccp spending more time right after shipping an expansion
what an insightful blog so you say once mmos push content to live they should listen to feedback incredible idea its almost like they need some sort of council of players to help filter feedback to them directly
while what you said is true i dont think that is exactly what i am saying right now ccp releases a bunch of new content and considers things done what i am saying is that they need to build time into their schedules to do postrelease work on new features when a big feature like incursions is released it isnt really done but ccp seems to move the teams that were working on it onto other tasks i would like to encourage them to keep the teams working on their features for one or two more sprints
what the hell are you talking about there were multiple patches over the following days and weeks fixing elements of incursions do we even play the same game
here we are in the shady area of issue classification at this point they are all up to fixing code issues say mwdcloak crashes ati radeon windows 7 clientsbut redesign incursion sites  thats an enhancementnew feature  so it goes into pool and will be fetched out as soon as developer has time sometimes it means neverif they have say 160 hours allocated per team member for postpatch feedback enhancements per team member and put it into plans then issue would be most likely resolved
while it would be great to see a credible wh corp candidate for csm credible is a key word there and aharm are not only exploiters but usually really smug about it too so their members sorta fail that criterium sorry as much as i love wh stuff and would like ccp to make it even better ffs make t3 subsystem swapping at a pos possible i dont trust ya and am not gonna vote for ya
i dont think i have been smug at all about what happened if you have specific concerns please feel free to eve mail or convo me i have spoken to a bunch of different wormhole corporations in the past few days and have been getting pretty positive responses and some great suggestions for issues to raise
exactly certainly ccp puts effort into fixing critical issues that are discovered but they dont seem to be putting effort into things like balance changes or tweaking the newly released content i am not talking about the flood of bug fix patches here i am talking about small content changes to react to the way the players play the game
so you live in a wormhole that makes you a worm real minority in eve why should you be in council
maybe after 3 hours the cloaks frequency modulation could go out of sink  meaning you are now scanable  and shut down on its own so the afk cloaker either has to come back within every 3 hours to disengageengage or log or risk being scanned assuming hes smart enough to be in a safe spot
as far as i know there was never any mention of mining having to be more profitable than pi in iskh setting up a good pichain takes more effort and skill personal not sps as well as a better understanding of eves market than mining to make it work right right now its no longer as cheap to run a pos compared to prepi but neither are capital module production or t2 production however even if current prices arent great eve has changed since 2003 and it is now much easier to acquire isk in any profession

hello spacefriends i am once again running for csm last year with support from no alliance we got remarkably close my views of the csm have not changed and im still as passionate as ever let us first talk about what the csm is and what it isnt many csm candidates believe that the csm is a venue to make gamedevelopment changes graphics redesign or bugfixes i am here to tell you that that is not the case the csm can only be successful if people on the csm accept what the job entails not some fantasy position the csm represents the concerns and needs of the players to ccp it is more than just a sounding boardso what makes a good csm candidate from my perspective its an active player who has an intimate knowledge of the game and who is also intuned with the community someone with strong views but who is capable of compromise someone that knows how a corporation thinks and can give feedback from a business perspective as well as a gameplay perspective this is precisely what i offer i understand that when running any sort of election the easiest way to win is to pledge to fix what everyone wants but eve is a different game filled with a much smarter base so i know that the people who promise the undeliverable will not get the votes i dont have the luxury of being a wellknown eve celebrity nor do i have a major powerbloc endorsing me so i need every vote that i can get and i will hustle for them so if you have any specific questions on where i stand just send me an evemail or post in this thread and i will be happy to give you my honest answer  not just the one you want to hear by nature of the csm the large 00 powerblocs will easily get their candidates  but this leaves the smalltomedium sized groups wanting the mediumsized groups are the ones that i will do my best to cater toback to my qualifications ive been playing eve for going on six years and ive explored every avenue the game has to offer in the last six months i have run through wormholes gone roaming through lowsec taken small gangs through 00 taken massive supercapital gangs through 00 run explorations taken part in the first incursions run the industrial  logistics wing of a corporation and much more unlike many my knowledge of the game is current  although i remember how it once was back in the day i know all about how the game is now while i look forward to answering every question thrown at me and i intend to hold townall style meetings to hear everyones voice i will list a small sample of some growing concerns and how i would handle them again im not promising to deliver all these things but its a look into how i would handle some major issuesnow with more cool video
station games  former csm notes suggested that a warp scrambler could keep a ship from docking with the trade off being that you can see outside the station before undocking i am vehemently against this idea although sometimes it is frustrating for some guy to sit on the undock in a dreadnaught or a supertanked battleship this change would ruin the little guy sometimes the only time a small force can fight a larger foe is when they can dictate at least one term and in the case of station fighting being able to kill some illprepared support ships and dock if things get out of control i understand that in eve there needs to be risk however currently with super capitals there is still a huge risk of aggroing on station removing this option just promotes them to stay docked  eliminating any chance of a fight  or bring more people crashing the node and eliminating any chance of a fight guerrilla warfare doesnt need to be nerfed a relatively recent phenomenon is ships circumventing the aggression timer by storing the aggrod ship into the ship maintenance bay of a carrier obviously this goes against the nature of the game and should be changed the most obvious change is to extend the aggression timer for ship storage as well as docking  but perhaps just transferring the cumulative aggression to the carrier accepting the ships would sufficeneutral logistics  ive seen the slaved abaddons deaggroing and warping in a guardian until they can dock heck ive even been that guardian in the same vein as above there is a simple alternative and that is just giving the logistics ship that does the repping an aggression timer that is to say after repping a ship the logistics cannot then immediately dock or jump they have to wait the one minute like everyone else local in 00  the question of local chat being an intelligencegathering tool has been discussed for years and if ccp were to make inroads into changing local as it would need to be handled with the utmost of care removing local altogether would likely be far too drastic a change to implement a suitable compromise would be to have anywhere between a 15 and 30 second local delay the pilot jumping in will be able to see everyone in local who has been there for more than 1530 seconds but he will remain out of local until his timer expires similar in theory to jumping in and remaining cloaked to make holding space more valuable systems with military upgrades and a new upgrade local scanning upgrade or something similar will have a 20 per level reduction in the local delay so a system with military upgrades 5 and this local scanning upgrade will have no local delay this encourages people to live in and upgrade systems those who venture out for solidarity alliance will do so with an increased risk likewise roaming gangs would have more maneuverability in the outlying areas but would be more at risk in the main systems
mini professions  maybe its just me but i always thought that the explorers out there kind of get shafted i mean their job can be done fairly well by a dude in a drake with two weeks of training i know specialized covert alts pilots can find these sites faster but a non specialized ship can find them fairly easily compare this to mining or even missioning and its a joke miners aspire to fly exhumers misisoners aspire to marauders and explorers aspire todrake dont get me wrong my love for the drake is well documented but i think tech3s provide a great platform for making professions more than just mini no ship gets a bonus to analyzers or code breakers what about giving the emergent locus analyzer subsystem a 10 bonus per level  you can ditch the tractor beam velocity bonus if you want i really dont think anyone even uses that especially with the noctis explorers be they in wormholes or wherever will then have a de facto ship with the same thing in though gas cloud mining is another mini profession that has been left wanting there is no ship that gets a bonus to mining gas clouds maybe im totally wrong here but ive never seen anyone flying a skiff ever why not retool that ship to get a gas cloud bonus you can even get a gas strip miner if you want thats cool with me you retool an existing unused ship for a new use nextlevel pragmatic space maneuverlowsec missions and risk vs reward  lowsec is probably my favorite part of the game and incursions have begun a longneeded revitalization  but it is not enough the way i see it the main problem is that there is no real reason for people risk venturing into lowsec solo miners can make just as much money in highsec with no risk small mining groups can make tons more mining abc ores in wormhole space which frankly is safer than lowsec missioners can make more in lowsec compared to highsec but its a fraction of the revenue when compared to running sanctums in 00 the one thing lowsec does have going for it is pos reactions but even then those dont necessitate living in that system  all one has to do is check on the pos at most once a week exploration is slightly better in lowsec but only slightly what i think needs to be done to stimulate lowsec is to both increase the reward to be more in line with the risk and to decrease the reward in highsec to be more in line with the risk there i do not want to see lowsec become 00lite it does need its own swagger with incursion it is clear the ccp believes the same with giving lowsec incursions key advantages over both highsec and nullsec another avenue that can be trekked is a spin on alchemy alchemy which was introduced to combat soaring promethium and dyprosium prices has been left untouched giving lowsec a bonus to alchemy and expanding alchemy to include neodymium and technetium could be a welcomed changeadditionally id like to see lowsec exploration a little bit more profitable i think the best way to tackle this is to reduce the number of sites in high sec and increase the yield of sites in lowsec like mission running corps exploration corps would have more of a purpose and would merge different groups together
factional warfare  i participated in fw the summer it first came out and i was very active in it it was probably the most fun ive had in lowsec ever after the initial awe factor wore off however it became very stagnant and boring with the addition of fw specific lp factional warfare has picked up i want to continue this trend and i have a few ideas first race with the most victory points will be given a spot in the alliance tournament they will have to pay the entry fee like everyone else and can choose not to field a team if they wish in which case it will go into the lottery i think this will encourage people to stay in fw for more than a month and make it a bona fide profession additionally new systems that are conquered should give a small bonus to the owning faction  perhaps a bonus similar to a nonmindlinked fleet leader of course these will not stack with existing leadership skills  itll merely act as a gang member with pretty good gang skills it may not be a huge motivator for conquering systems but i think it will be significant enough to make people consider taking systems and for having certain factions live in certain systems either way there needs to be a commitment to keep the new features up to datei do welcome any questions in this thread as i mentioned earlier and as electiontime nears i will be reaching out to the community for questions asked ill do a chribbainspired raffle and give away something neat to those who have asked questions unfortunately like many in the game im mostly spacepoor so the prize will be something interesting

hrm okay ill bite1 i like most of what you have said however i have a big difficulty with the neutral logi point i agree that it is fairly blueballesque behavior however i would be concerned about changing this given the current way that remote repping outlaws is dealth with specifically you get gcc for repping an outlaw i have a feeling that if your idea was implemented it would really rip up pirate based logi teams much as the nerf to ewar made falcon alts or ewar highly risky for pirates in lowsec exbydi and surge member here so i have personal experience with those issues2 why not do a constellation bonus to the fw teams make it like a generic version of the way sov levels used to work prefix in 00 time held determines bonus with one system being constellation capital  specifically make it 2reduction in repairclone etc costs per level of holding for members of the holding faction and then 1 for properly aligned faction this would really focus the power bases and then encourage the conquering or disruption of enemy systems perhaps they could add in a very limited portal ability once a system capital had effective sov 5 it would need a different name ofc maybe an npc portal which charges x amount of isk  a discount based on fw standing of each pilot that links 1 constellation capital with another have the routes be pregenned or shifting on a scheduled basis ie part of an npc campaign to conquer places this way its important to fight for a full constellation both as possessor and defender and it funnels more pilots into nice fights perhaps an increase in bounties for missions that are in enemy fw space bribed to raid rp type thing maybe implement a type of contract that can be fwwide ala alliance contracts also what about a  discount on taxes or broker deals for controlling fw coalitionsthese are just ideas that pop up atm but ill think of more
this is literally the single best person i have run into playing eve online i will support him forever
grath is just looking for some nepotism
i supported and voted for elise last year when i didnt even know him well just based on his excellent ideas and knowledge of the gamethis year as my ceo ive gotten to see first hand that he really is the best candidate out there plus also hes a super nice guy i literally dont know anyone that doesnt like elise
is your speaking voice super annoying
if it keeps bad posters like you off the csm i am all for bloc voting hijinks
moon income at the highest level is for corporationalliance costs anyone making huge personal tech moons profit off of it is a leech ours are used for subsidies sov costs infrastructure and reimbursementsbotting does need to die but as noted earlier ccp has to fry the bigger fish rmters before they can unholy rage mk ii the smaller guy botting for his plexes because while all botters are lazy rmters are actually stealing money from ccps pocket and at the bottom of it all ccp is still a businesswho said mittani favored supercapital fights especially those of the server killing kind he multiboxes drakes and maelstroms on fleet fights and gets an erection about his sabre in smallgang stuff everyone wants supercapitals nerfed because everyone agrees its killing 00 pvpalso no one in my years here has been told to skip work or school many people have done so and have been called and i quote fing idiots and on occasion worse than the maps changed a lot this is bad there was much laughter when we lost delve to our own incompetenceand pretty much exactly for the reasons laid out in mittanis latest tthcom post yes it is the most stagnant in our recallable history because a big war was just won a feud that has lasted years is decided and by most stagnant i mean nc is fighting on the drone border and dc is skirmishingoutright fighting evzeroke so most stagnant  wars still happening which invalidates the point i figure you were trying to makerebalance supercaps and remap sovereignty to twothree years ago thisd still be the most interesting time in eve to play maybe rollback dominion sov mechanics too 
i wonder how mittens feels about the 00 logisitics
youre not spank and you never will be
if i may as mittanis response didnt include this albeit i think his campaign understands these factsas a business ccp takes stock in public opinion of them if the player base feels like theyre being ignored theyll become discontented and if actively rejected upset when an idea is brought forward initially it starts as i think this is a good idea those ideas then build evidence and are presented as a cause to the government in this case ccp devs if the cause has a large part of the populace affected by it then the supreme authority of the standing government should take notice and make a motion to edit it for the sake of public opinion in real life for votes to get reelected in here with our walletssoif the csm is listened to by ccp peacefully then its doing its job as described this is desiredif the csm only agrees with ccp or disagrees with ccp but doesnt raise some hell public opinion is at best irrelevant discontent increasesif the csm is not being listened to by ccp and raises some hell and it fixes something that many people need not just a corporation or alliance but the entirety of 00 or lowsec or highsec then its evolving into an effective interface between the players and the people who design what is playedlastly and heres where a hardline maneuver comes in handy if the upvoted backlog expands as hundreds of things tens of thousands of people approve of fall into development hell while new and shiny with poor support structure underneath continue showing up if the csm is being ignored pressures ccp and ccp pulls the plug it shows that were being ignored and this is just a political bluff to make us fat dumb and happyall these words to say when pandering to our desire to feel important we may get comfortable with the position of the csm even if ccp contemplates only one in every twenty ideas and utilizes one in a hundred they can hide behind minor successes the csm needs to be a driving force and if ccp cuts them off itll do more harm than good for them we need a powerful leader for the csm and a powerful enough figure to garner the following to get therelongpostmepost it may be my being american but when theres problems that are allowed to sit while the government tries new failed experiments its my civic duty to complain madisons 1st amendment speech and assembly clauses and resist jeffersons belief in frequent political revolutions rather than roll over key example jumpbridges if the silly notion of removingor sharply nerfing actually is being contemplated hell yeah it needs to be addressed that would do terrible things to the 00 playerbase across the board which would cause quitting which would hurt ccps bottom line which would reduce their budget to give us what we want as players everywhere a decision by people who dont use them hurting people who do needs a strong force to undo the damage before its put in placethats what i want in csm6 and thats why mittani has my votetldr ccp needs apply communitywide approved csm ideas with more zeal rather than bucketing them if they dont itll suck for them mittani has a track record of getting s done i am the gsf and i vote
you cant really enforce an external gamemechanic based fix on what are ultimately social bonds between players you can try but itll just be worked around via jabber irc fleets in different areas or any number of cunning ways you cant force people to be friends any more than you can force them to not be friends diplomacy has always been a weapon in this game that some master usually blocs and some complain about usually elite pvp nostandings entities who end up losing to blocs while i dont think that id be in a position to ram through anything involving ui since thats not what the csm does sadly my personal take on the ui issue is that ccp should in an ideal world open up ui programming just like blizzard has in wow the wow ui has incorporated a whole slew of playerdesigned mods over the years which has made the ui ever better by contrast the eve ui is a dogs breakfast a goddamned spreadsheet in space ugh i think pi is boring as hell i have a couple of pi alts i tried it i have no idea how its going to work with dust does anyone even mention dust anymore heh i had hopes it would be a cool minigame or develop into one its not right now its tedious crap better than ratting though
vile rat obviously i could have kept the official gsf vote all to myself but vr works for the state department and is a political genius as anyone whos dealt with him ingame would know he is the good cop to my bad cop and weve done a lot together over the years seleene and i get along famously even though were technically hostile to each other at the moment he also knows the ins and outs of how ccp works better than anyone else who will be on the csm which is going to be key if my unpleasant hunch  that the rot lies within the lack of best practices in ccp itself  turns out to be more than a hunch ill be pretty happy with the usual suspects who i suspect will get in im not sure how the russian vote is going to line up since i cant read the language well either have krutoj or death or possibly both the nc will vote in at least one guy assuming they dont votesplit into a billion shards i expect test to come out strong for white tree in sum im not too worried about it i think that ill be able to work with just about anyone especially since my campaign message has essentially been agreed to by just about every other candidate wrt the csm needing to be a more powerful effective advocate and for the backlog to be addressed im saying the sky is blue its hard to argue with that
the year of excellence with the htfu video the switching to scrum the x wrote this and nobody else dares touch that code  these issues raise such a stench of code smell that i dont even have to be on the same side of the planet to smell itid love to work with ccp even if its only so i can unravel the pos code and put them on the path to resurrecting the dead horse who knows maybe at fanfest ill get a ccp hr person drunk enough that they offer me a jobin the meantime good luck with getting all the nc to vote for the candidate theyre supposed to i look forward to seeing goons see just how good they can make this game before they get around to screwing it up 
well here goesfirst off let me say im no fan of the goonsin fact if i said i think their lower than a rattlesnakes belly in a wagon rutit would be being generousthat said i find myself agreingjeez whats the universe coming towith mittansboyccp have forgoten the number one rule of retailthe customer is always righteven when their wrongthey dont give a monkeys ass about our viewsanyone who has ever submitted a pettition knows thisthe only way they will sit up and listen is if we all stopped payingunfortunatly there is a sizable group within evewho think ccp can do no wrongyou only had to read the gushingvomit inducing forums when the game went down for a day a little while backguys they gave you a few skill pointsnot a fully fitted wyvernthe next best thing is someone on the council who will annoy the devsso vote for the mittanieven if he turns out to be full of you know where you stand with a goonand as he sayshe is a ruthlessdevious bastardyou know you get with him exactly what it says on the tinso good luckbut methinks ccp will block your attempt at being chair
 i actually twitched trying to read that hes right but needs to resurrect his spacebar in some arcane ritual its in its death spasms
i read the subject of your message as saying the other candidates are lying to the players has the message changed or do the current crop of candidates agree that they are lying to the players or is there some other they that is doing the lyingdo you think anyone running again from csm 5 will win if so how do you think they will feel about you calling them the current crop of idiots do you think you will be able to manipulate them like your goons who you claim  would give you all of their votes if you didnt allow vile rat to run
huh
thank you i have edited the original post
what do you have against your spacebar
every year someone is going to change csm just more smoke going up the buthole but nothing actually happens i think this has more to do with the goons being preemptively buthurt about proposed 00 changes
more that when ccp proposed drastic changes to 00 nobody on the current csm said anything about it theres nothing wrong with getting people elected to the csm that actually live in nullsec to give feedback on nullsec changes
hi allin support of my csm6 run i will be teaching a series of free pvp fundamentals classesyou can find the details on the classes here
aye this is why you need to do more research than the little posts as any csm wanabe can claim anything they want but its worth nothingwithout the work involvedchose a dedicated csm rep who is willing to give it the effort it requires
could you please confirm what your stand is on the scalable gui and in game fonts being too small for the modern big display screens i am asking knowing that there have been numerous threads in the eve forums about this but none of them seem to have been addressed by game developers the game graphics become more and more sophisticated and beautiful but high resolutions that allow us to experience the game fully like 1920x1080 1920x1200 or more make most of ingame text unreadable and gui buttons extremely difficult to hitlooking forward to your comment
prolly voting trebor cuz of lack of suitable carebear candidate
oh well while im quite fond of my ideas but i have many and very different from one anotheri was just trying to expose a vision and get your opinion on it there are many creative minds around and many ideas and even if players cant do game design i do think that players can give some good ideas to ccp because after all some of us has a lot of experience its up to them to evaluate our ideas and theirs any big change in the game will have a lot of opposition amongst the players because we managed and even worked hard to succeed in the game as it is now changing rules will always worsen the game for someone
trebor
as an older player who peers at his 24 lcd through readingglasses and whose palsied hands shake as they attempt to rightclick on things im all in favor of a scalable and userextendable uiat the summit back in june ccp said they were making progress on an update to the eve font and hopefully more information about that and other global ui improvements will be forthcoming soon ive made a request in the csm internal forum for a status update and i will pass on what i learn as soon as possible
trebor thank you for your prior work on the cswm and offering to do it again in your prioritization you did not start to give any special weight to the proposals until the person voted for over 20 of them i think that is quite high would you be in favor of allowing the prioritization vote to be entirely weighted so if you have 20 points you could put them all to one issue or maybe 15 toward one proposal and 5 against another proposal etc
thanks for all your hard work in csm5 i hope you can continue it in csm6 the small thing i can do my votes are gonna be there
on wormholes  if youve never watched this you might find the first ten minutes or so interesting complete with me trolling mittens about the retribution around 7 mins in if youd really like to get a firm grasp on how short dominion fell off from what was originally intended especially the bit on treaties watch until around 20 mins apologies if i seem out of it because like third day of fanfest and no one was awake  sober insofar as wormholes themselves go im definitely the csm candidate who can argue most effectively about whats not going on with them and why they should eventually be iterated on it was a massive feature with an insane amount of potential which we originally planned to fold over into dominion and beyondapochribba heh was the first time ccp actually went back into the lore of eve and pulled out a white rabbit to do something new and scary anyone that follows the science skill paths knows that there are several other races out there besides the sleepers and each one of them has their own specialty with that as a base we wanted to slowly phase in the discovery of ancient technologies that would make new ship types new modules and even new forms of travel possibleexample 1  using specialized awesome racial technology you could install a one time use module or rig in your jump capable ship and instead of making a jump you would actually fold space in order to reach new regions far out of the range of ordinary jump drives true explorationexample 2  the t3 modular concept has always been intended to expand beyond just one ship class there were even public discussions about modular weaponry and ship fittings custom  brand name industrythese are the sort of possibilities that have been left behind and overlooked for going on two years nowso when you ask do you have any thoughts as to building on wspace as a game niche my response is yes i fall back into the thought processes that went into the original design and just want to see them continue i want to see them expand and grow beyond just the initial implementation insofar as the current implementation of the original wormhole design there are flaws in it that should really be addressed but once again no iteration id like to see npc sleeper capital ships attacking and clearing out players starbases or sleepers emerging into 00 and lowsec systems to poke around and do some investigating of their own sounds a bit like incursions yes id like to see finite sources of things like moon goo or harvesting awesome out of a quasar chaos mass hysteria and all thati could wall of text forever about the things that i would like to see happen but the primary job of the csm isnt to go into that level of detail  its the csms job to relentlessly remind ccp of the desires and needs of the people that pay the subscription fees asking why one of the most popular features ever released especially a feature i worked on has not had one aspect of it touched or tweaked in nearly two years thats not something i need much encouragement to do
as my last will and testament i shall support this endeavor to the bitter end we sail comradecheerslowa
im happy to see youre a candidate sel you have at least one of my votes
oh i forgot about this im still running and i still promise fishi will also attempt to have the value of isk moved to a gold standard ccp will be required to have gold or at least some shiny plastic on hand at all times to lend real world value to our isk
sound platform seems like hed make a good csm
i like his objectives and his campaign platform and i think that draco would make a solid representative for people who want to make sure that mittens and the rest of the csm keep ccp in line thumbs up
cometh the hour cometh the man
you speak as someone who has never experienced deep 00 travel i trust based on your statements and corporation this is your main if you get a moment then please do thisacquire a digital map of the eve universe without a sovereignty overlay but with security statusesopen it in a simple imaging program if youre using a microsoft windows operating system open your start menu and type paint into the search bar select the only option you should get and when it opens click file then open find the file and double click it to openusing a penor brush tool draw a line around the first 5 systems in any direction outward from the center that show after their name the number 00then again with the same tool pick your color of choice and randomly click that area outside the amoebicshaped ring you just drew for about 37 seconds depending on how far into the future youre lookingthis exercise will have showed you what the sovereignty map will look like if your concept of logistical nerfs were to see fruitionlets be honest youll go 40 jumps to ruin the day of someone who claimed sovereignty in your sector of the universe but you wont go 40 jumps to source the minerals or modules forof the 1600mm artillery iis you need to do it this is because larger scale logistics are required for larger scale corporations and allianceswhat you think your proposing is a dissolution of blocs what youre actually seeking is the dissolution of alliances in general so long as there are people where there are enemies there will be enemies of those enemies and they may as well be friends corporations bond together to form alliances alliances form blocs corporations will still form blocs if theres no alliance mechanic based on mutual interests and agreement on what alcohol tastes best on tuesdayssovereignty will be held by the most powerful blocs still and will only be however far people feel like reaching to live and those people will control the trade routes to the outer areas denying access to the smaller entities anywaysand when people try to etch their name in space theyll get it but for the 4 days itll take to take the system from them because even if no one wants to run from period basis in a mammoth to get the hydrogen isotopes their jump freighter didnt bring enough of you could hide in jove space for all anyone caressomeone will still find a way to get there just to f your day upedit im leaving this up for truth but i apologize for not noticing disgruntled flying monkeys posts were obvious trolls it took how blatantly off they were in themittanis thread for me to notice
youre trying to use logic against bismarukalle deimos and his sock puppet army its really not worth the effort
im willing to vote for vile rat but theres a 300 mill isk prevote security deposit hell get it back right after the electionplease send 300mill per vote up to 5 to this character thanks
o vile best of luck i hope you get in di would like to say a few things if i could i have not been playing eve for long but i have been closely following it since late 2003imo traditionally there had been three and a half aspects to eve in terms of flying high sec natural newby space low sec fun shenannigans with others nul sec serious player alliance foundations and war decs a way to mix all three uptraditionally nul sec space has been nearly off limits to new people in a large group due to easy gankability and that is fine lately though dreddit came along and with an upside down map they ended up in goon space with a new alliance built for newbies testpersonally having tried low sec and nul sec space several times previously it ended very badly with much isk burnt and a feeling of well bugger this for a joke test though is another story newbies can come in and be surrounded by fellow alliance members and feel safe in a stable environment bittervets oversee things in the alliance and from other alliances helping the newbros along i think this combination of new people being adopted by vets is one of the best things ever in eve newbies can learn quickly about isk making and pvp better than in any area of high seci for one would enthusiastcly support anyone on the csm if they researched other ways to promote this team work and promoted it to ccp in ways to make it easier to happeni think it has happened in the north alot because a the ratting is good b tech moons c not near amarr space i think noobs may be kos more with amarr than other factionsin the south i would support better ratting proposals to not only invite established alliances to help newbies in to their space but also remove the need to have botslastly i will add my voice to anyone who promote fixing the hels bonuses at present it is  please get it fixed to be as effective as an aeonnyx and fix the niddy to plz a vote for vile rat is not a vote for goons it is a vote for an effective voice to the people who run eve
but every hel just extends my buffer tank
have you seen me if you did youd vote for the guy who im stuck with and whos stuck with me
thanks for taking the time to respond could you clarify your points for me a little00so may i infer that in your opinion its not really a lack of goals but the lack of ability to attain those goals for some groups you seemed to articulate the goals better ratsmining ownershipinitially but perhaps i misunderstoodlowagain you seemed to articulate some goals pew pew without the hassles of 00 but then claim that there is no point is your argument or what i interpreted in the 00 section that the goals are too hard to achievealso could you clarify your metric a little further you mention that you know these problems are fixed when 1there is a pointwhen people go to lownull and 2 those goals are achievable by small groups it seems that people already go to those areas and have goals for doing so is your concern in 1 that there are insufficient people doing so if so then what would be the numbers you think are necessarycheersedit formatting

as much as i enjoy roleplaying and try to consider all matters from an ic incharacter perspective ingame the csm election is by nature something that can only be ooc out of characteri assume that your declaration meant that you would not vote for me because your main character is minmatar while mine is amarr while an unfriendly relationship between our characters would be very understandable please remember that you would be vote for me silver quettier and not my character gehen sealbreakeri have many friends playing minmatar characters amongst which some are members of em  uk and some of their characters truly hate mine its all part of the story a story that as player were writing together no faction will be overlooked by me as the voice of roleplayers from the gigantic amarr empire to the tiniest of players factionspeople who feel minmatar will vote for me because they know i will carry their voices as roleplayers if a display of goodwill is required i can offer this  i will do what it takes to convince someone at ccp to give back malaetu shakor his lost dignitythank you for your kind supportthe biggest issues for roleplayers is a hard to define concept because they are divided in so many factions many small factions are extremely overlooked ammatars  intakis  while some other although much bigger still have internal incoherences what is the court chamberlain still doing out there what i meant by being the voice of roleplayers amongst other things it to make sure that a proper explanation can be found to every change brought to the game especially gameplaycentered ones and try to have every change and proposal made in a way that would add to the eve worlds atmosphere not remove from itif the csm as a whole was given the chance to work on a specific rp problematic of our choice and i would have to pick one id say our biggest problem is the way information is scattered and sometimes even incoherent ccp abraxas has already set things in motion to make the eve universe easier to approach and roleplaying easier if elected i will ask ccp to offer him the csms assistance or should the other representatives think little of this project my personal help
please excuse me as ive been off work ill the last few days in real life i still have many topics to cover in my campaign posts and rp is a very important aspect of eve online to me
you have my vote having read your posts on different matters in the past i think your are well suited for the jobdont let those trolls discourage you
uhm did you quoted a wrong guy misunderstood my post or just posting ironically ok im going to bitebasically what ive said is that i dont care about what other people talk about some candidate to measure the quality of a candidate i use only his program and answers to my questions as a measure of quality
putting the botting jokes aside i find krutoj to be a very smart guy he seems to know a lot about the game and has some good ideas and i believe he would be a good candidate
someone i might could actually vote fori love those crying about bots bots are even more prevalent in the north i mean seriously you ever taken time to look at npc kills in tenal or vale etcno way you can reach those kinds of numbers without botsas krutoj already pointed out bots dont buy infrastructure they are not affected by nerfs to plexes anoms etc such nerfs only hurt real players like the 111 change that caused npc buildings to no longer count towards military index that hurt real players not the bots the slower respawn time on anomalies also hurt real players not botters
to encourage more of my supports to let me know of their support and thoughts on my ideas i am starting manalpans daily lotto unlike other lotteries you do not have to pay any isk into it all you have to do it post your support for manalapan in this thread or if you are not convinced yet provide constructive questions or concerns about elements of my campaign every day one lucky manalapan support will be given a random prize the prize could be isk 50m lets not be cheap here a bunch of t2 faction and officer modules and ships except there arent officer ships are also up for grabs this will go on until the announcement of the csm winnersi will updating the op and maintaining the list of people in the drawing on this post and on my campaign blog heremanalapan daily lotto winners3511 larkonis trassler  10x large trimark armor pump i  chribba dice3611 hot tubes  20x covert ops cloaking device ii  chribba dice3711 the diety  vizans modified energized adaptive nano membrane  chribba dice3711 hot tubes  150x 125mm railgun ii  chribba dice3811 hot tubes  50x electron blaster cannon ii  chribba dice3911 targamarr  45x ice harvester ii  chribba dice31011 brusanan  50x fleeting propulsion inhibitor i  chribba dice31111 burseg sardaukar  10x large polycarbon engine housing i  chribba dice31311 trinneth  50x warp disruption field generator i  chribba dice31311 brusanan  225x heavy unstable power fluctuator i  chribba dice31311 kuroda ayumu  100x medium armor repairer ii  chribba dice31311 brusanan  200x dual 150mm railgun ii  chribba dice31311 hot tubes  150x magnetic field stabilizer ii  chribba dice31411 winternight depression  50x 425mm railgun ii  chribba dice31511 stark rayner  100m isk chribba dicemanalapan daily lotto members1 larkonis trassler2 winternight depression3 elniaga4 dark drifter5 brusanan6 burseg sardaukar7 the diety8 stella lambert9 dro nee10 prokofy neva11 hot tubes12 iphiclus13 jade elaira14 targamarr15 fer delance16 iron straw17 harbinger03108418 davey camp19 abail dark20 brusanan21 iron straw22 urian kandor23 kuroda ayumu24 burseg sardaukar25 korvin26 caster short27 burseg sardaukar28 the diety29 ediza t0gym30 honor firestorm31 brusanan32 brusanan33 shandir34 dartainien35 jinkinss36 huntin4cloud937 trinneth38 stark rayner39 sian kine40 huntin4cloud941 dartainien42 brusanan43 targamarr44 el daniels45 drakoneus aivoras46 harbinger03108447 eihla xancsia48 trinneth49 syds sinclair50 brusa51 naughtygrim52 stark rayner53 grim863454 some n00b55 askgar elzoop56 brusanan57 iron straw58 brusanan59 krythas60 dark drifter61 eli shimaya62 captjackdaniels
at least we should all know where we stand with manalapan now regarding scamming its people who claim they never would who i dont trusti know that manalapan has had a lot of experience with low sec combat and its pitfalls if you want someone to suggest yet more changes for 00 sovereignty rules and the related logistics of life there i personally agree with destroy all jump bridges then thats someone elses forte if you want someone who will do their best to propose balanced low sec ideas and methods for bringing different ships or weapons into line then manalapan is experienced in these matters
i would like to say that it seems rather bizarre that neutrals are able to apply effects remote reps etc to anyone they like its a little confusing and considerably unbalanced due to their having no affiliation to their targets it would be more understandable if you could apply effects to pilots that are blue to them through diplomatic alliance setups  but neutral involvement in warfare without retaliative intervention would be ridiculous and would jeopardise many fleet setups and tactical operationsim not even sure people that arent in alliances are even aware of what they are capable of doing without concord showing up without the learn by your faults ethics  dont even get me started on concord uberpower gank resolutions
detailed list please 
ill only list the two finishedpublished games  there are countless ideas and concepts and concept prototypes that havent gone any further than thatstartag is the one that won an award the website has lapsed now but you can download the demo herei also made a promotional asteroids clone for the polytechnic i was working for a few years back called aoraki asteroids
where do you stand on drone rightson a more serious note ive often wondered about the possibility of extending the functions of autopilots to include some modules  specifically i was thinking of active prop mods and shieldarmour hardnersthe basic idea being to add an option activate when entering warp and activate when exiting warp or something very similari understand that using ap is supposed to be risky however i dont see that this would offset the risk too much especially not those for example afk autopilot
my view is that adding anything more to autopilot would make for less active play and less opportunities for players to interact with each other in ways such as ganking for exampleif you want to get somewhere safely or quickly you ought to be doing it actively possibly even with friends for escortscouting again the mmo thing for added securityas for drone rights im all for the establishment of a wildlife reserve to ensure the preservation of our notso natural treasures
i dont think it would make it neccessarily any safer especially if its only limited to active prop mods the only real advantage from my perspective is it would mean less clicking which for me is the main reason for using autopilot in the first place  not having to manually turn the ab or mwd on for that last 15km i tend to be sitting at my desk even if i am aping between here and therei believe that the current state of affairs is little more than a cultural misunderstanding between us and the drones i believe the drones are or have tried to actively communicate with uswhere do you stand on the idea of donating say 10 of all drone sales to a drone releif fund to set up a drone shelter and fund active drone communicatuion research
while features and ideas discussion is  that way one problem i see with this is that it would be open to abuse with things like activating a cloak on warp out for cov ops cloak at leastperhaps a better idea to save the drones is to purge the drf from the drone regions and save the local wildlife
hes the guygirl great platform and the web site is very informative
i support white tree
white tree has not been a pubbie since before he played eve
i support this product andor serviceoh man unintentional page 2 snipe
thats a whole bunch of pvprelated ideaswhite tree has a grand total of 57 kills and 35 losses many of your losses are quite badly fit 3 eanms on a hyperion t1 guns on a dramiel to put it mildly this does not seem like an adequate base of experience from which to make arguments about game balance in relation to pvp do you have any pvp alts with more credible records or are you just talking a load of rubbish about something you dont understand and are very bad at
siren my killboard efficiency sirena spectacular shot at character assassination there ophelia ursus given that i have gallente battleship 5 i was happy to swap a hardener for a rig and fit a broader resistance tank i was also aware  in advance  of the opposing gangs composition and despite my obvious lossmail i was the last brave soldier to fall on his sword during that bout of spaceship fisticuffs the fit is legitimate although admittedly not optimal a bump in the road to be sureand yes i do most of my pvp on my minmatarcaldari altbut of course why would i fly my main on fleets seeing as its entirely skilled into armor and armor specifically gallente maintains such a terrible position in the grand scheme of things in the realm of fleet warfare my platforms seek to improve the lives of armor pilots everywhere by shining a light into the dull and sad place that armor currently resides alongside ccp and my fellow csm representativesso vote for me white tree as your csm candidate
you see hyperion is kinda like maelstrom except the guns are hybrids so thusly pretty awful every time your guns cycle you get less tank meanwhile maelstroms cap is untouched and all for the tank get neuted maelstrom still does full dps just has less tank hyperion on the otherhand gets neuted it gets completely shut down considering this fact going eanms and not magstabshardeners which cause increased cap usage is a smart ideamoreover discounting his pvp positions because he has minimal  of public killmails on 1 character vs actually arguing his positions is kinda lulz
i realize this isnt a totally serious attempt at candidacy nonetheless this is a common and incorrect perception that i feel ought to be correctedfaction warfare is ludicrously profitable
someone who gets it that being saidim willing to vote for kalrand but theres a 300 mill isk prevote security deposit hell get it back right after the electionplease send 300mill per vote up to 5 to this character thanksalso as i have pointed out in the past there is a severe lack of range on drone rigs and no drone implants at all just saying
i can assure you this is totally seriousi see youve never owned a tech moonin all seriousness buy some kalbonds if youre looking for me to be paying youi think drones have some more pressing fundamental problems than a lack of good rigs and implants
i support this product andor service
as i stated before in my answer about the level 5 missions and small corps in 00 these two points would be another example of a steps that a small to mid size corporation can take as a group as they move deeper into multiplayer pvp these are early points where their actions could have consequences on their area in the game but not be as severe as they would be in 00 space this would hopefully push people deeper into the political and pvp aspects of the game and would be too small for the current superblocks to care aboutthanks for the reply after an cursory readthru many points did not seem to be specifically viewed through an economic lens but i admit i just skimmed and will be going back through more carefully as for the section i quotedmay i infer that you beleive lowsec should be designed around preperaring for sov 00 if so do you think there should be redesigns of other space maybe nonsov 00 or highsecso that there is less overlap in design philosophy andor playstyle
despite being a goon ive seen kalrand troll market forums in which he contributes good ideas smacks new scams and is actually constructive with his criticism on ideas and debates in that thread from how and what you post in the market thread id say i support a vote for youyour thoughts on any redesign or change with moon mins is this for the everymanevery alliance or just the repositioning and supply of tech moonsyour ideas on small bands of players in 00 is this for those small bands being able to become renters or actually independently holding space
mike azariah not just another bitter old veteran rabid female pirate famous rich player or disgruntled third party software developer mike azariah is a player just like you he loses ships just like you vote mike azariah for csmi know i will
new batch of qaa i disagreei wouldnt say that i think most players are satisfied its already really complicated in pvp and i dont think it should be a priority right nowa no opinionwhy and why not if the only such thing is rd agents its not that big of a deala i agreea 5050 resource and time repartition should be great knowing that fixing old content can make a great expansion on its own like dominion could have beena no opinionbalancing items and ship is needed but i think monthly balances would be really annoying for everyone last faction ship balancing was rather good as is made lots of useless ships useful and some ships imbalanced sadlya i strongly disagreeim looking forward to incarna i think it should be an awesome expansion making every player want to step out of their pod but not forcing anyone to do so
i like your platform your running on peter i also agree with it good luck m8
the problems we face in eve are tedious and complex but the solutions are not the game is becoming a grind what was once fun has become uninteresting the player base wants something new i can provide the fresh ideas needed to revitalize empire low sec and most importantly 00 i am not going to promise you this that or the other there is a lot to fix this forum post is not the best place to lay it out and make empty promises however i can vow this i will put in the time and work needed to be an effective csm i have the experience needed to do well i have all my heart into this job and game this is for the soldiers workers and fleet commanders of eveif you have questions or want to discuss my candidacy further please feel free to join the in game channel entitled madcat for csm 6 the mailing list goes by the same name the channel eve mail and mailing list are places were you can ask questions throw ideas around and discuss different solutions i have for issues that you and i feel are important i have flown in most of the different kinds of roles capsuleers can fill i appreciate some more than others pvp and 00 pilots being my primary concern never the less all jobsroles have there place and must be taken care ofif you vote for madcat144 you will be putting a pilot in office who promises to work to get what players want what you need restore the things you once loved and bring in the new era of evemy kill boardvote match
comments questions concerns post here or visit the in game channel madcat for csm 6
my goals for csm6i make this list as some point that i would like to introduce to ccp some of this proposal is suggestion from my corp mates and mine im opened to hear yours and i would fight for it fix old feature content i would like to introduce an upgrade to the autopilot i suggest a warping distance to the gate as 5000 meters this would help to short the time to approach to the gate making it little more secure to pilot to jump i suggest a new feature to the fleets making it more fearless give the power to the boss of the fleet to be able of cloaking the ships 3 to 5 if each pilot has the skill of cloaking make as a choice if pilots want pvp in high sec meaning we can keep the security for other pilots that dont want to do it make the wh able to stay open for more time fix remote repping fix the ability for people to drop allaince if there pos if is reinforcedi want to hear from you let me know what else i can do for you
who are youhow long have you been playing evewhat corpalliance do you representhow do you propose to implement your fixes
so you admit then that your entire candidacy is an attempt to thwart goons and the nc and not because you feel you have anything to add to a discussion of the games future thats kind of shallow dont you think
how do you respond to claims in recent newspaper and tv coverage that your campaign is actually fueled by pure evil and should be feared by everyone seriously this guy is too weird to even be in real politics
indeedyou did not seem to care much about when bob had a majority influence on the dev team at all windy your ticket reads like an attempt to bring caod drama to the csm nothing more abusing nda rights how is that even gonna work the csm gets hint of an incoming drake nerf and decides to stock up on maelstroms come on
alt detected also i am spartacus
this is awesome ive got my own dedicated alt stalker i have cried many a tear since genera1 windyp0ps was biomassed and some dude has made the campaign video that i was planning to make anywaythanks forumkisses windy
reasonable rational agendagot my vote
believe me small gangs are more of a pain in the a than big ones
i give my support to killer2
tune into lost in eve at 2100 eve on march 12th for a debate featuring me and other candidates i look forward to answering your questions and hearing your comments
it seems to me that for almost any proposed change or fix there are people who disagree you state that you are very good at sorting out the good from the bad i wouldnt expect you to say different you however dont want to tell us what specifically you think are good or bad ideas although you do have a voting record people can search out you dont seem to offer that easily in this post you basically just say ccp is not interested in your ideas players but my views are very good and constructive  vote for meif candidates are not going to give any specifics of what their views or even general vision for eve is i cant see why we are doing this csm business at all how can i vote for someone who shares my views if they dont tell me what they areeveryone seems interested in talking about processes instead of substantive issues so let me ask a few questions on that it seems to me that this last csm was the first csm to actually get ccps attention for any stretch of time we have a dev blog asking players to post many fixes that they can work on we also have seen at least a few of the items in the backlog get addressed we have seen dev blogs about how much resources they are putting where and we have had devs even speak on podcasts about the direction of the game moreover we saw ccp back off of microtransactions to a certain extent this was accomplished despite the fact that before csm 5 took office ccp as a company had already assigned the majority of their devs to nonspaceship related tasks accordingly the fact that they accomplished more than all the prior csms is even more impressive this last csm was the first one to actually create a measurement of how responsive or unresponsive ccp is to the players would you agree that this last csm did the best job at capturing ccps attention if not which one wasit seems that this last csm was the first to actually do something more than go to iceland have a few beers with the devs shoot the shand come home they were the first to actually create a situation where ccp really needed to address csm concerns mittani suggested that formal meeting minutes might be replaced by less formal methods like having meetings take place via skype to me that sounds like he is going to return it to the prior do nothing csms do you agree with his proposal if you agree with him about dropping the minutes etc how are the players you are supposedly representing even to know what is going on if you do not agree with him would you be willing to take notes and post them after getting ccp approval of course so that the players can be kept informed on what you guys are doing
good luck

i have regretfully withdrawn from the election due to personal reasons
sorry to hear that mate hope its nothing serious
ccp please for the love of all that is holy throw us a bonemaybe you are not sure what to do with black ops but please throw us a bone and unnerf the scan resolution lock range hit points and give them t2 resistances no it is not the silver bullet to fix black ops but it is a step in the right direction it has been almost a year and a half please
supported
given that ammo switching takes 10 seconds having all those different range brackets doesnt really make sense if its not lasersnot sure if the op idea is the definite answer but personally i was thinking as well that the hybrid ammo should be split into 3 range brackets just like they did for projectilesmaybe some slight specializaton in terms of damage profile as well say a standard highdamage round with the current split a kinheavy type geared towards armor and improved tracking for less damage and a thermheavy type geared towards shield with the same tracking for damage deal as far as short range bracket goessupport definitely needs some exploring in that direction
wish they would give a reply let us know what that think good or bad
im trained for every race and gallente could use some help caldari hybrid ships too
supported
i bet half of the players here that have voted support doesnt even have a freaking clue how to use blasters to be effective with themthey just whine that blasters sucks because they cant get them to work after how they are using itim using a megathron often now so i know whats good and bad with itpretty much everything except for the range on blasters is fine with the megathron  t2 neutrons cant really say anything about how blasters are on a hyperion or dominix for example since i havent used those shipsi also use a vindicator and that ship is just freaking crazy lol 235k ehp and 16k dps  90 web i have an upcoming video infod video where im using a megathron alot so you will see that i will hit targets pretty hard inside 8 km but when targets are longer out than that my damage gets pretty lowbut thats how blasters works
i think that all of these suggestions are worthwhile and deserve inclusionespecially the contract api as it would potentially allow community development of a tool to prevent deadheading
this suggestion is supportedat the same time i would suggest checking the balance factor for these ships maybe it is the case already  a titan in full gank setup should have higher dps and much higher ehp than a gank sc titans should be the is all  end all line of ships that use other capital ships as support
tell that to the people who farm angel 210 static plexs there is a reason why the dram hull is so cheap by comparison to most of the other hulls
i was not aware of that considering the power of dramiel it should drop only from 810
pretty much i did run a local 210 out of sheer boredom and it dropped me a dramiel bpcso i farmed it for about a week and running this thing 25 times got me 7 dramiel bpcs and a truckload of various goodies like abs mwds and small shield boostersthe whole thing can be blitzed in less than 5 minutes in a frigate or destroyer
you are ed really dont fix the ship im flying i like easy killsanother thing the dramiel brings is relative safety there are just a few ships that can really screw your day and with dualprop  insane agilityspeed you have a good gtfo ability in other words you dont have to commit to a fightsee where im going
bumpy bumpy for a good idea
signedi agree with the previous poster about cosmos needing some love but also agree with the op that sometimes you just have to take the small victories making cosmos bpcs useful is easier than removing them from the game having them usable adds colourdepth and is a good thing having them ingame but impractical to build is a bad thingmary


thanks for all the positive support and ideas guys  and a big thanks to manalapan for adding this to your campaign manifesto lets keep the ball rolling keep sending this out to your corpalliance mates and get them to place their thumb up here
yes please d
yes please 
we need thisgreat idea
totally supported bookmark sharing should be made much easier
this problem also occurs under normal conditions as was stated a few posts back you can simply declare war on him and destroy the pos being in the hospital means that he cant defend it and if he has other people in his corp they can simply keep it fueled of coarse the corp mates can simply take the pos anyway and leave the corpcurrently the only reason that i see the high sec poss are still up is because war declarations are too costly by being able to simply claim the pos the corp will be able to recoup their losses thus prompting a clean up of high secif the reason that there are so many of them in the first place is that they were simple lost by the owner then the best solution is to put the towers on the assets screen alternatively make a second assets screen listing what you have floating in space
being dead in eve is no big deal  being dead in rl is a bit of a bummer so you find youself dead after some drunken spree ill advised stunt or inapropiate sex act  whats going to happen to your isk and stuff  i think a code word that will implement a in game will could be a way to gothanks for your time
drunk posting best posting ehwhen youre dead internet spaceships and pixels arent going to matter if the asset was personal it dies with you if it was a shared asset others have access to it alreadythere is also the practical side that ccp isnt in the business of monitoring the health status of its clients so they have no way of knowing if anyone is alive or not and no one is going to notify them there is also the issue of rl wills wills already exist so if your internet spaceships and pixels are so important do a rl will where in the case of your unexpected death others get access to your account details and can distribute your stuff to the person or persons of your choosing as you see you can already do this yourself there is no need to even try to mix ccp in to this catering to your insane whims is in no way ccps responsibility as it shouldnt be you can either talk to a relative about it or overpay some lawyer to handle it
i can do life insurance and a will for your pixel estate
if people are willing to to fly expensive stuff that can be ganked then whats the problemits almost impossible to destroy somebody enough that they cant fly t1 battlecruisers over and over again  makes killing them almost meaningless but with 500 mil a pop faction battlecruisers a few deaths and its all over they wont be able to bring it again without doing serious time farmingand as far as trampling the battleships goes battleships are already dead in the water  only useful for sniping and farming a properly fit drake or cane can kill most battleships as example my ac maelstrom recently got owned by a harbinger fight started at 5 km or so both ships scrambled and webbed top speeds were 6030 ms harbinger got to 20 armor relatively quickly but by that time it slowboated within 12 km for the maelstrom and with superior traverse of 30 ms made ac miss 100 even tho it couldnt break maels tank by itself 3 minutes later enough buddies showed up to finish the job pretty sadbs need serious revamp for small gang warfare
i think this would be totally badass
you start out with the standard and erroneous argument that isk  balance only to move onto bs balance which is entirely unrelated to topic  someones been drinking methinks there is nothing wrong with people trying to buy success but look at the factiontot1 power ratio where the hulls exist frigates that are near cruisers cruisers that are near bcs and bs that are heads and shoulders above tier3 bs  there is quite simply not room for faction bcs without making regular bcs as useless as most frigatescruisers already areps here is an isk tip get 59 buddies and spend an afternoon grinding the assault incursions nets you each enough to buy any subcapital in game for extra cash make sure the incursion is closed so you also get the lp  so stupidly easy and completely risk free with proper coordination
as long as no fbc outdrakes a drake im all for them
show me on the doll where the bad cloaky touched youthat said any smart cloaking pilot will try stay more than 10km away from any and all objects the reason behind this is that once within 10km it becomes quite easy to accidentally get caught within decloaking range 2000mno instead your new and improved mines will only serve to buff dragbubble gatecamps in 00 even with your restrictions ie limited to 5 mines per person are we well lets bring 10 people to lay down 50 mines etcnot supported
i have a better idea why dont ccp give you free kmsbuff me nerf you and add extra grid lag while at it not supported
like a helium heartshaped balloon good ideas always rise to the topplease support
had to reply to thisgreat answer ms einstein lol  you must be in for a nobel price in physicsas none of the stuff we are flying around in hasent been inventet yet i consider this purely hypotheticali suggest we keep this an ingame discussion and dont mix it with real life metricslets invent a hypothetical trans warp drive module we can fit on our nonexistant ships capable of direct warp to an hypothetical destination in a hypothetical space consisting of 110100000101110111010101 located on a harddisc in the uk 
had reply to this  buy yourself a jfwe already have this thechnology and for a reason its limited to capital ships because as stated in fiction part of the game you know the official science that runs the game its to big to fit into any other ship
i agree with jaik
ive read all the replies and i understand where a lot of people are coming from as far as the immersion factor goes and how this would foul all of that up i guess im just tired of being bored when i log on because nobodys willing to fight or a fleet so overpowers another that nothing happens i realize theres a lot more i could do on my part to sate my boredom as some suggested and i just might try to start something such as an arena channel obviously some people have very strong feelings about this game for all the trolls and wow haters that posted there seems to be no gap in maturity level between you and the average teenager who does play wow i appreciate all the people that were civil

you leave your logic out of this this is srs politic bsns

just so im clear youre saying that youre angry that ccp basically fix all the important stuff but they dont go back and make the small tweaks that really add finesse youre positioning yourself as the wh candidate right the only catastrophic game breaking wh problem that any of us can think of is the one that you were found out and nearly banned for you exploited it constantly for about a year without reporting it it was massive hugely imbalanced and it netted you billions upon billions of iskand now youre complaining that ccp dont make small tweaks to balance quite as much as youd like but instead focus on the game breaking things
um no that is not at all what i am saying i am saying that the small tweaks that really add finesse are actually really important there are plenty of examples of this including more clothing options for the new character creator balance fixes right after ships are introduced etc certainly ccp must fix major game breaking crashes after a patch but i am saying they also should spend a little time polishing stuff since it appears they arent able to do so before the release of a featurewell the fact that the only issue you can think of is the magnetar bonuses is pretty much proving my point if you lived in wormhole space or even talked to anyone that lived in a wormhole you would quickly get a list about a mile long of issues that come upand again i am not complaining about ccp spending time fixing game breaking issues i dont see how you can read that from what i wrote perhaps you might want to read what i wrote a little more closely
basically we are talking about this picture sw development process agile methodologies rely on constant customer feedback but in ccp case this rule is broken  csm is fine and dandy but it is not your average customer so the feature can be shipped it can be bug free but its not the feature customer wanted 
thread title is inaccurate it should read two step made billions by abusing an exploit do you
hi two step youre right when it comes to wh the only catastrophic game breaking problem i was aware of was the bug that you exploited for billions of isk embarassingly i dont know of any other catastrophic game breaking problems in wh space perhaps you can share some of this list about a mile long of issues
if youre looking for a csm that will represent your interest if youre a wh dweller dont vote for the aharm guy the interest he has got in mind are the aharm interests ie keeping all wh  as obscure as possible so he and his can benefit from ignorance as long as possible seleene is probably your man he was a dev when they coded all the wh stuff so hes probably to blame for half of it might be worth it to give him the chance to clean up his prior mistakesim a trebor supporter for the record feel free to contact me ingame if you wanna know why
your right there is no mention of that limitation but it is a good balance rule it should not be possible for a passive income source to earn you more than an active compareable one i am not complaining to much cos it is making me lots of isk but it causes me a few balance concerns and some inflation concers as well if isk becomes more available etc etc
what is your stance on adding missile turrets to ships its the only major weapon system still magically appearing from the center of the ship
from a functionality point of view it does not make much of a difference but from and asthetic and as a primary missile user i would live to see they missiles actually come from somewhere on my ship
you have my votes
i would just like to say you got my vote promive been soloing for about almost 3 years now and before that did small gangs and some fleet so i see where your coming from i love to solo and no matter the changes ccp got in store i will solo regardless if i lose a ship or notbut you got my vote btw when will voting startpeace and be safe
dude theres nothing wrong with my screens i have tried to look at the website with both exploder and ff both times i get a dark grey font on a black bg i might not be 18 yo anymore but i am pretty sure my eyes havent started decieving me too much for somebody claiming to be a web designer he sure missed the part about contrastnotsureifsrsjpg remains
just to let you know ive tested the page on 8 different screens including my tvlooks and reads fine but i will brighten it up a little bit if you promise youll calibrate your screen
you have my vote and my alts and as many as i can persuade
mittani i have a question do you think that csm should have a veto on somemostall of ccps actionsbuffsnerfsfeatures etcim not sure if this has been posted before but 10 pages is quite a bit to scan apoligies in advance to those who allready asked this or something similiar
i have a question for mittensassuming the vote fairy woke up in bed next to you one sunday morning and promised you a wish in return for not saying anything to her boyfriend who out of the announced candidates would comprise your ideal result csm1 the mittani as chair obviously2 vile rat3456789
obvious op is a knob is obvious
i support this labor unionunions makes the workers strong
anyone with the in their name is
what i can offer youthe raw ugly truth no pretty illusions no false promisesim going to quote you on thatthe biggest words i know are swear words i know something is developing in eve because im downloading a patchall i want is a simple warnings of new developments that may spoil my eve online gaming rituals or i will ragequit eve the other csms seem to be speculating future depelopments in eve as if it was their idea close as they may become and little as they effect the outcome i still find this an insultyour my only hope
youre
so long story shortccp pitch ideas to csm csm gives feedback ccp decides whether to listen or not and still does as it wantsto be honest i dont notice half the bugs people whine about im too busy enjoying making people explode or exploding myself do we need csm maybe maybe not i like 80 of other people probably wont even vote and will we notice anything that has come about from csm interaction probably not das long as im still able to lock and start shooting im happy
i too once thought the mittani was smug foul mouthed scamming got like most of eve believes the rest of goons to be why because i had never actually talkedheard him talk and had only read his smug posts on kugu after joining the cfc and listening to his last silver tongued state of te goonion speech i realized my impression was obviously wrong and that the impression i got from the rest of eve was wrong mayhaps dear reader you too have heard such rumors and two things to all the dudes hurf blurfing about jump bridges1 they are not 100 safe and can be camped effectively with as little as 5 ships a solid knowledge of game mechanics and patienceintel2 if jbs are removed from the gamenerfed to hell and back then titans will become the new jbs the need for more titans  more botting due to the astronomical cost of the ships so p much a vote for jb nerf is an indirect vote for botting
gonna vote for this guy his opening post and comments sounded more honest than most stuff i read
it doesnt matter if i think they should have a veto or not because they never will have a vetohalf of being a good politician is knowing how to pick your battles incarna for example has millions of dollars of realworld cash invested in it its going to happen period trying to stop it thinking your group of nine player reps can somehow get in the way of that amount of alreadysunk capital is a waste of effort you might be able to offer input and feedback to tweak it or improve it the actual rankings dont matter obviously i want the chair but if i wanted the chair over absolutely everything else i wouldnt votesplit the gsf bloc with vile rat so clearly having vr on the csm is more important to me than the chair slot itself the chair will be a helpful tool if i can get it though it shows a mandate and implies power even if the actual listed powers of the chair are minimal i want solid and capable people on the csm who arent sperglords with no understanding of politics the sort of person wholl try to stop incarna or drone on about trivial bull for hours isnt going to help anything seleene knows his  death and krutoj know their  white tree is solid i personally think that meissa owns having hung out with him at the 09 fanfest i think my platform annoys the  out of him but if youre a diehard  nullsec  the mittani kind of voter id point to meissa as a sensible intelligent nonnullsec voice i can communicate whatever isnt covered by the nda making sure that news from the csm actually gets read by the rest of eve will be a priority i am in truth a smug foulmouthed scamming got i just happen to have a silver tongue and a gift for politics
saturday evening bump
sadly every csm there are candidates who are there to help the eve community and do the work and there are other candidates that are there for the free iceland trip the power that comes from knowing what comes next and the epeeni have to admit theres a perverse part of me that wonders what will happen with the csm if all nine or eight out of the nine are the latter type itll be entertaining if nothing else couple of hours until i participate in the lost in eve csm6 debate should be fun
i think that the core of pi currently doesnt need to get changed maybe 10 seconds can be reduced to 5 although i would like to know why ccp made it 10 seconds in the first place to be absolutely sure reducing it to 5 wont break anythingi also think there is room for improvement on the interface part i have to agree that the routesinterface needs an overall change where the processes should be seen directly rather then having to check each individual routecurrently the storage facilities have the same storage capacity as the launchpads for double the cpu  powergrid usage if this structure could be given a nondelayed link to the launchpad and far more storage to match its cpu  powergrid use this would make it a lot better thank you for pointing out the issue on the where the customs offices cant be checked when outside station i think this could be fixed by linking the remote sensing skill to itin my opinion the current biggest issue is tech 2 production with old players having researched tech 2 bpos no new person is being given an equal chance to make money in this area i just did a price check on the onyx for example costs about 179mill to buy in jita and over 200mill to build if you have all the bpos for the tech 2 components even far over 210mill if you buy all the premade componentsconclusionseconomic needs a boost tech 2 production balanced and pi smoothedhighsec suicide gankers insurance removed and concord faster deployment time gankers change tactics so should concordpossibly mining barge  exhumer  industrial  transport ship toughnessincreasethis would not only restore balance in highsec it would possibly even mean some industrials going to try out lowsecin over 85 of the systems in eve combat is allowed yet why is highsec still target of everything i mean come on
i completely agree which is why im a big advocate of major changes like this being disclosed to the players before they are implemented so that playerexperts can debate them and point out issues for the devs to consideri believe that most serious eve players are willing to look past their shortterm interests and consider the longerterm health of the game but just as in real life nobody likes a solution  even a decent one  imposed on them without consultation the csm itself is a step in the right direction the interesting question is whether ccp is fearless enough to take another steppersonally i think its just good business to do so  it catches problems earlier and cheaper and it builds an even stronger more positive and engaged community  a community that will tend to keep on playing longer and pay for more accounts
well after reading a bit more trebor daehdoow has got my vote and my full support definitely seems like the best candidate by quite a wide margin
yes apparently i have not yet plumbed the depths of my own masochismin the prioritizations i have done i simply gave each voter 20 points to allocate as they saw fit if they chose more than 20 items each item got less than a point of credit if they chose less then their votes were stronger up to a maximum of 3 pointshowever this choice was entirely arbitrary and in fact is a tunable parameter of the software i wrote to count the votes so if you make a decent argument that different limits  or even none  would generate better results ill strongly consider giving it a tryone player suggestion that i will definitely be implementing in the next crowdsourcing i do assuming nudge nudge i get reelected will be the option to vote against items you dont like that can be implemented fairly trivially and without making the current voting process more complicated a big concern i want it to be as easy and quick as possible
without turning this into a fullscale debate how do you contrast your approach with the valid points the mittani makes by this i mean in terms of the function of the csm and its relationship with ccp not whether youre a ruthless manipulative bastardto be frank id planned all along to vote for you but i tend to agree with his philosophy that the csm primarily serves as a sounding board rather than as a set of extra game designers your response matters a lot to many of us caught in the same situation as me
you shouldnt be let anywhere near people that are involved in decision making youre the water to the cats
if you had an extra vote that couldnt be used on seleene who would it be and why
seleeneyour platform seems to be the one that resonates most with me i would however like to hear your thoughts on my microcosm of gameplay clandestine warfare specifically how should blackops battleships be iterated on your thoughts on afk cloaking and what you feel should be achievable goals for small stealth fleets
ive flown with draco before and read his stuff and hes got some quality ideas and clearly cares about the game hed make a solid addition to the csm
so you are implying that the current jb system is perfect and should never be changed since it makes logistics easyive lived in venal  curse as a member of smaller entities and we did not need those jbs i waspart of it during their fountain invasion when the alliance had no jbs up and we did finethe only ones arguing for keeping the current system seems to either belong to the great northern jb network or the drone region jb network since those jb networks are the main reasons these coalitions can maintain their size and flexibilityi wouldnt go as far as removing jb networks totally but upping the fuel consumption andor at least increasing their pgcpu cost significantly to make sure that they cannot be on a heavily defended deathstar another idea ive seen but dont really like is restricting them to alliance only it might reduce their impact on 00 but it blatantly favours bigger alliancesthe other huge downside with the current way 00 logistics work with jbs is that it links the entire universe to highsec tradehubs instead of 00 having its own market its all importexportso i will actually ask a question and that is how would you change jbs to make them less of a force projection tool and more logistical
this may come as a shock to you but the pgcpu cost of the jb is actually one of the favored ideas being kicked around on the goonfleet forums another is reducing the hp of certain pos mods so it would be easier to temporarily snap logistics chainsbut really any competent cloaky gang can destroy ships off of a jb pos you need look no further than the daily shenanigans off ec to prove that

i support manalapan neut rr needs to be fixed
first of all thanks for making your pitch interesting enough that i have now spent an hour reading through candidate discussions instead of playing the gameyou say you are running as an independent candidate let us assume you get elected what will this mean in case you are pressured by your alliance leadership to votelobby a certain waywhat will happen if you should get elected but your alliances main candidate is notedited to fix typos
my apologies for sparking your interest in the games wider community i will always push for what i thinkfeel is the best for the gamenaturally my alliance mates will have much closer lines of communication to discuss their views with me but because im not asking for the alliance vote that communication will only ever influence me as much as anybody elses
my comment had nothing to do with isk efficiency or kd ratios both of which are stupid and pointless metrics my point is that you simply have not pvpd enough to have any kind of informed opinion on any aspect of ship balancing unless you have one or more alts with considerably more experience read 12 orders of magnitude more kills obtained in a variety of contextsand putting three eanms on anything is stupid because of the way stacking penalties work
practically every change to eve changes either the supply or demand of something often this has resulted in unintended consequences that have been misshandled by ccp and the narrow interests of most csm delegates technetium npc goods stockpiles recyling pos modules large module loot drops the sooner these economic black swans get noticed the bettereve is a war game with a war economy

i have being playing eve for like 8 months and still going if i got elected i would approach other member from the council to make arrangement to design a final proposal once we got that on hands i would look for support of the eve community to finally introduce the proposal to ccp for negotiation and final approvals we need to keep in mind this take time and time to introduce the new fix into the system im very confident we can make it happen

this is either a fabulous troll or you really dont have a clue how the csm works which is it well i think im a fabulous troll i want to be open to anyone and no be a selfish i know the process is no the way i describe but in my opinion should be that way thinking as the players are the ones voting

honestly this is one of the most important things about k2s candidacy i think the previous csms have done a fantastic job of refocusing ccps priorities and ensuring that our voices are heardif killer2 is going to be a part of that legacy and a part of that process then i cant think of anyone else i could possibly vote for if hes about continuing the process of bettering the game for the players instead of bettering it for the arbitrary desires of some random devs then thats the direction i want to take
you got my support k2
i have played eve with killer2 for several years now he understands the various aspects of the game and supports the cleanup of previous features over new shiny stuff mansex proclivities appear to be at the minimum which is odd for rawr leadership but the other qualities lead me to want to lend my axe to his quest
good guy worth of support
this is a good point and deserves a solid answer ive tried to avoid giving specifics because in most cases my opinions are more nuanced than i believe x change should happen to feature y and dont lend themselves well to simple mission statements in the years that ive been playing this game ive experienced most of it from empire mission running and industry to 00 life as a renter a member of a huge alliance a moongoo magnate and a trader pretty much the only significant areas of the game that ive not spent a lot of time in are factional warfare and wormholesso how does that tie in to my opinions on stuff well it means that when im faced with a proposal im using direct experience of many different types of play im also using my experience as a community professional and a games designer to theorycraft the edge cases the unforeseen consequences that could be catastrophic if not addressed the specifics will of course depend on the type of proposal that is being put forwards but typically i will evaluate things from an economic a community and a gamevision point of viewin general i believe that eve should be true to itself and not compromise on the unique experience that it provides i believe that reward should always be relative to risk and i believe that balance should come from an array of equally valid choices and not from making the game into brown team vs green team vs blue team vs gold teamto answer your specific queriesi do agree that this csm has done a good job of capturing ccps attention partly that was due to the enormous outcry over the infamous 18 months statement and ccp needing to patch the perception that eve was going into a temporary maintenance mode a lot of that pressure came from within the csm as well as from the larger communityabout meetings ive brought this up before to the other csm reps without much success the normal csm meetings are held ingame using the regular ingame chat system its not a very good system because ingame chat in almost any game is a poor medium for back and forth debate i am of the opinion that a lot of the stuff that goes on at meetings especially early in the term or before a summit which is when the workload spikes hard could be handled out of game via a more appropriate method such as forum posts skype or whatever this would leave the meetings to summarise the discussion and record the votes a valid criticism of this approach is that the process of debating is just as important to the public as the final results are so there would have to be a way in which the preamble and initial rounds of debates were collated and released along with the actual meeting minutes for the sake of full transparencyon this subject its worth pointing out that the vast majority of the csms interaction with ccp happens outside of the regular meetings the discussions in the internal forums the iceland summits and email chains with ccp devs are all several orders of magnitude more constructive than any given ingame meeting while the ingame meetings are the most publicly visible part of what we do they really are the tip of the iceberg with regard to ccp
thank you for your responsesi tend to agree that forums would seem to be a better way to debate an issue than chat it would allow some more indepth discussion where everyone does not need to wait for each post moreover its often more important to know the reasons why someone votes a certain way than what the end vote is i understand that allot of the discussion of csm 5 happened on internal forums already its just that those internal forum posts are not made public mazz had proposed they be made public  i supported that proposal but never really followed it would you support that they or at least future forum posts be made public that way players could make a more informed vote on who really represents their views
there is a lot that happens within the csm that the larger community never sees some of that is to do with the nda most of it is because there isnt really an effective mechanism to release it discounting here the purely trivial administration stuff that would be of little interest to anybody anyway the internal forums are sealed under a strict nda and would require ccp to sanction any release this would have to be on a casebycase basis as theres a wide variety of stuff in there i believe that there should be a lot more transparency around the csm but the csm cannot do this itself it would require a policy change from ccp and a fairly fundamental change in the communications setup as wed need to identify before each discussion what would be nda restricted and what wouldntthere are other ways to increase transparency and thus the accountability of the csm however one of those ways is through the csm devblogs that have been published from time to time this is an avenue for the csm as a whole to give the community more insight into whats happening behind the scenes as well as a chance to talk about future plans or priorities other ways are even simpler attaching names to comments in the summit minutes for example currently they just say one csm said which doesnt help if you want to determine which csm member is fighting your corner
thanks for telling it might of broke when i edited something its fixed nowi added a update to the blog
quotethe purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player baseupon being elected the members of the csm are able to communicate closely with ccphello votervote for me if you play eve on a linux based osthe initiator of my csm candidacy was a eve forums thread in the linux section

could contain minigames like fishing in lord of the rings where the achievements are purely vanity related but require rare quest items to craft the best t3 tanks you could then invite others to your private quarters for some interactive role playing instead of a boring old private chat channelif they add other vanity stuff to incarna it might turn out to be just what eve needs to get all those wives and girlfriends out there playing
i personally have my main account an account with a market trader and a mission runner on it an account with a ceo alt for a highsec mining corporation and a couple more market alts and three other acounts full of highsec industry and planetary interaction alts i dont see how its sad its an effective use of my ingame money to pay for accounts full of characters that make me more ingame money whats sad for you is that it means my six votes for mittens will be worth more than your one vote for whomever
hmmm  do you still have that ridiculous number of accounts for your invention operation breaker

destroyers need to be beefed up the purpose of the destoyer is to destroy enemy frigates however enemy frigates time and time again down destroyers this ship class pretty much has only one use and thats suicide ganking miners during hulkageddon i feel that the ship should have additional bonuses to tracking on top of what it already has along with maybe damage bonuses as well a destoyer should be a firgates worst nightmare not the laughing stock that it surrently is

this proposal was passes unanimously by the csm and will be presented to ccp

posting to confirm the tier system is terriblebattleship tiers are mostly just fine but a large portion of cruisersfrigates are tiered into awfulness this is sad
as always i support this idea
i sort of agree but i think youre coming at it from the wrong anglethe problem that needs fixing is that a whole bunch of the available t1 ships are worthless garbage the fact that ccp decided to make some of them worthless garbage as some quirk of a tier system is rather beside the point and really theres a number of highertier ships that are worthless garbage as well i agree that basing varied material costs and skill requirements on the tier system is fairly pointless but tweaks to the actual attributes of each ship should be done on the basis of making that individual ship useful and balanced not as part of a drive to remove tieringhalf a thumbs up i guess
it goes hand in hand really the higher tier ships that people generally consider useless are really just suffering from a niche or complete lack of a role such as the maller the thing should be the cruiser harbinger
1 of course
lets give eve some new and improved ships to work with it should be fairly easy to implement given that there wont be any new ship modules to makejust tweaking existing code to make the ships on par with each other granted i know its not as easy as saying it but hopefully this is low hanging fruit and an easy win for all of eve and its diverse citizens
youre talking about a whole expansions worth of work here if it was an option between the t1 rebalance and despite the terminology that is exactly what youre talking about and practically everything else that could be done to improve the game id put the t1 rebalance on the bottom of the list sure it could be done and sure it might make the game a little more interesting for 15 minutes until people figure out the new fotm but the effortreward ratio is divide by zero this is not a thousand papercuts or size doesnt matter proposal its a no other expansion this cycle proposal and that sounds like an absolutely awful idea
they managed to redesign all the faction frigates and add new faction hulls all as a side note to an expansionalso note the rejuvenating effect the new scrams webs and speed balancing ie qr had on pvp that too was a side note to an expansionbesides if proposals are to be restricted by whatever may require effort from the devs then there would just be one thread here namely fix lagzor
if you think that the eve community would not welcome a large scale expansion that addresses the balance of all t1 ships most people fly t1 ships btw then youre being sillyi can almost guarantee you that if ccp overhauled all t1 ships tons of old players would come back to see what has been changed ive come back multiple times for expansions that have far less content than what is being suggested here
yes because an ad hoc rebalance of faction frigs made all of them used not just the dramiel and the speed nerf didnt cause all kinds of bugs and break the balance on dozens of other ships and 2 full races they are still fixing the unanticipated imbalances caused by the speed nerf and it was almost 2 years ago now the suggestion is to redesign every single t1 ship in the game essentially from scratch and make sure all the t2 t3 and faction ships with the limitless number of potential fittings stay in complete balance just because a suggestion is presented as simple does not make an idea simple and the ultimate results would be a simple change of the flavor of the monthi maintain that there is no significant gameplay reward to do an entire rebalance at this time especially considering the massive amount of resources needed to do the job well instead of halfassed also considering other aspects of inspace needs to be rebalanced balancing the ships first would mean once other more necessary balances are done the ship rebalancing would then be broken and all those developer resources completely wastedits not a bad idea longterm just not a good idea right now
most of the rebalance is native to dumping tiers further tweaking would be warranted or not on an individual hull basisim sure ccp is better than any of us at planning out what they are spending dev time on
anyone who is suggestion that a total revamp of t1 ships as simple is foolish this i can agree upon however rebalancing a large part of the game all at once has some key advantages even outside the overly simple explanation of making everything useful
support ships should be balanced on role not some arbitrary tier
any more notice for this maby a upcoming csm candidate might want to chip in
this makes sense optional rookie shipsi do like the dod notice it gives the game a real life feeling
i never understood why the one ship that is supposed to be tasked with moving an empires worth of goods had the crappiest tank around at the very least jump freighters should be able to fit defensive mods that said as a regular jump freighter pilot i cant express enough love to the dev that decided on the quick cap recharge time
i already find myself bringing agility improving items along for trips and i never understood the speed bonus on those ships with their slow speed its a percentage on a very low speed so it barely adds
agility bonus would be awesome
my personal opinion on this is both a buff and a nerf so i consider it a balanced approach i wouldnt consider an agility bonus to be beneficial in terms of game balancing hell i know its a great bonus for freighter pilots bt you have to consider youre practically turning something the size of a cityid say buff warp speed and reduce max velocity you can see this as a freighter autopilot nerf and tbh i think that should be encouraged
op want to make gate camping easier and to get even the ships with cov ops not supported
i dont mind the idea of mines but i would want to use some of the game mechanics of drones on thembasically have a max of 5 mines deployable at one time have the mines damage radius and damage potential tie in to drone bandwidth high drone bandwidth meaning you can deploy high damage mines so the mines potential is tied to the deploying ships potentialplus use the drone mechanic for having active mines and deactivated mines dependent on whether the ship that deployed them is on gridim still a little unsure on hunter seeker mines though maybe tie them into the same fof missile mechanic so you cannot pick its targets but seeks any uncloaked target within its activation radius those seekers should have a max flight time when seeking and should detonate after that flight time thats my thought on this topic 
dont shoot it down for that reason offer a balance idea to account for covert ops vessels
mines were never a good idea in evebut they could be viable if used on a larger scalerather than accounting for individual mines you setup a mine field of variable size and strength the server can calculate a broad average damage profile for the mine field as a single entity how much damage a given ship would take would be a field density vs sig radius issueexample ship with sig radius of 500 m enters a mine field 100 km cubed with with 1 million mines deployed that means there is a mine every 1000 m so the ship would take an average of 50 mine damage while it moves through the mine field none if stopped
given the large influx in the number of supercarriers present in eve and the introduction of fighter bombers alongside the dominion sov changes poss have become obsolete and need a reworkinga fleet of supers can pop a tcu in less than 10mins this fleet will be dropped on a pos with no support fleet for what reason supers are immune to all ewar can only be held down by hicdic and have enough dps to effectively declaw a pos long before a pos will kill a superso there is no fear of losing a super when dropping on a pos to quickly reinforce a tcuproposed changesposs have a 50 damage bonus from its guns to capital class shipsposs ewar modules affect supercarrier and titan class shipsposs warp disruptor and warp scrambler modules can tackle supercarrier and titan class shipspos modules including the tcu take 25 less damage from fighter bombersthese proposed changes have no effect on smaller alliance wishing to take sov and only makes larger alliances think twice before dropping a nonsupported cap fleet on a pos it will bring back the utility of poss to act as they were intendeda welldefended and survivable outpost from which to base operations from these changes will also help reduce the ability of large alliances to grind sov in a matter of 10mins total for a system
this sounds pretty reasonable none of the proposed changes make poses safe from scs but do make a sc pos bash nontrivialeven if this exact idea does not go through i definitely support returning super caps to their intended role that of killing other capitals

real permissions management in eveone of the things that has bugged me when i was a ceo was the outdated limited and confusing corp permissions system you had so few options and it was a 1 size fits all i could not configure 1 office or pos in one manner and a second one in another manner this made it very hard to allow a lot of the things my corp mates wanted to do due to the fact that vital corp activities relied on having certain security in place on some offices and poss and this ment that giving the rest of the corp access to the roles to make use of these themselves was not possible the the whole feel of it made the game feel so early 80s computer system not farfuture space fairing societyi want to measure the players support for a complete revision of the permissions and titles system in eve i am going to outline my solution and ask for feedback and improvements as i am sure that my solution is not perfectmy solution is the a slightly modified version of the rolegroupuser paradigm that has serverd so many good permissions systemsfirst off in this paradigm users  charactersfor the rest how i see it working is as follows when you create a new corp a number of basic permissions are created these will be the same as the current options and in our paradigm are analogous to roles these will be used as default settings if nothing is changed corps can also buy more permissions to make use of giving them a name and a description thus being fully customisablefrom there corporation objects get a task permission tabmenu where you can configure all the tasks that can be performed inon that corp object for example a corp office has the following tasks that can be performed per divisionhanger view take take containerso that is 21 different tasks in my system you would then be able to either let the office take the standard settings or you could customise the task permissions to allow each task to be done by any one permission the corporation has availablebut assigning permissions to individual characters is still a nightmare so this is where titlesin our paradigm this is the groups part come in you creae a set of permissions and assign it to a titlejust like we have today but with a much much better interface and then grant that title to characters they now have the ability to do what ever that titles permissions grant a corp would start with a number of titles and could buy morewith this kind of system i could put a pos and configure the tasks it provides to be all done by a single permission say directors for a high security pos or if i was working on something special i could buy some more permissions call them something appropriate deploy my new pos and then configure the tasks for that pos to use the new permissions this would create endless possibilites and much more freedom for corporations to configure their corporation assets in a more hightech future society mannernow you will note that in a couple of instances i have said buy more x permissions or titles and this is what i mean each corporation starts with a default set of permissions and a number of titles these are fixed and can not be renamed but can buy more and call them what they like but to stop the sprawl of corps just creating permissions with wanton and abandon the charge does not have to be much say 100000isk per permission  or title and then 10000isk per month concord maintenance fee but it needs to make the corp think about the cost for just creating new permissions andor titles with no thoughtcontinued 
continued you might also ask what does ccp gain from this one of the issues that we ran into with deploying any new corp capability was the need to create permissions round it this became very hard as the current permissions system is based on a bitmask number system which has a limit of 32 bits or 32 permissions that a corp can support actually there is 64 as there are 2 bitmask numbers for permissions but the second is essentially a duplicate of the first saying whether or not you can grant the permission fromthe first set to other people i know that during the time i worked at ccp we ran into this issue a couple if time and i am sure that it has come up since i leftwith incarna due to be released soon and with some of the corp functionality that was planned for this i just know that permissions limitations are going to raise their ugly head again and that we will get the same bitmask implementation with 2x 32bit intergers allow and grantthat has already so limited us much in options in evei would really like ccp to commit to excellence on this and build a decent permissions system that will support eve incarna and potentially wod in the way they deserve i know this is not as sexy a topic as buff blackops but i truely think that doing this correctly will have so much impact on other parts of the game once done for corps why not move it up to include alliance level tasks and even down to personal allowing me to set permissions on my pi command centres to allow my corp mates or just a group of friends to also run my pi lines the applications of this are endless and in my opinion will go a long way to further opening the sandbox to some truely innovative game play changesi would really like to hear peoples feedback and suggestions on this but also just general support is going to show me the appatite for this kind of change
not much left to add i dont have a problem with using failbook to vote but forcing a failbookonly vote seemed unfair as i dont intend to have an account there

wat
1 faction bc would be great
lol yhh hyper ehp pirate bcs wouldnt be cool at all it goes against most pirate factions fighting philosophies for a startwould love to see what a fast blood raider laser bc would be like 3 this idea 1 for fast fun pvp
not supported because it would raise the cost of entry again similar to how the dramiel and cynabal have changed frig and cruiser pvp currently bcs are one of the few things a low to moderate sp player can train for relatively quickly afford and be a fleet member in this might consign them back to ships of last resort if the difference is large enoughprice wont matter theres a lot of isk floating around among the high end
lol look at the sandy vjayjays sure but they better cost a bagillion isk so normal people arent using themu should try to be more bitter seriously ur not coming off as bitter vet enough so angry that people beneath you might fly nice ships that only you should be able to afford give me a jet black hurricane with 8 guns and make them cheap enough that ephemeron emoragequits
at the end of the day anything in this regards is being done by game designers and id better see them finally fixing command ships battlecruisers and 99 other issues instead of this whats the point in making eve even more fubar
your proposal would completely nerf cloaks out of the game
lol lets forget the fact that the whole orbiting mine is a terrible idea partly cause mines by sheer definition dont move and partly because your mines will blow each other up by orbiting and coming into proximity with each other if you want to decloak sum1 on a gate then guess what get off ur ass and get corpies in fast t1 frigs with mwds theres no excuse not being able to do that in fact i think a new character can do just that in less than a day
there is no solution where nothing is brokenyour suggestion would render the cov ops cloak obsolete besides you would nerf low sec as well i would neary die out not suggested
interesting choice of example the b52 entered usaf service in 1955 and is currently due to remain active for another couple of decades if youre asking that ccp introduce t1 frigate replacements during a patch some time around the year 2080 then i can go along with that since even if eve is still going well all most likely be dead before we ever see it
this would be interesting perhaps we can have it as a special electronics skill which can be learnedthe skill would allow you a small preheat at level 1 to all out overload at level 5
pos needs changed anchoring is overly complex and could be made simpler in 100 ways i really like this proposal and think it would bring some needed smoothness to the game a lot of the other things are being have been revamped and i think it is time pos is given a freshening up along these lines perhaps it could tie into the sansha incursions concord issues new standards for pos to counter sansha technology or something along those lines 1 for this would love to see it implementedzr
please i always hate it when people say remove tech ii bpo why  i own 1 ship bpo and the only reason i keep it is because of the history and because its an unique itemthere are plenty ways of making enough isk and yeah i know some bpos are good and some of them arent but please stop whining about removing them if i sell my bpo i can invest the money and making lots and lots more money then i do now alright 15b profit producing around 42 ships per 32 days  pos is nice but if i should invent i can produce around 30 tech ii cruisers per week with buying bpcso thats indeed losing moneywith some decent skills 20x invention of cruisers  pos per 6 days well lets say you get 10 prints with 20 decrypt thats 100x cruiser per 30 days 150m bpc costs 750m decryptor costtech ii make it your self for more profit thats 183 more with a me2 pe1 print then i doproduction cost 100x tech ii cruiser UFFFD 83b 150m bpc cost 750m decryptor costjita selling price around 110m  108bthats around 165b profit per 30 days  pos invention vs UFFFD 15b profit bpo  posi was now talking about curse ship so dont know exactly for other shipofcourse i maked some bad calculations and its load more work so ofcourse a bpo will always win and for that reason only they should make it more fair for inventers and something more difficult for t2 bpo holders dont make it to easybut please dont remove them look nice  gameforce

you still want rent slots and think 00 is the only playstyle worth to playif you are an empire player you might want to look for a candidates who do not see empire as a nursery for players to grow up before they come to 00and if you are a nullsec player who thinks nullsec needs a fresh start tired of all this rentingsupercap instadeath for everyone who is not a powerblocimbalanced moons resourcesfarming in overprotected boosted systems against any logical sensetotally frozen political map because of overprotection of key systems held by powerblocsand if you want 00 to look more like wild riskyeven more rich but mainly in deserted areas not in big protected hubsdynamic wars political map changes regularly because ressources change with time and make some region more appealingsov battle in a whole constellation simultaneous structures to hit in different systems less ehp on these structures so that conventional fleets matter and no more supercap onlineno more jump bridges but players can build genuine gates with jove techs and let their alliance name on it for eternitywhile i wont ever promise anything because i know i wont make it happen alone what i can assure you is a fresh look on 00 free from influences and only motivated to make the game even more appealing for everyoneyou might want to look at this
why do people keep thinking that 00 players look down on empire we like empire most of our altswhich represents the vast majority of our subscribed characterslive in empire we need empire we dont want to nerf empire the only people who want to nerf empire are the lowsec pirates who want more cheap kills i like that empire is a safe place for me to run missions do market shenanigans and otherwise make lots of money please get the idea that 00 players hate empire out of your head
ps please do not nerf level 4 missions as theyre a huge money faucet for me and i like that

well when we are already talking about afhafk cloakers then what do you think about afh unprobeable frigatesshipsi know it is possible to dscan them down and i have already dscaned gscs and unscanable ships down a few timesstill its the same issue as having the cloak run 2357 you just have the eccm running 2357 andor some lowslot items that improve your strengthmaybe those items should also be changed to drain a lot more capacitor because at this moment you can train a character that can use a frigate with eccm mods in less then 2 days and you can just have him sitting in a system for being there and disturbing operations of anyone
i have heard about unprobeable ships and in general the idea of unlocateable passive ships ships with no at the keyboard pilot break my perception of eve

looks pretty good to me
im liking your idea on lowsec exploration and miniprofessions in general i can find great immersion in exploration and it is something that is available to both solo and group play apocrypha already improved a lot for us explorers but as you pointed out there is still plenty of room to improveexploration is what initially got me to move into lowsec and i feel that it can become the big catalyst for many highsec bears to move there too should it be developed further highsec mission runners have this general idea that missions need to be ran in very expensive fit faction battleships so naturally they refuse to put that at risk by taking them into lowsec when small gangs of pirates can easily gank their pve fits however the second theyre able to fit a cov ops cloak they start feeling a lot safer if a recon ship was introduced with cov ops capabilities and bonuses to exploration related skills combined with increased rewards from lowsec sites im guessing this would get a lot of people to move therefurthermore it might encourage pvp between pveers i rarely run into anyone in lowsec when exploring outside of the small roaming gang and the odd pirate and most of those dont even have combat probes with them or wont bother scanning out a cloaky ship however if lowsec got more crowded with pve explorers you could get situations where two pveers might run into each other and would have to compete over a high value site for instance some guy scans out a site warps to it and finds another player there in an expensive ship with aggro from all the npcs if this person never pvpd before or piracy never even crossed his mind the idea of taking out the opposing player might become real interesting if the contents of the site were worth the risk of aggression and the decrease in sec statusoverall good idea id also like to know in more detail how you would adapt a t2t3 ship to be better suited for exploration
hi there whats your position with that  wild 00 
thanks for the feedback thus far im really quite happy to read that people are living the lowsec dream what is fundamentally wrong with lowsec is that there is very little added value for all the risk i dont want to diminish risk in lowsec or decrease reward in highsec but more outlets to make money in lowsec would be ideal i envision a small group getting frustrated with running missions in highsec and branching off to the lowsec gold rush there they can meet up with other likeminded people form bonds alternatively they could because bitter rivals take up contracts with local pirates and fight one another to the death ultimately it doesnt matter how they interact just that they do itas far as exactly how is concerned i think t3 subsystems provide a great opportunity to add new miniprofession classes new t3 subsystems can be added that can provide bonuses to gascloud mining and exploration since t3s can cloak itd be exactly what youre thinking would be great except without having to introduce a new ship
its a great idea and yet its been sitting idly for two years  it would appear as though some helpful cajoling is in order

mark and i get along like a house on fire both from time served together in the great wars with him against us in the first phase and with us in the second and we mesh well irl weve chilled at the eve vegas thing as well as the last fanfest and i expect well do the same this year if hes going to reyk in 17 days like i am
mark in light of all these douchy words would you care to commentalexander the high sec ignorant idiots may not be so easily pursuaded by your point of view never the less they do seem to be a power to be reckoned with what would you say to someone 2 months in the game
if youre a newbie pretty much no one besides eve university or test cares about the newbie experience in eve as much as goonswarm we recruit newbies into the game constantly from sa and the rifter has always been our main ship of the line well until we discovered maelstromsanything that is good for newbies is something im behind half of the trouble of running my alliance is often convincing new players that this buggy hideous game is actually fun and not hideous

hey youre before my time but thats an awesome gimmick well done
i thought long and hard about posting here as im sure to get attacked by goonswarm members seeing this as an attack on their leader but it needs to be saidmittans on shc someone posted a quote from a goonswarm internal thread by you communicating your feelings about one other particular csm candidate trebor daehdoow and i quote the relevant bittrebor is the csm5 member who was directly responsible for the crowd sourcing initiative here on these forums where players could prioritize the wishes from a list of csm issues that are on the ccp backlog the results of that  the low hanging fruit or easytofix parts of game issues  led to the formation of ccps socalled team bff fixing at a fast rate exactly many of those issuesi would honestly like to know what drives you and other goon members to badmouth him behind closed doors he has a proven track record on the csm of getting real work done that benefits all of usthe only conclusion i can come to is that you perceive him as a threat to some part of your ingame alliance i presume his support for the nerfing of jump bridges as was speculated about by othersi should also point out that your claim theyre lying to you seems to actually mean im lying to you you do openly admit to being mean and devious though so i suppose its us that would be the suckers if we were to believe that claimthat said i presume you will get into the csm regardless due to the goons bloc vote and i implore you to at least try not be so divisive so as to revert the csm back into the irrelevance it had a couple of years ago
i dont see any reason goons would flock to attack you for that postbut the answer to your question is simple we dont like that guy because hes not our guy the same way blocparty voters in real life blindly support their sides candidate people in eve blindly support their sides candidate and you know what that means that means that the other guys candidate is an idiot a bigot a pedophile and drowns kittens in his spare time politics is politics
id vote for that guy  kittens why did you choose vile rat as your running mate
vile rat has a proven record of diplomatic brilliance that has been honed over the course of the great war and he works for the state department hes savvy intelligent and pragmatic weve worked as a team for many years
as you can tell they also have a budding bromance going on
im quite confident youll be one of the ones willing to put in great effort if elected im really looking forward to listening to those debates btw
youll have my vote thumbsup
riptard you are a smart dedicated person who is the type of person the csm needs you have my vote
as much as i do like mittens run and the points he makes just think about itworst thing that could happen to the csm would be getting mittens and 5 copies of him elected next to worst thing would be mittens and 5 sycophants electedwhich is why im backing trebor and hoping hell get chairman as wellim guessing he as a returning csm is aware of the retraints his infinte power still holds im voting for a csm that has both mittens and trebor with trebor having as big a mandate as possible ie im voting trebor
magic 8ball says statement too cryptic try again
also mittens has asserted that hell get a seat on his goon votes alone so why waste a vote on something that is presumably a sure thing already i encourage you and everyone to invest your vote in a diverse and experienced csm by voting for trebor continuityeven if csm6 takes a very different approach to csm5is still very important in helping maintain the csms momentum that continuity is best served by reelecting people who were effective and publicly engaged during the previous term no one fits that description better than trebor
hear hearif my second vote is going to anyone but trebor something im still mulling over  i dont like just voting one guy but thats more of a personality disorder than something rational its not gonna be mittens but at least  by now im convinced that hes not gonna kill all the hard work you trebor teadaze and others did
so uh what can we expect exactlyif theyre working on any of this crowdsourcegame prioritization stuff theyre sure not doing you any favors by keeping whatever it is theyve decided to implement under wrapsdisclaimervoting for you on 1 of 2 accts
the idea that the csm primarily serves as a sounding board rather than a set of extra game designers is an example of a false proposition for several reasons first because the csm has never served as extra game designers but also because csm has many functions in addition to  and arguably more important than  acting as a sounding board which btw is not so much about discussing lowlevel issues like fix rockets and much more about big issues like microtransactions and bottingcsm is not just about providing feedback to ccp or communicating player concerns to the devs these are important but even more important is the csms role as a stakeholder asking the hard questions getting ccp to justify the allocation of their development resources and in the words of ccp hellmar calling bull on them when neededbut calling bull doesnt mean yelling or calling people idiots it means making sure ccps considered all the angles that they have good answers for those hard questions that they can provide good metrics to back up those answers and so on it can and should be done in a calm professional manner  nothing personal just business
can you elaborate more on this specifically what about the stakeholder position is unique to the csm and how the role is enforced stakeholders in general have power what is the csms powerhow you personally have used your role as stakeholder for the betterment of the game what hard questions have you asked ccp and when have you called bs on them
treb gets my one vote you get the other accounts votetrebor may not be mister pvp hotshot nor may he be mister nullsec alliance but he is the sole candidate running who really worked hard for all of us the last time round with visible results i disagree with him on the issue of rage and how it affects ccps actions but even without the rage the work he did was absolutely worth the vote he got from my last time round its sad that teadaze and myxnee arent running this time as they were both hard workers as well especially mynxee all she got for her trouble was endless badmouthing and insults by the more lunatic fringe of the game and she deserves a better legacy than that and the best way to do that imo is to vote for the serious and professional candidates no matter how boring they appear to you
trebor you have my 1400swait wrong movieyou have my vote
in addition to the items mentioned in the size doesnt matter devblog team bff is working on some extra items that they hope to deploy in the near futuretheyve told csm about the csmraised issues that they are planning on working on all muscow shoulds and coulds and all things that will make a lot of people happy but theyve also taken csms advice to underpromise and overdeliver perhaps a bit more to heart that wed like they dont want to say a word about them until they are ready to deploy  i guess you have to be careful what you wish foras with the other teams such as the ones working on incarna csm is encouraging team bff to communicate as much as possible to the players as soon as possible you can help speed this process by plying them with liquor at fanfest
one of the most passionate people ive ever had the pleasure of spending time with though eve online ive worked with mark for over 5 years and would name him amongst those who have both earned their place as well as those who show the most drivehis work experience along with his game experience puts him in a perfect position to ensure players needs and concerns are raised to the topvote saline
without a doubt one of the best guys for csm good luck soleene p
do want ooi want you to go back on the dev team now pas you talked about wspace i realized i didnt saw any words about what we wspace residents wants  there may have way less big fixes needed but theres still lots of things to do evn if they are already on csm list since a whileas an exdev what do you think about the dififculty of remaking the corp roles system as theres lots of issues for pos security and what about reform of bookmarks and the option to have corporation bookmarks and so on and on a bigger subject  the dead horse about pos themselves everyone agree that it would be very hard to do but what would be your opinion on what do to about pos 
i was not gonna vote this time round but you have my vote seleene so thats 2 votes for you
your background at ccp is invaluable seleene but i might have voted for you for the banner campaign alone as it is you get my second accounts vote
seleeneknowing the ins and outs of ccp makes you a key member of the communitymy request for you to get my vote is keep an open mind and make sure all parts of the community are represented from the small time mining corp to the power block alliances
both actually the biggest issue is lack of attainable goals sure but the lack of goals in general hurt the experience i fear you misunderstood the idea of goals doesnt mean mining and better rats it means strategic objectives that can be accomplished by small groups where the counter isnt more dudesare you asking if theres a point where id say the problem is fixed and things are working well just clarifying your question because metrics are going to be worthless in determining this either people are having fun and think the end game content is entertaining and achievable or they dont
screw goons but i will vote for vile rat cause he does play eve and does know what we want1
i am represented by the monkey and ccp is the poor captive goat

helloyour immersive and roleplay point of view may be invaluable in a csm it is a good thing for roleplay and thus story and fiction to be represented but it is extremly important for me to know some people can have an insight based on immersion and how we players feel in the game how we directly enjoy it by being part of a universe how to forget a little the microsoft excel in space bit at the benefit of immersiongood luck for your candidacy
krutoj knows his  he corrected me on english grammara vote for krutoj is a vote for a strong csmand to all those carping on about botters i will tell you the exact same thing i tell everyone who raises it  almost all of nullsec is infested with botters and trying to use it to smear krutojs campaign is pretty irrelevant since he personally takes a zero tolerance stance towards it in his corp and his alliance and his renters also im willing to bet hes done more to fight botting than anyone who is accusing him of profiting from it has sure botting happens in the drone regions but no more than any other region of space and it is no more tolerated its hard to watch every system you own when your coalition holds around 1000 of thempretty much this

my goodness the neutral remote reps have to be fixed it makes high sec wars unpleasant i like to pvp and this makes eve unfriendly to pvpers for this alone i would vote for you but the other issues are important too that makes voting for you the only choice not just the best choice
you have my vote for neutral rr cheat needs to be removed for good
thank you for your support neutral rr fix is the central point of my campaign as it is definitely an overpowered mechanic and hurts the war mechanic
neutral rr must go
manalapan in your tirade you mention you will assure the implementation of your ideas to better the eve universe you do not however mention exactly how you can guarantee on such a promise i for one would like to know more about how this is possible aside from that i support your ideas and will do my part to contribute to your election to the csm
i cant guarantee that i can make these a reality that would be very unrealistic of me ccp generally does what they want what i can guarantee is that i will make sure these ideas get voiced and that i will constantly push for the balance of all play styles in eve

hello kalrandim an insignificant player from a dead alliance murdered by goonswarm in the distant past how are you i mention that because i think its important to convey that the csm is more about the every player and not one particular player or play style im interested in your candidacy because i feel like youre one of few who understand all phases of the game for players from new player in empire to bitter retiree in empire and i wanted to make a few points perhaps some to your benefit but also to ask a few questionsfirstly i like the idea of a pos module that enables subsystem changes but i think this would be better implemented in a module that already exists its the sort of module that would make small gang t3 fights more flexible and encourage their loss er sorry risk vs reward i realize thats probably a semantic argument though  the point is that we both favor the optionsecond i find that i agree with salvage drones it reduces an unnecessary part of the cleanup routine that goes with missions and the like and it might even encourage covertops capsuleers to have a bit of fun tracking plex sites and eating up what goodies they find it would also be handy for small gangsthe sov systems of teh past and present favor alliance level politics if you had the option how would you affect change in this area would you enable corporatelevel sovereigntyyou suggest a t2 orca but what does a t2 orca look like jump drivehow would you make lowsec mining more rewarding without devaluing nullsec higher density midends than available highends in nullsec what do you find are the balance problems with level 5 missions im naive here ive never attempted them and i shy away from lowseci tend to think that the botting bit is a bit over scope yeah i disagree with botting in general but i just dont think that the csm is going to do more to fight them any harder than ccp isoverall i think youve got the everyman in mind with the general scope of your changes as far as i can tell there is literally no reason for anyone who exists in any of eves sec spaces not to seriously consider your simple proposals but im interested in learning about the specifics that youd bring forward
thank you all again for your support and questions keep them coming
considering all the support youve been getting in this thread im going to go ahead and assume all your ingame mails are coming from your mother to make you feel better at least since theyre digital its not as painfully obvious since theyre not all in her handwriting kudos to your mum for giving her son that fantasy of popularity even if youre 26 already
haha very good i can only assume that the people that have been mailing me are people who are interested in getting an answer rather that having to read through pointless trolling by some people on the forums you dont like me that is clear i dont mind you cant please everyone especially people who set out to be as dramatic and unfunny as you 
i dunno id check those mails extracarefully for giveaways like asides asking why you dont visit your mother more often it just seems odd that anyone not related to you would be interested in a candidate as unfocused and bumbling as yourself
i have flown with pirates mined with the queen of the carebears been in wars and sat in gatecamps i have raced in the deathrace in a freaking mining barge i have rescued the damsel so often i had my name tattooed on her butt for easier identification i have written for the tribune been a guest host on a podcast and interviewed for a previous csm electioni have a life and have a firm enough grasp of reality to know what is important and what is notthis is a game    i enjoy it a lotid like to help make it better but if i am not elected i will continue playing i dont have to be the chairman    i dont have to be part of a unified voice destined to cow ccp into submission like that is going to happen i want to help make it better by cooperatively finding solutions to problems the players ask us to set before the ccp i do not think i am a game dev i do not have solutions for every issue at my beck and call i have the will to help find them to say what is good and what is bad i don know how to call bull if the occasion arises and i expect it willi am a player of the game    just like you i am not a godling not a leader of an alliance i write a blog

well for the sake of striking conversation in this post ill let you guys hear an idea i have for pvp pilots every faction npc has their own specific set of named modules passive active tank mods guns and even mid slots all have a named faction variant i propose we give a bonus to ships who are fit with all of the same faction module for example a ship fit with a complete true sanshas tank gets a 5 bonus to its passive or active tank same idea applied to guns and mids a ship fit with the same true sanshas high and mid slots gets a 5 boost to that faction gun or modulei think this will provide some unpredictability on the battle field which is nice also it will increase the value of these current modules most of which value is negligible at the moment and do not serve much better purpose when compared to their t2 equivalent
you havent been paying attention much to this election race have you
to the goon race not really
im sure that statement makes you feel really smug and ill do you a favor anyway every major candidate who has any chance of winning has made it a point of acknowledging that trying to push specific ideas is a wasted effort no one is going to take you seriously if you are trying to present that as your campaign platform in addition to that glaring issue your character name is offensive to just about anyone whos been on the internet for any length of time people like to see realistic names or at least names that contain nothing but words aside from perhaps some sort of roleplaying gimmick focused on rogue drones or sanshas there is no reason to have numerals in your name other than a lack of creative thought people dont like people with a lack of creative thought on the internet people like to make fun of those guys ie you if you would like to make a serious bid for the csm then you would do well to first read the platforms of the other major candidates and then post something similarbut different enough to distinguish yourselfwith an alt that doesnt have a terrible nameon the other hand im sure if you post with xvxlegolasxvx youll get some votes from people with names like iisephirothii and drizzt dourden
i see you goons are good at poking fun at trivial things including my name when i started the trial of eve online i was not aware of its rich scifi role playing community and i did not create a name that suited it instead i chose the name that i had adopted many years ago when i was young and first started playing computer games i was an enormous mechwarrior fan hence the name madcat and the numbers after for obvious reasonsi have petitioned to ccp to change my name but this is not something thats donei am not worried about people making fun of me i am making a serious bid for csm i am not promising the sky to the masses i am not smearing my competitorsi know that my ideas and arguments are solid and i am confident that players can see right through some of my competitors vile intentionsi have read the other candidates platforms many still containing specific ideas i find them impressive ambitious and do also endorse some of thesecount on me capsuleers to make a difference in csm elect me a candidate who has dignity and strength and is not running for their own personal ambitions

this is singularly the most ed thread i have had the misfortune to read and people say mittens spurges hes got nothing on disgruntled flying monkeystop spewing s
thats why everyone not in these dictator coalitions should vote for the neutral antikartel csm ms pacman if ms pacman would get 10000 votes she will be able to appeal to ccp based on her total votes when its needed
no this thread is about your continued violation of the eula why do you refuse deny the accusations that you are circumventing a forum ban using alts
cheerslets see if this csm can get  done right
you got my vote
killer2 is our man you have my vote
k2 has my vote as well
i definately support this player he represents the mindset we need to represent us to ccp
1 from little old me as well killer2 is an excellent choice
yea umm pretty sure ccp said at last years fanfest linux was no longer really going to be cared about by them since not many people use it but best of luck getting some votes for csm off of just an os
least inspiring candidacy thread ever
c
but lets give you a honest chance why should anyone vote for youwhat do you think about the current state of the game in nullsec what should be done to fix ithow about lowsec any ideas on fixing thatif mittens is right and the whole trick to the whole csm thing is forcing ccp to listen to the csm what would you be adding there if we elected you
im with mr destroyer on this one renting is a nice winwin system if you can bear the stigma of being a renter it allows easy access to the moneymaking facilities that nullsec offer and a whole new game experience for a freshfromhisec bear and awesome passive income for the landowner if you want to do something about it make an alliance and invade instead of ingalso a is a word
what i like to see implemented is that renting space to others can in future only be done through rent slotsrenting through a rent slot can be done by a ceo or added rolethe advantage of this will be that ccp will get control over rent space and their money flows ccp can then also limit the number of systems andor corporations that an alliance can rent out to othersexamplefictional system qbatestsovereignty demo alliancesystem licenced to rentingcorpthat is also what i meant by termination of renterspace as it is today as the way systems are currently being rented has totally gotten out of controlany other way of renting out systems should be a violation of the eula once rent slots are being introducedalliances wont be able anymore to rent space to other alliances with the introduction of rent slots this in my perspective to make it harder to maintain coalitions between alliances

keep wishing hope is fine
nice ideasupported
lolwut so you want to make it even more like rock paper scissors than it already is sorrynot supported you take away the tier system and you ruin the diversity in the game then once the tier system is revamped you have to revamped the skills system to go along with it it will never happen tier system is here to stay
you know id prefer rockpaperscissors balance to rifterrifterrifter that we have in place at the moment i say this as someone who adores the rifter incidentally but it also shouldnt be the obvious choice for every bloody role except maybe scanningbalance based on roles will increase diversity not reduce it because you will be able to choose a ship to fit a role rather than just doing a few hours training and using the rifter for everything
you must be one of those who think one ship should do everything rather than using the correct ship for the purposewhat a foolishly ignorant statementthe skill system would need exactly zero changes related to removing tiernot your call to make
supported
making ships useful yes
yea nice one the purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccpyea me and my mates want more ship types i want faction destroyers we have discussed formation flying too this would be very useful nice one cheers
supported although not sure whether this should take priority over other more urgent stuff
while supporting this i realize that nothing will change in the space for the next 23 years shoes jackets sunglasses and sexy asses are way too important
frigates are fun people use t1 frigates from time to time no matter their sp t1 cruisers not so much honestly the only people who use t1 cruisers are people who havent yet trained bc or t2 cruisers most people blow through the t1 cruiser phase in less than a month as such in the grand scheme of things rebalancing ships that are rarely used isnt worth the time or effort right nowrebalance frigates t1 faction t2 yes battleship tiers make sense t2 cruisers could use a bit of rebalancing but not terribly important either right now
most people get to bses as fast as the skill system allows that doesnt mean that is the smart thing to dothe important thing is removing tiers the rebalance might not even need to happen no they dont but ill bite the bait anyway whynothing is terribly important right now but t2 are not part of this topic either way
bss are usually a bad idea most end up sticking with bcs which is the logical choice for players between 112 monthsfrom a skill perspective or from a construction cost perspectivea tier 1 bs  tier 2 bs  tier 3 bswhen it comes to tank damage output and versatility the higher the tier bs the more you get out of itsure i was just pointing out that rebalancing is needed throughout the game
then whats the point cost differences either dont matter or are actually a good thing gives rookies something to work for skill training differences dont matter changing those 2 parts of the tier system would affect absolutely nothing without a complete rebalance of all ships of every size every tech level and of every class plus all the weapon systems and every module intensive computer simulations would need to be run to calculate that no ships will have an advantage over the others and thus become the flavor of the month and make the rest obsolete and when youre done the state of a game where every single thing is balanced it will mean that there cannot be any way for any ship to gain an advantage over another which means every ship feels exactly like every other ship that is bad for gameplay and the reason i find vanilla shooters like halo boring and a complete waste of massive amounts of dev time to get the results you are looking forships will never be completely balanced and thats okay small balancing changes are made all the time if you have something specific propose it as a general everything should be fixed well no duh sherlock i hope the devs are smart enough to realize how poorly thought out this idea is and what a massive waste of time it would be to carry out
no the important thing is the rebalance part tiering on its own is not an issue at all
they go hand in hand i spose you cant have a tier system and have balance too
asap would be fine for me

i like these ideas very much in my opinion and maybe restating other ideas turn off all newbie ships for docking with a pod and not having a ship at current station by default and one of the followinghave a button or other ui interface ex in the aura help section that delivers one to your current station or seed every station with a newbie ship faction appropriate you buy them at like 1 isk andor have the option to sell them for 01 iskthe buy back needs to be very low to prevent abusewith with either option but definitely the market buy option you could also do away with the fittings and gratuity gift of tritanium would this also free up database keys as well

new caldari player here under two months i chose caldari for the guns missiles and shield tanking  but mostly the guns from long range aspect so when i was ready for cruisers i discovered in the forums how gimped rails are but decided to get a moa anyway i pve just to be different from my friends who went caraceldrake and because i still wanted to fly a gunshipbest fit was to forget range ie disappointingly chucking the play style i had in mind tank passively and fit duel 150s and fight in close well after a couple of weeks of trundling slowly to get to range and still hardly do any damage im at battlecruiser decision timei still want to fly a gunship but the pve nonblaster ferox is crap due to rails so this afternoon i researched cross training to gallente for brutix  megathron path since damage bonuses seem to be better than the caldari range bonus and i can utilize the hybrid and gunnery skills i already have but apparantly the gallente gunships are not much better even with the added drones and better bonusis it worth doing this should i just grin and bear flying a ferox  rokh and hope for a rail buff i have a couple of days to decide since i am waiting for cybernetics iv for implantsobviously i am supporting this and cant believe this thread is a year old and no buff when its better to ignore the ship bonus and fit lasers and projectiles to caldari gunships then surely there is something rotten with rails even if my experience in the moa didnt already affirm thiscount me as a disappointed new subscriber and if after another two months when my initial subscription ends and ccp shows no willingness to address a rather fundamental balance issue then i may have to move on probably wont  but wasting time making a wholesale switch to minmatar or amar for decent direct fire play would  me off enough to just chuck the whole game right then and therefix rails  railusing gunships please update decided to fly the drake while crosstraining to either minmatar or amar for a gunship battleship rails are dead to me now thanks for the recommendations
the megathron is the single gallente bs that works poorly but works with rails just because of its bonus and still you must fit one tracking computertracking script and add mfs wich means you have very good armor tanking skillsoc youll forget to ever use t2 ammo wich is complete crap and use faction ammo instead but dont expect to get some dps with them that could ever make you say wow forget it or youll need to third crosstrain for the vindi before you can see your rails spit something that looks like dps
most wars ive been in one side or the other just shut down a few hours in and the one war that ive been in that was not like that was the one where one six year old loki blew the crap out of our ten man t1 cruiserfrigate fleet with month old pilots in my experience at least youre wrongalso support for this idea nerf autopilot hauling boost active hauling
agreedeven a 1 agility would be better than the speed bonus its a freighternot a speed boat
i fly cov ops in nullsec every day i am not so much of a sissy as you to be worried about a few little mines taking me out and yes it would be useful for gate campsboth offensively and defensively hardly would make it easier since you have to sacrifice some of your regular dps in order to fit the mine launcher not everybody is going to have a mine launcher for that reason alone
the only way i can see of stopping the lay mines then go to high sec and get concorded when your mines go off problem would be to only keep the mines around as long as the ship that layed them was in the same system
does nobody read my posts timer to limit how long mines remain once laid and only allowed in nullsec or a concordable action
and how does that stop a ship from laying mines then flying into high sec before the timer runs outunless you make the timer so short its virtually useless for the intended purpose this is an issue you need to address
well i dont see an issue to address since actions taken in nullsec do not effect concord and its actions against you therefor if you lay a mine in nullsec and move to high sec and someone dies from your mine concord isnt going to give a crap no matter where you are and if you lay a mine in empire or lowsec then you get concorded pretty simple
and in an ideal eve that would be the case problem is the agression mechanics as they stand currently dont allow that to happen instead you get the situation i described above people getting concorded for actions which took place outside the system which was a major factor in mines being removed in the first place so unless you want to recode the entire agression system i think its something that needs to be addressedactually this has given me some ideas of my own regarding mines ill make a new thread rather than clog this one up any more
its enough trouble that in wormholes that people use secure containers tonnes of them around warp bubbles around a posso you get sucked in when you warp to 100 to the pos and get decloakedthis would allow people to put mines everywhere and warping to a pos you just scanned would be instadeathnot supported
yes i can see it nowas soon as you warp into system hundreds of pilots start planting mines around a single pos and you die because of it sorryeither you didnt read any of this post at all or you have no common sense at all
sorry but if either of you think that planting mines and them staying active when u  off somewhere else is a viable option then ur sadly mistakenthe only way mines are going to work is if theyre only active when the ship thats deployed them is on the same grid as them period
why they are working fine you havent a god given right to kill every ship that pass a gate if you are good and lucky you get a percentage of the cov ops vessels if not it is you that should adapt not all the game that should adapt to your playstile
i still dont understand what your problem is here any idiot in a cov ops with any skill at all would be able to easily avoid mines in space not only would they be seen on overview but in space as well since you literally have to be within bumping distance to set them off then the only way they would have any danger is if someone was lucky enough to place one exactly where the ship appeared on the other side of the gate even with 5 per ship and 20 ships its a pretty damned fair chance that it isnt going to happen that way if this were implemented i am sure ccp would set up something where the mine would randomly place 2k away from the placing ship kinda like probes do right now when you launch them so getting an exact precice bead on gate in locations will be extremely hard if not impossiblei will however concede a point to a previous reply in this thread make the mines despawn if the person who places them leaves the system or if the timer runs outwhichever is soonest this will elleviate any concern over killing someone in nullsec while in empire and getting concorded for such an action
supported with reservations and suggestions 1 any mines deployed by a pilot will selfdestruct when that pilot leaves the system for any reason or logs off this cures the leave them in losec concordoken in hisec problem with originals you want minefields you have to be there to tend them2 nulsecwspace only just like bombs and bubbles3 1 field per skill levelthe question is it a gunnery or missile skill can wait nine mines per field1 in center and 1 on each of 8 cube corners when laying fields the distance between mines in the field cube can be set from between 1km5km distance from each other4 all mines die 12 hours after deployment regardless5 mines can be targeted and killed but have extremely low sig radius making clearing them a timeconsuming chore6 when mines are targeted the owner of the field is notified7 mines do not affect cloaks for range decloak purposes but do sense a cloaked ship and will detonate for damage if in rangethis gives us more choices in the very slim destroyer hull offeringsminelayer  bonuses that allow fitting of minelayer moduleminesweeper  bonuses for targeting and destroying mines

for the record they do it in rl is not a valid reason for anything in this game dont argue soley on this point
agreed i will state or restate as the case may be these ideas 1 have an option to scooplaunch fromto the maintenancerepair bay allowing the ship to only gather the drones it needs to repair 2 the operation of the maintenancerepair bay requires an high slot item that takes things like mechanical parts and or robotics as fuel fuel is consumed per activation and repairs either a set amount of damage a cycle or simply repairs it all in a single activation slot residence is not set in stone but would offer the best for game balance imo 3 could even make a skill with it decreased cycle time andor fuel cost
considering that all rr only requires cap imo it would not make sense for rr in this case to require fuel however having a mod that uses cap to repair the drones while in the bay would make sense

i see no issue with this mining ships have drones and would be able to defend themselves however this would not completely git rid of boting as some bots drop drones after landing on grid or taking dmg nonetheless this would be a harmless addition to the game imo
i would play test this as a sovhub upgrade similar to cynojammers or capship construction upgrades and keep it on the systembysystem upgrade i would not limit it to midtohigh level sov holders thou
make it a black ops thing the ships are rarely used something like this would fit with the concept of black ops make it burn fuel make it a module that has a cool down between cycles make it only for black ops ships
omfg this the ability for the black ops ship to jam the local of the systemusing fuel of course it is in would be perfect for covert drops
theres not enough details to judge this ideawill the black ops be able to enter system without showing up in localif yes  then its useful for both attackers and defendersif no  its only useful for defendersif local jammer uses fuel what kind of length of duration are we talking about 12 minutes  useless15 minutes  only useful for specific combat operations such as to cloak mass fleet movements not useful for small scale operations1 hour or more  useful for general purpose pvp roaming gangs

anything that works with my short attention span and
encouraging microcredit with a loan contract systemrecently there has been some discussion of microloans in the market discussion forum in the real world microloans are typically very small loans without collateral given to impoverished entrepreneurs in the third world eve is similar to the real world in that the wealth held by veteran players can be many orders of magnitude greater than the poorest players this wealth divide often goes hand in hand with an experience divide a loan contract system would put wealthy experienced players in a position to lend money  and advice  to younger playersin the real world microloans depend on the social bonds within a community borrowers are part of a group of people who all know each other and have a common interest in each loan being paid back similar social bonds exist within eve but they are not as strong and typically exist only between players who have known each other for a long timeso i propose a game mechanic that would allow a player to lend money to another player with some assurance that repayment will be made there would still be risks to both lender and borrower but they would be manageable and when mitigated with careful social interaction could be small enough to write off here is how it would worksetting up the loan after speaking with a potential borrower the lender would go to the contracts page and fill out the following in a loan contract form borrower an individual player not a corporation loan amount capped at 500 million isk collateral  isk isk collateral is optional and would be capped at 90 of the loan amount collateral  items lender can require items as collateral borrower will be warned that the value of the required items could be greater than the loan amount finance charge a simple finance charge is added to the repayment cost this would be capped at 50 of the total loan amount loan term minimum 7 days maximum 60 days payment reminders the borrower would receive periodic payment reminders via evemail until repayment is completed upon default  garnish income lender can choose to garnish up to 50 of the borrowers income if default occurs  upon default  kill rights lender can choose to receive kill rights for the borrower upon default other rules acceptance  escrow when the borrower accepts the contract the collateral  items and isk  will be placed in escrow  repayment borrower can repay the loan gradually or in one lump sum he will go to the contract page find the contract under the in progress list and click a make payment button these isk will be added to the escrow until the contract is finished if a direct transfer of isk to a lender is attempted the system should warn the borrower to use the contract page instead repayment on time when the borrower makes the final payment the isk in escrow will transfer to the lender and any collateral items will transfer back to the borrower default garnishment and kill rights will begin if the borrower has not paid the entire amount by the end of the loan term garnishment will end when the loan is satisfied or after 60 days whichever comes first kill rights will expire when the kill occurs when the loan is satisfied or after 60 days whichever comes first default plus 60 days if the loan amount has not been repaid 60 days after default the contract will expire collateral and isk held in escrow will transfer to the lender and kill rights and garnishment will end number of borrower contracts a player can be the borrower on only one contract at a time number of lender contracts a player can be the lender on as many contracts as his contracting skill level allowscontinued in next post
continued from previous postother thoughts and ideaswhy create a game mechanic for something that already happens lending  both collateralized and uncollateralized  already occurs in eve but it there is usually a bond of trust underlying the transaction this system will allow newer players to get financing for the ships and items that they are ready to use as a veteran player i am amazed at how the perception of wealth changes over time i remember saving like crazy for my first t1 cruiser knowing that if i had the ship i could make back its value rather quickly now i can gain or loose that much isk in an instant and barely even blinkwould this harm the culture of eve by removing one of the incentives to join a corporation joining an active corporation is a great choice for many players but it still doesnt work for some this would allow solo players to receive one of the benefits of corp life but at a cost and a certain level of risk this would also benefit players who want to help out a new corp mate before a complete bond of trust has been created will this lead to added player interaction since lenders will be wary of scammers and risky borrowers they should consider hearing the borrowers business plan and giving some sage advice a wealthy player could market himself as a mentorlender for younger players both parties would benefit from the relationship as the borrower would gain valuable knowledge and the lender would have greater assurance that the loan will be repaiddoes this add anything else to the game this system would create a new occupation  lender  business advisor  loan default enforcer this system would also reinforce eves image as a dark and dangerous place as it could leave even the most carebear of highsec dwellers worrying that his loan officer will show up to destroy is shiny new hulkwhy allow items as collateral admittedly it is not vital to the system but even a young player may have a t1 blueprint or other items of value that he can part with for a while or he might want to put his mining barge in hock while he tries out some pvp action without having to deal with selling it and buying one back laterhow about cleaning out the borrowers wallet if he defaults garnishment would be of new income only similar to how corp taxes are collected designing the system so that the loan amount is deducted from the players wallet upon default is an option but is perhaps too robust this may create too much player frustration and lead to ragequitting can the borrower scam the lender yes he could move the isk to another character then biomass the character that took out the loan he could borrow money just before taking a planned hiatus from the game or he could default and then not make enough income to pay back the loan through garnishment as a result lenders will need to have some trust in the person they lend to or plan on a certain percent of unrecoverable loanscan the lender scam the borrower many of the rules are proposed to avoid lending scams but the lender could require collateral items that are greater than the value of the loan then somehow ensure that the contract is not paid back curiously this becomes more possible if he knows the borrower well perhaps a friendly fire incident could occur during a mission between corp mates  oops sorry about your new cnr good luck repaying the loancontinued in next post
continued from previous postbalancing points a number of the rules can be adjusted to balance the risk to the lender vs the risk or inconvenience to the borrower these include the caps on loan amount and finance charge the minimum and maximum collateral amounts the limit on number of open contracts and the loan and default duration limits we should look for a system that provides enough lender assurances to encourage lowcollateral loans but enough risk to encourage some social interaction between the two parties the system is balanced when the lender finds himself saying id give someone a lowcollateral loan but only if i got to know them a little what about apr loan points and other lending fees there is no need for apr or other complex financing math since this is a smaller short term loan a single finance charge is simple and easy to understand for the borrower of course the lender could make a verbal  and nonbinding  promise to give something back if the loan is repaid earlywhy a cap on the loan amount this ensures that the system primarily benefits individual players not corporations and alliances they will have to continue to conduct business in the trustanddistrust atmosphere of corporation lifehow about a minimum collateral amount if you want to help protect the borrower from himself you could add a 10 minimum isk collateral rule this would help ensure that he does not borrow substantially more money than he can pay backwhat if i want to be a full time lender a loan contracting skill could be introduced that allows a lender to have more than 21 loan contracts out at once this would further encourage micro lending as an occupationhasnt this been done or discussed before loan contracts were added with the revelations expansion and later removed but the system was intended more for loaning items and didnt have any real recourse in the event of a default ideas similar to this system have been discussed recently including microcredit credit systems a 3rd party loan market and islamic finance would this be hard to implement i suspect not most the mechanics involved already exist in the game contracts escrow taxation kill rights holding altered items in escrow such as researched blueprints and rigged ships could be problematicin summary a loan should be a mutually beneficial relationship between the lender and the borrower if this system is implemented correctly younger players will benefit socially as well as financially and veteran players could enjoy a new occupation putting their wealth and experience too good use polemarchus
unless you tie the loan to the actual account to effect all 3 toons  altsa loan will never workotherwise i will create an alt  borrow a couple million from you transfer the money to another alt and kill off the borrowing alti skimmed your whole post  too much to read sorry if this was already in your inital ideas
yeah i get a bit wordy sorry about thatand yes the idea is for there to be some level of risk to the lender to create some social interaction between the two parties
if when thinking about the consequences of your untimely death the thought of oh no what about my pretend internet spaceship assets enters your head then you really need to reassess your priorities
people do wills for dealing with their facebooksecond lifewow accounts nowadays youd be surprised its becoming a cultural norm now to have a will setup to deal with your internet accounts it can act as a power of attorney of sorts for those who it gives power to so that you dont have constantly update your will every time you update your password in eve online
would rather see more factions represented than more ships in each factionwhere are the playerusable eom ships for example i wants me a black shieldtanked punisher with a blaster bonus
i think this idea would work so long as the drones deactivate if the ship that launched them exits a certain range from them of course it would make people think twice before just jumping into system this could also be a way to help with finding cloaky campers but its still a far cry from fixing that problemi still like my idea of placed stationary mines though

aww u mad just because we evicted you from wspace doesnt mean you shouldnt vote for me i am interested in representing all wormhole space residentsuntrue i think it is important to separate my personal interests from those of the people i would represent this is what everyone expects of all csm members personally i believe aharm has made lots of information public about wormhole space in fact anyone who comes to our public channel aperturecom and asks a wormhole question gets an answerthat being said i like seleene and if i were not running he would probably be getting my votestell ya what windy as soon as you dial the crazy down from 11 to around 2 i will talk to you until then you should really go back to your crazy nc conspiracy theories and let the adults talk in the other room
that kind of childish retort albeit to a pretty childish post doesnt do anything to convince me of your suitability for the csm sadly you surely had to expect that kind of response to your candidacy and it seems you have no real interest in rebuilding the bridges your corp burned so effectively with many peopleif you were truly serious about representing the wspace community it would have helped no end to start repairing the relationships and discussing all the issues months ago with the major players were a minority group as it is and getting a candidate in would require a serious combined effort and no small amount of luck perhaps even sucking it up and admitting you have little credibility currently and throwing the weight of aharm behind a more neutral candidate could have worked better shrugit also doesnt look good that youre effectively still trying to spin the whole mag issue you refer to it as an exploit in your blog implying that you do not agree with this terminology you also continue to claim that it was never used in pvp before the rnk encounter this is simply not true and again does you no favours whats the deal with domania standing as well potentially splitting the vote seems counterproductive for all our interests
that was seriously shabby
oh come on hyperfly is mad because we evicted him from his space he isnt treating me with respect he has been smacking in local for 2 daysas for repairing bridges that have been burnt i have tried i along with several other corp members have been asking to be unbanned from your public channel so i can chat with you guys i certainly dont have any grudge with anyone in your corpim not sure just how much blame you are expecting me to take for not starting my campaign months ago i didnt decide i wanted to run until fairly recently if there had been a previously announced wormhole candidate that i respected i would not have run and would have worked hard to support them there wasnt so i ran i understand that many wspace folks may have some really hard feeling for aharm at this point but like i keep saying this is not aharm running for csm this is me i am not running on a nerf everyone but aharm platform i am doing my best to listen as much as i talk i have talked to a bunch of folks in your own corp who have expressed their support and given me some great feedbacki agree that i am somewhat inconsistent with the exploit term the reason is i think the best term for it is a bug it didnt require some special magic tricks to do anyone could have and several people did figure it out as for it not being used in pvp other than rk it wasnt if you have other evidence please let me know this is the first i am hearing of it and i dont like false accusations to be thrown arounddomania wanted to run as much as it would simplify things in corp aharm is not a dictatorship i like dom but i think i would do a better job which is why i am still in the race
oh well then go ahead and bring your grudges into the csm
no i will not be bringing grudges into csm i have no grudge with hyperfly he is the one that has an issue with me running for csm doesnt mean one has to sit there and accept insults and disrespect if people want to have their voice heard they shouldnt cry like and baby and throw poop around the room

cheers for those answers would like you to expand on one thing thouregarding corperation roles and poss and building currently pos roles allow full access to any corp job it would be nice if ccp would add more roles to allow segmenting of roles thus keeping corperations more secure we have 7 hangers to adjust for roles regularly but only one role which is deny or allow for building jobs its high time more were added to allow more diverse corperations with better controls instead of just make an alt corp
i concur sj i posted multiple suggestions to this recently and jon was nice enough to point out how old this section of eve is and it would be awesome to see it revamped in the next year or somy thoughts  replies so far
shamelessly crossposted from goonfleetcom and presented to you here as a courtesy by corps diplomatique because were looking out for you oreillybe careful what you wish for i mean if you live in empire and your biggest gripe with eve is that you cant download a ui mod to make your sparklekestrel flight stick match your minds eye hellokitty skin wrap then you probably dont care about anything that would be of import to the csm so the ui guy is a likely good vote if you live anywhere where your daytoday concerns are more than do i have time to make one or two sandwiches while i autopilot to jita then this guy is going to be literal kryptonite for you as a rep
these have already been posted from a chatlog while i was discovering the depth of his lunacy but i cleaned them up a bit for forumwhoring
people will see what they want to see and normally logical people with dismiss all evidence to contrary just to conform with everyone else while i dont agree with everything helens said he can be pretty witty and funny i am constantly amazed with how my views of trebor conflict with the majority of others im often disgusted with how much of a politician he can be  especially when he wont state his stance on something or writes something ambigious to deflect the topic because it could reflect badly on his image and his latent ability to twist reality into sensical lies a lot of the candidates are prone to similar this doesnt mean he cant be or wouldnt be useful on the csm there is always the paperwork and data entry or temper rages to get attention to an issue waiiittt a secccondddserious ip
i suspect hell succeed and win the chairmanship since he has the endorsement of last years chairwoman plus hell pick up the antinullsec vote
its almost like you guys are intentionally trying to push as many voters as possible his way
this can not happen
thanks for drawing attention to concrete failings because the one thing i have noticed while reading his reelect me thread is that he seems to be cherrypicking questions and avoiding anything where anyone calls him on his past commentsi dont think that makes for a decent representative  if you want someone who can hold ccps feet to the fire he or she needs to be able to stand up to the same level of scrutiny
conclusive proof the goons will only represent their own narrow interests to the detriment of eve overallvote against goons spamming localimage changed to link navigator
actually that would be the mittani who refuses to answer questions about his past and current statements did he call the current csm a crop of idiots did he post that it wasnt until recently that ccp actually claimed they would start listening to csm he claims that csm has no input on the development of the game well then whats the point but he says they need to come together to be powerfull does he think he will get a consensus on csm by calling all the other candidates liars i mean its not like he even needs to campaign plenty of good little goony lemmings will vote for him so why start out by calling all those on the csm with you liars and idiots is it his inflated self worth that allows him to blithely ignore common sensehe is ignoring these questions which were asked in his thread because they pretty much expose his buffoonery but whatever if the null sec alliance leaders get elected it will revert to the days when they used to control csm  ie csm wont matter anyway
what does this have to do with the efficacy of treborim voting for kalrand at this point but rage away i guess
the original post isi dont care who you vote for but if you are going to join in a goon thread attacking someone dont be surprised if someone points out the goon candidate is worse than their intended targetand in any event you failed to mention what specific questions trebor was supposedly dodging
are you serious heres a hint all the questions he has not answered are the questions he has not answered it isnt my job to keep on top of those  im not claiming that i am a suitable csm candidate i am noti guess what you are saying is that in a goon thread even if stuff makes sense i should expect people like you to contribute irrelevant and angry posts okay ill take that into consideration so now that im not surprised please explain how your post is relevant in any way other than that it gives you a chance to say i hate goons while presumably attempting to do damage control for treborhint it isnt
ive got no dog in this show and while prevent goons from spamming local isnt exactly a compelling reason to not vote for the guy the goons do bring up an interesting list of things that are concerningtrebor sounds like hed support something that sounds good without thinking it all the way through ccp does that by themselves enough hi technetium if theres one thing everyone agrees the csm is supposed to do its weed out the bad ideas or at least provide the dire warning that things will breakadd to that his penchant for deflection and i cant support him to be consistent or to do serious critical thinking on issues not sure who im going to vote for but it has to be someone with a clear head on their shoulders
the ankh effect
vote for trebor  keep csm relevantdont be fooled by the goon propaganda drones in lock step like courtroom and halfhead they will treat the csm like they treat all their interactions blow it up
those are seriously compelling evidences hes a complete idiottherefore i shall agree with the goons and vote for trebor  that would be the true goon waymy only regret was not joining the goons when i started my career alas it is too late now be assured however im a true goon at heart even when im not joined to the mother hive
vote trebor troll the goons
heroinahalfshell trebor is dodging questionscearain which onesah ok thank you for your contribution to this thread edit the forum didnt want me to post your name for some reason
not all 00 people want to see the mittani in a csm seat i think thats only reserved by those who miss some chromosomesthe fact alone that goons are trying to keep people from voting for trebor should be proof enough that the asylum inmates fear himas for the mittani i know blimps that hold less hot air than him he is so used to the sheep following his every command that he really thinks that wolves would follow him too
i would go look here if youre still having trouble finding those questions hes avoiding answering if you want me to tell you what to think then i would suggest you calm down and do some reading and make up your own mind like what i done did if you dont want me to tell you what to think then why would you believe anything i would tell you when you could source it yourselfsorry if that is kind of contentfree but you didnt really give the impression of someone who had come here to do anything other than whine about something that is tangential at best
how is being concerned about the character of trebor an automatic vote for the mittani there are other people running right you guys are insane
why do you need to jump on it asif your life depended on it to point out it isnt an automatic vote for the mittanito be clear i am a 00 residenti am part of the nci dont want to see goons in the csm and on a personal note which doesnt reflect my corporations stancei do actually not want to see goons anywhere but in jita
oh so now goons hate trebor and write bull about himim definitely going to vote for trebor
if there was ever a way to get more players to vote for trebor i havent heard of it some random goon above wrote be careful what you wish for indeed
dont bother m8 not going to vote for you anyways just wondering what you had to say csm related after trying several putersbrowsers i just gave up not worth the effortstrain on my eyeswhy should i have to calibrate my screens when you are the one that missed the section about contrast i still believe using a dark grey font on a black bg is somewhat morronicfree bump
i agree with what you say except the one about nodelayed local since i am in low sec i guess i dont mind if you change null secbut it seems to me that this will just be a mechanic to help people bait and blob seeing local spike after an attack is often what allows small gangs and solo pvpers an opportunity to try to gtfo before the blob comes i would also point out that according to the last qen wormholes get very little pvp that is the case regardless of whether you look at it per system or per player in them it appears few people want to spend time scanning systems only to find out there is likely no one therebut like i said if null sec loses local i would just expect low sec to get allot more people who are looking for small scale pvp i dont mind that btw i hope this doesnt sound overly negative about your campaign because i am not i agree with all the other things you mention and i definitely agree with your overall approach to how to look at proposals i definitely hope you get in
try sitting with an agressed guardian next to a sentry gun for 60 seconds without receiving any rr and see how much of that ship remains once the agression timer has cleared as per your fantastic suggestion
im not sure he is saying they would get sentry gun or concord fire he is saying they wouldnt be able to dock or jump maybe i missed it
if elected what will you do about the horde of bad posters that currently reside in pandemic legion
this is exactly right agression as it comes to dockingjumpingchanging sessions in general im not out to make lowsec pirating more difficult by any means currently if a logistics reps a 10 pilot who isnt aggrod the logsitics pilot turns gcc  this is a silly mechanic they should be flagged and able to be shot like the 10 character but gatestation guns shouldnt shoot them until the pirate actually goes gcc i am pro lowsec after allwith regard to a delayed local i did intend for it to be implemented in 00 only  as 00 will be the only place where it can be mitigated with upgrades the point of it is not to be able to gank people willynilly but to make upgraded space more valuableill mirror their forums and make all posts pub oh wait
one might say even that vile rat is a real dragon in the sack
that might well be so but it doesnt explain the need to single out trebor and it doesnt explain why trebor was identified as the most dangerous member of csm5 which lies in the past most dangerous member for what reason im sure goons will vote for who they are asked to anyway so why the drama
trebor is one of the few real competitors for the csm chairman mao post thats why
youre so angry that anyone would dismiss trebors ideas that not only did you ragepost about the topic elsewhere you popped over here too soodds are good that the empire bloc will unite around this guy and hell end up with the chair no doubt id end up crying impotent tears of rage over the loss
a vote for trebor is literally a vote for someone who is worse at eve than ccp developers
those trebor links are pretty scary to read titan pinball dd weapon yikes
i guess thread linking of ideas is in so i will leave this here
im sure thatll make the elite pvp vote which isnt going to vote for me anyway furious
you have my vote and im an elite pvper smugim so cloaky i dont even show up on killboards
combat simulator and userbase moddable ui damn for that i can almost forgive he is a lawyer irl and vote for him
thats funny a goon with a heart yea right hes the ceo of one of the main groups targeting noobs in the game promising null sec rats and good fun all just to rob you lulz and take all your items you want to have moved down  i dont support this type of player for our best interest and if i was you i wouldnt ether beside most of his support you see r his own alliance
you bring some interesting ideas however my votes are instead going to someone elsenot trebor hes just as toxic to my style of play as you are
not one of the links was a proposal by trebor interestingly enough trebor allows the players to make the proposals and then he works to get ccp to implement the players proposals that whole assembly hall forum you know has the mittani ever even visited itits very interesting that the only csm member that ever tried to measure how much players want certain proposals is singled out for ridicule by the mittani of course the mittanis campaign depends on players being idiots so anyone who actually promotes what players want must also be an idiot
if i had to base my estimate of the eve communitys intelligence off of what i saw in assembly hall and features and idea discussion id think most eve players were idiots too
it speaks volumes as to what a candidate will or will not support popular acclaim alone doesnt make for a good idea and if you lend your support to an idea that isnt even popularly supported it just illustrates your personal bias even morerandom guy posting in the assembly hall can toss out dumb ideas without much concern that ccp will take them up a csm rep on the other hand is elected to actually consider and think about the ideas heshe will pitch to ccp i sure as hell dont want someone that will support plastic wrap for everything and ruin courier contracts because it sounded cool at first glancesay what you will about the mittani and goons in general at least they think their ideas through i may not like them on a personal level but they probably wont wreck the game
waiti think youre not addressing the logical conclusion of democracybread and circuses for everybody a new shiny tengu in every hangar and dont stop until every player in eve has an above average positive isk flowalso you do have a lot to overcome with that lawyer gig but it does explain a lot of previous things ive seen about the mittanidont know who ill vote for but if you give me kickbacks earmarks and pork
i notice that a good few of those comments and links are just attacks on him as a person aka trolling what a surprise but ill bite on the rest if youd ever just once actually bothered to have a discussion with him on any of those topics presenting him with arguments as to why theyre bad ideas do you think he would have listened perhaps like he did when he did the crowd sourcing initiativeyoure well known for trolling and long lasting personal campaigns against your enemies in null and you carry on that same tendency here and here comes the important part without presenting any coherent platform of your own apart from a vague promise that youll somehow be more effective than csm5 was presumably by using the same tactics that youre using against trebor as trebor is almost going to be on the same csm as you the only result of that will be a completely ineffectual csm riven by internal rivalries and infighting worse than the drivel that miss no caps or punctuation mazzilu came up during csm5 unless of course that is exactly what youre aiming for
monday bump
thanks for the replybit less csmdefensive stance than i would have expected refreshing one main reason i even ask this is because simply put if csm does have any impact at all it does not really get out to the publicwe see your guys writeups we see in devblogs where ccp mention discussions with csm but frankly that could mean anything or nothing we just see you guys have meetings and no real impact and a personal pet peeve is how on numerous occations csm delegates been stating they cannot talk on this matter due to the nda isnt it quite odd given the transparency that you even have to sign that ccp could just avoid feeding you information you cannot share problem solvedeither way i appreciate your writeup its just hard to feel csm is worth anything we could use more insightyeah i agree both on the wh more connections and instalocking hic camps my main is 10 and i like lowsec as a whole tbh and generally i feel that not much is needed but we could really use less chokepoints more traffic and the ridicilously lowsec specific lag sec updates but heh if thats a deterrent for 00 alliances to show up im all for it we need less nullsec alliances and more carebears in lowsec just wanted to see your point first before i post mineim still guttered about csm but i do appreciate that csm5 has been pushing for what seems to be more response from ccp yours and seleenes focuses is inline with my rough opinions tooso on the subject on that what do you think of afkcloaking another pet peeve of mine
i agree its an annoying mechanic and a number of solutions has been proposed such as adding fuel usage disabling directional scanner while cloaked making the current penalties more severetbh im okay with any of those as long as ccp game design thinks its appropriate and qa tests it thoroughly and covops cloaks stay p good
thanks for your support if you have any questions for me throw them out there the debates went really well ive written a long blog post about it for those that are interested
having flown with you now in a couple of corporations ive been quite impressed with your knowledge of the game enthusiasm and dedication to doing a great job in whatever you choose to do more importantly your blog is a good read while im bored at work good luck in your runyoull have my votes
we must vote for trebor in the numbers that will get him the chairmanship it looks like at the moment that at least three or four of the 00 crowd will get seats on the csm we all know that they are out for themselves and not the eve community in order to make next year just a lost year and not revert us to the csm of three or four years ago we need his leadership
that comment is like saying carebears are against pvp well someone has to blow up the ships that carebears build or mine for nullsec players are very aware of empire and how it impacts their gameplay
all that tritanium has to come from somewhereseriously though thats about all that comes out of highsec that and whiningps trebor has bad ideas and should not be reelected unduhpants
i like how this csm candidate ignores anything that he doesnt have an easy answer forgood politics
you sound like an idiot who doesnt realize theyre an idiotquick what are the oil of olay seven signs of aging
and sadly it looks like not very many people are noticing strip away all the rhetoric and hes just a guy who doesnt understand how nullsec works and is asking ccp to break the game for the people who do
stakeholders are roughly speaking the customers of the development team an example of another stakeholder at ccp would be the marketing departmenteach stakeholder group submits requests for things to be done in csms case this is a prioritized version of our back provides feedback and other input and holds the product manager accountable for the resultsindividual csms are not stakeholders the csm as a group is as for examples of csm 5 calling bull which does not involve raising ones voice btw the most recent public one that most eve players have heard about was regarding microtransactions where csm very forcefully represented that nonvanity mt items would have significant negative consequences and ccp has adopted csms position at least for nowcsm as a stakeholder operates under certain handicaps were not onsite except during the summit meetings and our input into the development planning meetings is provided through our representatives ccp xhagen and ccp diagoras also csm 5 is the first csm to have stakeholder status and just like eve the game of stakeholder offline has a bit of a learning cliff so the role of the csm is continually evolvingbefore the end of our term csm 5 will produce at ccps request a continuity document which will describe csm 5s best practices in the hopes of helping csm 6 get off to a running start  especially with respect to its expanded responsibilities as a stakeholder
look at all these goons and their alts running in here trying to sling mud maybe you need to check out mittanis statement saying he wants instant pvp in eve just like battlegrounds in wow and then come back here and talk about stupid ideas
stakeholders are customers how does this make ccp accountable to them in what way is ccp accountable what happens when ccp just does what it wants anyways
actually he said he wanted an option of instanced pvp not that he wanted all pvp to be instanced
what i am looking at is this candidate being unable to answer a whole bunch of questionsif hes going to cherrypick where he responds at this stage what do you think hes going to be like when hes screwed the pooch i have no problem with people trying to be important in online games  what i have a problem with is his apparent misunderstanding of pretty much everything that needs fixing with this game yeah great so you want competition so everyone has different ideas in this case the game needs a strong and focussed csm in order to get the changes made or this game is going to hell in a handbasketif you seriously want another ineffective uninformed bootlicking csm delegation then vote for the guy who wants tocompletely break contracts let bots live outside of concord protected areas
its funny how insecure the goons are due to this candidatefact is that you want a chairman who is balancedfact is that you want a chairman who listens to other peoples opinionsfact is that you want a chairman who loves the game because of the gamefact is that you want someone whos actually intrested in overall improvementi have been watching the csm closely for quit a while and trebor is a person who brings those qualities to the boardhe receives high praises by other csm members be it 00 csm members or none 00 csm membersthis player doesnt claim to be the ephiphany of deviancy who will will change the world because hes soo smoothhe claims to listen to your concerns and ideas and together with the rest of the csm forge those concerns and ideas into packages to be taken up with ccpand instead of fighting ccp to show how l33t he is he suggests to actually work together towards improvementthese are the strongpoints we want in chair
the argument above this post just confirmed from me why i wont be voting for trebor arrogant confrontational and wrong is not a great combination hes essentially the sarah palin of the csm election
you mean like thisfrom those linksif i could buy votes i am sure i would get praise toohis claims and suggestions dont match his actions or arguments please dont break this game
ah i see the smearing has begun again
i think you may have skipped over the preface to that argument which ill reproduce herei want to preface this by saying that since i dont have any knowledge of the internals of eve this is based on guesswork i do not claim this is the way to deal with lag only that i think its an interesting starting point for discussion about the kinds of changes that might tame lag  see im waffling just like a real politicianin my csm 5 manifesto from which that posting was taken i was trying to make the point that no matter what ccp does to make the servers more efficient the current game mechanics encourage fleets to expand to fit the lag availablei was just illustrating one possible way of changing the fleet sizefleet power curve so that after a certain fleet size the power curve starts to level off which would tend to put an organic softcap on fleet sizes because wise commanders would find better uses for their manpower than putting them all in a big blobi make no claims that is the only solution or the best solution  it was simply an illustration offered to spark discussionone thing that i think its important to understand about me is that as a skeptic im always willing to change my mind when presented with sufficient evidence for example during the june csm summit i had a wonderful dinnertime discussion with stephan meissa about blob reduction he disagreed with me about the fogofwar idea and made a good argument for multiple simultaneous objectives in sov warfare as a way to encourage blobsplitting and reduce this discussion significantly influenced my personal opinions on the matterhowever my personal opinions are just that  my personal opinions while i am happy to inflict them on anyone foolish enough to ask i try very hard not to impose them on anyonebeing a csm delegate is not about trying to get ccp to do things your way its about trying to get ccp to allocate their limited resources in ways that maximize benefits for the players thats what stuff like the prioritization crowdsourcing was all about  members of the community who cared enough to get involved contributed their opinions about prioritization of backlogged csm items which helped inform the prioritizations that the csm submitted to ccp in many cases individual delegates personal pet issues did not end up getting the ranking they expected but as they say the good of the many outweighs the good of the few or the one
i guess that is why you called someone a troll instead of addressing their points regardless of personal history you should be able to put this behind yourself if youre going to be an effective representative what happens if the playerbase supports something you yourself disagree with are we all trollsobviously this is hyperbole but i imagine youd just lie and hide behind the nda sorryif youre waffling then youre waffling and trying to deflect from this by making it into a cute joke doesnt mean that you are doing it any lesshaha im picking holes in your campaign just like a person who really cares about the direction this game is goinge something else that doesnt ring true  you say knowledge of the game mechanics isnt important which is untrue but does help to excuse the fact that everything i have seen you post that isnt a simple generalization is inaccurate at best so why then do you place such emphasis on it in your campaign statement and website which do you really believe or do you assume that voters are essentially dumb and will be dazzled by your qualifications
in an effort to gauge your sense of selfimportance could you explain why you believe your page on wikipedia should not be deleted
lol i can only assume that the rest of the goon candidates are afraid of trebors track record if they have to sink this low
i am afraid of his track record because he is not a good candidate and that is what most concerns me when evaluating csm candidates maybe the rest of the goon candidates are concerned about this tooi get that there is this idea that goons want to rig the election 1 that isnt really possible one vote per account seems like a fair situation to me and 2 even if you hate the guys the evil scamming bastards you cant really argue against the points they have raised or can you i mean you could post about that instead of just contributing white noise
the csm does not need a chairman who will rally the other delegates to storm castle reykjavik pitchforks and torches in hand it needs good hardworking people who are willing to do all the boring work needed to convince ccp to allocate resources in ways that will best benefit the players that and only that will maintain the momentum built up by csm 5the chairman of the csm has no special powers or influence other than that which is granted by the other members of the councilmynxee was a great csm chair not because of her leadership skills which she has but because of her organizational skills she didnt tell people what to do she just made sure everyone was aware of what needed to be done kept track of everything and made it as easy as possible for people to step up and get stuff donewhoever becomes the next chairman it will be a tough act to follow
i cant really speak to that except from a design angle and acknowledge that revamping that system has been something the designers have wanted to do for a long long time the issue is more about getting it moved up in the backlog and finding a way to have such improvements slotted into a released feature that way there would actually be programming time and qa assigned to achieve thisid like to see the current starbases be relegated to a purely military role and actual personal owned structures be introduced modular addons white picket fences all that jazz of course pos code makes the coders eyes bleed and then there would have to be art done for it all the in house term used for this as it has been discussed in the past and talked about at fanfest were shanty towns that players could build in space tldr  i want to see modular player structures like legos in space hell yeahblack ops need love so bad that its criminal these ships should be doing amazing james bond stuff that no other ships can do at the very least they need a serious lookat because i see them bridging stealth bombers to targets more often than actually doing anything themselves the afk cloaking thing is annoying as hell and could easily be solved by requiring cloaks to use fuel like lo in order to operate fuel usage could be a simple calculation based on mass and ships that are supposed to cloak would obviously be more fuel efficient the only real problem with this is that any mechanic like that would require a cycle time like guns or anything else that consumes ammo which cloaks do not have im sure it could be programmed to work like this but for whatever reason this issue remains untouchedabsolutely its core to my campaign im not really interested in seeing one part of the game achieve dominance or attention over any other outside of the fact that i do prefer to see more spaceship oriented stuff over the paper dolls of incarna primarily i would just like to see what we have now completely fleshed out and finished thats what iteration is all about the onus is on ccp to prove to us that incarna is going to have enough relevant actual game play to justify the time they are spending on it as an aside i spent two hours on eve university mumble last night answering questions and taking in what all they had to say recording available here so my attention is definitely not limited to just the big stuff in eve
well generally speakingyour campain theme iteration is a good one imho and really what ccp should focus on on most subjects i think i share your opinion or at least go in the same direction but this im personally one who love smallscale warfare eve is severely lacking love in that department sitting 10 players fighting 10 players is boring as hell and extremely predictable when you played this game for x years what is fun and often challenging is to try to beat anything on your own the cloaks are one of the few tools we have available nowadays barring having multiple characters in same system logging onoff in a rotationits just way too easy to lock down gates as it is the regional gates was a nice addition but it is still pretty ridicilous i go through lowsec and theres 10 guys sitting with instalocking hics that will and can kill anything that is not supertanked or cloakyi go through 00 and boom you enter alliancecoalition xs space and there is six t2 large bubbles with ceptor swarms greeting youall this is fine they use the tools within the game to defend space or whatnot there is really only three tools available to fight this speed this was changed on a big scale by the nano changes i actually support those changes but it did kill off the roaming potential by alot and did promote blobbing as did the dd changes cloaks its not dead certain you will pass camps and with noncovops cloaks you still need warpinsbounces etc intel scout spies etcfor the 110 man gangs who like to roam their greatest tools as is today is the recons stealthbombers and t3 with or without interdiction nullifier or faster ships with cloaks you may have noticed more and more players drop that medium neut on their vagabonds to put a cloakand at the end of the day the only thing afk cloaking really do is to put people at unease you still have time to gtfo when the cloaker decloaks you still have the option to fly with friends and you still have the option to take other defensive precautions like having neutecmdrones etc using your brain dscan and not being lazytldr  this is a major issue to those of us who miss the oldschool roaming wolfpacks and guerilla warfare stuff dies when you decloak not while being invisibleim quite disillusioned personally both with csm and with ccps love for the blobbing in eve i was starting to get slight hope there was a reason to vote this csm but this stance is a major gamebreaker so i guess those 5 votes you were gonna get from me will go nowhere as last year
misanth my thoughts on this issue stem from more than just the afk cloaking stuff as you describe it i find it annoying because i see it as part of a larger problem i simply think that this issue like countless others needs iteration think about it  cloaking has not been touched from almost the day it was introduced no further balancing no serious looks at how it might be used better nothing why dont specialized ships get some kind of surprise bonus when they decloak or other bonuses that offset negatives my opinion on this in no way means its the exact thing that might be implemented i gave a very short example in response to a specific question any solution to the matter would come as the result of input from multiple sourcesi see all of this as more of a general balance issue i would like to see ships that are specialized in using cloaking technology get more specific bonuses to using them while slapping a cloak onto a raven or something would still work but impose some sort of penalty that sort of thing i hope that clarifies my answer a bit more
this campaign makes sense supported
what would you do for losec ccp have just implemented a drop of sansha carrier bpc only in losec in the past they have implememnted level 5 missions directed towards losec what more do you think can be done to improve this area of space

back from hunting 4 deersrighto sobots i want to tell you a big big maybe bigger than the moon secret the prices of all dr space my alliance is holding has standardized rental costs they range from 15m per belt of a low ss system to 55m of the high end ss system  high end starts from 08 to 10 therefore its impossible for me to charge bot runners more nor do i intend to charge them at all if i know they are botting petitions petitions if you are a ceo you can follow instructions here  register on our site and access the rental system and see for yourselfand ofcourse if that doesnt satisfy your interest in bots and rmt some of you apperently know even more than myself or do you you are free to read evenews24 article on botting you can write a petition on me requesting a further investigation callum from the options you listed  i already wrote why i dont want to influx the amount of bubbles that are already in systems nor you could limit their amount at the gate atleast by dev standards it would require a lot of coding including creating a special grid around the gate with also having different limit calculated for different size bubbles you cant treat them equally seeing as enterance gates from empire are full of small ones drag bubbles from different solarsystem objects etc i do like the one about turning off bubbles at dt but as you know blob warfare being what it is involves camping pr diz hw etc now if i recall you are ncs fleet commander now here is a scenario you camping enemy capitals in station system you have the staging pos bubbled you have station bubbled your forces are camping both or watching both dt after dt you login 90 of your fleet is still afk short downtime enemy capitals mass undock and  jump out now how does that make you feel you spent 6 hours camping you didnt let your guys to logoff and go to bed you kept telling them that they will have a capital fight or slaughter which ever you like and dt robs you of that i personally had even better case in diz where after dt the dead cyno jammer was rolled back to online and full hp that cost campers about 5 dreadnaughts and x amount of carriers couldnt hotdropthere are a lot better ways to deal with bots for example changing rats ai the biggest difficulty is that a bot is a macro that mimics your behavior and changes to that will involve ruining someones way of isk making as well and by isk making i mean their iskhour ratio this will definitely be a very hot discussion  the csmalso a bot would warp out without the need of any bubbles its the actual players who need them so that wouldnt really do anythingtitan blobs this also relates to giving titans back their aoe damage but while this is a boost for them and reduction in blobwarfare tactics its also should carry a big additional penalty with it so far penalties include reduction in hit points longer immobilization just massively longer align time and even to the point of it being a self destructing mechanism aka the big boom didnt want that titan anyway thanks for 300 killmails whatever the choice will be voted on titans effect the current 00 warfare a lot their doomsdays work in high lag conditions their massive ehp allows them to logoff and escape a certain death etc if i recall correctly  and i normaly do ccp kept boasting about titan changes  that was exactly pre dominion saying they are working on additonal weapons for it ofcourse never saying what something to make them still special after the upcoming nerf single target doomsday
so its long overdue to give titans said weapon as well as making them more vulnerable as well as killing blob warfare at the same timeofcourse this all works in theory in reality large alliances might just keep fielding exact number of titans over and over and another tactic will need to be involved or people will simply not engage blue balls whatever the outcome its time to do those changes but making penalty is crucial to be successful in balancing this issue
i will be on
ill vote for krutoj because i think he has a good look on 00 and lowsec life as alliance director renting one and nonrenting one he know a lot about what player want what they make how they make their life in eveand for sure he have a good experience of the game
i still didnUFFFDt hear this csm candidate as well as uax death from the same alliance for that matter saying something along the lines which would include that he does aknowledge large scale existence of boters in his alliance and that he is actively doing everything he can to remove them absolutely nothing nada zero about that has been said by future csm memeberall i read are some murky and pretty hypocritical statements about changing ai of rats against bots and similar nonsence which is as he knows very well totally useless as todays bots are already at high level of configuration posibilities againt rats and very capable of adapting with future releasesseriously if that is all you have about batling large amount of bot accounts in your alliance i would suggest much more effective and straightforward solution which also goes along with findings published on eve24 forum this is something i would expect from csm candidate truly dedicated of solving at least one part of rmt problemdisbanding of shadow of xxdeathxx and depriving bot accounts of par of their safe haven it would be clear action to prove that krutoj is serious and with true grit about the matter and not some mambojambo which is only used to avoid answers on real questions about botting in drone regions now if i was to see something like that i would say that krutoj is dedicated and worthy of my vote and votes of eve pilots who despise usage of bots and isk printing which is very evidently happening in drone regions until then i am not going to vote for krutoj and give my money for tickets to iceland how ever utopian it might sound as chances are still high enough he is going be elected thanks to drone region superblock voting machineo7

rabble rabble rabble this is an outrage
an audit traillog for share exchanges would also be nice

you have my votes all of them
you have my all of my votes and the votes of my corp
at the december summit in iceland ccp presented the incarna expansion to the current csm at this meeting the csm urged ccp in the strongest possible terms to step up with the messaging efforts for the expansion as we felt that expectation management would be critical to its success at launch we are pleased to see that ccp has begun to release initial information about incarnahowever given how crucial incarna is to the future of eve and ccp the csm feels compelled to make public some significant concerns we have raised that have not yet been addressed by ccp we wish to stress in the strongest possible way that we do not do this in order to be inflammatory rather the success or failure of incarna is such an important issue that in good conscience we cannot remain silentour first and most crucial concern is that there is little evidence so far of a roadmap for this feature we are extremely concerned that development of incarna the most significant addition to eve since beta is being done in an adhoc onthefly mannersecond we wish to reiterate our unanimous objection to the forced integration of incarna into the general eve experience and that we strongly urge ccp to ensure that any new systems will not adversely affect the performance of the eve clientthird regarding metrics we feel that forced integration will not provide a true picture of the usefulness of the features while at the same time these metrics will be used to justify incarna as in any area of business using flawed metrics to justify resource allocations can only lead to poor decisionsfourth while we agree that ccps decision to stage the release of incarna in small chunks is a wise one we feel that it is very important for ccp to expand their messaging and provide a clear and detailed vision of the future iteration and potential of incarna so that players who are highly invested in the current core gameplay of eve will be able to better judge the value they will be receiving for the large amount of time and effort being invested in incarna by ccpthe csm would like to reiterate that we are not opposed to the development of incarna rather we are primarily concerned about the apparent lack of significant planning for a feature ccp properly regards as crucial to the future of the company and the game we love so muchwe want to see incarna fully fleshedout how that is done and how the evolution of incarna is messaged will be key challenges for ccp over the next several expansions we hope that ccp will view these expressions of concern as useful feedback that will be helpful in properly justifying and measuring the resources being devoted to incarnamost sincerelymembers of the fifth council of stellar managementexcept for mazzillu who objected to public posting of this letter and requested that her name be excluded
planning is importantmy what an opportune time to publicly post a letter to ccp that the eve community at large will likecough csm election in two days coughobviously this doesnt apply to those not running for reelection so hush mynxee etc
i think that csm5 has done a marvelous job during their term and their huge efforts are greatly appreciated however i do believe that ccp have made a great game here with eve online and i think that they should be given the benefit of the doubt regarding this new content they want to introduce regardless of how they planimplement it i believe it will be goodis it possible that they have plansideas that they are not sharing with the csmall my love to mynxee and the rest of the csm noise
for your information this letter has been in the works for several weeks we started by communicating our intent to ccp giving them the courtesy of advance preview and reasonable time frames to respond there has been no direct response except comments from advocates about the upcoming messaging the first of which was ccp chiliads dev blogwe felt our concerns were not adequately addressed by ccp and they did not engage in any dialog with us about those concerns if more people reading jita park during elections means more eyes on csms expressed concerns then so be it i would call it a lucky coincidence but if id had my way about it the letter would have been published weeks ago
thanks for your support but if that is true then in my view the csm has even more of an obligation to express concerns because it means we have been isolated and excluded from the process of representing player interests at a critical time in a features life cycle
i agree with noise csm5 has done an amazing job with starting to hold ccp accountable and i hope that csm6 will continue along the same paththis is something that really does worry me about incarna i know that ccp has stated continually that eve is supposed to be a total sci fi experience but after years of talking about ambulationwalking in stationsincarna it is finally going to be upon us and we see captains quarters i am a programmer myself i understand that this is a monumental task especially integrating something of the magnitude of incarna with the previously existing game but not seeing a plan or a direction that incarna is supposed to be heading down concerns me considerablyhopefully at fanfest some new information that they have been keeping back will be revealed i guess we will all have to wait and see
this i completely agree with it would defeat the purpose and the effort put in from the csm should it be true
forced integration while i concede that ccp have developed a strong tendency to validate decision on the mere basis of because it is awesome for who is one of the questions left open in both sales and retention focus in that regard but this letter from the csm 5 kinda sounds like ccp would still be subscribing to the delusion of incarna cannot be compelling unless it is enforced which from a customer perspective comes down to an admission of desillusion and lack of vision  and thus inspiration towards the customer surely that cannot be the caseanyway i get the idea from the chatter on twitter that this letter did not exactly come out of the blue and was a topic for a while  but i presume internally between csm and ccp i agree with the concern though after reading the latest interview in pc gamer i was afraid from hammers statements being an exact 180 degree opposite of the new approach of zulu signalling ccp still having tendencies towards awesome and shiny dump content regardless of finished or tuned and never look back and hey guys there is a new buzzword that will deliver us a personal award im looking forward to incarna if only for the expansion of the universe with a complete new environment added to it on the basis of the original principles of sandbox risk vs reward player drivent events  trends it could have been really awesome but not as an apparent delivery as part of a bigger strategic perspective that of world of darkness where i agree that it makes commercial sense but not a lot for sales or retention in the format of the last 4 years i wish that letter the thoughts behind it the argumentation that must have taken place and the obvious care had been present 2 or 3 years ago now i fear it is too lateas for why i fear it is too late dont get me wrong i do think particularly zulu with his complete change of approach and rightly so is trying to pick up the pieces and doing the right thing has csm seen or heard of a roadmap or vision document yet but well considering it is clear from the various minutes and media reports that on the topic of incarna csm 5 was isolated from both its job in that regard and the actual topic including an nda stamp applied but that ccp did go to the media with  from reports and comments on these forums and others  with exactly what they had shown the csm i am sorry but that merely bleeds a part of ccp living in a trench ccp is still right the data does indeed not support that polished content sells better but reading this i fear for ccps capability to fully understand the value of retention the cost of recycling customer prospects and the necessity to take care of matters its business
opposed to the development of incarna right here well at least when its done at the dramatic expense of inspace features make timely balance changes fix the ui buff the lag team iterate on sov etcwhatever money talks unsubscribing is the only thing that works
i agree with noise for the most part i believe that ccp has created a great game in fact its a game that all 300000 subscribers enjoy and they ccp created it without directly announcing every single change that was to be made to the gamethe 5th csm has without a doubt been one of the most successful csms ever but this constant push back against incarna is really beginning to leave a taste of bovs in a great number of players mouths a simple look at the number of bloggers that came out and voiced the need for patience will tell you that they are less concerned about it than csm v plus for every blogger there are hundreds if not thousands of players that feel the same waywhile i really do appreciate the effort that csm v has put forth i truly believe that by continuing to push back you are leaving yourselves a negative legacy that will not be forgotten for a long time
my apologies this message was supposed to be posted from this toon
dont be silly if anything to be clear from the csm 5 efforts in regards to incarna it is that they have a genuine care to do their job as tasked by ccp in providing feedback thoughts and concerns as well as argumentation to enable ccp to not fall prey to the usual traps of shiny and awesomeive been following numerous blogs that signal a welcoming of a new side of eve personally i look forward to it but ccp has been around for a fair few years now consistantly ccp have merely focused on sales and not on retention and while we can see from zulu that there might be a change to their patterns  it would be a first for ccp to not simply throw something out there and never look back which would be an utter shame patience is something which niche after niche has never yielded any iterative results whatsoever coming from ccp  until csm 5 started to apply simple accountability in communications and interaction doing exactly what an external stakeholder is expected to do even better doing exactly what ccps ceo tasked them to doso i understand where the concern from csm 5 comes from the pi iteration team bff team gridlock all consequences of csm 5 efforts which until that point never came from ccp ever even a few simple examples of caution with ccp and patience like cosmos pos botting faction warfare are considerable signals of caution in favour of staying sharp rather than sitting back and well giving it another 4 years  i am oversimplifying it obviously but i am sure the point is clearits been the caution communication the accountability applied that is giving way to meaningful change in ccps deliverables patience has never yielded results the need for balance is clear personally i think csm 5 struck a solid balance there something that should be obvious to us and to ccpwhat were to happen when the blogosphere welcoming incarna were to be forced to face the disappointment of ccps hopefully former style of deliveries  nurturing eve year after year with incarna i am sorry but it really is time to take care of matters professionally nothing lolcorporate just properly to do and get done the right things right
personally i feel incarna has great potential and dont begrudge ccp their choice to invest in it however the csm as a stakeholder group is obligated to raise concerns and ask hard questions it is not always easy comfortable or fun to hold people accountable for the bare minimum of expected communications with a stakeholder group in the absence of such and after having given ccp many chances and considering that we will hand the reins over to csm6 in a few short weeks a public record of csm5s concerns in one easily referenced place is all that we hope to accomplish here
posting in approval
mynxee i can understand that you simply want your concerns noted nuff saidipod if ccp has truly ignored the game or the areas of the game that you view as broken why are you still playing
just because ccp say they value the input of the csm that doesnt elevate you the status you seem to think you have attained its a method of free idea generation no one really cares if a new feature spoils your idea of a perfect spaceship game i fear youve forgotten that eve is a business and im not talking about selling blueprints youve served your purpose and it isnt to tell ccp how to run their enterprise now mop up those tears and get on with your day the internet already has enough people whining
nobody tells ccp how to run their business on the contrary nor is any csm taking on any delusional perception of status they are just a stakeholder nothing more nothing less they are indeed a business instrument  you are right this is business and in that context remarkable isnt it how both ccp and csm and customers care about eve as more than a game but as a livelihood that enables livelihoods
just wanted to post in support of all these goals from an outsiders perspective we have heard basically nothing about what ccp wants incarna to be other than awesome id love to hear about some actual planned game play even if it is a year or so out
signedi wrote about this not so long ago incarna  will history repeat itself
because i love it eve is more than just a game hilmar once said that eve is an emerging dynamic and the good man is right ccp created life we only quit life when we either get another one or are left or found alone in misery  bitter or perceived as bitter has nothing to do with that nor any relevance please dont mistake constructive criticism for bitter im not saying x or y is broken eve is business ccp has to expand in order to grow but in more ways than one the 350k subscribers we see today come from an original strong concept and a lot of tender love but less and less care  compensated by acquisition focused mrketing and a hell of a lot of word of mouth potential generated by the principle of player driven events  trendsbut yes the past few yers weve seen ccp chase from one buzzword to the next but less and less capitalising on the potential of delivering on the buzzword and nurturing it beyond the mere point of sales focus eve is a service model selling is one thing keeping is the other half eve is amazing and can truly be a generational game i cant see myself quitting it i worry because ive seen less and less visible care from ccp translated into care for deliverables which is not the same as care in its own right something which encroaches on retention unfortunately and that is something which the past 4 years near continuously increased the difference between what ccp presentes what they deliver more so even that the difference between that and how they take care of itsomeone else actually made a fun picture bout that once as analogy fro something known in enterprise development known as the tower of pisa syndrome while one can establish parallel products within the same ip or even others continuously vertically expanding regardless of intent or often even actuality as perception defines the reality of those within the modela service model product for content and features without widening the base or taking care of the deliverables over time results in a pretty damn high skyscr but one which has a very fragile base empty floors and a huge ruide for its inhabitants to alwys follow upwardsim not saying they are ignoring the game they dont it is a business but they have been chasing too much shiny with the same unchanged message and validations for too long and that does present a risk of compromising the continuity of the dynamic that too is business
signed well written to the point and expresses what many offs are thinking and would like to see i vote mynxee for community manager
thank you its been a rough ride this time around and its important to keep it going in a constructive manner i hope csm 6 will be able to do thatnot so subtle hint im running again
hope faith caring those have eroded during my time as a csm delegate sure but theyre not quite extinguished though much needs attention i still believe there are a lot of bright spots in the game and a lot of good people at ccp working hard on making more things better if i didnt believe that i would have resigned from the csm and quit playing immediately after the june summitha keep in mind that this letter was a joint effort meissa and helen produced initial drafts the entire csm made suggestions in the course of a rather lengthy dialog and then trebor and helen worked closely together to produce the final drafts i just get the honor of posting because the chair is the most obvious sacrificial lamb for such potentially controversial messages
as one of the primary authors of this message with editorial input from other csm members i endorse this product andor service
by coincidence i updated my post just above yours to reflect that in response to thorviks comment
incarna is to all extents and purposes vaporware it doesnt exist in fact not even a clear idea of what it is supposed to be exists within ccp this is very worrying since years and years of work and money have gone into the project but no actual gameplay existson top of that i will never forgive ccp if their forcing me to use incarna to switch ships and the like causes me to waste even more time when changing vessel and despite their bold claims it willid much rather have ccp be open about being emptyhanded for now and actually asking us what we would like in incarnaim sorry ccp i love you guys but its gonna be awesome1 just doesnt cut it anymore
while i am worried about the state of development for incarna i disagree with the csm on the integration issue if incarna is to have any success or relevancy whatsoever it should be fully integrated within eve and ccp need to have the guts to stick to their guns and not give in to the never change anything crowdi do agree you shouldnt have to run down kilometers of tunnels to dock undock or switch a ship or fitting but that dosent mean that all station services present and future should be available outside incarna or that there shouldnt be an incarnaonly economy and incarnaonly gameplay that is relevant and affects the larger picture  including the spaceship game it should be optional in the same sense wormhole space is optional you can opt out but you also miss out
agree with the csm5 grouphelicity had a quite nice post as well
this is broadly my position as well for what its worth i am opposed however to simply shoehorning existing things into incarna as a bandaid for actual content my concern is that there will be little to no value added to eve by incarna in and of itself and simply giving us what we already have in a new interface is not a compelling reason to tie up so many resources on a huge new feature
i respectfully disagree with what is said here for me i really couldnt care less about incarna i highly doubt it will be that important for the way i play eve moreover i wish they would just spit it out and go back to spaceshipsi do not want them to spend any more time trying to flesh out some as yet unknown game mechanic that we can do in stations i hope that in this sci fi universe most of the important stuff continues to happen in spaceship battles i hope the road map is once you can walk in stations we are done with incarna until we have polished every aspect of the space ship gamei realize they are going to continue redirect resources to incarna no matter what i or any other player wants nonetheless i can still express my view that i wish they would stop neglecting everything else in the game to spend even more time on this prized egg called incarna please ccp get back to the spaceship game asap
haha you guys are super dumb releasing a public letter
i couldnt care less about incarna either chances are ccp does what it always does and run for the next distraction to talk about on a tradeshow but incarna is a cornerstone to the tech framework for wod so its getting a hell of a lot more focus than stuff in the past like fw or such or so was said last year in cologne at the gdc conventionso they will pursue the path whether we like it or not it seems to me to not be a bad thing to watch carefully whether ccp can maintain a balance between spaceships and incarna god knows they have a history of kneejerking in one way or the other but never doing two things right at the same time were not going to get em back to just spaceships they cant not after so many years of repeting it everywhere moving away from incarna would be akin to tossing the towel in the ring which they cant do because thats not awesome nor does that give awards
signedone may hope ccp has prepared some fresh air for the fanfest but personally i am embracing for the worst scenario you will do stuff here you know secret dark stuff and it will be hm err awesome stuff yes awesome  all it will be wrapped in some hurpdurp of funny video presentations about nothing offtopic have i missed something  have there been not only a spoongate but also a mazziliugottouchedina badplacegate 
while i support mynxee absolutely on the issue of ccp needing to communicate their plans on incarna gameplay if such plans actually exist  which i seriously doubt since i think incarna is just an alphabeta run for those in ccp who hope to make a name for themselves in wod  i tend to agree with cearain that knowing ccps inability to budge on things theyre fixated on it would be better for them to just get it over with and then ignore it like they do most expansions i hope that after those people in ccp who are responsible for this mess are done with it and move on to wod that the remaining devs will be able to get on with fixing the more pressing issues of the gamethat said ccp knows full well the consequences of messing up as they learned at their own cost last year after the june csm summit and pushing the players a little bit more towards the cliff of rage is something that is not likey to end well for them or their business
incarna is a dumb waste of time in a game with overwhelming gameplay issues that need addressing over an expansion that is 90 cosmetic and wont fix any problems if only mazzillu realized this then that is really depressing
pretty sure what mazz realized is what an nda is
except that nothing in the open letter isnt public knowledge and therefore not under nda unless the nda magically means saying nice things about ccp all the time
let me explain how an nda works in this circumstance you youre out of the running for csm
serious question what does incarna offer mothership and titan pilots as a titan pilot i feel slighted that a whole expansion is being dedicated to walking in stations which i can not partake in
what bomberlocks just said regarding nda and the content of the open letter besides which our advocates and much of ccp are already familiar with the content of the letter since they were given a preview weeks ago no one raised the nda flag at that time or sinceas far as whether or not incarna should or shouldnt be something added to eve that is water long over the bridge it is on the books and theres no going back with that as a given the csms role is to help ensure that it meets players expectations and benefits the game as much as possiblenot just in the immediate release but over time both of those things are only possible if ccp engages with the csm and communicates with the players or lets the csm do so in a factbased and timely manner
eve supports many different major play styles it seems to me that ccp has worked to design mechanics to make many of these play styles more enjoyable however the small gang and solo pvp playstyle has been passed over time and again i will argue that position in the next post if you want to hear my reasons for that belief but in any event i would be interested in your opinions on a few topics1 would you agree that small gang and solo pvp playstyle has been the most neglected major play style2 if not then which major play style is more neglected by ccp3 in what ways will you make sure ccp understand it is time they did something for those who like this major playstyle4 any thoughts on fw plexing would be appreciated i dont think fw is the only form of small gang pvp but it does seem to me that fw plexing broken as it is was about the only thing ccp has ever done to truly promote the small gangsolo pvp 5 any other comments on making the game more enjoyable for the solosmall gang pvpersnow on this you may say ccp wont consider anything to boost small gang or solo pvp or fw etc if that is the case will you be more likely to saya something to convince them that small gang and solo pvp is really fun in their game and warrants attention both for the game itself and for their bottom line and if that fails inform them they are simply ignoring your playerbase that elected you and tell them and the players there is no real purpose to your being there or b oh well then lets drink a few beers and talk about incarna and otherwise have everything we say be hidden by the nda the player base that elected me dont need to know what is going on c something elseyou can see my sig ideas that i support but there is no need to comment on that as i admit it hasnt garnered enough player support to be voted on by csm i really think players have given up hope that ccp will revamp fw plexxing its hard to find anyone who even knows how it works anymore ccp actually took their guide to it down moreover although i am certainly happy to hear any particular design ideas you may have im more interested in knowing to what extent you intend to push them to promote this play style
let me explain in more detail why i think ccp has long neglected solo and small gang pvpplaystyle 1 industrialist we have seen ccp create worm holes which yield new types of tech 3 things to produce wormholes also provide a whole new place for industrialists to base build poses and mine etc dominion also lead to new opportunities for industrialists in null sec planetary interaction also provided industrialists with new materials to produce etc im not an industrialist myself so there may have been other things ccp has done to make the industrialists game more enjoyableplaystyle 2 shooting npcsmissioning we can shoot npcs in missions in high sec low sec or null sec we can shoot rats in fw missions or in belts there are also the improvements in upgradable sov space to shoot rats then ccp brings in sleepers for wormholes and now incursions a whole new way to shoot rats again its clear ccp has done allot who want to do thisplaystyle 3 large fleet pvp everything about sov holding null sec revolves around this this has been the center of ccps concern from day one it seems dominion was focused toward making sov warfaret obviously the lag hurt this so it is a huge priority of ccp to fix same with the work on supercaps etc could it use some work i suppose as i hear there are many naps but if ccp cared as little about large fleet pvp as they do about small gang and solo pvp they would have been saying they will get to lag in about 18 months ccp obviously cares allot about this style of play and is focused on itplaystyle 4 solosmall gang pvp this is basically low sec and npc null sec space but it can happen anywhere what has ccp ever done to boost this play style what mechanics promote this 1 fw plexing2 possibly worm hole collapsing based on size although we will see saying this promoted or even was intended for that purpose is an extreme stretchas far as fw plexing it needs fixing and has been more or less ignored from the day it was put out players have figured out the most effect way to do it is really primarily a method of pve instead of pvp i could go on and on with the problems but why everyone agrees it is broken yet ccp seems insistent that this will be a low priority thank you ccp for the broken mechanic to promote solo and small gang pvpas far as wormhole collapse to promote small gang pvp  well saying this was implemented to promote small gang pvp is a real stretch it was much more likely implemented to promote small corps being able to put a poses in wormholes in any event according to the latest economic quarterly very little pvp at all goes on in wormholes compared to null and low sec so if this was somehow an attempt to help small gang pvp it failed thereso am i missing anything that has been done to promote the solosmall gang pvp play style anything other than one broken mechanic fw plexxing that has been acknowledged as broken for yearsi recognize that since ccp has taken no interest in promoting small gang or solo pvp there are fewer and fewer of us left in game so to the extent you are just pandering for votes this may not seem to be a great topic but many people who like small gang and solo pvp have stuck with the game for a long time and therefore are more likely to be voters
1 and 2 yes and no i understand the sentiment since it hasnt been really boosted but its not been neglected anymore than say industrythere have been few instances of improvements to this other than the faction ships improvements when you fight solo you tend to go with the best stuff right however theres a definite need for improvements to small gang warfare also notably in 00 sov wars where small gangs play no part at all we have started to talk with ccp about this and they agree on the general principle now we have to keep discussing the ways forward on this game style there are a few things in the pipes that are geared towards improving pvp in general that will benefit small gangs and to some extent large ones as well3 ccp understands the need the few resources that are allocateable to improvements due to incarna eating most resources mostly are directed towards improvements that touch as many people as possible that being said as part of csm 5 has pushed for improvements to some classes of ships that are or should be used for small gang pvp but arent other than that game mechanics and ui improvements like overheating ui for instance would greatly benefit pvping in general and small gang pvp in particular4 fw is in dire need of fixes after evaluation of what it would require to be functional with ccpa lot of resources i cannot in good conscience say ill push for fixes to it in the first part of the term while incarna is developped theres few resources available committing a huuuge chunk to fixing fw may not be the most productive thing at the end of the term however it should get back on the radar that i agree5 im a member of rooks and kings not a 00 powerbloc we do small gang warfare from 5 to 2530 men most commonly in lowsec and 00 as such i really understand the ordeals one has to go through with small gang warfare you can be certain that ill keep that play style into account as i have over the past 4 termsmeissa anunthiel csm 2 3 4 and 5
since you can gank biger ships like bss becausethey have low ehpthey track badly against smaller targetsdrones dps to support against small targets is a jokeyes i think so now some will spit out tons of blah blah about mmo definition team play etc etc and bs is not ment to pvp alone where ccp said so blah blah blah forgeting to say a carrier has 10 to 20x or  ehp than a bs and is able to gank everything on his path and youll need hundreds of bcsbs to take a single one down then the argument about the required sp to pilot that stuff blah blah like piloting a bs is free skill and less intensive than a bc etc etcsolo pvp first then pveno progress for solo or duo pve for people not playing all day long its boring has it issince feedback threads seem like another game in the game and nothing else i realy cant think something canwill be donne for a minority asking for solo pvppve has hybridsblasters threads where you cant see a single dev post something you represent the minority in the game you folow or you stfu because you dont countto make it short and direct youve traine the bad skillsgallente train the good ones youll do it anyway crosstrain never played fw yet since it seems for what i read its not an interesting activity in the game just another boring ocupation and i cant see wy fw cant assume the faction police role with strict rules oc but think this would helpthere are already many threads about this and if nothing is donne well you think what you want about forums feedback customers comunication etc etc it seems obvious incarna its all it maters and everything else will just be left down about the beers i never drink with people i dont know or cant trustyes id probably spend some time searching a nice blondy to make me visit and have a drink with then waste time talking about virtual stuff knowing nothing will change
3rd party applications are an essential  with the smallest possible effort on the ccp side i would really hope that having one csm member dedicated to getting apis fixed and enhanced this would be an area where more good stuff would come frombecause i have very limited hopes of the actual game getting better through csm input sadlyyou sir have my mining lazors

killer2 is so sexy
mynxee just posted an open letter to ccp about incarna i was one of the primary authors of that letter and of the private letter that has been posted simultaneously to the internal forums this is a critical time for ccp and the eve playerbase there is a lot of potential for things to slide off the rails and for eve to lose its way unless ccp get clear and unambiguous feedback from the community of particular note is the first point about an apparent lack of direction for the feature too often in the past ccp have seemed to follow a design ethos of throw ideas at the wall and see what sticks unfortunately that leads to poorly integrated and schizophrenic design its easy to look back at major systems that have fallen flat at launch due to a poor understanding of what the players want from them  pi dominion eve gate faction warfare are the most obvious exxamples and its interesting to note that of all those systems only one pi has been iterated upon postlaunch everything else has been left in its launch state despite glaring inadequacies lets not go down that path again
not to degrade the message in that letter one of constructive concern i share but im a little bit in doubt on that part of primary author if i remember correctly you were an inactive alternate until a csm member could not make a trip at least if the logs in teadazes csm database with meeting logs are correct correct me if im wrong or confused on both parts of the question cheers
i was unable to make the first few online meetings due to a health issue over the summer and early autumn i still contributed on the internal forums and the various email chains that went around despite being in hospital for most of the weekend meetings and was able to go to reykjavik after i had recovered in the place of mynxee who couldnt attend the incarna concerns sprang from the summit and were discussed at length internally by the csm meissa and i wrote draft letters back in january and mine was chosen as the basis for the final draft over the past month and a half other csm members have chipped in and suggested edits and changes the final version was jointly written by trebor and i taking into account all of the input from the other members
good luck bruce youve got my vote
how is your campaign not simply a prolonged way of asking ccp to reverse a decision to support an os that theyve deemed too marginal to support in any significant way how does this campaign accomplish what a periodic dev blog cannot i gues the main question is can you articulate more than two items that require a voice for the linux eve community because ccp doesnt officially support us is highly unlikely to grab ccps attentioneven with cider support many players have discovered that various branches of wine are capable of running eve and in a few cases it performs better than commercial branches do why then would ccp be compelled to support a platform that seems to support itself better as an independent communityand finally beyond cheerleading for the linux community what else can you bring to the table in the event that your linux initiative is vetoed in favour of other eve gameplay issuesi dont mean to trash your candidacy but as a player im concerned that you offer a narrow focus in a highly technical area with little thought to game play issues which is the traditional area of concern of players who campaign for a seat on the csmthanks
yeah bruce you got my votekeep it up and dont let yourself be swayed
my vote is here of course and whoever else i can encourage to voteabout concerns expressed1 the undeniable marginality of our platform is also due to the nowdefunct official client being used by a tiny fraction of actual linux users while the majority of us was hidden behind wine and counted as windows users even when were not i wouldnt be surprised that the actual number of linux players is many orders of magnitude larger than the number of counted transgaming clients even a way to properly count us would be something id like to be presented to the devs2 while the focus of the campaign is indeed very limited to the technicallyenabled the vocality of our group is also near to annoyingly legendary who would you rather on a csm seat someone with a goal and the thrust to reach it against all odds like uhm running eve on an officially unsupported but community powered platform or yetanotherpowerhungryreplicaofthepreviousdrone i know my answer
what makes you think low sec is broken it just has a bad rep with new players a too dangerious what do you think ps nz ftw
try to realise there is no elephant
kalrand does look like an excellent candidate though
i think the context you are missing is that the dust link is the top priority for the pi team not the whole companycertainly they are going to devote some resources to linking up to dust since if they dont dust will be an even worse failure than it is likely to be already at least this way they might sell a few copies to eve players i guessmy csm candidate position on thisi would rather see them waste 1 team on dust then waste 7 or however many teams it is now on incarna i hope that ccp is planning on not making dust participation integral to pi or sov or whatever they end up tying dust to since even in the best case few people are likely to be playing dust a year or so after release
why should they have to waste teams on anything your logic is nonexistent
teach the elephant to dance tbh
so what you saying is ccp please legalize renting and implement it into the current alliance system is that right you asking them to do extreme changes while they still fail to finish up a good enough existing system where a bloody ceo cant kick a member whos not in station where alliance management itself roles etc is a mess good luck m8

hi this is the point in the campaign where im supposed to announce some big new policy to keep your attention instead im just going to link the sountrack that suzi kato sent me to accompany my campaigngreat song it makes me wish i had a moustache i could twiddle while i listen to itfor glory and honour
to be more clear about the fix renterspace i wrote as it is todayi am pretty sure that no candidate exists that is such a genius that he has a solution for everything if he would exist he would already work for ccpmore discussion and with decent input just saying idiot or stupid is not really constructive is that the solution will get better for everyoneeven when you disagree with me your input will help to a better solutionits naive to think that renterspace will stay the way it is when alliances start charging between 2b and 45b isk for a system a month you may state that something is getting out of control hereif we all not willing to work together on a more balanced solution then im pretty sure ccp will start balancing it themselves mark my words on thisso what im suggesting for now is to see implemented is that renting space to others can in future only be done through rent slotsrenting through a rent slot can be done by a ceo or added rolethe advantage of this will be that ccp will get control over rent space and their money flows ccp can then also limit the number of systems andor corporations that an alliance can rent out to othersexamplefictional system qbatestsovereignty demo alliancesystem licenced to rentingcorpthe landlord will get some options in pricing  discount and other influences like the value of a system belts moons station this in order to stay competitive to other alliancesat least this way there will be some kind of balancing on rent space and a hold on outrageous rentfeesany other way of renting out systems should be a violation of the eula once rent slots are being introducedalliances wont be able anymore to rent space to other alliances with the introduction of rent slotsi am convinced this solution will serve us all including the landlords
in adittionwhat i want in nullsec is that everyone who is not in your own alliance will appear redalliances coalition partners will also show red and thus will no longer able to use other alliances jumpbridges and can no longer hide at their posscorporations that rent space will appear not red but also not blue to their landlord alliance and vice versa say yellow as alliances can no longer rent space from other alliances in this new setup it will prevent that they going to abuse a rented location as a stagerin addition to this if a landlord alliance rents out a system that includes a station the land lord alliance can still enable to refuse docking rights to alliances and corporations they have a negative standing with by renting out space like this the landlord alliance will accept the risk vs income situation it will give individual corporations from empirean opportunity to experience nullsec renting corporations will not be able to make use of the landlords jumpbridge networks poss and alliance channel renting corporations will appear yellow to the landlord alliance and the landlord alliance yellow to the renting corp this situation should be interesting to pirates too  member corporations within the alliance cannot make use of the rent slot system and asking rent old style will be a violation of the eula  kudos system for alliancesmember corporations of an alliance can earn kudos thats where my suggested kudosystem for alliances kicks in corporations within alliances can rent systems by paying in kudosonly kudos can be earned by participation in pvp kills industry and so oncorporations in alliances can only use the kudos in their own alliance kudos cannot be traded with other corps to prevent exploits paying isk for kudosthe setup of a kudo system will benefit the alliance in participation and rewardingso far for now

yes thats a good example although the arrow for a baddon would probably be way shorter i also think that just the vector rather than an arrow would be cleaner

or just remove them from the game would be even better p
sure you can its just a question of how much is dictated by the tiering and how much is down to individual ship attributes right now to this extent i agree with your premise theres too much seemingly dictated by tier hence things like the low end frigates hopelessly lacking in slots and ehp
exactly most of the evidence of the tier system are the inherent imbalances so by nuking the tier system we nuke the imbalances so you are rightwe just need more thumbs up posts

hii would like to propose that the way fof missiles operate be changed slightly currently fof missiles will target anything and everything without regard  so if i warp into a complex or mission site or whatever and hit f1 they will rather uselessly go for the large collidable structures firstnice for some pretty fireworks but useless otherwise as im sure you will agreewhat i propose is that somewhere there be a little options box much in the same vein as the drones settings tab on the drone bayoverview box that only becomes available when you load fof missiles there you would hopefully be able to set priorities for the missiles something likefrigs  cruisers  bs  wei realise that this is a fairly low priority fix but it would make new eden a slightly better place imoplease support thanks ecassus temons post   really focuses on my original idea better than i did really please support and make fof missiles actually useful e2 from kazuo ishigurua good addition to my proposal
supporting this
thats kind of the whole point of fof missiles they are suppose to be rather useless and are only good for when you cant get a target lock ie against ewar and the like they are a very specialized type of missile with limited use
someone just wants to afk missions so no support for you okay i want to afk missions too maybe i will but i wont
on the provision the drones steal your cap in doing a selfrepair and its not a freeride for limitless tank then i guess id support the op
supported a reasonable feature that has been missing for too long and since drones can be shot its not gamebreaking for nondrone ships and besides drones working on your enemies are not shooting at you
any drone lovinis good lovin

id like to suggest a nerf to the ability to include multiple quotes in forum repliesit makes it way too easy for people to act like theyre smarter than they really are and feel better about the fact that theyre arguing over a video gamehow about only one quote per reply or one quote per page or maybe requiring an isk cost for every quote imbedded in your message or how about just allowing everyone to share the length of their dcks in the interest of getting it over withdo this ccp since im sure someone important is actually reading all of this
i would say that training up missiles and flying a drake  raventengu is going to be a better pve option than gallente anything if you absolutely must use long range guns rather than missiles then amarr is pretty goodso for pve drake  raven  cnrtengugolemcant speak to pvp as i dont do it yet
i support a change to the freighter bonus i think it would be better the change the warp speed rather than agility so there are still risks associated with moving a freighter the warp speed change would make it a faster trip and not change a freighters vulnerability
like the idea of destys having a new t2 role tbh  but some of edteachs thoughts are wildly overpowered stheyre the main ones i have issues withmines should use the drone mechanic of being active when and only when the initial mine laying ship is on the same grid much like when you warp from drones they disengage and have to be scooped up so should mines but mines should die faster than 12 hours 4 hours at absolute maxmines are supposed to be hard to detect and by definition should be small disposable items like that wouldnt and shouldnt have comms systems allowing the sending of notifications it goes against the nature of their covert doctrineyou touched on a topic actually that got me thinking about sig radius and sensor strength im sure some that want this are people hounded in nullsec by cloaky nullified t3s and understandably so it should take a concerted effort to stop them and not just a fancy new gadget to solve a problemthat being said i would like to see one of the weaknesses of mines if reimplemented to not be able to detect ships that combat scan probes cant detect that means cloaked ships and ships with a sensor strength to sig radius ratio greater than 108 aka unprobeable it makes sense that if a scan probes hitech sensor packages cant detect that then a disposable mine wouldnt eitherthere should be no indication other than to the initial mine layer as to the status of the mines whether theyre online or deactivated they should appear the same so that its educated guesswork as to whether a minelaying ship is on grid but cloaked or if the minelaying ship has gone offgrid and the mines are offline
i dont think the mines should be limited to grid but to system no reason you should be bound to watch the mine like a hawk to make sure it doesnt dissapear while you bounce around system doing stuffi dont think they should sense cloaked ships and just go offbut i do believe they should be something that can decloak a ship and detonate if directly impacted at the very least perhaps a cloaky can brush past a mine but if it goes right into a mine it detonatesan exploding mine should also do the damage to a cloaked ship and decloak it this could be used as a decloaking tactic on gate camps but not one i think would ruin cov ops even if you are decloaked you are probably already in warp anyway by that time and a ship would have to deliberately run into the mine while you are still within the 5k range of the explosion for it to work and that is still pretty far fetched a thing to happen anyway
i agree more weapon options is something we all cravealso mines do sound pretty sweet indeed
updating this so it makes more sense to new readersif mines were to come back1 no more than 5 deployed at a time so gates cannot be easily spammed with them and to reduce lag whether or not they are in groupings of 5 or 8 or whatever can be left to ccp personally i think a single mine placed up to 5 total is fine2 when placed they are placed randomly up to 2km from the placing ship and self destruct after a time period to be determined by ccp or when the pilot who placed them logs off or leaves system this will prevent concordokken on players that lay mines and go into high sec3 mines have the same 500m trigger range but a larger explosion radius mines will not act as a decloaking device unless the cloaked ship makes direct contact with the mine4 mines once deployed are stationary and nonretrievable friendly ships can detonate them and they also do harm to all ships friend or foe alike 5 mines like bombs are restricted in high sec and are only deployable in nullsec6 mines are deployed by a mine layer device mines also show up on overview and in space as objects that can be targeted and destroyed if so desired 7 make mines only deployable by destroyer class ships give them some useanother idea i was thinking of would be to have one mine destroy another if it is set off this way if you have say all five mines clustered in a big ball and one goes offthe other 4 do not detonate and are simply destroyed againwhen you have a trigger radius of 500mthat leaves plenty of room to move around for cloaky ships you would have to have several hundred mines layed out around a single gate to effectively stop a single cloaky ship with the rules so far stated this would be an idiotic waste of time to implement considering how many ships you would need with mine layers attached to do it and the fact that they would all have to stay in system and keep laying the mines over and over so stop whining about that another idea is to make mines bigmake them take up enough space so that the ship carrying them can only take about 5 out with some ammo for other modulesedit accidentally posted with my alt
bump because this needs to be looked at p
i saw about 200 not exaggerating bots running missions in eitu the other day all magnate frigs scanned their cargo mission items been going nonstop for days reported all for eula violations but they are still going
actually market bots are good for everyone they create liquidity and make the game better for both buyers and sellers
people who say bots cant be found dont know what theyre saying the ccp client could very well detect popular bot clients in memory on log in and report them to the serverthe way to deal with bots from ccps part is to take a good look at the major popular bots existing today secretly release a client patch that detects those clients in memory along with incarna or whatever do nothing for 36 months while collecting evidence of botting do a massive ban of accounts in one go that works very well because it sends the botters into a panic sue the company making the bots if theyre selling themrepeat as necessary thats been proven to work well for other gamesyou cant stop all botting but you can do a lot better than theyre doing now
good arguments but it doesnt ban custom written bots that rmt rings might be using
there is a corp of bots down in the low sec around ingunn and gusandall that do nothing but run courier missions 237 nothing i sent in a petition about it and did they get banned nope ccp doesnt care about bots
doh
this needs to stay up at the top why isnt anyone supporting this 1

they could use some love yesalso update the stats of the drones we have in bay and in space according to our skills so we can know what they really do like missiles that are loaded in launchers

you repeat that as if it it any proof of superior efficiency but actually ecm is pretty crappy on unbonused ships by design ecm was nerfed and ecm bonused ships got much greter percentage bonus then all other ewar ships just to get ecm to workthe only thing wrong with the other ewar drones is being hit by stacking penaltyand web drones are just too slow lift the stacking penalty and all those would probably be useful
if you take my ec900s away dont forget to take the ecm ships i carry them for away tooyes thats right my ecm drones are defensive
i dont really have a problem with ecm drones they arent that hard to deal with but the other ew drones are indeed very weak i occasionally use the webtp drones on my maelstrom to help with tracking while solo and they are effective in that situation but they could stand to be buffed substantially regardless so this is what i think should be done1 increase web drone effect to 40 from 20 it was 30 back in the 90 webber days and everyone ed about them being pathetic back then too stacking penalties would still apply2 boost neut drones so 5 of them is equal to a single t2 mod of their size ie 5x ev900  one t2 heavy neut its balanced because youre dumping 300 dps from berserker iis for a single capless heavy neut3 boost tp drones so a single tp900  40 effect tp600  30 tp300  20 stacking penalties apply4 split sensor damp drones into two types scan res and targeting range increase sd900 effect to 40 sd600 to 30 sd300 to 20 stacking penalties apply5 split td drones into tracking speed and gun range increase td900 effect to 40 td600 to 30 td300 to 20 stacking penalties still apply
personally i think small ecm drones shouldnt existotherwise its same situation as with multispecs before they got nerfed  every ship with extra mid slot drone bay fits one

this is sillynew zealand is a wealthy developed nation it is perfectly capable of looking after the victims of the recent earthquake without outside aid donations  in a way that haiti and pakistan clearly werent if you wanted to put plex donations to good use youd far better donating towards something like vaccinations for preventable childhood diseases in subsaharan africa which kills and disables many more people than earthquakes but i guess poor black people dying doesnt grab the same news headlines as affluent white people dyingalso lol at the csm candidates bandwagoning this
ignoring the issue of whether using plex for donations even makes sense in the first placeno
i agree with shoban on thisbut this comment is just pure ignorancenew zealand is not a 3rd world country in need of assistance it sucks what happened but they can manage just fine on their own without financial aid haiti was a much different story not trying to be a  but that is just how it is as for not using plex for donation purposes to begin withthats being a  why shouldnt we have a way as gamers to donate to a good cause plex was an excellent way to do that and was ccps decision to do it and up to the player as wellso why notedit i am going to change my vote on this and say go aheadwhy not saying not supported after what i already said seems a little hypocritical anyway even if ccp does do it i do not have to participate if i dont want to anyway so no big deal there
because this looks so much betteroh my god its beautifuland if we get a ritter crosermake it happen
i dont think the planets look quite as detailed that close up but i do agree move the stations in that close as well this will make the planets seem a lot more sizeable while you are at it please also make the stations bigger too make them seriously 5 times the size they are now it really draws away from the game when i see several capital ships undock and wonderhow do they all fit in there
ahemthe excuse i think you are looking for is magicgravaton generator arrays are a good one too you know if you want to be all technical n stuff supported i want bigger space plsedit1 spellingedit2 they should totally make it so that your ship overheats just like it does when you overload when you dive into the planet going at subwarp speeds the end result being a nice fiery splosion could make bumping ships off station more interesting
support also if this does occur can we have the music from 2001 a space odyssey playing as we orbit the planets
supporting this because planets should be well planetsized
makes sense ive always seen syndicate as the resourceful sneaky semilegal group
supported really need a fix for this quite unbalanced issue its really annoying trying to scramble for pvp in a shield tanked ship i force myself to logoutsit in my shield tanked vagabond at all times when not in anything else so i dont have to wait 5 minutes for the shield to recharge at the sound of pvp
new feature rightclick tower recharge shield and cap only allowed to do once per hour to avoid exploiting iti think its easier for ccp to write new codefeatures then it is to changefix old code 
supported mwd and ab should have distinct effects on a ships engine trailswait where the frak are the engine trailsseriously ccp theyve been missing for how many years now
awesomely writteni generally fly an armor tanked ship and i just dont feel like ive been in a fight unless i hit hull theres only a few things better than hitting 10 hull as the other guys ship splodes1 for more options for hull tanking

supported great idea
if some of you csm candidates could carry the banner that ccp needs to announce its patch days sooner then 12 hours and 19 minutes before a patch is deployed with a significantly increased downtimeif it was a hot fix it would be a different story but this is a planned release and a week notice wouldnt be to much to ask three days notice would be a minimumive noticed this behavior from ccp in the past and it has annoyed me but this latest patch gives us a warning of a little over 12 hours and increases downtime from 30 minutes to three hours i dont mind the lost time or the delay in setting my skill training its the inconvenience of the whole matterwhos with me
reading the patchnotes makes me consider it as a hotfix tbh
same
did you even read the patch notestheres like 2 changes one change is to counter exploits and the other is to improve performanceobvious hot fix

thanks for the endorsement acei just posted my 00 thoughts on my blog since i am not a current 00 resident i would be relying on the community for what they like and dont like about 00 i do have some thoughts and ideas of my own though
already have the corp permissions thing on my mindnot part of my platform as though i want it if it does not get enough support then i am not going to rage quit but certainly something i would like to see fixedproposal thread here  corp permissionsthis is an updated version of teh userrolegroup paradigm tweaked a little to handle evetell me what you think
i think this needs to be stickified
wow nice websitenone of csm candidates shares more than 69 of my thoughts though
nice work good to see there are some more options this round and atleast someones vote website is working as intended p
ive been waiting for this
they may only maybe sometimes slightly more or less than youalso some of the questions are asked in such a way that although one agrees with the underlying sentiment if taken stricto sensu the opposite answer had to be selected hence the commentsat the end of the day its an indication and you should check out the candidates programs in more depth before making your choice
this is worth repeating
i just wanted to thank dierdra and any other folks that worked on the site you guys did a good job i did find some of the questions to be a bit odd since folks could answer that several different areas were the highest priority it seems like only once choice should have been allowed there
i understand what youre saying but if a candidate wants to contradict himself by claiming two different areas are both the single most important thing in eve they can 
on the results page can you make it to where we can keep the questions in view while we scroll through the participants i get lost having to drag side to side to see what candidates are foragainst
well based on the votematch i can hardly make a wrong choice as i get at least 50 from every candidate it seems dnever seen that happen in rl politics
oh and can you implement a remove button some of these people need to be filtered out from my screen
both your suggestions are good ones unfortunately i dont really have time at the moment to do the website restructuring required to make them happen 
it should just ahve a 15 scale something like i tend to agree very strongly  5 or i tend to disagree strongly  1 that way someone who for example thought faction war was extremely important but not the most important thing ccp can work on could give that a 4 instead of having to give it the equivalant of a 2 disagreeits just awkward wording it the way you do
id like to object to this as you can see through a cursory perusal of the questions asked theyre very slanted i can determine nearly perfectly what the answer the author thought was correct iseditthis is also significant in what questions were asked vs not asked
awesome site
they can and it will make them match higher especially if most users agree with more than one choice
i resent the implication that anything i wrote was manufactured or bull i have provided links to posts made by trebor and a quote from a csm 5 rep and made no recommendations as to where your votes should go i merely pointed out the hypocrisy of the terrible players who bandy behind trebor as if hes some sort of messiah when in fact his ideas and platform are very likely going to make your eve experience worse in csm5 he was a recorder and editor and his recommendations all reflect that he put a basement dwellers level if interest and work into the menial tasks that no one else wanted to do which is remarkable if only to note that hes a perfect secretary but hes not exemplified himself as a leader someone who can prioritize tasks and delegate work to attain success coupled with gameplay ideas that can only be described as ccpesquemy hope is that people will see him for the sham he is and spare your votes for other more deserving candidates that will better represent your own selfish interests as a democratic system demands thus far people have been very receptive to this and i look forward to seeing more deserving candidates on csm6
confirming that this is an extremely bizarre way to rally support for someoneno doubt this was what the goon hive mind intendedbut why
i doubt this was a sanctioned post there is absolutely no doubt that trebor was useful on the 5th csm he has just been awarded more credit that is his due alot of what made csm5 successful is the other members the csms new status decisions within ccp itself and how they interact with the csm dont get me wrong trebor contributed administratively for some things that needed to be done and quite well but giving him credit for things outside his control has created this uberversion of him that i just dont think is actual reality if this image was intentionally crafted whether by himself or virt and co it is extremely diabolical and successful especially on shc and this is why hes deserving of credit personally id like to see the mittani and trebor as cochairpeople
that sounds dubious how could it not have been sanctioned when courthouse posts it on goonswarm forums and the mittani starts using the quotes on shc soon after while he has campaigned for his image like everyone else is supposed to do it seems to have been very specific on differentiating what tasks he did eg crowdsourcing and what csm5 as a whole managed to do that UFFFDberversion is the product of angsty bees
damage control alreadywhy i never
what is more amazing is the amount of alts that pop up during these kinds of things which then go sling there dungheap opinionsthose people must really suck badly or be overly concerned to be not posting with their mainsthis can have several reasons the main trolled soo darn much in the passt so it lost its credibility ages ago already the main is afraid of being kicked out of its current corp  alliance by some fearless leader the main is such an insignificant speck that its postings are just as insignificant and by hiding behind a new alt it wants to give its postings a sort of importance some people metagame soo darn much they just cant do anything else than use new alts time and time again to keep the feeling of playing eve
confirming im an alt but my mains will vote for trebor and seleene tbh
i listened to the podcast debate trebor had some good ideas but sounded like he was standing on a soapbox im sure he has been an effective member of csm5 however politicking is not something we need nor do we need what appears to be really terrible potentially game breaking ideas like a pinball doomsday weaponthere is no podcast for the mittani yet but id rather wait to hear what he has to say before shooting him down because of the corp hes in or because someone in his corp wanted to bring up some points that i have yet to see elsewhere on the forums
reading the arrogance of the mittani alone about how hes the saviour and will change everything because hes godlike is enough for meif i want to hear people like that i can just listen to certain politicians which i also dont take serious
so let me get this straight he would like changes to the stale and stagnant status quo to promote ingame conflict cooperation and make eve more of a challenge for the individual playersounds like a truly horrible guy111say no to anyone who wants alternatives uberblobs funded by passive income and bots so sayeth the kitten  errr mittenslazy ass nullsec
i dont think my life depends on it i play eve so haha life etc butyou are posting as if it is an auto mittani vote because  well i dont know but i guess it has something to do with hating goons  but it isnt so i am letting you know i dont think this is something you should have an embolism over you may disagree i mean you are not exactly averse to hyperbole but i think youre getting scared about something that isnt an issueif the only comeback to these claims is that i should vote for trebor because it will upset the goonies then i dont think you are making a very strong case for your guy i assume he is your guy but maybe you are just posting in this angry manner because you think that not voting for trebor is a vote for mittani heheheheedet for grammer
if you cant explain why any of trebors ideas are good with a straight face then you shouldnt be posting in this thread to support him
see here for an example in his own thread where he is either incompetent or lying this sums up better than anything else why i dont want him on the csm and the poster is very pretty too
all i see is goons and goons alts trying to get ahead by smearingnothing really new here
mittanis campaign has stated thus far that hes in favour of rebalancing moon materials again despite apparently feeding his minions on the teet of his moon income hate him for his personality and his arrogance but dont knock him for his positions if you dont understand them
all the words typed in the op would be better expressed by this single image youll have to google invasion of the body snatchers to properly understand the context if you are 11 or somethingplease visit your user settings to reenable images
dont you have some more gay gallente erotica youre supposed to be writing
im guessing that means it was a pretty direct hit on the old collective ego sensitive little flowers you chaps turned out to be
shes not even running and youre mudslinging care to post substance to this allegationis it yurijade this is an example of some of the worst kinds of discourse in that other thread i can appreciate your positions but how is a former chair helping to shape the only democracy that matters in eve by posting crappy image macros
i consider it an entirely on topic concise and pointed tldr of the op post if you dont understand the context then i suggest you check out the movie from your local dvd store
trebor supporters literally believe an image macro is a direct hit to goonswarms collective egothis is probably the most damning evidence against him
like theres no way that could even be a hit to anyones ego even if we cared what someone who roleplays a spacehooker thought its not insulting in the least
i apologize my memory failed me roleplays as a space hooker and space madam of a space house
that triple post is you literally turning over in the harbour with a broadside full of holes below the waterline you know that dont you
i triple post to show i can
try it your inferior posting skills wont let you do it
ccps forums will recognize you as an inferior poster and require the forums to recover before suffering the insult of another post of yours
goonwaffe garpa posting technology is stateoftheart
also can he prove he was born in the usa and is in fact not a terrorist these are important questions that demand answers
please stop this its dumbyou too jadelet the people enjoy the politics and the drama not pooping on the discourse
alot of the player running for csm are moulding the campain around the same point fixing lowsec my questions arewhat is your take on lowsec is it broken what is broken how would you fix it dose it need a fixthanksmitch
lowsec is broken because theres very little reason to be therepirates like it because they can exploit ad gank players and drop caps without much trouble when the going gets tough dock upfw is another can of worms because its essentially a blob fest resulting in little drive for anyone seriously looking into pvpfor the rest of it the benefits are very minimal and most people would prefer going into 00 or sticking to concord spacethis is a pretty broad question but ill say yesyes its broken and it needs a fix no i dont have a solution for you low sec is boring and ive been trying to avoid it so my perspective is not a good one
do you think that by increasing the value of solo pvp you may therefore see an increase in solo pvp in areas where numbers are not required eg everywhere bar sov holding nullsec which might unintendedly make losec a little more enjoyableor do you think that is being too optimistic
pirates using what exploit exactly  and what is wrong with ganking n00bs like it doesnt happen in 00it has been my experience that if caps are dropped in lowsec it will be 00 entities 99 out of 100 times this remark coming from you your corp and alliance is amusing to say the leastif you are trying to avoid it it stands to reason you arent there much how can you say its broken then or did you take a page from your illustrious allaince member mazzs book and hope to swoon low sec denizens to join your banner in the vain hope you will be able to fix low sec
i think youre misunderstanding my use of the word exploits not saying they are doing anything against the rules more exploiting the players that travel through the most important thing about lowsec is that for some its the first brush with gankingpvpslight misunderstandingim referring to the logistics required to create and deploy said ships anyone can do it in low sec which isnt the case in 00 as for my corp we dont really drop caps this alliance well i have no relation to them except name i dont associate myself with them i was actually against iti used to live predominately in lowsec from day one i was in low sec be it pirating in yong running hisec fw ganks and operations around old man star or having a stint with the heretic nation in amamakei left it because it offers very little for a player such as myselfand once again i have no relations with pl other than that i happen to be in a corp that joined them i have not conferred with anyone in pl regarding my stance on anything nor do i care what is for thier best interestsi am looking out for everyone who enjoys pvpsidenote also consider that lowsec is not actually part of my platform if i had a plausible solution for one i would have included it as required i simply stated that the area does need some work
hey prom did you sign up for this
 mickeythat would be a nice effect but thats probably a little optimisticdidnt by the time i realized it existed it was too late at any rate im hoping people can think for themselves
do you mean you cant list your views on it anymore
that is correct
swoon great ideas for changes and great ideas to put across it sucks ccp wont really listen but if elected i hope you will beat their faces in with them
hi elise you write some really entertaining brs on kugushc theyre great fun however im interested in your opinion on super caps as a tool you guys use a lot and from the perspective of someone who is presumably pretty knowledgeable about themwhat do you think about them do you think they are balanced at all the ease at which a titanequipped alliance can deploy fleets around the place with titan bridges the dps and logistics which can be brought to bear with supercarriers i mean to take down a tower or structure people dont use dreads any more the things that are meant to be for that they just drop 10 moms and the fighterbombers do it in half the time and without having to seige supercap hp that requires enormous serverdestroying fleets to take downand supercap proliferation because of the amount of them i mean theres obviously no point in bringing dreads to a cap fight now and the only time its worth bringing carriers is for suicide triageso yeah what are your thoughts on this
shameless selfserving bump 
im a empire carebare with less than two months of play time and your getting my votes thanks to akay and his excellent lecture pointing me towards your tth column
sorry no kickbacks if you want those trebor has a lovely little lottery you can sign up for if your vote is for sale
im just going to link everyone to your meltdown on scrapheap so we can stop acting like you have anything serious to say without literally punching a hole in your monitor in a frothing rage you want to attack me for trolling and personal heh
thanks you can also find a lecture i gave to eveu a few years back about espionage on the eveu website hope you enjoyed it and remember spying is the most fun you can have in a bad spaceship game made in iceland with your clothes still on
the mittani is a strong man he will crush his opponents and be powerful like stalinif you do not vote for him he will take power
mittani youre a powerful character in the game but at the end of the day thats all we see of you you boast your ruthlessness but i cant help but wonder whether thats who you are or if its a mask you put on when dealing with the gamebut to your credit you wear it very well ive seen alleged chatlogs that feature you and you have a fierce bite one of my fears is that you with vilerat will tagteam to dominate the discourse of the csm and scare the mouths off the other members of the councilthere appears to be a consolidated campaign to keep trebor away from the council yet you must understand that in the end its likely that whether you are on the council or not youll probably wind up working with trebor one of the alligations that stem from the antitrebor sentiment is that he cant actually come up with good ideas but trebor provides examples of successful ideas that has gained his support so it would stand to reason that there are crappy ideas that hes supported as a member of the csmgoon members have also hilighted personal ideas of his that have failed to gain traction are there ideas that sit in the middle  halfbaked proposals that hes supported that can act as an example of shotgun approval that exists to see which surivive long enough to make a hit in otherwords would you be willing to provide examples of trebor supporting a cartload of crappy ideas to sift out a few precious good ideasi see him as supporting either populist ideas that players have demanded for ages and for making suggestions that have been in the ccppipeline for years but id like to know if your researchers can list falsestart initiatives that would show me the interested voter and king of perkone if this guy just supports any crappy thing that comes along put your money where your goonymouths are
we herd sheep we drive cattle we lead people lead me follow me or get out of my waygeorge s pattonkeep leading mittani1 vote
most of the discourse of the csm takes place on internal forums while its true that strong personalities can dominate a summit i dont intend to scare the mouths off other representatives at all that said ill do my level best to utterly crush completely ed ideas and make no bones about it from my perspective the primary concern is not this guy has dumb ideas because ccp typically ignores amateur game design attempts and clearly has done so thus far more worrying to me are the personal reports from mazziliu and helen about his tendency to belabor a point and drive devs away from a discussion out of sheer spergfactor since jade constantine has now lined up behind trebor thats the kind of endorsement that should make knowledgeable sociallyadept players cringe in horror
thank you mittani for your responses id appreciate seeing helen and mazziliu speak up on that im not gunning for an endorsement in favour of you over another candidate but if more of past csms could speak on the record about the issues of the previous csm it would say a lot more about the issues of the csm and what would work out best for it
i have another question this one pointed to one of the more unfortunate aspects of this campaign but a reality that i most enjoy about this gamein the leaked comments you seem to take a less than favourable view of the ideas of most of the other candidates current and past id like to read it from you what do you think the negatives effects of removing jumpbridges from the game would be do you believe there is room for compromisegoonswarm has been said to have a vested interest in curtailing reform in 00 space while ive tried to understand the campaign of the big players id like to understand your position better you are after all the leader of the alliance and you speak for them in diplomatic situations in short why should we all care about jumpbridges can you illustrate the challenges of living the 00 dream despite earning hundreds of millions from technetium every few daysthanks again for spending your time on this
theyve made a number of posts about trebor already heres mazz
and heres what helen had to say on goonfleetcom which you cant read
i was asked today in ripardeg what my position is on microtransactions this is such an obvious question that im surprised that i wasnt asked it until now my position is thisfirst i am the owner of the no microtransactions toon that should give you some idea of my default position on this issue my preference would be that eve have no mts at allhowever we know that hilmar has spoken publicly that mts are part of his longterm strategy for ccp at the end of the day ccp is a business i work in the business world ive been the technical assistant to a senior executive at a very large company and i can tell you that once an executive at that level makes a decision it is nearly impossible to change their mindso my view is that mts are coming to eveso in a more realistic sense though i dont like mts my position will be that if eve must have mts they be restricted to vanity items only clothes ship skins alliance logos on jackets and on the sides of ships and thats itif anyone has questions about this position throw them out there
i will be participating in the lostineve debate on march 12thmike dawe  mike azariahmikhail margulev  krutojjordy wille  cyerusrene de vrind  ms pacmandebate will be released as a podcast on their website
looking forward to that also i dont think its a real debate from what i heard past debate seems more like a good way to promote your points and answer some questions 
despite your ostensibly rpfriendly introduction your comment on matchevecsmcom about whether roleplay is sufficiently supported demonstrates a lack of understanding of the issue and maybe even a hostility toward anything that benefits those who take the concept farther than you do due to some irrational fear that your own style will be affectedevery character in eve is by definition a rping yet i am still myself and dont want to change that in any way
it was meant more as something to think about the statement in my opinion should not be if eve has enough to offer rpwise but whether if you are contributing enough to eve its up to the players to decide how much of their characters is really like themselves in rl and which parts are fictional and only exist in the game
yes it actually does im not an eve veteran but the only times ive seen ccp actually do anything is when the playerbase is unified and furious at them and in the case of botting not even theni mean the real activity from the last csm came once 18 months had leaked into the wider gaming media no one knows what the csm discussed and given that ccp had zero resources to allocate for anything that was raised it was irrelevantgood hardworking people get ignored by ccp the csm gets used as a convenient media relations exercise  rubberstamp and then they go off and do what they had planned long before you showed up
ccp can always do whatever they want it is after all their sandboxbut if ccp or some group in ccp fails to engage or seems set on doing something that concerns us and declines to justify their actions then there are several things csm can do for example1 do the research and present the facts which is often related to player opinion polling the reason the crowdsourcing prioritizations helped was they gave people numbers to chew on2 present good arguments based on the facts3 internal pressure both by posting in the internal csm forum and also by escalating concerns up the management ladder4 and as a last resort public pressure management we had an example of this yesterday with the publication of the csm public letter about incarna but before csm took the step of making a public statement of our concerns we spent months since right after the december submit working the other options
firstly before i get to the main point of this post which i would appreciate you attempting to answer  how does posting a public letter that contains nothing that the playerbase hasnt made publicly for the last god only knows how long prove that the csm 5 members are capable of anything other than attempting to make themselves look good before an election okay you say you spent months working the other options which are1 do the research and present the facts which is often related to player opinion polling the reason the crowdsourcing prioritizations helped was they gave people numbers to chew on2 present good arguments based on the facts3 internal pressure both by posting in the internal csm forum and also by escalating concerns up the management ladderhow long did it take before you realized these werent workingadditionally it is obvious that 1 2 3 and 4 are all part of the same process rather than being an example of several things for example how do you present good arguments without the facts you are basing your argument on you cant what you described is not several things but a single process and i think you are being disingenuous by presenting it as a list of optionseither you understand the mechanics of the csm or you do not one of these has to be trueso if you do not understand the mechanics of the csm i dont want to vote for you based on thatif you do understand the cms mechanics then you just misrepresented them to the playerbase in order to create an apparently knowledgeableimpressive response to a question or in laymans terms you lied to make yourself look goodtherefore by your own response you have shown yourself to be either incompetent or a liar and i dont want either of those on the next csm thanks
trebor always seemed a pretty reasonable hardworking constructive and independentminded guy to me all reasons why the goons will hate him
if you are hated by goons you gotta be doing something right vote trebor hands out campaign buttons o
ah but that is not what i said i said rally the other delegates not rally the players and there is a big difference between the twoi believe it is important that the csm behaves in as professional and businesslike manner every lapse in that professional demeanor gives those inside ccp who dont like the idea that oh the horror the players should have some influence over them the ability to squawk lolcsm as an excuse to avoid engagementand indeed the very example you used 18months was an example of the csm being professional and businesslike we put some hard questions to ccp got candid replies and reported our findings in a calm and measured manner in the summit minuteswe didnt even need to rally the players we just presented you with the facts as we saw them and did you the courtesy of assuming you are adults who can think for yourselves and come to your own conclusionsturning to yesterdays public letter on incarna it is just the end result of an extended effort of trying to encourage engagement from the incarna team leads that began with the summit meetings in october and decemberwe originally published a first version internally telling ccp we intended to release it publicly but giving them time to address some of the concerns we raised in the hopes that the letter could be made more positive or even rendered unnecessary i am told that this letter upset certain people at ccp very muchthe only significant visible response to that letter was the first incarna devblog out of courtesy to ccp we waited and gave them extra time to address the remaining concerns we had when a response was not forthcoming we fulfilled our responsibilities to the players by publishing a revised public letter adjusted to reflect the information provided in the devblog and additionally internally published a more detailed version of the letterwith respect to botting which is a concern i share with you ccp sreegs has engaged with the csm on this issue internally and also publicly on the forums he also intends to make a public presentation at fanfest on this issue i hate to admit it but i might soon have to give a spork to an exgoon
iterations is imho really the key to improving eve working on old features will bring new life to them introduce new features and make using them more effective there are so many missing features that would make a previous expansion so much more complete iterations is the way forward
seleene what went through your mind when you first heard thissidenote didnt it all feel so real back then like it actually meant something wtb those days back tbh
i loved it suas was very talented blog update about the lost in eve debates and the eve uni class that i did this weekend is now up linkage
wow that was a long recording but damn worth listening to that really cleared up so much amazingthank you that was really excellent
seelene you are probably the candidate with the broadest perspective in the game the leader of one of the most successful 00 based alliances and later a member of the eve development team you seem to be naturally the player with the wildest eve careerwhat do you feel is an appropriate scope for playerdev interaction what are the lines of the gm vs a gm do you feel that they communicate closely enoughwithout necessarily describing the process of developing resolutions to bugs which im assuming is a major nda issue do you feel that ccps current process for handling them is appropriate including the turnaround time to creating and ultimately releasing a fixits often stated that ccp doesnt deal with players who use bots to play the game for them do you believe that there is a foundation for this perception do you think that this is a problem that needs to be dealt with can it with respect to your nda obligationsyouve dealt with the csm in the past how did you feel about meeting teh csm prior to your visit and did your perception change afterward do you feel that the csm has enough capacity to affect change to the scope that players tend to promise during the election cycleeditas a player a developer and a candidate which of the past csms do you feel were most effective in general and in terms of specifics
see post 5 where i cover a few high level points on the opportunities with low sec it not that the csm can do any one specific thing we can however work to identify the communities few larges issues and work with ccp as a focus group or sounding board on new ideas that would help correct some issuesat the end of the day one of the best things we can do is find a workable solution to get carebears into low sec get them there to harvest the riches that need to be created and provide targets for those that arent care bears grinthe only real way to get carebears into low sec is to either a reduce the risk or b increase the reward
i understand that you want to try to improve game mechanics and thats good but what can we do for lols would you consider giving hulks turret or launcher hard points i do not mean to increase the number of high slots just to add varity to the fit allowed

thank you i must admit i was still struggling at understanding some partsso my personal opinion about salvaging salvaging is a good and interesting part of eve of course it can be used by newcomers to significantly boost their income at the game start or embraced as a fulltime career by noctisflying salvage masters however im not sure that salvaging needs any improvements at the moment  with the addition of the noctis and t2 salvagers someone can really spend his day salvaging without too much hassle were you thinking about something in particular ninja salvaging is also an important part of it a reflexion of what kind of aggression mechanisms should be triggered by salvaging someone elses wreck could be interesting but so far i find it to be an effective yet not too bothersome way of bringing some challenge to these hisec missions
pokeso what you thinking about various rp issues such as the live events the end of chronicles and so on
im thinking to enforce a policy at the ccp workplace that all employees must be in character 247
icelanders incharacter of powermaddened demigod capsuleers get ready for more volcano eruptions
great suggestion kick 3000 people out of 00 because of the botters which are probably not even 5 of the alliance the current system of dealing with botters through transactions and petitions is both effective and ineffective effective since it does catch a lot of them in the net and bans them ineffective because they create new corporations let alone accounts so how would you deal with thatlets summarise this rightmacrosaka bots mimic players behaviorbanning them spawns new corporations of same botsrmt has market and goes through 3d party sites that are made for itmacros adapt to any new changesas far as i remember csm5 were talking about abolishing belts or somewhere along those lines or making constant mwding to get in range for example for said ravens i dont know all the different options that came up will hurt the main player base more than fixing the problem as they adapt to it anyway and the top 2 ways they are caught at the moment still are petitions and rmt transactionsso to answer your question no i do not have a solid solution to this problem
if ccp is unwilling to do it when its literally their job why should anyone else
u need a reality checknice replies  how the hell do you transport 4 deers btwhas my vote
thank you for your supportdeer werent shot all at the same time so we took 4 legs and back stakes right from 4 then you cut meat from the bones left bones for dogs so you left with just meat pieces we had chillers with us about 5 all full then got home and cut meat into smaller meal portions and stored away
oh wow the sad thing is due to your massive spaceholding renterbotterrmt whatever operations you could probably practically afford to blow up a titan every time you wanted to oldstyle dd
i guess it would be pretty ty if all the caps jumped out but its not like ccp wont turn them off anyway as we saw when it were camped in
krutojthedestroyerto kugu thread with some more questions answered there as wellnatalia kovac my ceos idea is to have titan production prolonged as another nerf to titan blobs so instead of say 3 months increasing it to 4 more fights for titans being built anyone also you claim we earn a lot of isk here is some information on that about 6070 of it goes to pay for sovbridges another 2030 goes for ship reimbursement and what remains goes to people managing the alliance or other needsas far as isk goes northern coalition holds like 60 technetium moons have a look how much that brings besides their renters food for thoughtcallum545 in the last 3 years i can count only 34 cases when ccp interfered with bubbles as per dominion large amount of bubbles is considered exploiting and ccp removes them via petition same goes with deploying sov structures pre extended downtime even if it was 2 hours before it and you cant prove that the hostiles didnt mean to take them down in that 2 hours but that 1 hour of downtime caused you to have the unfair advantage those are so called legal cases still you atleast have the hope that you have less than 10 large bubbles or that hostiles wont petition them being ehonor and all that while in the case of turning them all off regardless is a pain
your neutral rr fix is stupid repping someone does get you aggression but since its not an act of combat you still get right of passage to stations gates and that lark as for the logi just getting away youve successfully forced it off grid thus there is no logi should the logi come in again it will be off gate and could easily be caught and as for station if it does dock again there is no logi should it undock chances are the short time it is able to stay out it wont be much good at all youre concept of it being a game changer is true but if you where good at pvp then youd be ready to counter this rather than crying you dont know how to and calling for it to be nerfedas for the rest of your ideas seems like you really dont know what you are on about
but how could actively participating in a fight not be considered an act of aggression it makes no sense that it isnt and what happens when the target has multiple logistics say 3  5 sure you can neut or damnp the logi or shoot them until they leave but unless the fight is greatly slanted in your favor in the beginning you will not have time to deal with more than a couple logi ships before you die and really with 3 spider tanking logi ships you will have a lot of trouble dealing with even one of them if you are by yourselfand then you have the random bored logi pilots sitting outside station who feel the need to ruin every single fight they see by repping one side or the other and ccp removed the only consequence to repping random people because a bunch of carebears whined about itbasically if you were good at pvp youd bring your own blob to kill the rr or have your own fleet of rr alts to counter their rr altsway to miss the point
lets not turn this into a thread debating neutral rr there are plenty of threads debating the point ad nauseum go post in one im sure the other super leet pvpers will all agree with you that playing docking games in jita with neutrals is a good time
i honestly think that neut remote reping has ruined and tarnished the 1v1 in places like renshekamarr and dodixie new and old players undock in a pvp ship hoping to get a fair 1v1 to test their ship or just have some fun then they see the very familiar aurora of the rr ships usually they are fairly off the station and they end up losing their ship the only counter to rr is of course more rr personally i think that neutral rr should caused concord intervention by jamming the rr ship for an indefinite amount of time usually around 10 minutes as an average depending on the regular 1v1 after some thinking i have chosen to support you manalapan best of luck to you and your ideas
alright just did the drawing and the winner againhot tubes and he wins 50x electron blaster cannon ii i am standing firm that hot tubes has some how compromised chribba dice linkplease more people post so hot tubes doesnt win anymore i am tired of him getting my stuffalso my concern about neutral rr is that it is1 breaks war decsthis weakens war declarations in high sec substantially as any predictions about enemy power could be off substantially the concern is not that some alt with rr will get involved the concern is some random person can come along and completely change a battle they have no stake in random involvement of outsiders is my problem here2 100 risk freea neutral rr ship can rep someone and get away through a gate or a station with absolutely no threat on itself now i did think about just adding an aggression time like guns however instead of using logistics they would instead use battleships that can tank the 30 seconds before docking it is only worse now since rr cannot go gcc on accident any longer yes i understand that it needed to be fixed for incursions and maybe incursion systems get a different set of rules you can easily justify that saying concord changes the rules in favor of combating the sanshaurian kandor way to sneak in there but that is exactly my point thank you for your support and construction of the concept
was going to split my votes between you and trebor  now trebor will get both
after reading all this and going through your campaign site you have my vote i wholeheartedly agree with your take on scamming i hate scamming but it is part of the game and neutral rrwhile i think your interdictor idea is nice it seems to be of no use to me living in highsec or is it meant as a targeted effect and i missed it otherwise id propose to make it a targeted effect and i will train destroyer 5 at once 
i believe you are talking about the dockgate jammer script if so then yes it is intended to make it a targeted effect that as an aoe would not be balancedthank you for your support and comments on the ideas payne666do you disagree with my stance that scamming is an integral part of eve trying to figure out what you didnt like in particular because i believe trebor is not antiscam unless i just completely failed at reading his stuff likely it was late
scamming is part of eve in a way that makes the game unique there have been ample passive antiscam mechanics that have been put in place like the writing out of 100 thousand on the contracts to the removal entirely of freeform contracts or even painting the navy megas camo green catches the eye better for those that buy items linked in local on image aloneand while these changes can be seen as pros or cons depending on your take of scamming it also blows me away the creativity of players to invent new scam forms now if ccp were to make all scamming griefing etc against the rules they might as well paint all of space pink with rainbow stars and have us only be able to fit snowball launchersthe seedy unforgiving side of eve is what makes it so different and special
i shall join this league of internet spaceship nations
serious answer nothing but while incarna has a high potential to be enforced partially or selectively it is something that solely applies to station environments cnsidering theres been mention of special incarna nodes and such i doubt ccp even considers expanding it to captains quarters inside ships  i could be wrong thoughnot so serious answer look on the bright side being in a supercap will save you plenty of plexes in not buying pink dresses tattoes earrings and hats
am still suprised she didnt ask for 2nd term of csm just because in it
so i have to wait 2 years for any chance at content relevant to my playingsounds like a great game these 1 year development cycles are fantastic
if the feature is compelling enough to attract players be it as an rp environment or with its own gameplay then it doesnt require enforced participation how can a feature be defined as a success if the only option to avoid it is to quiti agree that incarna should have its own gameplay and that it should allow access to the current in hanger features what it shouldnt be is a total replacement for the hanger environment for those of us who are not interested in walking around when docked from the information in the cq blog it seems it will be a total replacement of the hanger environmentmy concern is that ccp are going to take the easy option and not only make incarna participation required at the docking stage but also provide flying in space changing stuff only available in station to further enforce participation we discussed some of this under nda this would make even an optional incarna about as optional as actually fitting modules to your ship  yeah you could do it but why would you i agree here and am quite happy to miss out on minigames and walking around if the option was there whilst on the subject and because people have been attacking me for suggesting that incarna being optional would make sensewspace is optionalplanetary interaction is optional and most people have opted out according to the figures we havemining is optional  you can pay others to do it for you or get minerals elsewheremissions are optional  other ways to make money are availablerunning a pos is optionalmarket trading is optionalsov is optional  you can live elsewherepvp can be optionalavoidable if you stay awake etcbut  incarna participation will be enforced unless ccp change their mindmaking incarna participation optional will not ruin your immersion but making it enforced ruins mine
this has nothing to do with an ndait has everything to do with alienationsee the csm has benefited greatly from storms aimed at ccp the summer rage meant ccp gave the csm big cookies to help deal with the player concerns and i think that the csm sort of hopes that this will happen againthats stupid and it wont because this is completely different than the summer pr incident first of all in the summer the rage was aimed at the higherups who have the power to make major changes this letter is trying to start a storm directed at the grunts of ccp and its telling because it speaks about implementation details its not going to work because those grunts of ccp arent directly beholden to the media and they arent required to answer to the csm or include them in operational details its also entirely the wrong way to go about it since they will take it as an insult to their livelihood incarna to you is a game incarna to them is a way to feed themselves and they will do anything to keep that from being jeopardizeddevs arent required to give the csm so much as the time of day they only do it if they want to and theyre only going to do it if they think its safe weve proven ourselves willing to start pr  when we dont get our way so this isnt going to help their willingness to deal with us thankfully most of us are leaving office especially the people who were behind this trebor and helen were supportive of the letter though something voters might want to keep in mindi signed my name to the private letter because i agree with its points but im not going to associate myself with the public letter even if we get our way it isnt worth the risk that we go back to being csminthedark that we were during the csm 14this is stupid i cant believe im the only person who thinks this screw you guys im goin home
it would be absurd to say anything in this letter violates an nda it is simply their requests i dont see this as any sort of  storm either i do agree ccp should communicate  i suppose i also agree that incarna shouldnt screw up the spaceship game by making dockingundocking take unreasonably long or causing lag etc i am also not suggesting that ccp scrap incarna that would just be dumb but i am saying i do not expect anything more than just being able to walk in stations i dont expect fireworks or some whole new fantastic game there are all sorts of games where you can do hand to hand or gun combat in space station settings im not interested i dont want ccp thinking that they need to keep working on incarna until they come up with something great the whole genre has been beat to death if they get some inspiration 5 years from now thats fine but dont force it because some players feel they have some sort of right to something more substantial than walking in stations just make us able to walk in stations in the most basic form possible then reassign the vast majority of devs back to spaceships i listened to part of the lost in eve csm debate seleene said ccp had only implemented a small portion of what they had planned for the spaceship game there is allot more they can do in this game but they need to wrap up the incarna stuff and get to it
eh they left us firsti think youre attributing unduly specific intent to the diffuse anger of tens of thousands of people who quit and posted about it last summer they were trying to reach senior management but not midtolower management and grunts what they were ed off and posted everywhere cuz they hoped it would make a difference or because they felt like something was taken from them and were madi suspect csm5ers think incarna will provoke rage with its bugs and slowness and no gameplay theyd have to be huffing some pretty sweet ether to imagine a stronglyworded letter is gonna cause rage on its own theyre not morons theyre getting out ahead of the inevitable to avoid blame to mitigate damage if possible to make a point etcif theyre looking to feed themselves by continuing to alienate their customers with idiotic priorities way outside their core competencies then i hope they buried a lot of shark fins in the sand last summertime was eve had 60 mil in annual revenue and could feed lots of people if it was tended to howeer since that wasnt as much fun as making console fps and repeatedly learning to make a 3d engine it got deprioritized plus i hear vampires are gonna be all the rage with the young folks around the 2012 holiday season could be bigger than farmvillewhat people do or do not say about ccpincarnaeve and in what forum doesnt much matter except to the extent that its true or not if it turns out to be a huge success because what second life was really missing was a buggy laggy primitive space sim with a sadistic ui played largely by bots then nobody will care what was posted where and when and by whompretty sure that ship has sailedfirst mittens sperging all over shc and now this trebor you have a really strange way of lobbying for support
this csm term has enjoyed an unprecedented level of inclusion keeping going in the direction of public complaints at things we dont like will jeopardize thatthe rest of your reply is just spouting off at how you think ccp should be run thats nice go get a job in ccp upper management my concern is with the csm and making sure that next term it gets to have the meaningful discussions that its enjoyed this term
mazz your new portrait is freaking gold
incarna is just code that can be backported from wod development without too much work so of course theres no eve specific planningnor is there any reason for there to be as incarna has no gameplayi dont want a roadmap i dont expect ccp to stop working on it theyve invested so much in wod they cant stop i just dont want ccp or the csm considering it as anything other than a cosmetic decoration on eve
i thought you were quitting eve so why the concern
the recent release of information about captains quarters was a good example of the communication efforts the community should receive more often about incarnabut all this lacks a bigger picture a roadmap of sortsif i have a seat at the csm ill be sure to continue your work on the crucial matter of communication between ccp and the players
considering this public letter addresses design gameplay how can it be considered aiming at grunts
high level concerns hey you dont have anybody assigned to working on eve summer 2010 something only the higherups can deal withlow level concerns hey why is this feature mandatory this letter 2011 something only the grunts can deal withwhat you think im doing and what im actually doing are probably two separate things
there is something weird happening to the post above me and its freaking me out
incarna wouldnt be a problem if there was a way to opt out of it there isnt at this point instead of being able to conveniently click a bunch of buttons we will be forced to walk around in a station to do these thingsi dont want to do such a stupid thing i play this game to fly a spaceship not wander around struggling with an obnoxious interface
i think the csms concerns about the success or failure of incarna are grossly overblown while their point of the importantance of planning are spot on those issues are generic and apply to every project in every business area lets look at incaraworse case its an abject failure and we the players of eve are forced to spend a few seconds in an crappy avatar however the rest of eve should stay generally the same its still going to be the game we love of course there are the lost cycles that ccp could have been putting into eve while true they are already lost if this is a failureand they are no more lost as if they were put on another pi feature or pick your preferred waste of resources end result we still have eve and hopefully ccp will go back to doing what it does bestbest case incarna is a success its deepens the game play increases immersion and player interaction it enhances the game we love it bring in new subscribers for us to blow upsell stuff toscamwhateverthe bottom line is that this isnt as dire as the csm seems to be making it out to be if ccp doesnt know where incarna is headed who cares they didnt know where eve was headedand probably still dont thats an asset unless the csm knows something we dont the worst case isnt that big of a deal the risk to reward still seems to be in our favoroh yeahthis is still a game enjoy it or dont
considering the stunt with this letter its no wonder why ccp doesnt want to show an incarna roadmap at this stage its in their best interest and possibly everyone elses to at least wait until this csm leaves office also as far as timing goes with fan fest right around the corner and csm elections coming up why on earth would they talk more about incarna nowi think mazzilliu is right this public letter potentially does more harm then good not just with ccp but also with regard to how the csm is viewed by the players if this letter had come out after fan fest as the result of a lack of information revealed then that would make sense as it is the timing seems to be in the best interest of only a few
personally i would have waited the two weeks until fanfest before posting a public letter two weeks wait wouldnt change anything but based on information general public might get about incarna such a letter might get much more public exposure and support and result in actual actionright now most players know nothing about incarna beyond captains quarters and even that is just a rough idea  we dont know how movement will be handled etc etc its not on sisi yet either but should be this or next week unless their schedule changedas a result most of us cant honestly say agree or disagree or even you are overreacting because we simply dont know wont know for at least two weeks so what purpose can such a letter serve at this point in time aside from creating anxiety sounds like something that should have been worked out privately or postfanfestbut thats my take on it based on what i know about incarna which is practically nothing i understand csm may be privy to information under nda that makes them act this way and i find it very disturbing for many of us incarna is a make it or break it feature if it turns out to be a total letdown and all we get this summer is one character in a tiny room doing nothing except converting oxygen to carbon dioxide followed by another 6 months or more of iteration of more tiny rooms in which one or more characters will be converting oxygen to carbon dioxide together thats a year wasted the payoff for the amount of work spent on it would be slim and none i understand that ccp needs carbonincarna both for eve as a platform for future nonship content as well as wod but they need to remember that they cant leave the space portion of eve to stagnate for years while they do it apb is a good example  developers spent an awful lot of time on the character creator  which was frankly amazing  but forgot the rest of the game as a result it was one of the quickest and most brutal failures in mmo history  under 3 months from release to server shutdown bottom line speaking for myself i dont know what to think obviously csm is deeply concerned and i assume they have more information than we do albeit under the nda but is it bad enough to risk bad blood between presentfuture csm and ccp for going public especially in light of recent ccp and csm strengthening the bond interview a month or two ago i guess time will tell
utter drivel it is the managementvisionproducer level staff within ccp who should be making those kind of key strategic decisions not the grunts working on one part of a featureweve been waiting for answers to questions and constructive feedback raised in december and havent heard anything an internal letter was sent to ccp last month and all we got back was the cq blog which didnt address anything significantthis letter hasnt damaged any working relationship with the incarna teams because there wasnt a working relationship with them in the first place
frankly i think incarna is going to be great i spent a lot of time crafting my virtual ass and i expect to spend a lot of time fapping over it
what about all those guys with male avatars tho if youre not gay plex for sexchange these are important questions ive blogged on this and im going to stick with my initial take on incarna  ccp has to deliver the goods and make it interesting thus far ccp has not shown that they have a plan theres that word again for doing that and i dont think this public letter would have become public if the current csm had been given any kind of bread crumbs to reassure them
you still cant disagree that the two complaints are of a completely different nature one is something that can be seen as a reasonable request all around the other can be seen as trying to dictate game features by others one is broad and allows for a lot of leeway in the possible responses the other is specific and narrow and not to mention ignorant of whatever operational constraints may be imposed on the teamthe csms relationship with the incarna team might not have possibly gotten worse but weve just broadcasted a message to the rest of the teams saying hey guys if you dont do something we really want you to do were going to try publicly shaming you good work guyswith regards to the timing issues brought forth by others the letter was supposed to be released two weeks ago since i raised up such a stink about it and the csm was concerned about being perceived as acting maliciously and ccp said they would be taking time to draft a responseincarna devb but in the end nobodys minds changed because of it we cant really release this letter much later than this because our term is ending although most functional activity of the csm seems to have ceased at around the time of this letter anyways
sorry i could not resist that wide open door anyway earlier today i left a comment on keiths blog which was promptly turned into a guest post where i left my own observations on the matter of the incarna open letter it is best read there and until we get new forums the character limit here is a bit restrictive anyhow i understand where the sentiment of buffering against perceptions of butthurt comes from but it is unwarranted unnecessary and counterproductiveunwarranted because this is ccp we are talking about a company that dares to be different that wants to conquer the world they know that is never smooth sailing and takes a lot of hardshipunnecessary again because this is ccp they have an open business culture with clear company values which they stick to if folks working there get butthurt over an open letter it is more from individual confusion between work and person than from an absence of such company valuescounterproductive because this open letter the process the communication the accountability it is all exactly part of the mission of csm as a stakeholder as laid out by ccps ceo providing feedback is but one part of it challenging ccp another and both are inherent elements required in any external stakeholder interaction yes it is a learning curve on all sides but that is fine ccp are humans but strong people and they are a teamjust like in my comments on keiths blog it is still best demonstrated by the words of ccps chairman of the board of directors its from 2009 yet still applies to everything ccp takes on as a company as people vilhjalmur thorsteinssonthose are very wise words and the thoughts behind it are even smarter they are good lessons and values not just for ccp as a company but also as people and equally for the dynamic that they created  of which ccp csm and customers alike are a part of
meissa thanks for the response i find it surprising that no other candidates have thus far felt the need to post about smallsolo gang pvp although to be fair seleene did respond to almost the same question in his thread i suppose solosmall gang has been sufficiently killed off due to neglect so no one even needs to address it as an importantcrucial concern for the game but you say faction ship improvements were some sort of boost to small gang and solo pvp you ask when you fight solo you tend to go with the best stuff right i cant answer for anyone but myself and the answer is no when i fly solo i expect to get blown up so the faction ships other than the cheaper frigates are really not on the radar sure some people fly more expensive stuff because it is fast vagabonds drams and cynabals obviously are top choices for allot of solo pvpers although they also tend to be the bane of solo pilots because little else can really compete with them 1v1 the faction bses are really just used for pve as far as i know the faction cruisers  well i really dont know what use they are in sum the vast majority of faction ships have no place in small gang or solo pvp i do disagree with the thought pattern that goes faction frigates are used in small gang pvp therefore ccp isnt neglecting small gang pvp in the extreme saying faction frigates are boost to small gang pvp is like saying faction bss were a boost to people who like to shoot rats consider thiswhat if the only boost ccp gave to people who like to shoot npcs was faction battleships and fw plexing no faction war missions no epic missions no sleepers no incursions no upgraded null sec npc spawns no speed missions lots of people who like to shoot npcs would leave the game wouldnt they do we not see lots of people who liked eve for the small gang and solo pvp leaving the game is it hard to see whylets face it ccp has nearly completely ignored this play style and so the players who enjoy it are leaving fw plexing the only thing ccp ever did to boost small gang pvp ended up being more of a method to deal with npcspve than a mechanism for pvp see this thread where a former csm posts about capturing 111 fw complexes in less than a week without a single pvp kill
i agree its borderline hence the sort ofbut you dont see large fleets consisting only of faction bsmy point is that a faction bs versus a regular bs the faction bs has the advantageand this is the kind of scenario more visible in small gang than in large fleet i admit its not much of an improvement however hence why i keep pushing for it pi appreciate your comments and concerns and agree with most of the points you make i definitely agree that the needed attention to small gang warfare is ill met with faction shipsfaction warfare could use improvements indeed the only problem is that a series of small improvements and fixes wont change the underlying problems in fw and its going to be patch upon patch upon patch and no end in sight we agreed with ccp that fw needs to be modified in depth to be able to achieve its objectives now with the resources available i cant promise to push for it in the beginning of csm 6 as i said in the 2nd part well have more time available however
your ideas are interestingim a small gang low sec pvp player myself i dont solo often though 315 people fleets mostly and little to no fancy faction ships i understand what you mean and i share lots of your concernsbut solo pvp regroups lots of different kind of pvp you cant really compare hi sec wars low sec piracy antipiracy fw and null sec small gang roamingsi think ccp is aware of the importance of small gang pvp on eve for instance alliance tournament the most important event organized by ccp is about small gang pvp not fleet fights not mining operations or probing contesti doubt anyone could come up with a solution to improve all kind of small gang pvp playstyles though i think each of them war 00 low fw etc is tightly linked to the game mechanics and population of its environmentas far as lowsec is concerned i believe small gang pvp concern should arise when discussing a broad lowsec overhaul factional warfare includedeverything is tightly linked in low sec you cant look at it from the small gang pvp point of view onlymaking lowsec interesting enough for industrials for instance would make the pirate population grow bigger and allow for more fights in general maybe more small pirate corps and thus more small gang fightsas for fw i must admit i dont know it really well but what i know is that it cant be separated from other small gang pvp in low sec pirates and fw often interacts for instancethe same goes for 00 small gang pvp there depends on sovereignty mechanisms which have a huge influence on population repartition in 00 upgraded systems being full others being rather empty right now jump bridges and other fleet projection abilities also have an impact on small gang pvp either because it allows small gangs to travel fast in their own space or because it allows defenders to respond more effectively to a roaming gang changing them will have an impactand for hisec war mechanisms aggro timers and neutral remotes none of this can be taken separatelyand so on everything is related and small gang pvp is everywhere in eve impacted by absolutely everything and impacting everythingfocusing on one whole area at a time is in my opinion what csm should lead ccp to do keeping it mind that modifing an area doesnt mean it has to stay the same for years small meaningful changes when needed should happen  dominion as a 00 focused expansion for instance failed quite horribly and need to be looked at as soon as possible
1 not sure about the most neglected just as i would say that any pvp chagnes have not been focused on blob warfare the issue that pvp is facing is thatthat of human nature eg if i can do this with 10 people then i can do it twice as fast with 20 and twice as fast again with 40 then when you bring 40 your opponant brings 60 so you call your friends and they bring another 40 etc what has also added to this is the fact that corporations and alliances are larger more of them opperate in 00 and that is a direct consiquence of eve having more players in the same amount of space when i first started playing i could make the run from hedgp to vngju and maybe see 23 people now you see 12 every couple of jobs and there will be a blob of some kind that needs to be avioded2 i think ccp have worked hard to try to bring good content to most parts of eve every couple of updates but as a concenquence i do not think any 1 play style as gotten an awesome set of content take planetary interaction pi for example i have been doing lots of this as an industrialist but at times it bores me to tears it is so static i can not use my other industry and science skills to give me an edge in normal manufacturing i can research the bpos to give myself an edge i can put up a faction tower to get a better research tower to research my bpos but with factional warefare all the schematics are the same with nothing to give me or others that work at it an edge3 i know ccp have said that they do not like to impose limits on player interaction but all the same limits are there 11 research jobs max 11 manufacturing jobs 11 people per squad 5 squads per wing etc i think it is time that they admitt defeat in trying to control human nature and put in some increasing negatives for gang size in certain circumstances like a deadspace complex that eachtime some one warps in it spawns more and bigger rats the issue is to find something that can not be exploited for the sov mechanic4 no major experience with that but i from reading the forums i know it could do with tweaking5 i want to see more of it i loved it when i was in 00 but one of the reasons i am not there now is that fleets got to big and fights less enjoyable a number of candidates for csm want more small gang so i am sure it will be on the agenda very early it all depends on what options ccp presentsi also think that the csm should continue to push this issue to get some plan of resolution from ccp
vote for madcat
sshhh that was supposed to be between just us two now everyone is going to get the same idea
goo killer 
i was impressed by your results on csm match toolnot perfect but better than the other idiots 
whats up with the opposition to incarna that you expressed on matchevecsmcom
you can find my personal thoughts on the reasons behind the goon smear campaign in my campaign thread and you may want to read that first this thread is devoted to a related issue the damage it is doing to other qualified candidateshi everyonein this election weve seen a lot of mudslinging much of it directed at methats fine i dont take it personally and i know its just politicsfor example one current csm alternate has apparently been referring to me as a dangerous idiot on his internal forums while at the same time for the last month or so weve been working together on the public letter on incarna in a quite cordial and professional mannerso either hes not serious or he has a great deal of experience working with dangerous idiotsbut here is the point i want to make be very wary of changing your vote to me because of an emotional reaction to a provocative campaign messagefor example ive gotten some emails saying things like i was going to vote for you and seleene but after all this im throwing all my votes to youi think this kind of reaction is illadvised you will be doing exactly what the mudslingers want you to doallow me to be bluntthe only reason anger about the mudslinging should cause you to change your vote is if you were going to vote for one of the mudslingers or their candidatesin particular i strongly urge you not to change your vote to me from one of the solid nonaligned candidates who are running such as seleene ripard teg meissa anunthiel jonathon silence and roc weilerthese are the kind of candidates who will work hard to improve the game and the csm for me to be reelected to a csm that doesnt contain people like them will be a pyrrhic victory  and deeply pleasing to those who care more about their own personal petty interests than the health of the game as a wholesincerelytrebor daehdoow
and people say goonssolar legion of red noise are trying to form a bloc
in another light it sounds like youre in favour of splitting the vote among candidates who arent putting an effort into taking the chair conversely lets say a goonswarm candidate such as kalrand who has the ear of a number of players concerned with industrial aspects of the got a seat on the csm are you suggesting that they wouldnt have a desire to make progressive contributionsdoes the goon ticker ticker make them an undesirable candidate to you or are you simply trying to galvanizegenerate some antigoon sentimentwhat are your feelings toward the contributions of csms that did boast a goon presence and how do you feel they compare overall to the quality of csms without the goon presence what about other goonsourced community contributionsi hope youll forgive the provocative nature of this post ive been trying to be evenhanded in my questioning but ive also been trying to avoid the temptation of posting in threads by people who already players offer strong support but your reasons for posting this thread are unclear to me and i just want to understand your motivations as a candidate for posting this thread
the chair has absolutely no power other than opening sessions btw just sayingit doesnt matter what tag a candidate wears what matters is how they behave and the contribution they have to makei have no problem with goonswarm hell i have bee stickers on my fridge im more concerned with candidates who preemptively call half the other idiots or morons chances are these people are going to have to work togetherif one wants to debate one should debate issues priorities knowledge experience track record of a candidate if one is so inclined calling names is never a good idea and certainly not insulting others it says a lot about a candidate that they think their programprioritiesvalues do not stand enough on their own that they feel they have to bash others to look better by biased comparisonthere have been more than one instance of productive goons in the past csms there have also been blatant attempts at tilting the proposals towards gameplay changes that would benefit them above all which in my view is bad p goons play the game like everyone else in their own unique style one that needs to be represented but there should be a difference between game style and the csm the csm is not pvp its a venue to foster changes and improvements give feedback its not the characters its collaborative effort of the players behind the charactersabove all else one should vote for candidates who can work with others especially with people who hold different points of view for thats what the vast majority of the time is going to be spent on discussing differences the ironic thing is some nongoon candidates that are running would probably do a better job at defending goonswarms game than some of the goons running
i was quite amused when mittanis apparent alt described you as a higherfunctioning autistic i guess the comment was phrased with a certain level of mental health jealousy
right i agree that there is a lot of mudslinging going on but i feel that this time around there is a reenforced effort to sling mud at candidates with the wrong ticker and this concerns me the csm isnt supposed to be about party politics but that doesnt preclude block politics and its clear that the goonblock is fighting trebortrebors answer appears to be to passively fend off goon candidates by endorsing others and that worries me so my interest is to better understand those positions but i like to ask these questions aggressivelyjade i cant determine if youre calling me a mittani alt or if youre referring to some other poster if you are i guess i could try to prove that im not but then i dont necessarily mind that the image my posting conjours up is some old retired fart who yells on the internet and i doubt any attempt short of posting time stamped pics would satisfy you so ill keep it trite whose alt are you p
i imagine that is quite true
of course not the campaign is totally divorced from the regular work of the csm and i will base my opinions about a delegate solely on how productive they are for example whatever his personal opinion of me may be once helen highwater was able to devote time to the csm he did good work
meissa anunthiel suggested that the chair has very little power and i understand that you were once the chair could you use some of your experience on the csm to explain to the players who will be voting what your experience as the chair was like i think players in general would like to better understand the scope of the job so we can appreciate why its been so heavily politicized
thank you for your quick and candid response trebor i wish i could summon players to a thread id like to better understand why helen who was voted in was unable to contribute their more of their time to the csm id assume that delegates would appreciate the experience more but just as with realworld politics i suppose you might have a variety of commitment from different sourcesbut i appreciate your statement on their contributionthe goonblock v trebor campaign is a hot topic on the forums and one of the draws to the game for me at the beginning were the politics of war to the layman it reads like a futuristic space action novel except the parties involved often have ridiculous names
it doesnt have a great deal if any actual power but unless the chair can be considered honest and hardworking its possible that some harm can be done to the process in this current election its a symbolic gesture that the goons would like to take the chair position to make a point about their role in the game as a power blocafter all its likely that the coming session will involve potential alterations to 00 mechanics and might impact the bottom line of the spacealliances seeking their candidates election the jump bridge logistics argument is pretty important to the spaceship emperors out thereon balance though its better to have more candidates elected from an independent perspective than it is to control the chair 2 votes are better than 1 even if the 1 does come from the chairpersonso speaking personally id rather see mittani take the chair at the cost of an extra hardworking independent making it onto the council if forced to make the choice
ultimately ccp is free to listen to their own whims based on practicality and simply what makes sense incarna for instance is here to stay after five years of development or whatever and countless amounts of capital burnedpersonally i think someone like trebor is motivated at making good things happen hes been criticized for coming up with and voicing bad ideas which im not going to comment on i dont think its appropriate to judge possible execution based on concept and i certainly dont want to do so here but that concept needs to be informed i do agree that trebor has shown the motivation to push an idea that hes behind so that it reaches some form of realization and he is willing to do the labour that people find menial  i get that hes committed and those are the strengths he brings with him the problem i have with him as a candidate is that im seeing a lack of ideas that come from trebor himselfnow i dont mind admitting that ive probably missed things in some of the other candidate threads ive asked for solid examples of supported items vs successes its too easy to take advantage of the discourse through forum trolling for example than it is to hold er empirical evidence in your hand and say im not here to tell you that you suck this is documented proof that says that they suckthis is why i keep positioning myself as the uninformed mass i need useful information positive and negative and demand it to be spoonfed to me i have that right though people want our vote and i think its their job not only to tell me why but also to show me why
be careful what you wish fori didnt attend many of the early meetings in csm 5 for a variety of reasons the most pertinent was that i was actually pretty ill and spent a lot of time in and out of hospital thanks to a very sudden and rather scary heart problem additionally i was third alternate to begin with i later ended up as first alternate following ankhs removal and tambers resignation and from my experience in csm 4 the third alternate rarely got to do much at the online meetings so the csm meetings were a lower priority than they had been in csm 4 regardless of my attendance at meetings though i kept up with the other work of the csm and contributed to the discussions that were held on the forums and via email ive mentioned before that the meetings are almost the least important things that the csm does  despite the fact that they are the most visible thing that we do i cant vote at a meeting unless a full delegate is absent initially i couldnt vote unless three delegates were absent but i can bend the ear of someone who can vote at any time prior to the meetingas soon as i became first alternate i stepped up my meeting attendance dramatically because it became far more likely that id be able to contribute to the proceedingsregarding trebor and the original topic of the thread i have an opinion on trebors effectiveness as a csm candidate that i did not intend to be published outside of the goonfleet forums i was saddened and angry when i saw that courthouse who btw isnt a mittani alt hes a mrchi director had reposted my words for bringing that tone into the campaign i apologise trebor is a hardworking and conscientious csm delegate but i feel that he often simply doesnt understand the ramifications of the topics hes often passionately discussing this in my opinion makes him a poor choice for a candidate despite his other undeniable strengthsone of the unfortunate things about being an adult is that you cant always choose who you have to associate with and so despite my feelings on trebors opinions i work with him and with other members of the csm with whom i have disagreed there was a point during the initial drafts of the incarna letter where trebor and i were going around in circles on the edit and talking past each other trebor contacted me privately to cool the situation down and as a result we were able to reach an agreement rather than continue to argue over semantics i appreciated that even though i disagree with almost every opinion that he holds
i dont altpost vov meissa and seleene are both fine candidates who i get along with smashingly for what its worth i have no problems with them being on the council
edit hi mittani im going to but your thread laterhelen i greatly appreciate you taking time to clarify things personally i believe that the csm would benefit from enabling the alternates more recognition in the spirit of opposition days  where they can briefly introduce their own perspectives i hope youre better and appreciate you explaining some of your personal stanceand for what its worth i feel that trebor mischaracterized your early contributions i think most voters would agree that being number 3 in line toward being president for example would make you a rather unlikely candidatei feel that applying the style of politics appropriate for a community is unfair particularly if its a private forum which is how i can accept posts on scrapheap challenge or respectively something awfulcom which appears to be semiprivate but i disagree with politics posts being mirrored from private forums mittani knows how to get his people out and im as does trebor internet communities differ and so to the processes that initiate activism within those internet communitiesone of the things that i found damaging to the public side of the discourse was trebors promise to pay out eve isk to whoever finds the most effective channel of getting his name out hes already well known and so it seems not only redundant but its evolved into a backdoor way of damaging the debate mittani has directly attacked competitors but at least hes knocking on the door before taking a wrecking ball to the speakers corner and he appears to be keeping his venom in the cab of his vehicle of mass destruction hes not paying his supporters and so they appear more genuine to mei guess what im saying is that despite your overall friendly everyday player demeanour it appears that you are unintentionally sabotaging the debate trebor i cant ask you to stop people who genuinely agree with your stance and are fervent to express it but in the interest of good faith would you consider removing the billionsisk bounty

dont let your focus on mudslinging let you be distracted from answering my question to youdo you not understand the mechanics of the csm or did you lie in your thread
welcome back to the mudpit madama more adept individual may have noticed that i am not even in goonwaffe and as a director in merch industrial and alliance diplomat for goonswarm federation i am privileged to work with mittani on a regular basis the research and analysis of trebors capacities are original research the conclusions were my own as well tootles

i have received a few messages from other capsuleers saying that i needed to get a web page up and a campaign going they had read my campaign message and like what they saw because i was like them so here it goesi am not a politician i am a person like you or anyone else in new eden i have a life out side of eve and as much as i would like to spend all day exploring wormholes and working the 3 ms mining missions and manufacturing i have to tend to my real life i think there are a lot of people like you and me in new eden the people that come here to escape the demands of life to become that explorer and adventurer that the our normal lives dont allow us to be we look forward to that hour a night after the kids have gone to bed and our spouse or significant other is watching tv or reading a book that time when we can become the captains of our own battleships and fight pirates and other scourges of the universe i love my time on eve and i am grateful that ccp brought together the talent to create a universe where i can escape the monotony of paying bills and filling out tps reports and watching my cubical mates steal my red staplerbut i think ccp has forgotten that as much as we want to live in new eden some of us have to spend more time on earth i appreciate some of the new ships and missions and many of the new features that have been introduced since i started playing just before exodus was released but in all the upgrades and forums ships and features can be a bit overwhelming when you cant get on every day and keep up with all of the new things i can image it is a bit much for the newbs as well i am not against progress and upgrade i love it but i think eve has gotten to the point that a capsuleer cant survive in new eden unless they are in a corp and they cant experience all that eve has to offer if their corp is in an alliance im not saying that corps and alliances need to be done away with i just think ccp needs to do more to maintain the ability for people to be independent spirits the introverted rogues of space that wander and do their own things the han solos of the old republic if you willi also feel that ccp needs to reevaluate its role as god over new eden god created the universe and man created his own troubles i dont think ccp needs to regulate and define every little rule and nuance of what happens in the universe let man be man let us learn that if you are going to go into 00 space in a probe you are going to get ganked i went into a wh a couple days ago and was having a great ole time cleaning up a pack of sleepers i got caught unaware and got podded was i ed a little but i laughed at myself for being so dumb and not clearing out when i new there was trouble when the first player ship appeared thank god for clones and insurance geico of new eden can save you 15 on battlecruiser insurance when i started in eve there were pirates everywhere and gatecamps were a way of life now they seem to have died off i have read various theories as top why this is allied groups cleaning them out loss of interest but the one that i dont like is the claim that ccp punished them concord is there to police the stars let concord do what it was created to do ccp can control the universe let man control man i am not a pirate nor will i ever be one but i think the loss of the pirate corps has taken a bit of the adventure away from eve that i found appealingi know my message is a bit mixed but that is what i think you can agree with me or not but i want to know what you think i know i am under informed so inform me what do you want to see in new eden what dont you want to see in new eden there is a lot of talk about station missions and walking around i see the advantages ad disadvantages of this what do you think what do you wantif i can serve on the csm i want to represent you not me
its csm 6 bromaha bit late if you want to be on csm5how can i trust you to change the game if you cant even readin all seriousness interesting platform but i dont think you understand the csm as an entity  it is not an engine of change it is a sounding board for people to say no thats ed whenever ccp pulls a ccp and suggest how they might change it besides you dont seem to know what youre fighting for before going into the election which worries me alot also you seem like a hisec carebear so vovgood luck in the election

do you find yourself as a pvpcombat pilot with default mining or industry skills or perhaps you are a miner with default gunnery  turret skills i propose that a simple and slight change be made to the skill system that allows players to not only inject skills but to uninject skills as well once the uninject tab is selected a caution window should pop up to inform the player that the skill will be uninjected once the skill is deleted off the players skill sheet it will remain in a standby window for 24 hrs after 24 hrs the player can finalize the deletion similiar to character deletions players would not get back sp this would not change game play or affect the main game it would slim down jumbled skill sheets and decrease clone costs please comment
no it really wouldntdo you mean drop a skill and get the sp back why would that make sense and how would that not be a huge change to gameplay
i have to agree with danika on this
totally agreeing i fail to see how it would not be the worst possible thing
lol sorry for the confusion no you would not get back sp that is why it is a minor change it is a functional change very small
i dont know why everyone went high and right on this nothing was said about sp being reembursed this has nothing to do with skill points stay focused on the topic at hand
so what youre suggesting is you should be able to unlearn skills without getting the invested sp backthen my question iswhy would you want such an option
those who would want such an option would be anyone who doesnt want a jumbled list of useless skills that the player has no intention of training
ive got a few skills i wouldnt mind getting rid of and cant think of a simpler solution even a hide skill checkbox would be harder to implementsupported
sense does make not this
oh great another pointless destructive option on right click genius it should be put on the context menu right between train now and train after current skill too why not it just makes sense
i do not see the point i usually do find the point too
you really should stop bumping if its a good idea itll stay afloat on its own filling it with literally a full page of bumps just makes you the op look badthat said while its a good idea the problems with it have already been covered theres no way you can justify slowing the whole game down whenever a big fleet engagement goes down and the only other solution is to somehow prevent the metagaming since time has slowed down in that system only they just need to call their alliance in and wait for reinforcements as said this can be done by preventing jumps but then this kind of ruins the strategy of having vanguards  basically youre forcing the attackers to either commit their full force or only part of it since they wont be able to reinforcebut heck what am i saying its all been covered in this thread probably dozens of times already
yes i do believe those comments were made and i do believe that both were met with counters that logically solved them without any game breaking situations in fact i believe they actually started to achieve what ccp wants from large scale fleet fight  reinforcements and that was a broken up engagement consisting of the main fight with smaller secondary fights in surrounding systems
if its a good idea itll stay afloat on its own  i wish that would be true but my real life experience tells otherwiseanyway statistics 8651 of players live in empire 1107 in nullsec and 242 in wspace source  qen q3 2010 eveonlinecomcommunityqenqenq32010pdf so i believe it could be said that only 10 of all players have regular experience with big fleet battles im not sure how fw fares never dit that to simplify things  90 of people that watch assembly hall arent really hurt by lag and it aint medialized enough to make them care so they dont care example i know nothing about what eunuchs want i dont care about them and i dont hear about themand i dont care about homosexuals either  but i surely hear about themmy point is we have to keep reminding that lag exists to people that dont experience just like we are reminded that homosexuals exist even when we are heterosexualsi keep reminding this thread in alliance and fleet and local channels im part of nc and live in lsjep and i keep bumping this thread so that it is vissible if you have other suggestions how to medialize this thread im listeningstatement im not homophobic or anything like that as long as the people in my fleet keep the cap chain up and leave the wrecks for me i like them and if im not the only one with full rack of salvagers i hate them not caring for their religioussexualpolitical orientation
there has to be more detractors or something that can say their piece
i personaly never really thought of the different ships as in different teirs when i first started playing eve i more thought of them as a different hull with a different role  and i think thats how they should be in the first place with relitively different stats and miniral reqs for the different hull types based on size of ship and what it is designed for like more combat oriantated ships would require more megacite due to it being used more in weapon systems and so on and so forth
i like this idea and the neg posts have no standingfof weapons are not what they are namedthey should be renamed very bad bad missiles that are no good and should be recalled and possibly discontinuedalso why do serpents deal 75 dmg and hydras deal 25 dmgshouldnt heavy missiles deal more than small missiles while small and fast frigates should be made faster and smaller to actually dodge the missile completely not negate the blast dmg into a state of dumbmissions need to be made more complex obviouslysmallcruiser ships need buffs i dont know about anything bigger than a battlecruiser so that doesnt mean buff the drake or buff the apocalypsekill 2 pirates collect reward could be changed to1 scan for pirate base with astrometric probes scanning for ships and wrecks is made easier obviously 2 fly to pirate base and investigate investigating means use the archeologycodebreaker or roid scanner or cargo scanner to search objects i think ships need more medium slots when we start making realisitic missions 3 kill all hostiles that attack you4 retrieve the mission thingy and return to base5 bonus mine the roids salvage the hulls of derelict spacestationsghost ships steal the secret blue prints from the central computer or other general industrial ways of making moneys increase the techindustry of your faction while decreasing the numbers of the enemy pirate faction
trolling comment removed  adidai shall deign to give you some more information on my use of them until two days ago i had never used them i regularly run exploration sites in highlow sec and as a lot of the ships in these sites are frigscruisersdestroyers the amount of time spent locking them is proportionatly more than say a level 4 mission in my trusty tengu i decided to experiment to see if the locking time could somehow be negated by loading up hydra fofs the whole point of my post is that when they do operate and target ships they work wonderfully well and save quite a fair bit of time locking npcs even taking into account the lower damage output however because more often than not they have a tendency to go for lcss the time saving achieved in blasting away the small crap is eliminated when they go for every bunker radar post or brothelmy retort to you sir is that you obviously havent used them or even considered a response beyond a typical troll reported
see above this has nothing to do with missions and all about making an intended weapon system actually viable
i think perhaps you went a little offtangent with the rest of your post but thanks for the support perhaps you could check the support box too
fair enough fof missiles arent what theyre named theyre if anything foae missiles foe or anything elsei would suggest you read up on the subject matter the fof missiles are based around identification friend or foe infofof are a combat system designed to partially defeat ecm then have never been designed for pve the guidance system mechanic targets anything thats not blue friendly so yahh it will hit structuresif youre flying round in a tengu revise ur fit andor your subsystems to give u that extra mid to fit a sebo not  and moan to change a system thats not designed to do what you specifically wantthis whole thread is a complete cascadefail
no because this is a game and as we know eve bears little relation to realitysays who sourcetrolling comment removed  adidaa bit like you perhaps now why couldnt you have posted something worthwhile initially instead of making you look like stupid and juvenile you seem to be somewhat polite and reasonably articulate in your proposal threads  i would expect the same for here
if their defense is that fof shouldnt let people fly their drakes into plexes and press the 6 missile group button then perhaps missions and npc mobs be made a little stronger rats have like 50150250hp while typical players have almost anywhere from 1000100000hp shieldshullsarmorsupgrades includedstronger rats harder missionstougher missions better reward buymake tougher shipsbetter battle physics could be implementedartillery deal splash dmg dmg to nearby ships when bullet hitslasersautocannons effect velocitymaneuverability of ships when wingspropulsion are dmgedrailguns have the ability to pierce and pass through multiple ships on a single line of pathmissiles can be hacked and retargeted to hit friendlies by scramble fields be countermeasuredsmokeclouded back to their original launchpoint or far off course or be intercepted by defender rocketsstructuresasteroidsother shipsso infact fofs could hit collidable objects but only when the original ship target flies by them and puts the structure in their path fofs dont just whizz off to hit whatever rock or ruin is nearbywhich probably is not emenating heat or a spacial distortionwhenever you press the fire button
i agree with some of your ideas but i think that the gist of your post is beginning to move beyond the realms of this thread i think you should definitely explore this further though perhaps with a new proposal your first paragraph certainly bears repeating though i dont really want to make it possible so that the be all and end all of pve setups is a drake or what have you with 6 launchers and uber fof missiles  not at all i simply would like to see the ability to somehow prioritise targets for the missiles  fof missiles have quite a severe damage reduction compared to regular heavy missiles and seriously think that this is appropriate and maybe should even be reduced further if the ability to prioritise targets is implementedthere is some nice discussion here more please
i have some mixed feelings on this i do have concerns of imbalance that could occur gives a substantial disadvantage to nondrone ships it might be a way to boost gallente though without having to do too many numbers balancingi am going to go ahead and support this with hopes of getting more discussion out of it as a solution to the gallentehybrid issue rather than reanalyzing those numbersvote manalapan for csm show your support here and get free stuff
yess supported
draco llasa  robert weatherly indicated he will focus on hybrid balance vote him and hybrid users will have a voice in the csm
well in my opinion it is a simple choice if pve is your primary concern for the moment and you want guns go minmatar low signature hulls capless guns selectable damage types good damage projection and fast speed this way at least your shield skills are not wastet plus most minmatar ships use missiles as secondary armament this may be handy if you decide to explore an other facette of caldari playstyleand as a big plus minmatar guns really sound like guns i mean guns 
railguns and the mechanic behind it are fine the problem isnt the module itself the reason why railguns seem underused and underrated is because its not the simplest solution to logisticbacked fleet that are on the rise recentlyin the age where a shield buffered bsbc can be repped up by scimiesbassies the high alpha of arties is recommendedso in conclusion its not the railguns that need to be fixed
i dont belive you ever used or use them to say such a thingwy use rails when lasers or artys are much better in any situation if not give me an example where rails are better because ive tested almost everythingsituation to make them spit something close to lasors or artys and i cant so please enlight mewy use blasters with ridiculous engagement distance when pulses or auto canons are far better in any situationi think about 3 possible answersthe guy is a noobthe guy is a masochistthe guy is just stupidor the three all together so whats the troublethe shield fleets logistics typeweapon systemsure wy would you use ex100 fail railguns when you can do the job with ex20 arties or ex25 lasors ships wy the hell should gallente pilots use artys or acs on gallente huls loosing dps bonusbecause they hit harder better dps projection bigest numbers etc etc comprendeyoure one of the best trolls on this thread has all the non gallente pilots who post here or like some minmatar pilots giving fitting lessonstake your drake away from this thread

does that have any chance i wonder if it is illegal anywhere to make a program like that its not malware like ur general trojan or something
200 read this yet only 8 supports how hard is it to hit a tick box for support and click post reply most of us who are affected by this issue have given up looking in the forums for help and id wager most dont visit the assembly hall very often so this proposal needs the support of the general community whether you are affected or not there is nothing here to oppose and many eve players could certainly use this proposed option cmon capsuleers we all love eve or we wouldnt be playing it and nobody wants to get locked out due to a noningame feature at least not currently could really use your support on this before its too late
i would like to think this issue is being looked atworked on either way this is one idea on the table and it is an issue that needs to be addressed i support this
supported
agreed
supportedwhile i dont have any issues w the cc i would hate to be in that position
the reason for the lack of replyes is becouse everyone is waiting for the new forums to go live a like quick is so much easierbecause of the wait now for the new forums until after fan fest you should be getting more thumbs up now
definitely i had no problems with the cc but dont want anyone who should be able to but couldnt to be locked out of the game through something that was not their fault hardware wise

what if requirements for smallmedium smartbombs was reduced by 5066sort of solves the ecm drone problem for the subbc hulls by providing a usable counter allows ccp to ignore the issues with ecm for another cycle so should be a slam dunk no

in all fairness the missions forum should remain open to them
posters or toasters considering the nonsensical nature of the idea i presume the latternull posters generally behave like brats spoiled children of a working single mom personal attacks mudslinging tantrums et al is the standard for the most partthe only difference between coad and the rest of the forum is that null has to reign in the urge to be idiotsrestict null posting to coad with special dispensation available for the few intelligentcordial individuals
supported this thread shows why
while i do think that post quality could improve i do not think the op should be a leading example
and just how do you propose the forums would know who is a hisec resident maybe posters here should have to pay a fee over and above the regular subscription fee that everyone pays to play the game and which includes access to post in all of the forums makes as much sense as the ops idea not supported and ironically should be classified with the ops suggestion of needing better posters

you are utterly underestimating the level of automation that can be achieved with a simple program as long as there is an algorithm on the other side it can be figured out by experienced people and either circumvented or automated within mere daysthat said the more randomness a process includes the harder it will be to bot it the key is to find the right randomness and that requires outsideofthebox thinking point a lazer at it and do x and profit will just not cut it
making the belts require scanprobes to find may also help it would be more difficult to write a bot that quickly probes down scan hitsexample a new kind of scan probe is introduced called the specialized grav probe or something it only finds grav sites but also finds special grav sites other probes cant find each of these special sites has one rock in it like real asteroid belts the asteroids are spread out but they are very numerous and easy to find with the right equipment scan down your rock warp in nom it look for a new rock now miners are engaged at keys all the time mining is more interesting miners dont have to sit exposed in the same place for long stretches of time and bots have a tough time emulating themdownside fightclub pvpers dont have a belt one to gather at for pew any more though i suppose planets could suffice needs more work obviously
sure nz isnt a third world country sure there are plenty of other causes to donate to yet still the red cross are taking donations to aid the people there who are suffering they seem to think theres a need for aid there and quite frankly i would take their word for it as they are some of the ones on the ground helping outit doesnt matter whether youre black or white rich or poor  being squashed by falling buildings is pretty ing traumatic and having your house destroyed is pretty damn devastatingas for the csms bandwagoning on this you will note that i as the op and most of the other csm candidates supporting it are from new zealand we would like to be able to support our friends and neighbours in their time of need regardless of any csm election
supportedi dont support the uninformed bs being promulgatedthings are actually pretty squalid on the ground and likely to stay that way for a while
to whitfor a start off what the op forgot to mention is that the feb 22 earthquake was an aftershock of one that occured last september that earthquake cost 455 billion usd this one is tipped to costaround 15 billion usd  for a total of 20 billion 15 of new zealands gdp compare that to hurricane katrina the united states costliest disaster which weighed in at a mere 65 of gdpalso i feel compelled to point out that the destruction in christchurch is being compared to that in haiti by people that were involved in both quakesincidentally  how many people realized that the us accepted donations from afghanistan and kenya in the wake of hurricane katrina
little known fact the maximum peak ground acceleration pga measured during the haiti quake was around 05g the maximum pga measured during the christchurch quake  despite only being a magnitude 63  was 22g this represents some of the most violent shaking ever measured in any earthquake anywhere and would have utterly decimated many other populated areas around the worldthe death toll is only as low as it is because most buildings didnt collapse outright due to high engineering standards but thousands are damaged at levels beyond safe occupation nonetheless and much of the city will need to be rebuilt from scratch anyway in the meantime thousands of people are now homeless andor are faced with very third world living conditions in the absence of electricity water and waste systemsits easy for me to support this since i was there and i went through some serious  that i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy ingame or rl ive lost my car my home possibly my job and my injured knee is still giving me trouble and i know im one of the lucky onesbut to put things in perspective i dont think its worth doing as another oneoff event id like to see this and any other such plex drive in the future to be part of a more permanent rolling plex donation feature where ccp would nominate a different charity every month or so and anyone could feel free to donate to that cause or not
thanks for lending your personal perspective to this cause ben sorry to hear that you got caught up in the eventre your suggestion i would agree or even go one further and provide a mechanism for people to donate plex to a range of causes or even the cause of the players choice although that would be a push administratively it would get a lot of in game currency changing hands and provide players with the opportunity to use in game resources to make a real world difference
the reason ecm is so much greater than tracking disruption target painting and sensor dampening is because the ships that receive bonuses for ecm get a much more superior  bonusits almost pointless to fit ecm on a ship that doesnt have a specific bonus whereas you can fit a td sd or tp on any ship and have almost the same effect as the so called specialized recon ships5025 optimal disruption default6281 optimal disruption pilgrimcurse3 ecm strdefault 75 ecm str falconrookim not sure of a solution if this even appears to be a problem to the rest of you it does to me
not supported increase optimal disruption bonus instead and give falconrook the 2nd neut bonus that pilgrimcurse have otherwise its too op
so your proposal is nerfing the other ewar modules to a point where they are only effective on the specialized hulls and need lowslot support modules
ecm is like that because it is so intensly full of win that it needs some fail in order to not be unbalencedthe other ewar types have less win so they are compensated by having less fail this is balencingfalcon and rook are already used more than any other recon ship because they have the only ewar that can turn a one sided gankfest into a gankfest in the other direction anyone who says hed prefer a pilgrim to a falcon needs to lay off the boostersewar is fine the way it is no buffsnerfs needed
like i said i dont have a proposal i was just bringing it to everyones attention that there is an imbalanceyou cant say not supported then offer a solution thats contradicting yourself rofl
so in other words youre saying the falcon is better and its balanced that way 
three things first if you dont have a proposal then why did you post this in the assembly hallsecond numbers being different  imbalancethird this is a terrible thread
the imbalance lies in curse and pilgram having 2 ewar bonuses instead of just one they should give them higher tracking disruption bonus and remove neut bonus that way its balanced
sorry read this thread and somehow associated it with a thread that asked for energy neut bonuses on rooks and falcons thought this again and proceeded to beat it down thoughtlesslysorry
we have carriers then we have cruiser logis nothing in between proposing bs logi for t2 version of tier 3 bs hulls cruiser logis lack hp and get butchered in incursion sites unless you manage to fit a 1600mm plate carriers cant go into site
interesting here is a complaint where someone believes that our current logi ships are too weak and thus a newer beefier class of logi ships is required i wonder what do you think about this guys charge that the current logi ships are nigh unkillablealso this is a rehash of the thread i just linked just different wording and character posting itnot supported
yeah cant support this cruisers are the support sized hulls with a couple of bs exceptions ie tier 1cruiser logis can have decent hp and spider tank unless youre doing it wrong so shouldnt get butchered in incursionsif you really want bs logi use a domi or form the classic rr bs fleet
to be honest i dont think even capitals should have rr bonuses nvm bses
lrn2fit your logis a guardian can easily fit a 1600mm plate 4 large remote reps a large energy transfer and a medium energy transfer and it will have an excellent tank made even more effective by its small sig and afterburneryou you are fitting abs on them rightprotip acr rigs are your friend
i think the op is a basilisk pilot like myself ive personally found the ehp on those things to be lackingin my opinion the proposed battleship logi should be very similar in repping capability to the cruiser sizes but they need a lot more tankif youre having a hard time killing logis youre doing it wrong logi ships are easliy killed by arty sniper battleships energy neuts andor focus fire switching full focus between several targets will also overwork them enough that they might let their repairs on each other slip especially if they are in charge of more than ten ships when they can rep that much you really shouldnt focus on dps because you wont break the tank that way you have to use huge alpha strikessleepers and higher level incursions have enough alpha to take down logi ships easily and theyre coordinated enough to pull off the moving primary thats why logis have a hard time with this stuff
overall not supported guardians as noted can fit a 1600 plate and a trimark for buffer 4 large reps and 2 large energy xfer if you know what your doing that will give you over 9k raw armor hp without fleet bonuses not to mention very good resists if you do it rightcan also be cap stable with only 1 energy xfer on you if you have logi 5

800mm plates allows guardian to survive easily in full aggro vanguards and most assaults 1600mm lets you survive headquarters but for moms you will instapop to one flight of fighters aggro there is nothing you can fit that will let you survive more than one volley of micro torps which hits perfectly on cruiser sig and cruiser ab speeds its been tested with 1600mm plate on max armor skill guardian plus ganglinks for armor sig and speed full fighter flight aggro  dead logi theres a reason people dont like to bring guardians to mom sites they get aggro and diefor highsec pvp you can bring in artys or just jam them noobs will keep finding reasons to whine in pvp no matter what and neut rr is a separate issue that needs to be addressed by itself
would it be possible to have another wallet for individual players i find personally that one wallet is not enoughit maybe ok for pvpers buy indy guys that set ptojects for themselves not corp would benefit from this to be able to allocate finds into this walletmay be charge for the extra account sort of 50 mil or something for admin fees in setting up the extra account with caldari business bank or something soo it can tie into the story line aswell djust a thought

this is a proposal to reuse the system scanning array in order to scan for cloaked ships the problem people away from the keyboard cloaking in systems gives them an advantage over people one can assume the afk cloaky isnt there and find out that they are there there really isnt a direct way to counter this possible solution to redo system scanning array that will work like regular combat probe scanning but giving it the ability to find cloaked ships in order to keep it fair so not every cloaked ship becomes useless by being scanned instantly here are some ideas for balancerequire certain sov level with i hub upgradehave a timed delay on online scanning module such as online  15min scan boot up  online and scanningrequire anchor v and a new skill on the same level as starbase defense managementor use that skill toohave it cycle through a pi or ice product item to keep in online and scanning kind of like siege mode i figure some of that would be good to have so the player cant just go to tower and turn on the scanning array to find the cloaky instantly so if someone does plan on a bop hot drop they got like 1530mins to do soor however else long and having the cycle timer would prevent the scanner from staying on 237 this way it gives the owner of the system a chance to get rid of afk cloakies since they can just sit there for however long they want to do a hot dropgank why should they be safe and have nothing directly to preventing them eve is about nothing being safe where ever you go thank you
easier and much more appropriate solution nerf local alreadywe need to fix the damn local chat for many reasons and afk cloakers is just one small issue this game would be so much better if we had proper scanner ranges such as 15 au sphere of scanning rather than arbitrary system wide player identification tool
ephemeron you appear to have totally missed the point removing local would make an afk cloaky more impossible to counter the sterling intelligence of black aces made manifest once morefew points on the opi think its a decent idea but the penalities had better be massive we all know alliances are rich unless it costs so much to online the scanner that its only worth running for an hour or so per day this whole idea wouldnt work making the module also extremely costly would be good and also very hard to transport essentially making it such a pain in the ass to useinstallpurchaseand runin principle i think this is a decent idea but if ccp doesnt do it exactly right it would end up being very game breaking and as some things like supercarriers can show ccp has a habit of accidently ruining everything
i completely understand the annoyances of afk cloakys but i would add that if scanning for cloakys becomes possible that it takes in to account the deficiencies of current probe mechanics in the sense that if you set up a ship to be unprobeable it should still be unprobeablei would add though to this that cov ops cloaks should get a sig radius percentage penalty when onlined even when not activated so that cov ops cloak fitted ships could possibly be scanned out where as unprobeable ships without cloaks couldntthis would have the effect of former afk cloakys now not fitting the cloak but flying an unprobable fitting would be unprobeable and that cloaked afks with just a normal setup 1 cloak would be remotely probeable requiring maxxed skills and a multitude of bonusesas an intelligence tactic a fit on the same ship with the covops cloak offlined would be unprobable but scanable on dscan providing that afk red in system alarm bells etc situationthe same fit when the cloak is onlined would be remotely probeable but more usefull at intel gatheringif and only if probing cloaky ships becomes possible it should be a reserved ability with maxxed lvl5 probing requirementsmax skills ship bonuses module bonuses and probe bonuses should be the minimum requirement to scan out frig sized cloaked signatures
forgive my noobness but what is the actual reason that afk cloaked ships are bad honestly if they are afk what advantage do they actually gain  they arent actively playing cloaky ships have a built in counter if they can fit a cov ops cloak they already do terrible dps if they fit an improved cloak they nerf their scan res and lose the instant lock abilitiy of the cov ops pilot  am i missing something
nope you havent missed a thing in fact youve concisely pointed out why cloaking afk or otherwise is working as it shouldif you have a hostile cloaky ship in your system get together with your corpalliance mates and go about your business as usual if they uncloak to attack you smash them to bits sometimes the best counters are the simplest
bbut what about the 00 person who cant be askedbothered to endure the hassle of setting up a defensive fleet what about his solo playstyle why are you using logic logic has no place here they should be able to kill anything that enters their system no questions asked rabble rabble rabblesarcasmnot supported grow a spine and adapt your shipstactics to the threat like everyone else
think he may be referring to cloaky t3s or cov ops that jump into a system uncontested and then sit afk cloaked for up to an hour or more while the defence fleet scurries around achieving bugger all then pops a core probe or scans sanctums and havens out and either s out of the blue solo or pops a cov ops cyno and murders sum1 with his buddiesits a genuine  with an entire system tactic that works if you get a rep in any area of null sec space
he may well be but my comment still stands as it is
it would just result it that module becoming a must have like jammers and bridgesall you need is the ability to send a ping that reveals all objects to regular probes makes it useless without probing support and wont hurt legitimate cloakers as much as a permanent decloak like that which you suggesthas to be a separate pos module or similarly exposed so that it can be knocked out
no the idea is utter crap along with all the other anticloaking whine threadsgas this threadtia
in wormspace afk cloaking doesnt work well since its primarily a tool of terror and psyops remove local and the problem is gone  they must actually take action to prove they are still there yes lack of local makes cloaky attacks more likely to succeed when they attack but it also makes locking down a system with an afk person very difficultalso if you wanted to propose a sov upgrade that allowed some sort of system scanner sweep to reveal local momentarily at the cost of pos resources id be behind that 
like the above posters thoughts on this although im not too sure local will dissapear but having a delayed local list would be good much like some chat channels having delayed chat member listsyou could have a reduced delay dependant on sov and no local chat on contestedunclaimed systemsafk cloakies are really an issue when theyre in fleet formation systems as afk cloakies would be reporting numbers in systems cloaked off grid somewheredelayed local wouldnt stop this kind of intel just require the cloakies to be somewhere on grid to fleet formup loactions reporting overview numbers which tbh would still be relatively safe
changing fitting requirements on the weapons system would make part of the weapons systems rebalancing but the ships too need a close look to their bonus so wy not work the pgcpucap recharge on the ships but not bothafter a few tests ive changed my mind on the plates instead of these i work the resists and energised regenerative platings seems to work quite well but i still got trouble with pgcap with the sucking armor repper system while the same ship with a full shield bufferresists i have no trouble at all or need of any cap injector patheticwhat all those gallentehybridsblasters threads learnd me is this ccp will make no changes to gallente or if they do you must wait untill the pretty graphics show them no one starts gallente chars wich will never happenlearnd me that the absense of any coment from them just means that they dont care at all since youll crosstrain anyway one day or another so this kind of rebalance is on the bottom list and its not important the fact that you still pay your account shows youre happy enough with their choiceby the way this choice is intended so youll buy another account train another race char etc  profitis it better on other games i dont care if its better or worst i play eve and the fact is that their comtemptuous attitude versus costumers and threads about this matter is just despleasing they dont care at all
ive never understood why blasters paper dps goes down when you change from neuts tbh are the longer ranged blasters to ions shortest ranged its completely backwards imho when listening to the whole blaster ideologys
are you proposing this as a flat boost to all blaster sizes because blasters problems are much less pronounced on the frigate scale and this could lead to further balance problems

new ccp tweet15k pilots43 of eligible pilots already voted for the csm6 elections up from 134k votes at the same point last electionthis is freakin awesome  the level of support that this election is getting is just enormous
not all the candidates are on thiscan candidates still get on this or is it closed
ahoy dierdrayou have send me an invite to your tooland i looked at it a few days agonow while im sure that this did cost you quite a bit work i will not add myself to iti dont want to suggest you would do such thing on purpose since i know you put in alot work for the community but the tool is just not neutral enough the questions are mostly stuff that the eve blogger scene is posting about and another large chunk is stuff from the forums here  while the contents of the campaigns of some candidates are not covered properlyi feel no matter what i answer the set of questions does not allow me to show why i want people to vote for mealso when promoting such a tool which should be neutral you might want to rethink endorsing specific candidates in the bio of the character promoting it otherwise it looks strange
perhaps new questions could be suggestedall surveys are biased due to the nature of the beast how you represent yourself through the survey is up to you note that ripard teg and mike azariah have commented extensively about their answerssome of the questions are obviously loaded others are missing nerf super carriers is missing for example it is up to the candidates to position themselves in the space mapped out by the survey what nondrone compounds are there that factor in the resource generation of the gamebut i feel there are questions that are important which were not asked and the slant of the questions tends to imply that people think the csm has driving power rather than a share of steering powerthank you diedre for the site warts and all 
diedra some commentsi agree with the above posters that the questions with highest priority should be modified regardless of whether or not the csm members themselves actually are somehow wanting multiple most important sections a simple change to high priority instead of highest above and beyond all else will cause it to flow more also it makes those answering want to modify their answers so they make one higher than the otherin the comparison page could you please make the questions and your own answers on the left static is that the word not a web designer while the candidates list can be scrolled for easy comparison currently if i scroll the entire screen to far over to see the far right candidates i lose seeing what question i am on and what my own answers were so i have to keep scrolling back and forth to keep track
the questions were worded as highest in order to highlight the dilemma if you have to choose one feature over another would you because the csm does affect the priority of development and if the entire csm tells ccp we believe 00 is the single most important part of the game that may well become reflected in the priority ccp gives to 00 development it is important for voters to know which area of the game a candidate will most likely push forsome candidates like peter powers chose not to participate despite multiple evemails being sent to them sign ups are now closedi disagree that i  as a pilot  should be completely neutral because i make this website the website is transparent in its operation questions were simply chosen to be divisive and polarising and focus on the most popular issues of the moment this unfortunately means some people will feel misrepresentedi also disagree that the questions are biased or leading there is no right or wrong answer just a statement you either agree or disagree with and we see that all questions have people both agreeing and disagreeing with them for anyone not happy with this website youre welcome to make a better one yourself
thank you for this awesome tooli used it and then looked at what my personal keypoints were in regards to priorities and compare them with all csm candidates
thank you for running this service again dierdra i read some players concerns about votematch being rigged to influence their votes i can confirm them that as a candidate the answers displayed on this website are those i entered and were not tampered with in any way
thnx for this tool though i personally find its use limited it does send me in the right direction somewhat but im missing the extended ideas from the candidates it might be under the text balloon but the mouse over is not working for me though it does on the other mouse oversmy main issue is that though i agree that the industry side of eve needs alot of love especially the mining direction it does not mean thats my main voting point i do however end up with someone who is running almost completely on a carebear base he might have issues concerning ship balance and 00 developments but im pretty limited in viewing their complete stance on things i know i could go to their own portalswebsites to read their extended views on things but it would be usefull to be able to get it from the tool itself as said a more in depth answer on some issues could be under the balloon but thats not mousing over for medunno if im the only one ie80760016385the main thing im really feeling limited in is the extend of the questionaire sure i can agree that low sec needs development but in what way would my vote match with someone running since he could have completely different ideas about fixing it than i do even though i might agree with him on the base level i might totally not agree with the way he wants to handle things
good jobalso op excellent job bow
why are they now closed
great job certainly helps me to filter all the candidates however my vote wont just go to the person with the highest match which is 76 as i try not to vote someone whos terribly unlikely to make it to a seat anyway
i either allow candidates to fill inchange their profile or allow users to vote match if i were to do both candidates could try to change their answers to tailor them to what they perceive are the answers most likely to give them high match percentages as well as preventing me to get accurate metrics on the answersmatching after the elections as data then may not necessarily be equal to the data during the electioncandidates were given a week to fill in their profile and received a reminder mail on top of the initial evemail urging them to make their profile some have obviously chosen not to do this which is entirely their call
a week seems a short time how do you know they even read the evemailalso my question is why is it now cut off not describe the cut off deadline it seems pretty arbitrarysince it is clear at this point the dierdra vaal is not accepting all the candidates submissions i would ask that it be unstickied its not fair that ccp stickies the views of some candidates and not others if all the candidates can contribute to this and arbitrary deadlines that may have been enforced in a biased way are not preventing anyone from submitting their views then i have no objection to the sticky
i think i can answer that simplyif you cant bother to check your mails during a candidacy campaign how the hell are you gonna manage when you even get elected to represent peoplefirst thing i always do on all my accounts when logging in is check mails my corpmates know this and they know they can talk as much as they want my mails firstas to the cut off equally simple candidates has sufficient time to respond and fill out the form if they cant be bothered to either read their mails or fill out a form why would others bother to keep everything opena service was offered to those who didnt get onto the form they for some reason didnt take up the offer and as such arent includedsimple enough
some players have real lives that sometimes may take them to places where they have no internet access for a week and some players have real lives that means they do not even log in every week im not sure that these candidates should automatically be ruled out and yeah maybe a candidate cant get to answering your set of 40 questions in under a week anyway im glad you have all sorts of time and log in checking your eve mail every day but that is not a requirement of a good candidatewhy do you think its a bother to keep it open the op never said it would be any sort of bother to allow those candidates to submit their views i think the op doesnt like the candidates who didnt submit their answers so decided he would close it ccp is giving this persons views of candidates he likes or doesnt like a top spot on the forum bottom line candidates were excluded from this not just peter powers btw and no good answer is offered as to why ccp knows that yet they are still going to give this persons biased website a top spot on the forum thats not how you run an unbiased election
i have to jump in here  as i explained i decided not to put myself on that tool because i think the selection of questions excludes people by ignoring their campaign topics in the questionsimho the time that candidates had to fill in their information to this tool was ok also its based on ccps schedule from announcement to voting etc if a candidate does not find the time in a week  which is the main campaign week thats a different subject and those candidates need to look at how important the hobby eve is to them and if they can actually spare the time that the csm will require from em if they are voted in
ill vote for the one who thinks we should be enabled to have a bloodlinerace change now whos the one
as someone actually running for csm ive never heard of this website before today ive also had no interaction with the owner and dont see why shes presenting this as some table of who you should vote for based on all of the csm candidates positions
oh how wrong you are the cut off date was set when i sent evemails to everyone regardless of which candidates did or did not fill in if youre campaigning for a seat on the csm and you cannot manage to check your evemails once during that week then im sorry but i have to enable voting before the election starts even now voters only had a day to use the website before voting opened personally i feel a week during a promotion period should be sufficient for any candidate who is serious about wanting to get electedif youre donating money to have the system rewritten so candidates can add a profile but not edit an existing profile during the voting period id happily give you my bank accountas for implying im excluding candidates i dont like is ridiculous since i really hope peter powers will get elected while theres several people who did make profiles whom i hope wont get electedyou received an evemail from me with your login details on 20110302 0031 you also received a reminder evemail 20110304 1341 ill happily provide screenshots of my sent folder 
if you had any idea how many evemails i get you would know why thats a bad way to reach out to peoplea forum post will always attract my attention why was this the first announcement of this project
im sorry you didnt pay attention to your evemails this is the first announcement of this project this election round there were announcements for the csm5 and 4 elections too because this is the part where it is useful for the community at large im a bit surprised none of the other 45 goons mentioned this to you the mittani was one of the first people to fill out his profile and im quite sure he too gets a lot of evemails
if i was in league with those other goons for this election im sure they would have mentioned it to me im not they didntsomething ive noticed in this game is that when someone runs a site from year to year they do eventually burn out i dont take for granted that a player will run anything again just because they have before
dvthis is the first time you indicated it would cost extra money how much extra would it cost to add a profile late who charges it and can you offer a link to what you are talking about i guess i question this because the first time i asked why you wont add candidates you said nothing about money it would seem that would be the obvious and easy first answer to my question if it were true my evemail is constantly blinking because of agents telling me missions expire or some garbage about insurance etc i and as you can see others that play this game do not always check their evemail checking your evemail is not a requirement to run moreover if someone came back from a business trip on the fifth day after you sent it it is not really reasonable to assume they will get right to it karland is yet another person that you seem to be excluding if youre saying it will cost more money to add new candidates explain this if you are just excluding them because you dont like them then that is something different ccp shouldnt be promoting your own agenda in this campaign
thanks for the tool  it helped as for the folks who did not respond to email you are a poor politician

last time i checked a dev and a csm are not the same job you might be trying to get the wrong job its a csms job to look at what ccp are going to put in the game or fix and say i like it or i dont like it we dont need all this stuff about what u wana change we just need to know if for certain topics or agaisnt them i am not trying to poo poo on you i agree with alot of what is posted here but lets be honest for a change 1 vote and stopp shooting my rattering toon
done good luck
who did you check with on that csm can represent the players however they want last i checked there were no rules where are you getting this information some other csm or csm candidate if you say why you like it or dont like it you are acting like a dev right if csm is not going to have any effect on the development of eve whats the point
voted good luck with the campaign shame about you missing the questionnaire maybe you should fill the answers to this thread
vote for you good luck prom
i believe in elise randolph
i would follow elise randolph to hell and back
in the last five months or so i have taken down about 130 towers in a safe estimation even with the ability to wield a formidable supercapital fleet i used dreads every single time mostly because fighter bombers rightfully cannot hit towers but that is besides the point also during allout capital brawls dreads are great tools for mediumskilled pilots to use and be effective in even last year if i were to classify dreads as mediumskilled id slap myself but with an aging eve community that is what they are becoming the fact that people use supers for a multitude of things is in a way good for reducing the number of active supercaps putting them into risky situations increases the chance that theyll be killed supers are killed on average nearly every other day nowthere is the perception that supercarriers are grossly overpowered with the notion that if a group drops a handful of these suckers it will swing the entire battle i dont know if thats necessarily the case really there is still a large risk associated with deploying them and if one were to simply drop a handful of regular carriers on a subcapital fight it would have the desired effect as well the ting about supers is if one is to lose the support battle even 20man gangs can take out stranded supers i know that rote knows what it takes to take supers down and you guys arent the biggest giants in eve either way with all things in eve there is room for balancing and change and the csm doesnt get to decide everything about it but i am experienced enough in using supercapitals to make smart decisions when the subject comes up
elise 4 csm he will lead ustz csm to greatness
so many great candidates this time but elise is still among those few im willing to give my votes for
id like to remind everyone that voting is open ill be holding a qa on sunday with the fine fellows at new eden radio 
i voted for elise randolph todayi am a proud member of the randolph party
what are your thoughts on updating the pos system to a more starbase like idea such as thiswhat about making 00 accessible to smaller groups than omgwtfpwnd alliancescan you expand more on your thoughts on low sec i honestly think its safer to be in 00 or jspace and i get more money and i dont get a standings hit if i decide to kill people there and even with the blueprint incentives on the low sec incursions any ship id bring in to work on an incursion would be one i wouldnt want to lose repeatedly to pirates because its more likely id get killed 10 times for every new shiny prize i got from an incursion even a t1 battleship is over 100 mil without fittings if you go into t2 or even t3 500 mil loss possibilities is going to require some pretty stellar benefits to overcome the major pirate detractor of low sec what are your thoughts on jspace content is there enough is it varied enough is it an aspect of gameplay that would benefit from improvement or is it good as iswith incarna are you of the variety of incarna can die in a fiery pit of death i like mah internet spaceships more than internet space people or the sounds pretty cool im excited to see what it has to offer since this seems to be something ccp is going to be focusing on for a while what kinds of suggestions do you see yourself making regarding this new track otherwise pl is hardly not a powerbloc
1 from me good luck
you just received 2 votes from me good luck
looking at the candidate who have only 231 kill records since 2007 with a darwin fit in losses have no experience in sov warfare but cares to give his opinion on a balance and 00 subject here and there for 4 csm terms by the way you was not in csm 2 and 4 you was an alt this makes me wander why we have this mess in in the game and what bright ideas of that was yours
voted for someone else as their platform interested me just slightly morebut if i could vote twice youd definitely be secondthough i do have an alt somewhere round here
because meissa is a command ship and logistics pilot i have no gun on my damnation why would i though i sometimes do put a civilian ac in there to  a mail just for people like you who think nondamage dealing ships have no role p when flying those i have other things to do than whoring mails also i have alts the main of which flies carriers and dictors both light and heavyconsidering the alliance i am a member of rooks and kings do you think if i was devoid of pvp value theyd still have had me inas far as me being alt in csm 2 and 4 i was indeed on purpose for csm 4 due to term limits do you know that alts participate in discussions and get to vote when a full member is absent which is the vast majority of the time or participate in the forum conversations that happen with the devs on the private forums among othersalso i never take credit for group efforts and the csm is very much a group effort i havent done that in any past elections and im certainly not going to start now you can see my argumentative contributions in the minutes or take the word of other csm members ones i quoted above or others that you may find in other threads or on shc for what happens in iceland
my 2 are in your favour  good luck
our chat confirmed my impression that you will invest time and effort into representing lowsec got my vote
four votes cast and a shameless bump for you good luck
of all the csm candidates id vote for mittens or krutojnow who should i choose
krutoj owns vote for him
i did listen to it and thoroughly enjoyed it im really looking forward to tomorrow
it is time to vote at last
put my three in good luck
i voted for the mittani and a brighter future
i havent placed my vote yet so i will sell it to you for 10 billion isk

ignore my english its not my first or even second languagewhen people vote vote for 1 of 4 main reasons vote for the party the candidate is in in this case corporationalliance 1 vote in a program 2 vote in the advantages he might bring them if he is elected 3 or just vote for the candidate 4 i normally like to vote for a candidate the other reasons are secondary to me if i do not find something to identify myself with in the candidate he will not get my vote so i need to examine the profile biography experience and the character of the candidate in our case i found a lot of information about biography and experience but i didnt have information about your character so i did something i pick up from my father job i profiled you we can learn plenty just by reading statements and texts that people write down its not a exact science and by no means im a professional doing this but for this purpose will sufficemost of the candidates profiles ive made are jerks to put it in a simple way many didnt show structure and coherent ideas i found some that reveal their own insecurities in rl in the campaign posts some are just selfdelusion were this is its more than a game its their entire life  these people need counselling and quickly omgabout your profiling i started with your campaign text excellent writing skills the correct use of words in specific places the arguments used are based in common sense what reinforces the ideas you want to transmit its obvious that you choose a very specific public 00 research it found its soft spot and went for the kill persuasion and manipulation 101 right there excellent you grab my attention and since that text left many answers of your profile open i went after more so i went after your posts in kugu and tenton i lost an hour reading your stuff the most impressive thing i discover is something rare among mmo players you dont display any signs on disinhibition effect that normally affects most of the mmo players  this means that you behave here in eve the same way you behave in rl that is a plus in your final scoreso what is your final score in my opinion you seem to be a very determined intelligent and successful man you are a very talented introspective writer you have charismatic speaking skills but a knack for manipulativebuilding opinions you seem to execute authority with moderation and common sense but when faced with something that might presents you a problem or a danger to your status position or way of thinking you dont blink and go for the kill without take in account consequences to others than yourself and that makes you a egocentric bastard you seem to behave in eve the same way you behave in rl soi totally identify myself with you you have my vote

hello mittania few questions you have raised the point of all expenses paid trip to iceland would you as an elected delegate decline to attend the summits in iceland and opt to telecommute from home you have mentioned my directors having been in the past five csm pools who are they and why are they considered your directors skill queues are mentioned as one of the great featured coming out of csm efforts but nothing more do you believe this is the only feature of note worth mentioning are there others with examples in your short blurb just before a voter casts their support for you there is mention that in order to effect change you alone require the csm chair what advantages do you believe are provided with chair versus a regular delegate what do you believe can only be achieve by obtaining chair why can such issues not be brought forward as any other position within the csm given your belief that one feature of thousands is apalling what sort of tools or methods will you use if elected to change this track record whether passively or by force do you have any comments on the work done by csm 5 in comparison with previous councils you appear to advocate manipulation hardline tactics and shotgun diplomacy to get things done the way you want them what recourses do you have or have used in the past when someone decides to challenge youdissent professionally let us only focus on strong logical debate and not omgudidwhartlol type rebukelooking forward to your replies
dear the mittaniwhat is your position on rmting and boting in eve would you advocate any changes in eve to deal with bot corps renting from large 00 alliance rental schemesregardscyno
well just from your massive post and view count in this thread in all likelihood artificially inflated you will probably be electedi think the fact that youre spinning so hard for an internet spaceship council is pretty funny though
hey the mittani you have got my vote m8
from your commentary about disinhibition you may be amused by the fact that we have a zizek quote as our alliance description i think zizek is a big hilarious fraud and that anyone calling themselves a lacanian outside of the realm of academic literary criticism should be shot but its a good quote nonethelessim pretty much exactly the same in real life as i am in game i appreciate your post

the mittani is not lying to youhe is telling you the complete truth let that sink in for a secondthe complete truthgoon stylehe is telling you that the csm is nonsenseall the promises from the csm candidates all the issues and features theyre going to address  its all a pack of lieshe is telling you anyone looking to join is either naive or outright maniplulativeits time we stopped being suckersthe truth is that being on the csm has nothing to do with being a game designer or implementing your favorite features or fixing railguns or removing localhe is telling you that the candidates are looking for an all expense paid trip to iceland you the voters get used  a vicious cycle that pits your wishes for a better eve online against 9 people looking for an allexpensespaid icelandic vacationtherefore he is telling you he is manipulating you suckers into voting for him so he gets an all expense paid trip to iceland not that he really needs the money after all he is a successful lawyer  who found socialism only after he made it big in a capitalist system its the principle of the matter why pay when you can get someone else to pay rightvote mittani because everyone knows eve needs another unscrupulous manipulative goon readscam artist bent on selfaggrandizement in a postition of power
i looked at the interesting csms candidates by far mittani yours seems the most withrealism i should say i can relate to some of your views and too add a cherry on topa good poster which makes my heart swoon you have my voteshowever a questionwe all know that supercaps are breaking the game more so in nullsec if given the power what adjustments would you make to balance things out or the like since fighter bombers dreads have become obsolete even more so disregarging bringing a fleet of them to cap fights on a general scale now dreads need some loving
while i dont think the csm actually has the power to implement such things i think supercaps need to die in droves right now its too easy for them to get away id support something like a supercapital point that you could mount on supercarriers such a thing would result in so much supercap death as it would ensure that supercap fights are deathgrips or as a more careful balance tweak at the very least fighterbombers shouldnt be able to kill hics with such ease note csm is not amateur game designer hour and my above views are thus frankly irrelevant death2allsupercaps
the real nexus of botting these days is in l4 empire missions i think it should be cracked down on particularly in nullsec it ruins solo pvp when every ratter autologs upon a hostile jump in but ccp doesnt enforce antibotting rules essentially handing out only wristslaps one of the reasons botting is so widespread though is because the pve in eve sucks ass rmting leads to credit card fraud and should be heavily cracked down by ccp on wherever possible
this would be completely skullingly stupid inperson persuasion is vastly more effective than purely written persuasion body language communicates more than words both give and take like many csm delegates in the past have said the real action of the csm is facetoface in reykjavikive either run goonswarm or been a eminence grise since its inception compared to the grand promises of all the candidates over all the years perhaps this next expansion well see huge deliverables sourced from the csm but for now the election rhetoric has been little more than twaddle because im a ruthless bastard i think i can make a lot more out of the powerless chair than its explicitly delineated powers imply i dont think other candidates grasp the political power of titles ive answered this question multiple times over the course of this 12 page thread the summer of rage was well done this public letter on incarna is going to be very popular with voters yet futile and politically senseless if you insist upon rationalism and logical debate in all things youre not going to vote for a guy who mentions charisma as one of his selling points disputes between humans are not some kind of spreadsheet comparison contest since you suggested that i should telecommute to reykjavik and skip the facetoface summit meetings im going to guess that you dont understand how that works beyond that my record is not one of shotgun diplomacy goonswarm has some of the most consistent and effective diplomactic relationships in the history of eve we win not alone but arminarm with our friends
it matter little to me what he says i would never vote to put anyone from goonanythingand their associates in a position to have any say in this game their ideas of fairnessyeah right backstabbing cheating and out right lying are and forever shall be exemplified by their leadership
i would tend to agree the mittani is certainly an intelligent person and an exemplary spy master he is emminently qualified to write for ten ton hammer and lead the goonshowever by his own words he has been in goon leadership since its inception as such he bears responsibility for the goon brand under his watch the goons have become synonymous with betrayal weak character scams and have been encouraged to be as obnoxious as possible all of the accomplishments of the goons and there have been many are overshadowed by their loathsome reputation unfortunatelythe qualities that make the mittani a natural for the in game work he is currently doing makes him a poor choice as a candidatein my opinion alsogiven his propensity for intrigue and ebetrayal i just dont see the wisdom in giving him direct access to information protected by the ndai think that he has a place in the tapestry of eve he is certainly a celebrity just not csmalso this anticandidate candidate routine that he is running is transparently insincere it typifies what i feel his behavior would be like as a csm member
you say that we are being lied to and that we are suckers that must be why you want to be a csm then you are the head of the goons and you all lie scam sucker people in fact you brag about it and are proud to be the top scammers of eve you have nothing to offer the players of eve excpet fellow scammers and i loled when i read your speech which was well written but lacked the obvious truth you and all goons are scamming lying players of eve who play to only grief and you have all said those words many times i am calling you names i am quoting your wiki website and other statements made from you all over the years vote no for any goons running for csm
well im sold you got my votebreak some heads over there

thanks again for replyid hate to see a fuel bay on em i wrote more lengthy regarding that in seleenes thread would be gamebreaking for me to lose it heh guerilla warfare crew checking in tldr afk cloaking to losen targets up or to stay alive when blobbed sometimes for days is vital when being massively outnumbered seleene lost my votes on fuelbay on cloak opinion alonewill see if you wont at least get some vote from me since thats no major concern for you
ive written part one of a long reply to csm5s open letter to ccp about incarnaheres part one part two tomorrow
you have my vote good luck
enjoyed your reply to the csms open letter looking forward to part 2youve got my vote
1 4u 1 4seleene i cant choose between you both guys since you are the two persons id like to see at csm6both are constructive and complementary have strong positions base on solid experieces and are mature enough to look at it has a game but a serious internet spaceship business that must be taken forward by mature peoplegl rip hope to see you soon at csm with seleene and youll both do great things for our loved gamesry my english is pretty low
i was impressed with your appearance on lost in eve you sound level headed and i belive you would be a good addition to the csm you get my support there is just one comment id like to make in some of your replies to questions about problems in eve youve responded with some fairly specific ideas about a fix while i generally agree with your ideas i feel csm members are better placed to facilitate the communication of ideas from the player base to ccpim a fairly casual player and sometimes only get a couple of hours a week to play eve i currently feel trapped in hisec because without the support of a corp the potential cost of lost ships and equipment is just too great compared to the profit how do you feel about the transition from hisec to lowsec for players like me
voted for yato bad i could not vote for saleen as well
good luck mate  also enjoy the cookies
thank you nom nom nom
you have my vote especially i hope you will do your best to hunt down bots and isk farmers also your ideas about poss are interesting
thanks for the vote i will do my best d
the statement is what it isroleplaying is not sufficiently supported in eve onlinethe point of the questionnaire was to answer the provided statements not make up your own and then answer those without even mentioning within your answer that you have done soits true that roleplaying is in essence a playergenerated and playersupported activity it can occur even in games where the developers do almost nothing to encourage it but thats not the ideal situation and there are things that can be done to encourage it and make it easier for example making informational pf more readily accessible ingame instead of 1 burying some morsels of it inside mission text and making those morsels available nowhere else and 2 burying the other morsels in unorganized webpages that particular issue will be fixed by this assuming that actually gets done and fulfills its objectiveswith the above in mind at this point i think eve is very supportive of rp and specific advocacy of roleplayers concerns is only needed in a maintenance capacity ie prodding ccp for clarification if something they propose suggests a pf retcon of some kind may be incomingits also true that theres a broad spectrum of opinions about the definition of rp you are on one end of that spectrum most people who actually identify themselves as roleplayers are on the opposite endall that aside what really bothers me about your response to the rprelated statement on the questionnaire is that it implies a willingness to ignore what people actually say substitute what they said with your own statements and then respond to those statements in a very personal irrelevant manner is that how youre going to represent players who arent you
hi harveyi had the same questions and did a bit of research myself there are quite a few sources to support the statementthe ultimate wizardry archivesrelease date 2000platform ibm pc compatible theres quite a few search hits on google seems like the man is level on the claim and anyone doubting the accuracy of his statement now has independently verifiable content to peruse as for the movie bits also truelinkage imdb
i am not voting for you
see you folks have been playing blobfest online for so long that the idea of combat involving tactics is alien to you trevor put up a proposal and the null sec denizens just cried out its crap with no discussion even though the purpose of the modest proposal was to stimulate discussion rather than to put forward a serious proposalbefore commenting go ask google about a modest proposal and perhaps you can start to understand the geek mindsetas for the questions that arent answered perhaps they are not worth paying attention to since they are blatantly trolling or attention whoring
how did trebor misrepresent the mechanics of the csm
actually he answered all twenty one 21 of them at least those that were phrased as actual questions and not simply loludidntanswardisone111 statements 
i dont really see how the consumption of babies would help solve lag but that doesnt stop it from being a good idea
you have my vote
no of course not i have no problems with people disagreeing with me and as long as they do it in a polite manner i am happy to discuss things with themas ive said before im a skeptic this means if you can provide good evidence that a position i hold is incorrect i will accept it without too much of a bruised ego furthermore i acknowledge the possibility that any particular position i hold is incorrect or at least only partially correctit is for that reason that i try very hard not to project my personal opinions into my work on the csm after all i was elected to represent the playersmoving on to your question if i didnt personally agree with a proposal because i thought it was a bad idea i would have difficulty effectively championing it to the csm and calling for a vote in such a case i would have three main bits of advicefirst i would suggest they contact other csms that might have a more personal affinity for the subject mattersecond i would explain the issues i had with the proposal on both a conceptual what they want and structural how they are asking for it level and if they address those issues or make a good argument that i am mistaken or perhaps a bit of both then i would be able to raise and champion itthird i would suggest that they contact the other csms ask for their input and tweak the proposal as appropriate that would maximize the chances of the proposal sailing through with a 90 vote and everyone saying good idea no objections does this really need discussion lets voteall of the above can run in parallel of coursewith respect to your other questions and other posts do not expect a reply its blatantly obvious youre a troll a three monthold character with only a few posts all of them about the elections and all of them recent however you did ask an interesting question and i gave you extra points for having a character name that triggers the forum badwords filter  including messing up the link to your posting history on evesearch i know you wont be satisfied with this answer but hopefully it will be helpful to other readers of the threadps thanks for the all bumps
i wasnt originally planning on voting for you but due to all the hate from goons you ended up with one vote from me
even though i dislike goons since the day they formed up i am not avoiding to vote for them due to that dislikemy sole reason to vote for trebos comes from my point of vieuw that a chairman  woman is someone who is organised enough passionate enough but also willing to redirect any trail offs back on track to get things heading the right way againthese are qualities i see in trebor and as such i would love to see him in the chairman positionthis has nothing to do with power or the urgent need to press a hard mark people need to realise that the csm isnt for fighting against ccp to get changes but it has to fight alongside ccp to get things doneall the energy one would waste fighting against the owners of this game could be used for a lot more productive thingsi love eve and i love the people i play with these are qualities i rather see in a csm than someone who wants to have a position there soley to have another ego boost

the csm isnt all hard workone of the fun things ccp asked csm to do recently was come up with slogans for ingame banners promoting the electionheres one of mine that made the cut and is just starting to run  enjoy and thanks to ccp diagoras for coming up with the idea in the first place
i wonder if thats an example of how the mittani is lying to you since ive actually declared publicly i am voting for seleene the fact that i felt it appropriate to point out that the antitrebor campaign from the goons was more akin to an invasion of the bodysnatchers style imhuman screech aside you should take an effort to post truthfully if you to hope persuade elements of the community not already wearing a goons4life sweatshirt while knucklepaging down the turgid prose of your rather awful tentonnehammer vanity publishing extravaganzastill you have to laugh are these the kind of sociallyadept players you are speaking about mittanii feel positively awful to be reviled by this groupbut on a serious note to mittani  you have a responsibility to your player group i think you do them a disservice to talk about social inneptitude and ignorance in the way you do instead you should work towards better integrating them with the rest of the game by seeking the social contact and interaction that will gain them and you a little personal confidence in the years aheadon other notes good luck trebor i did vote for seleene but lets hope you and the other good independants get a decent share of the independent vote
thats horrible
you have all of my votes having spoken to you seen your past performance on csm5 as well as reading the deserved confidence mynxee has in you i share that confidence in your abilities and hope you get chair good luck
i have updated the 4th post in this thread to explain my position on the smear campaign i commend it to your attention
no sensible person who gets it that the csm represents the whole community can fail to see the value in what you brought to csm5 and will bring to csm6 i must also comment on the fact that you didnt just go off and work on these things in a vacuum in many cases you consulted with other csm members to get feedback to help improve them prior to raising or initiating themyour efforts on behalf of csm5 and the community are very much to be admired and should serve as the gold standard for csm delegate performance
to understand why the goons are afraid of trebor is a relatively simple matter they define their success in eve by their ability to harm or otherwise mess up the gameworld they have tried for years now to achieve this through gameplay with little actual impact  eve eats griefers alive the nature of the tooth and claw environment is self correctingnow the goons wish to harm the game by perverting the csm political process to lobby the developers to ensure the utter boring stability in 00 by opposing any kind of progressive alteration to nullsec alliance mechanicsthis isnt newsfor the goon mission complete in eve the gameworld needs wrecking in some way and having failed through any alternative source of griefing or gameplay intervention the best path to the current crop of goon leaders is to seek the solidification of existing power blocs to establish an aristocracy of nullsec that effectively stifles the gamewhy else do they oppose measures designed to open up the make the game more challenging in the sphere of 00 logisticswhy oppose the removal of jumpbridges why oppose the neccessity for escorted freighterssimply to ensure the ongoing stablity read boring stability in 00 that makes a static mockery of ccps vaunted endgame of alliance politicsgoons have by and large decided they cannot grief eve to deathbut the current leadership believes it might just have a chance at boring eve to death as a last grasp alternative to enshrine their role in history before burnout and irrelevance sabotages the goon legacy of shameless selfpublicists like the mittani
my vote goes to the mynxee endorsed candidate give mittens hell
voted for treborgood luck mate i hope you win another year of largely thankless frustrating unpaid work
youve got my vote of all the candidates that i read about you struck me as the most genuine and experienced while there are others worthy of the position i wanted to guarantee your own so good luck
this man works his socks off daily for all of us he gets all my votes
was going to give the mittani a vote or two until he started with his sock puppet malarkyso now you have all 7 votes
folksi greatly appreciate your expressions of support it is perhaps the greatest reward from working on csm 5  the only close contender would be the coffee at ccp which is really quite excellentif i could impose upon you futher i would greatly appreciate it if you would take a little extra time to make sure all your friends ingame know who you voted for and why and encourage them to vote as well  for whatever candidate they preferyou may wish to pass on these two links which explain the stakes at risk in the election
minerva ill give your post the attention it deserves in the morning when i have time to make a proper reply in the meantime voting has openedfolks of course i would like you to vote for me but please just vote i would not be doing all of this if i did not believe it would matter i dont need anymore free trips to iceland ive been on both sides of the fence both as a dev and as a player  believe me a solid csm can helpgo vote help make eve a better game for everyone
by far the best candidate to vote for
ill buy two things of that that cloaks havnt been revised since implementation is not ideal that certain ships use the cloak as a safe and thus get in some sense immortal like ratting ravens the npcing ships is one of my targets playing smallscale so i understand this sentimenthowever id still like you to revise that thought as to looking at the cloak as a whole bares the issue ill tell you why this is a major gamebreaking issue for me personally and i bet many othersi specialize in cloaking and guerilla combatright now for example i have multiple accounts sitting in hostile 00 and hunting targets using cov ops ships scouting and noncov ops ships utilize the cloak to huntnoone forces you to play that way bring friendsthatd be all well and fine if it wasnt the few things called tz rl interruption and limited gametime without cloaks id be forced to high and nullsec alone should null and wh be for fulltime and blobs alone that is the cost of losing the cloakwhy a fuelbaytimer on the cloak doesnt workyou surely understand im often camped in sometimes by as many as 50 players camping in my single character often with many bubbles on the only outgates sometimes i get camped in for days before i can barge out beforeafter dt remember how the coaltion locked down bob in delve some year ago its the same thing but on a smaller scalea very recent example yesterday i killed a drake that was ratting in a deadend system my scout found him i enter local warp my curse to his belt and engage him suddenly local doubles up i keep a close look at scanner typhoon lands the drake died and i managed to keep the typhoon disabled before anything else arrived and i could get out then i cloaked up now theres only one gate out the locals know my ship and will of course try to get revenge i manage to slip out near a dt using a scout but already initiating the combat i was at a disadvantage they have numbers they have more damage tank etc i have the element of surprise and get to chose when to engagetldr  putting a timer on cloaks would be a buff to local inhibitants a great deterrent to guerilla warfare and another boost to blobsedit oh and to add to the bad part where certain ships like ratting ravens being immortal yeah that isnt good and ideal but the only threat they are is to ccp through bots pvp wise it is no concern is it worth killing off the guerilla warfare for that instead of trying to fight botting through mechanics that would have far less effect on nullsec warfare

i would like to see serious persons take care of our opinions and there is no doubt for me that you seleene are one of themhad to splash my votes between you and someone i realy think can do a great job with you has rip someone who im deeply convinced has the tools opinions and with someone has you that can make the difference we expect from this new csmwish you good luck and see soon enough my favorite candidates work together
voted for seleene with both my accounts good luck i reckon youll do a great job
my votes went to seleene as well i believe that a former ccp dev is in the best position to have positive interactions with ccpbesides if mynxee supports seleene thats really all the endorsement i need mynee is awesome and was a great csm chair
i voted for you seleene i think youve offered the best overall experience portfolio and the other candidates appear eager to work with you i also think that ccp would enjoy hearing a seasoneddevelopers version of the ideas expressed within the csm i wish you the besttrebor is probable a shoein for a spot as a delegate at this point but im afraid that hed slow down the csm process as chair  he seems to get the role of the forums and the chatssummits confused focusing on details when hes in attendance and being too general on the forums im afraid under him the process would slow down too much his populist policies coupled with his voterbounty system reveal a candidate who is running in bad faithi was also dissatisfied with his wholesale dismissal of goon candidates to put it bluntly he likes them when you call him out but he marginalizes them when nobodys looking objectively goon is a major element in the game and yes they have a stake in what happens in 00 i think its a good idea to have them involved in the same way concord was involved with drone region players when it came to naming them lets all work together to make a game we all enjoymittani has a lot to say about the games mechanics but also has legitimate concerns with the csm process hes got experience in just about every facet of eve life short of the csm and he shows good peoplehandling skills some might disagree but i dont think the csm has anything to lose with him on boardmy personal first pick is seleene second place mittani trebor gets the third spot i also want to see helen on again and this will be exactly how it wont play out
i still owe a few answers in this thread and i promise to reply as soon as i can once rl slows down a bit and i can sit in a chair longer than 10 mins in the meantime i just wanted to say that a lot of folks seem to think im going to get a seat no matter what but im taking nothing for granted certainly not with the field of heavy weights in this election as a first time candidate im having to pull in new votes or sway old voters to me so thank you to everyone supporting me so farccps twitter feed announced earlier over nine thousand capsuleers have already registered their vote in the ongoing csm elections make sure your voice is also heard after the same duration last election only 2305 had been cast vote nowthis is exciting i just wish there were exit polls for all of this the 30th is a long time to wait for results vote vote vote
itll certainly be interesting to see what happens if the  of voting accounts reaches say 25 itll be much harder for certain people to dismiss the csm with that kind of mandate
this is exactly what i am hoping to see no matter who gets elected if a large enough percentage of the eve player base votes then csm 6 will have a truly representative mandatenew ccp tweet15k pilots43 of eligible pilots already voted for the csm6 elections up from 134k votes at the same point last election
you have my vote you know what teh real truth is because you have dealt with game design you truly represent the peopel of eve and everything i hear about you  even from your enemies is good
pos a great thing for a industrial expansion would be to add the capability to rent the research and maybe even production slots to the general public it would be a big projrct but we can always hope cloaks fuel as depicted has a problem in the past i was capable to navigate 00 gatecamps in a cloaked bs i had to spend more than 1 hour moving around carefully to get out of the bubble and far away to be safe warpingif you add a fuel requirement based on mass for cloaks it would became impossible or the fuel requirement would be so low that it will not make a difference for afk cloakers btw 4 votes for you already sent

its not about being for or against scamming scammers do what they do only to benefit them selves  they are selfish and dont have others best interests at heart that being said how do you expect voters to support some1 that puts himself above othersi would prefer to vote for some1 that might actually try and make a positive change for us all and i highly doubt a scammer is such a person either way  i have already cast my 2 votesgood luck to you anyhow
hardly call it a scam it was more like a child having a new toy to play withyou got bored with it and burned out hardeasiest option was to call it a scam and move on even if you were to get on the csm youll get bored within a month and break the nda somehow so that you take the easy way out all the while labelling it a great victory
compromising the chribba dice roll was totally worth it so i could make sure i didnt win that officer mod
your plan for an overhauled bounty system has bounty hunters being assigned targets with a probability proportional to the bounty on a players head so a player with a 500m bounty would be 100 times more likely to be your target than a player with a 5m bountywhats to stop your new bounty system from being rendered worthless by large bounties on players who arent really vulnerable to solo player or small gangs titan pilots players who dont really log in anymore resulting in many or even ost of the bounty targets assigned being players you cant realistically kill

obviously anyone who is against rr has been defeated because of it
you act like dbank didnt go on for 16 months if that is my burnout period for anything then that would work for csm because that would last 12 months also huge difference between running a bank and csm in terms of content csm would be more interesting and would definitely not lead to any burnout especially during a single termthe low bounties probably will not be very frequent missions but still possible it is unlikely that the system could be rendered worthless by large invulnerable bountied players because low security status or kill rights are required to receive a bounty something you will find does not apply to titan pilots also the system requires that the play be currently logged on for someone to be given the mission as a tz difference prevention mechanicfor discussion on your point though lets say a player in my alliance has a 9001 billion isk bounty and everyone else only has a 5m isk bounty it is still possible for me to draw him as a mission and collect on the bounty and split it with him the abuse of the current system while this is not the most desirable result the ability for this still to occur would prevent the instance where 9999 of all bounty missions are for one character while not making the event common placeand a post from one the biggest benefiters of neutral rr my personal experience has not been terrible by any means it has happened to me personally once in a battle i was winning and i just waited and docked a mild inconveniencemy concerns on the matter are the ones i stated above it hurts the war mechanics and it also is risk free pvp which should not be possiblekorvini thought throwing an utu at you already made me your pet besides you agree with 90 of my ideas anyways so sure
votematch says 56 so i need to kill you more to shape your brain the way i want
why cant you calculate rr into the equation in the first place if you know or suspect that neutral rep is a possibility then dont risk it ive lost kills and recieved some losses because of neutral rr and im not complaining its part of eve plus i doubt ccp will change this since it would reduce the  rolling in to their bank a change on neutral rr is a change on active alts and the reduction of them from the game think of all the alts who are dedicated rr which would stop paying 1499month
losses are fine by me the broken hisec wardec system isnt a mechanic that is exploited to the point where it has become a common expectation for any hisec wars is most certainly something that needs a fix im not sure why anyone is opposed to the thought of something being changed for the benefit of fun game play and balance except of course for one that is personally offended by the suggestion because it nullifies a tactic that person uses as a crutch and will be met with minor hardships while the rest of the game would benefiti guess from the greed standpoint this would hold true however ccp really wanted to have microtransactions put into place plex for remaps and that wouldve been a pretty good financial boost but a huge backlash from the forumscsm had them change their game plan profit is important but it isnt the entire driving force behind game mechanics besides people said the same thing about nerfing falcons backintheday but the nerf was necessary and the balance that emerged is more funon another note logistics would still be a viable alt job but having them sit invincibly on the back of a station until it is most convenient for the exploiter to use it would no longer be viable theyd have to be part of the alliance at war to affect the war i also feel command ships in hisec should only boost a fleet that is in war if it too is part of that war
i did not know there was a drawing and all of a sudden i has vizans thing thats awesomei just supporting you because if the other csm guys got their way and made suicide ganking harder my industrial returns wouldnt be as good i also liked dbank back in the day minus not getting all my money back thanks for the modnow to figure out how much it is worth probably pays for my dbank lossalready gave you my vote
if you read this eve24news article you will understand better why you should vote for ms pacmanin her platform she wants to fix the kartelsrenterspace in evelet me quote some out of this eve24news articletheir long list of clientsi just wished this article would had come out a little sooner as it underscribes my campaign so if you have a character left you still can vote with then vote for ms pacman
its pointless to vote for other issues before fixing the iskbank issue
how is this related to rentershow do you think you can fix this
candidate comments
these real money trades rmt and the list of of who bought isk this way and how it is related to rentersheres my view on thisthe isk that they sell like to the people who are listed has to come from somewherei assume they also sell plex for real money but then cheaper than ccp doesthis is a speculation they invested money buying isk in order to create such a power in game so they can create a powervacuumnext is they make settlements by alliances renting space from themthe areas they control will get so large and the isk income will get so high that they will be able to whitewash these isks for real money and make huge profitshow they whitewash it can be variousrentspace settlements will prevent anyone to get access to nullsec any other way than renting spaceany other way say pvp will be a fight like papuans vs the russian armypart of the solutionby replacing the current way systems are being rented out for a by ccp controlled rentsystem  like in game rentslots and put a limit on the number of slots and edit the eula that any other way to rent out space to others will be a violation of the eula you can break open this vacuumnow larger numbers of corps and alliances from empire wont be papuans anymore and can actually fight their way into nullsec and obtain spacewhile they obtain more space the powerblocks will lose more ways of making income r64r32more numbers of indepandants in nullsec will cause to make it harder for the powerblocks to maintain their illegal way of making real moneya perfect example of this in real life is currently libia and the revolt that is going on there against kadaffihe controlled his nullsec and made trillions of oil dollars but now the people are taking over in a even more wider aspect it happened in tunesia and egypt first with success what ccp has to do right now is to freeze all these peoples corp wallets while they are being investigated the people who are being listed buying isk in violation of the eulanote that i am not accusing any alliance about the abovei leave the answers to that to ccp
only 8 buyers out of 5800 in my alliance p happy about thatem banem
i would have to agree  any accounts found engaged in rmt and can be conclusively proven as such should be hit with the banhammeralso rmt is a separate issue to nullsec rental space although they are linked simply by the fact that rmt activities need to be funded somehow
its quite delicate that a csm candidate his alt has been discovered in that listand its even more delicate if you find out who that is but i am for sure not going to give that away
i sincerely hope that eve24news first action was to inform the authorities when they were handed the database dump  hacking is rather heavily frowned upon and if the allegations that it was done in order to blackmail individualscorps then the perpetrator is facing a pretty hefty prison sentenceif eve24 did not inform the authorities no ccp are not the authorities and publishes the information on an add supported public space ie making money off it then they too are going to need lawyersseeing as eve24 were so kind as to provide pretty much all the evidence needed for successful prosecution id say the case will be very swift so good luck to themon topic why vote for a platform wanting what is already thereccp already has an rmt taskforce permacamping the logs but are due to the nature of the beast always two steps behind  throwing more moneyresources at the problem will not solve it any faster
thats not delicate thats grounds for ineligibility for csm plain and simple regardless of who it is and what ingame position they hold
sorry for the harsh words your proposal is absolutely delusionalnot even speaking about obvious ways to workaround any artificial limit put on the interaction of groups  purposemade sister alliances etcsimplyfing things a bit some small alliance is either renter or being shot now you want to forbid some alliance a to rent space to alliance b because it ran out of gamerent slots are you going to forbid alliance a to shoot alliance b and say ask for ransom for not being shot  eula youd say  congrats instead of gamerent slots you just have instituted shooting right slotsironically enough your libya analogue pretty demonstrates what things you are not getting people are taking over not because some higher authority changed an eula for kaddafi and he ran out of oil slots
this is a paid endorsementno sorry this is an unsolicited endorsement for this candidatei endorse this candidatein all seriousness though ive known this candidate for a number of years we were incarcerated at the same institutionsorry thats not right his hand writings a little hard to read as i type this i should probably edit it we attended the same tertiary institution and i know where he lives so if he fails to come through for an appropriate fee i could transfer all his assets to youno wait i wasnt supposed to say that out loud  wheres the delete key againin all seriousness though getting imigo onboard the csm can only be good for the gamethis has been a paid sorry unsolicited endorsement for this candidate
ive just read ms pacmans stance on nullsec renterspace and mafia extortion and had to commentto be blunt this is utter rubbish currently there are no game mechanics to createmanage rental space anywhere in eve the whole arrangement of renterspetsallies is based on player to player interaction and quite frankly this is the way it should belet me be perfectly clear on my stance here im not for or against alliances renting space charging large prices for the use of space alliances imposing rules on other alliances use of space or any of the wonderfuldastardly things nullsec inhabitants do tofor each other what i am for is allowing 00 entities to make their own decisions about what agreements they make with other entities any means to regulate this eg rent slots will be artificial and arbitrary nullsec is player run space and its use is negotiated between players  whether they negotiate with words isk or by blowing stuff up keep it that way
the link you referring to is an older editionlet me relink that to my solution that can be found at this linkpost here good luck with your campaignedit also more insight here at this interview
as a player with more than a years experience multiple accounts and a corp ceo you have my vote all four of them to be precise keep it real honest fun and fair good luck and best wishes
still rmt and nullsec rental space are two separate issues the only connection is that rmt needs isk funds from somewhere to sell and space rent can be one source of those funds

i am a little sad that this left the first page some important issues here that need to be adressu
i agree mostly with disgruntled flying monkey and was thinking the same thing before he took the words out of my mouth i see you have a pretty clear idea of how the csm works to present ideas and im sure youve done your research on each of these ideas youre supporting but i think youre forgetting that multitudes of players will support bad ideas simply because they arent able to see the longterm ramifications of said change that being said i want to flesh out a few of my concerns with each of your eleven pointsthis is too vague what even counts as a small band sure id like to see giant megaalliances no longer controlling large chunks of nullsec but i dont think its a big issue the game gets along fine as is and dont forget that those megaalliances have lots and lots of players in them its just players banding together eve makes that happen where other games dont i dont think its a big enough issue to fuss over when there are pressing economical issues at handmaybe its just me but i dont see how this is really needed i like the idea of tech 2 capital ships but i dont know if its really a question if the players want them more of a question how to implement them ccp cant just throw it out there they have to test the design over and over again very carefully to make sure that a minor imbalance doesnt throw everything to heckonce again seems vague though i admit i havent had much experience with t3sthis is one point i agree with whether or not we have incursions missions still need work both to make them more fun and engaging for the players and to thwart mission botsi think you worded this poorly both t2 battleships have very clearly defined roles perhaps a better point would be that the black ops is highly restricted in its use and the marauder is for missions thus there are no t2 battleships for pvp in a pvp game in any case i think this point also needs a lot of worki agree 100 small ships have too strong an advantage when it comes to ninja salvaging but its too small a point to put it up here no matter how many players think this is a big issue the fact remains that the disgruntled players who lost a salvage opportunity can either learn to fly a better salvage ship work with friends or accept that they arent getting salvage because they arent taking the steps to ensure that they domore or less what i said with the above point though once again i admit that i dont have experience with technetiumaction is always being taken and its impressive the dedication ccp puts into this area what we need is the answers to solve the technical problems they are combating in this area to give them ideas that can be implemented its a difficult issue and ccp needs solutions not lists of concerns they are already aware offaction warfare is very lucrative and its economic effect is debatably one one of the driving forces behind it nobody should expect you to know a lot about every issue but you should be able to admit when you dont know enough about something
contsome people think these things need a change and some like it the way it is you need to give both a good reason why it is bad the way it is and a good idea how to change it and it would be better if changedi agree though keep in mind that part of the lack of lucrativeness of lowsec space is that it is inhabited by bot miners nocxium the primary lowsec mineral is quite valuable despite all the bot mining but if bot mining activity were substantially reduced the value of nocxium would likely shoot up quickly to the point that several players went to lowsec to mine jaspet hemorphite and hedbergite still id like to see crokite give less nocxium and i personally think pyroxeres gives way too much nocxium when you consider its unit volume it gives about 40 as much nocxium as hemorphite the top nocxium yielding mineral but i digress i speak from fairly general experience in mining and i believe i have enough experience in these areas to speak about them the way i do but the point remains that the concern about lowsec isnt how lucrative it is so much as who is taking the gold but youre right lowsec needs fixing are you hearing me ccp fix lowsec
one of the issues with this is that i dont see how any mechanic could favor a small to mid sized corporation attacking or defending space that wouldnt give an overwhelming advantage to a giant alliance attacking or defending that same spaceone thing ive said in the past about this is that there could be regions of nullsec space that arent connected to the giant null sec ring that surrounds high sec space currently this could come as either nullsec pockets in the middle of empire perhaps as small as a single system that arent jumpable to other low or null sec systems or perhaps entire null sec constellations that are only reachable by going through wormhole space these would be areas that a small to mid size band of players could defend and own that the giant alliances would probably ignoredepending on game balance issues it could have either a jump drive a clone vat bay or the ability to compress ore i really dont think it needs a jump drive id be leaning towards the ability to do ore compression or greatly expanded cargo holds mining is a dead or dying profession in both low sec and null sec people have talked in the past of adding a superveldspar to null sec and putting mercoxit in low sec these sound like ideas i could get behind but ccp could also add a lowseconly mineral to complement mercoxits null sec only statusi see them as a series of instanced miniincursions that corporations could run that would be far too powerful for a single player or two in a carrier and not needing quite as large of a force as the current incursions dobotting has a profound effect on the eve economy to the point where i feel some game mechanics are developed to diminish its overall effect by baking in an awareness that a certain percentage of minerals and isk will be botgenerated i know the csm cant change that but im also not one of the people running for csm that has allowed their alliance members to bot freelythanks i hope this helps
ive described running for the csm before like thisits actually an important economic issue that there is no endgame for a small alliance right now ive posted above about nullsec pockets and wspace connected null sec that small alliances could use but honestly its vague because anything i propose would be a specific mechanic and the csm really doesnt propose specific mechanics successfully the can highlight problems like this isi would hope that once they come up with the specs of any ship that they were thinking of adding to the game that they would come to the csm for feedback beyond that i really do feel that a t2 orca is something people want in a game you do want to be giving players more of what they wantin wspace there is no way to refit a t3cruiser there are corps right now that move into wspace to make t3 components but who cant refit their cruisers with the ferry modules theyre creating that just seems broken to menifty
having a very defined role is much different than having a better defined role they both have a role right now but its far to niche of a role for what should be the superultimatebattleship people should be flyingi like to chunk this in as another example of giving people what they wantin a nutshell tech is used in a quantity that far exceeds what one would expect in a r32 moon mineral players noticed this weeks before the changeover to the new t2 component recipes but ccp went ahead anywayone of the things the csm does is point and go hey this problem is very important and should moved out of your ever lengthening queue of stuff youll never get to and get fixed now this is me saying thatit may be very lucrative but its obviously not lucrative enough if more players arent doing itthis is more of a ui issue and while eve has a number of ui issues this one is pretty badneat
right im not sure how they could do 2 but adding how many runs are left on a blueprint could easily accomplish 1 either putting in 1 or zero for a bpo and a positive number for a bpcbecause they also dont differentiate between a 10 run bpc and a 1 run bpc
anyone who supports orca pilots gets my votei dont know why but people tend to have some kind of hate directed to the industrial part of the game especially against orcas
well voting has started thank you for everyone who has spent time in sending me mails with your questions and support now lets see how we do at the vote
 aureleos for csm  the entire purpose of my campaign is to prevent ridiculous changes to eve motivated simply by the urge to nerf 00 or its occupants while encouraging the creation of new content and novelty to keep the game both competitive and enthr
games promoting rl valuesi like games that have reallife valuable lessons to teach scamming in eve  this is something that can happen to you in real life and perhaps you could learn a good lesson by being scammed in eve so you learn to avoid the same in real life yes there are idiots who will never learn but eventually those will emoragequit eve and we will be rid of them though i have never jita scammed someone jita scamming in eve is a legitimate mechanic that should be left alone as a way of culling the morons from the game knowing you are at risk of being scammed is a valuable reallife lesson banking  there are several organizations within eve that offer banking services but there lacks a system mechanic to make that a truly profitable system how do you ensure that a loan can be repayed collateral how can you save isk put it in an alt that you dont often use can you earn interest on money saved yes you can but you have to trust it to a player controlled institution that is then making loans or profitable investments with which to pay interest on money you have trusted them with we could set up some sort of commission to rate capsuleer controlled service organizations for people to use as a gauge of trustworthiness think evebbb better business bureau run by volunteers similar to the isd method i give chribbas services a triplea rating p saving and investing are good reallife values if you want to say aw eve is teh game and shoulnt haev stuffz like taht1 i say it already teaches a lot of commodity economics so why not other useful skills no where does it say that a game can be nothing more than a game and besides you little kids can then tell your parents or wives  about valuable sht you learned from evenew content expand wormhole stuff  developable worm holes  not just the systems the whs themselves imagine groups of organized people that can invest in building infrastructure to temporarily stablelize worm hole entrances the immediate effect of this would be that whs could potentially be safer for large groups of organized players trying to maintain towers and industrial activities  its actually a risk tradeoff if you look close at the idea easier to control the wh but you become a larger target for pirates or other hostiles the longterm effect would be reduced prices of t3 ships if the risktradeoff isnt balanced everyone is gonna jump on this idea and say aw that is a dumbfksht idea what about blah blah blah or blah blah blah to this i say well we can have discussions about the creative aspect of addressing blah blah blah without trashing the idea altogether afterall imagine the fella that first said hey lets make an mmo that is all one huge server based in space you know some asshle troll jumped up in iceland and said aw that is a dumbfksht idea what about blah blah blah or blah blah blah well 8 years later and a whole buttload of blah blah blah later we have a pretty cool game we all love to play  if you dont love eve then why the heck are you reading this incarna  yes please  no it doesnt mean ccp is trying to go and be like world of warcraft its novelty it puts a face on eve  poor pun intended it creates an entirely new dimension for the expansion of eve ccp can easily support the incarna feature by having those mechanics supported by dedicated servers for those of you who are worried that the new content would fudge the servers for the rest of the game my main reason for wanting incarna is because like so very many of you i really want to kick scotty the docking manager in the nards
fixes to current game mechanics this would be the largest section so far so in the interests of whatever brevity i can salvage from what i have typed so far i would say that fixes and modifications would be looked at from a balance standpoint ccp has maintainted that certain aspects of eve are balanced despite complaints the fact is that ccp has its reasons for keeping some things the way they are especially when it comes to ships and mods that are specialized for certain combat situations understanding the game from the greater perspective and having a bit of realistic experience with realworld military capabilities i can understand the idea of specializationi am going to leave this open to questions as to what i mean as it pertains to eve the idea again is to prevent certain lulwut forces from nerfing game mechanics simply to gain an advantage in a potentially narrow perspective of the game that is not to say all concerns are narrow just most of themthank you again for taking the time to read my blah blah blahaure 3
this i like nothing crazy just measured conservative advancement when you have a machine with over a million gears spinning all at once you dont want to move too many at a time we moderates need a voice and i think youre it
something positive aureleos paid me a tengu to say somthing positive on his thread
ohhh yeah this guy here aureleos u guys should vote for him because the other candidates are ebil zombies and need to have some shootings  cause u dont negotiate with zombies and ccp is the last place we need zombies lets face it if zombies eat ccp staff then they will eat the hamsters and if u think down time is long now think again zombies aureleos isnt one of em
i see a lot of other peeps running having concerns over new content ideas while failing to have concerns over changing the game as it exists while at the same time knowing jacksht about what they are talking about not naming peeps but there you have it a lot of witless candidates talking hot air out their aholes and over their heads same old sht every year mittani seems to know a lot but since he is a lawyer in real life i am not gonna vote for him every vote he steals from the mittani is a win for mevoting for you aureleos save us from the change
tldr
if u havent read what aureleos has to say yet i will give you the short version blah blah blah key board face roll blah blah blah vote for me i wana go to iceland to see how icy it isand free tengus if u vote for me
what is thisi dont even 
some nice ideas not over the top valid pointsvote aure
i like this article as well nurfing just for the sake of nurfing is not an answer and should used as a last resort and i always against it i have to say that it is the games vs rewards that keeps me coming back but if i want a game that will hold my hand all the time i would go play wow eve is more dangerous and less forgiving of mistakes and thats what i like thats my 2 cents
hi mikewhere do you stand on the big stuff sov pos mechanics force projection supercaps  jump bridgeswhats the biggest single thing that bugs you personally in eveyouve mentioned destroyers and i agree what other hulls also need a good look atone last question what are the various things have you done in eve
i like your stance on lowsec i really really think it needs fixing and i can see how difficult an issue it is every solution seems to backfire even as early as the planning stage but more than anything i like your stance as a whole to represent the whole playerbase and to focus on the big picture that is what the csm should do i like that you arent supporting individual little quibbles you have that you plan to put forth your effort into making everyone elses gaming better but also that you appear to have a keen understanding of how the game works and that helps you to spot potential problems within an issuethat being said id like to ask for your opinion on a handful of ideas i had to help fix lowsec and i want to stress that ive already decided my feelings toward you being elected to csm and im merely asking out of both curiosity to hear your viewpoint and a hope that you can poke a few holes in my ideas so that i might better formulate them in the futureidea 1 i think bot mining aka macro mining is a big part of the problem with lowsec since they actively mine in it bringing down the prices of those minerals namely nocxium and thus creating competition that real player miners cant compete with so my idea is moreover to fix macro mining i think that if the miner were to aim the mining laser at a slowscrolling picture of asteroid in which the minerals and the empty rock would have the same color scheme and would look virtually identical to a computer but would be fairly easy to spot by a human player that the bot mining would be far less lucrative and the player mining would be more engaging i realize already that the first big problem with implementation is that these pictures would have to come fresh from the server and be updated frequently i think that making them very lowquality is step one as it not only reduces streaming bandwidth but also makes it easier to add in image artefacts that the human eye can detect and that computers cannotidea 2 i think the nocxium output of crokite a major nullsec mineral and pyroxeres a major highsec mineral should be reduced their current output is quite significant even to the point of eliminating the need for lowsec minerals since there are no other minerals that come primarily from lowsec making nocxium more exclusive to lowsec would increase the value of lowsec mining and i know thats only one of many steps to solving the issue but i think its a valid oneidea 3 make system security status more gradual there should still be a hard boundary between lowsec and highsec but i think piracy should be much more difficult to get away with in higher security systems of lowsec ganking in 04 systems should be particularly dangerous to the pirates and should require substantial preparation thus many of the more daring carebears will be willing to enter lowsec despite the reduced danger likewise high security systems of lower security status values should have a greater difference between concord response times perhaps thus allowing a suicide ganker more time to complete the objective and making the ganking cheaper in those systems perhaps in 05 or 06 systems it could even be possible though definitely not easy of course to thwart concord and actually manage to escape whatever fit allows you to do this however shouldnt be a very good gank fit for instance if it requires you to fit 5 warp core stabilizers on a battleship then youre pretty much stuck with smart bombs as your weapon this change would entice more pirates to highsec and would blur the boundary between highsec and lowsec with the carebear playerbase more spread out lowsec would become a bit safer just from the presence of other nonpirates to help dilute the pirate populationso those are my ideas curious to hear your input i dont care if they never get implemented i just want lowsec to be fixed
one final idea not my own though i have ideas toward implementing it make pvp and pve fits identical this goes inline perhaps with making missions more fun and maybe even thwarting mission bots if instead of fifteen puny ships you encounter 12 powerful ships and maybe 13 flanking puny ships you would want to fit ships similar to how you would in pvp if you went up against 12 ships that were as powerful as a player ship it would take some skill to run the missions perhaps the agent would tell you what youre going to be up against ship types and faction and in some cases it may be a good idea to bring a small ship to complete the mission now im not saying missions should be more difficult just that they should be less hectic
just out of curiosity has there been any communicationprogress on any other issues in the last 2 months you know the other stuff that you guys were actually elected to push ccp to work on low sec proposals hybrid fixes or have all efforts been dedicated to badgering ccp about incarna i confess i havent been following much lately but it seems that since the december summit there hasnt been much done or said that was productive shame since up until that point a lot had actually been accomplished i am not being sarcastictbh i think the csms mandate should not be to call bull but to help get the things that are currently broken in game fixed the players have all been clamouring for things to get fixed and the csm was helping with that the fixes in incursion are a clear example of the csms impact and progress on that front the outrage in june seemed to stem very much from the perception that ccp wasnt going to be adding or fixing anything other than incarna for 18 months and now this csm has taken a page from that book and doesnt seem interested in anything other than incarna ironic
i begged the evegate forums team to impose a special 140character length limit on virtuozzo posts but they refused on the grounds that virtposts are incredibly useful as forum stresstestson a more serious note a reply i posted in my campaign thread gives my perspective on how the letter evolved
ccp did their release planning in jan so were at the stage of waiting to hear back on which items are being progressed and which have been shelved since december ccp have started providing weekly updates to csm of where things are but unless they give permission we cant discuss features in progress in case they get droppedjust to make it clear ccp have stated that no stakeholder group within the eve project has guaranteed development time allocated so it is entirely possible that no csm issues will get worked on for a whole release cycle however in this cycle a team is spending some of their time working on quick fixes identified by csm and playerssee above release planning has been done and so no further issues can realistically be added at this stage csm focus until the next round of release planning is on providing feedback unless a team has time to work on something else at which point well do what we can to get more issues pushed forward this cycle will continue for as long as ccp have a two release per year schedulethe role of the csm continues to evolve and that is likely to continue into csm6 and beyond it simply isnt worthwhile going back to the old system of just raising hundreds of new issues because ccp simply dont have the development time to address more than a handful of them the key time is providing the priority list from the crowdsourcing before the release planning which we did and attempting as you pointed out to get existing things fixed the reason csm are so interested in getting answers to incarna questions is because that is the main focus of this release cycle
they better fix hybrids first just sayin
clearly i am abstaining from signing my name to trick you
so why exactly is incarna that important and crucialeve is about flying spaceships thats what we all love about itand i dont see how that incarna stuff improves anything frankly i think its a waste of resources
its important because its taking up a lot of ccps development resources for a significant amount of time choosing to spend developer time on incarna means that ccp has chosen not to spend that time on other things i agree that incarna is likely to offer little to no value for the majority of current eve players ccp thinks that it will attract new ones but i am sceptical of this
noccp is developing a character  environment engine for carbon they happen to have a huge playerbase to test it on in eveonline so they ahve decided to add the engine to eve to test it out in real life before making world of darkness andor other carbon based mmosincarna is a toy in eve thats allccp gets to develop and refine the content pipeline for the engine on a live game instead as a lab experimentif you think the reseources would have been used on eve had they not made incarna you are very wrong
except that the carbon team is completely separate to the incarna team or any of the other eve teams there are eve resources being spent on incarna over and above the carbon integration

this is the kind of post csm should more oftenon a regular basisit is very hard to get a feeling you do something this is great example of showing what you do giving transparency having a dialogue with both sides etc it also shows the csm5 already done way more than any of the previous versions by this post alonethank you
its a distraction for the players and for the designers it isnt going to have any new functionality or gameplay that we are aware of though there are many references to what it might be in the future it will essentially be a better looking habbo hotel
thanks for your comments misanth the amount of time and effort it took to get to the point of publishing this letter was far above average but we do have similar internal discussions and debates about many things that follow a similar process this is a big part of the unseen time spent doing csm stuff and it is considerable for those delegates who choose to participate in such discussions not all do for example i contributed very little to the null sec discussion because i have no expertise that would allow useful participation these discussions often involve topics that ccp has placed under nda which is why they dont get shared with the public the csm internal forums are by default considered to be nda which helps to establish a comfort level for csm and ccp to engage freely in discussionparticularly for people on the ccp side of the equation but ccp participation is optional no one on the ccp side is required to engage with the csm or answer our questions with the possible exception of our advocates nor come to the table to try and resolve grievances it is easy to assume such a grievanceperhaps due to personality conflicts or personal issues with some csm5 membersis held by the incarna team we dont know perhaps we can make some assumptions about that when csm6 takes office and we see how or if they are engaged by team incarna
how will incarna be enfoced on supercapital pilots or pilots living in wspace im curious
dont be silly we all know incarna is station environments unless you have a station on board of your supercap or in a wormhole those niches will be irrelevant for ccp in the topic p that does not diminish the importance being cautious of the mindset behind the approach of x cannot be compelling unless it is enforced with incarna that is a topic lets hope the paradigm does not spread beyond
we have no real idea whats incarna about unless captains quarters and and nothing else but mabes and stuff alike how can the csm take players comentssugestions seriously when even them are in the blackout arent they supposed to be the comunity voice but also the coolwater for all the boilling threadsits pretty obvious that the comunication from ccp vs players has serious issues and vs csmat the end of the day the major part of the players has i do whenever i get enraged that happens pretty often  we throw on csms back al this misscomunication issuesnow i really hope for the grater good of this game i enjoy that ccps senior devs are capable to open their eyes a little bit and see the community waiting for answers from them and not only from you actually i expect their answers for the issues you repport better than your repport of their answers knowing whow senior devsmanagers act i will not expect any change in this sens and wish you guys good luck on trying profit to take some local beers and kiss some local chicks for me at least that will profit a liitle bit to some eves community sry for my poor english not english native
teadazethank you for your work on csm i voted for you last time and definitely feel i got my votes worth your main point in your campaign and throughout what you did on csm was you were going to push player concerns but here i think ccp is pulling a form of bait and switch on you tiny montgomery is correct the players were extremely upset because they didnt care about incarna csm should continue to inform ccp of this fact and continue to push for the things players care about  iterating on the spaceship gameit seems to me that it is very hard to represent the players views about a game feature that isnt even out yet and they know nothing about sure you may know some things but we dont the only thing you know is that the players dont really care about incarna and were therefore upset that it was taking so many resources for such a long time period that was clear rightif that was clear then how can the csm as representatives of the players say things like this given how crucial incarna is to the future of eve and ccp the success or failure of incarna is such an important issue we are extremely concerned that development of incarna the most significant addition to eve since betarather we are primarily concerned about the apparent lack of significant planning for a feature ccp properly regards as crucial to the future of the company and the game we love so muchhuhi am left to wonder what ccp put in your beer the players have said the opposite very clearly in june many left because they saw incarna as a big time waste and a guarantee that what they find crucial to the game may never get worked on the kicker is really this we want to see incarna fully fleshedout i read this as ccp spend more time on incarna than the 18 months you already set aside this couldnt be further from representing the players views i want incarna spit out asap so ccp can go back to spaceships asap players were ticked off that it took as long as it did if its not fleshed out so be it i dont care i care about ccp getting back to spaceships because that is what is crucial to eve  or at least my subscription to it and others who left the game not incarnaif ccp wont listen to what the players tell them that does not mean you should ignore what the players say and start playing along with what ccp is forcing down our throat you simply need to report to the players that ccp is going to continue to ignore them until incarna is doneyou have always done a great job of this as far as i can tell and you achieved great results for the players this letter though come on its the opposite of what the clear majority of players said in june in any event on the whole i would vote for you again  if you were offering to run i think the csm got suckered into ccps agenda a bit here but you would start to see straight eventually step back and you will see where tiny montgomery is coming from
it was just to point out that incarna will be optional regardless how much ccp tries to enforce it taedaze listed everything but incarna in eve as optional i just said it will be optional as well if you really truly hate it with every fibre of your body and dont want to participate just find a playstyle where you never have to dock
i know i am a new player in the grand scheme of things and i know that i do not speak for anyone other than myself but as this has become a huge issue and i have heard far more experienced players voice their opinion but not many newer players like me a lot of you guys and gals have noted that there is little or no use to incarna and perhaps for the experienced players there wont be it will just be something you see for 30 seconds while you switch ships to go blow some poor person up but as a newer player i believe that this at least has the makings to be very useful to the newer player it could be a place that can give you direction a place to see and understand before being thrown to the wolves i tried to start this game once before and stopped simply from the fact that it was so open ended i had no idea what to do now that may seem ignorant and make me sound stupid but it is the truth at least at the beginning you need some kind of go here do this to at least know how to do the various things if you are searching for a way to actually make a reason for it think of this if it even adds a tenth of the amount of people that currently play the game to the universe then is more then there are now and that means more people to blow up for the experienced players and a more enjoyable experience being blown up for newer players like me because no matter how enjoyable a game is you need to have n0obs to make it better just my thoughts
ghost minerthe tutorials will help you learn how to play eve its hard to see how you can better learn to fly a spaceship while in a stationno one doubts that incarna will add players who would like a game where they walk around in a space station but at least as of june of 2010 that was not our playerbase indeed its pretty clear that the time and resources spent on incarna will cost eve at least some of its current players there are many players who continue to play with the hope that ccp will someday improve whatever it is they currently do for me its faction war the june summit minutes forced everyone to realize that whatever it is they would like done will almost certainly not get done for 18 months that sucked to hear and more than a few quit but some of us have decided to ride out the 18 months now we get a csm letter that says flesh out incarna which can be interpreted as asking that they should do more with it than they already planned well  no that is the complete opposite of the views of the players that i had read back in june the csm should represent the players that elected them for the reasons i set forth in my prior post this letter does not entirely do that and in some ways completely contradicts the players outcry
i think the biggest problem here is people dont know the difference between lag and bad fpstbh i think the lag issues are under control and large fleet framerateframerage is bad at least on common systems im on a q6600 with geforce 9800gtx and its literally unplayable in some fightsi think more attention needs to be payed to framerate performance and scaling down visual effects  3d models automatically to improve framerate and ui responsiveness also the option to specifically select what visual effects we see would be great ie so i can hide all the sebo effects only etc tldr more graphics more options to turn them off preferably optionally automatically and audio amarr kchhhhhhkchhhhhh
whoha hold that quote it always struck me as more odd than usual that ccp after having presented a pretty nice demonstration of incarca or walking in stations at the time to suddenly announce that they have scrapped the current concept and would make it something else instead ever since i saw this post in the mission forum i have had a bad feeling about the direction of the concepti fully support the message of the csm and the last line of your quote in particular helicity
still stuck in the bar at the galaxy pub where you more then welcoe to visit me for some qa  and ofc a cold one
hi miogarsormri fully support your motto more quality less quantity
a great concept and a great goal to work for as csm i like it and you have my vote
why is there a peter powers ad on my killboard when i pay for no ads
the evsco guys where so kind to put up a notification for my campaignits not an ad perse its the notification system they usually use for news and suchwith my campaign focusing on 3rd party development and killboards being one of the most used3rd party applications they have the best interest of their customers at heart when recommending to vote for me
vote for peterdont let the nc take over the csm as well as 00
its bogus is what it is
dont think its the place to whine about something at the top of your killboard  do you
i most definately think it is i will also be blogging about this abuse of power
what is your experience in dealing with disparate groups of individuals and getting them to perform on given tasks in addition what is your experience in convincing those who have more control than you come to see things your way real world and virtual world pleasei do not mean this as a joke or an attempt to discredit you these are the key things i am looking for in a candidate for this position
in my job i have successfully coordinated teams up to 14 people including external developers id love to give a few examples about how exactly i got us budgets times or solved other problems however most of that stuff falls under nda that i signed and respecti have been involved with several open source projects in different roles and when php4 came out i tend to believe that quite a bit of what lead to the zend engine being under a proper opensource license was due to the community work  campaigning that i did back then zend the company who build phps runtime called zend engine planned to release it under a kind of properitary license back then zend used to advertise with the slogan zend  where php meets business the discussion was pretty stuck in its trails so i put up a banner on a webpage having a logo like theirs saying zimt  where php meets needs alot of the larger php related sites back then adopted the banner and the zend guys suddenly felt the need to send someone to a usergroup meeting to talk to us about what we want well the rest is history and nowadays php is one of the most successfull opensource projects arroundin my free time im a member of a political party and have been for several years well i recently switched parties but thats a different story that alone teaches one quite a bit about how to work with people and how to push forward new ideas even if there is resistance at first
i am your union representative vote for me
i voted for you with my accounts because youre an idiot forum troll and the csm needs people on it who dont take it seriously
1 vote for my friend windy 
oh no its a goon invasion1
is it about this point in the campaign where im supposed to try some complicated mittens  trebor style post to convince you not to vote for me i dont get how that works but all the cool kids are doing it so block vote manipulation is clearly the way forward
tbh the only voice of reason in this campaign roc would be a close secondwindy to secure my vote please answer the following questionsteak or prawns 
were separate entities now
twiglets see im even antiestablishment when it comes to answering food questions
what is your experience in dealing with disparate groups of individuals and getting them to perform on given tasks in addition what is your experience in convincing those who have more control than you come to see things your way real world and virtual world pleasei do not mean this as a joke or an attempt to discredit you these are the key things i am looking for in a candidate for this position
oh god this is like a job interview wait it is a job interviewrl examples are kind of pointless because its the internet and i can make stuff up for what its worth im a departmental manager for one of the uks largest firms and management responsibility for several teams and about 20 individuals managing the politics and personalities of the corporate world is sadly by bread and butter in the virtual world i think my greatest success in convincing people who dont agree with me to see things my was was my phenomenal campaign to get sons of tangra to reimburse hurleys titan it just hasnt happened yet i was also the mastermind behind the bee gone campaign to rid the game of goonfleet judge the success of that for yourself
there are no goons
theyre called nondisclosure agreements for a reason because you know disclosures are limited under the terms of the agreement the idea that theyd expose themselves to lawsuits to gain a superficial advantage in internet spaceships is absurd
be sure you will get all three of my votes
may your hand be led by the clarity of consciousness
voting is now open i encourage everyone to vote
voting is now open cast your vote for helen highwater today
a vote for me is a vote for common sense in the csm tell your friends reactivate your accounts and click this button
i like your stance helen highwater i wish more people would wise up and work with the system rather than try to defeat itim curious about your feelings toward something and i want to stress that im not asking how you would present this to the csm im just curious what you think about the issue known as the thousand papercuts projectregardless of your answer i will say that ive already decided whether or not i will vote for you and best of luck on the election
hi helencan you explain why the voter base should respect you as an individual or trust any words coming from you i am concerned given multiple sources pointing back to comments you have made regarding another delegate and linked so kindly by the mittani specifically using discriminatory words to describe someone based on sexual orientation such actions bring into question your professionalism and integrity comments
i think there are a bunch of small quality of life features that could and should be worked into the schedule by ccp im aware of akita ts thousand papercuts project and its something i support i was pleased when ccp recently announced there would be a patch entirely composed of small fixes along these lines my concern is that these miniexpansions while welcome may be counterproductive in the long term as there may be a tendency to hold off on small fixes until there are enough ready to go that can be bundled together id rather see them added as bonus fixes to existing releases where possiblei do not use sexual orientation pejoratively on the goonfleet forum i speak to an audience using terms appropriate for that audience i would not use those terms outside of that context in that context it has nothing to do with sexual orientation it is simply a commonly used term of disparagement that has long since shed its original meaning to that audience in any case i am strongly opposed to discrimination or prejudice based on sexual orientation and do not intend for my words to be interpreted as hostile to others on that basis
i find it interesting to note that there are a lot of people posting to this thread against helen though not one of them is able to give reasons why we should not vote for him beyond specific small circumstantial itemsevents i want to know why you dont like him is it just because his stance is popular and looks good in any case i am not ignoring these minor comments rather they help to reinforce the idea that people should vote for helen  if none of his enemies can come up with anything bad to say about him then why should i be against him
youre absolutely right sometimes i feel like many of them are being ignored but it might just be that ccp isnt ready to fix them yet there could be any number of reasons that we the players dont understand that are delaying their implementation still i like to keep pointing these things out to them thats what gets these things highlightedregardless of my undisclosed vote i definitely support helen highwater for csm
thanks for your support dont forget to tell your friends too for csm 4 and 5 i missed out on a full delegate spot by less than twenty votes each time so every single vote counts
hi iainsaying hello and wish you good luck
thanks rene renUFFFD good luck to you too
youve got my vote
thats right the head scammer himself the mittani is running for csm all those goon scams that screwed trillions out of people ruined the game for many and still scam even today are all from the head guy the mittani yet he is running for csm do we want the top scammer in eve himself representing the people of eve in fact when you check the list you see a few other goons running for csm scammers who have no shame and laugh and ridicule the innocents who have be conned by them if you look in to goon history from other mmos all they car about is griefing gamers in all the games they are in and they have done it i say lets send them a large message and vote for more qualified non scamming people to represent us
yes please send your votes to the mittani
not that ive bothered with scamming myself but scams are an integral part of what makes eve awesome deal with it
while i do not personally like scamming it is a valid part of eve online that dark addictive mistress that we must serve
smug
i personally do not scam i grief and i metagame as well as indulging in sadism and megalomaniamy alliance happens to be some of the most effective scammers in eve though
the only reason i dont scam is because i dont need isk
scamming is awesome deal wit pubbies
lol ofc i dont believe anything you say i am sure you dont scam just your alts eh lol regardless you are the leader of them all you approve of it and represent it you are guilty of it even if you dont scam which of course you do well maybe not anymore since you have scamemd so much you dont need the isk but ofc by your own admission you enjoy it so i doubt that you dont scam you can try to pretend you are some great person of the people but you are not you only represent the few in eve who scam and grief
i was wondering what the csm candidates stand is on rebalancing the hybrid weapons platform namely rail guns as right now they rails are the most useless weapon in eve and the player base has been after ccp to fix them for some time yet nothing ever appears to get done about it so i was wondering what each of the candidates stand on this issue is and would they be willing to bring it to the attention of ccp when they meet with them later on for me this is an important issue because its just another case of ccp ignoring the player base and working on more useless fluff like this officer quarters
update with a new blog
got my votecpp should support wine as an official platform for linuxbsdsolarismacos and scrap the stuff from transgamingsimple as that and to be honest i doesnt care that this is a single topic thing there will be plenty of other people in csm that whine about lag and stuff
i think that someone going into csm not really knowing what to expect or do with it is most likely to vote on changes as they see fit at the time unlike the s from the major alliances that are likely to vote heavily on 00 crap
because the csm council of stellar management are not the ctm council of terrestrial managementtbh dust 514 might interact with eve but its a completely separate game i dont see why the csm a group devoted to the betterment of eve should give a  about other games the company has planned they might care if it drains resources from eve but with incarna coming so soon tm i cant see that being the casei really expected incarna to come long after dust i look at this as a welcome surprise
well first of all team pi is not the whole of ccp  so its the planetary interaction team that has the highest priority on dustdust and pi have been named to go hand in hand actually pi was called preparation for dust a few times before so its logical that the pi team is now working on this integrationnow you can argue that pi itself could use some work because while it is an income source there is little fun in doing it  however i have high hopes that with dust being connected to eve in pi pi needs to change a bit anywaysalso personally i rather see them putting efford in the evedust connection then into incarna while i dont see how incarna improves what eve is about dust should introduce a few features that actually add to the gameplay that we knowthe only thing that i could think of to bring up with ccp about dust would be to ask them about more information on how dust will impact eve but from what i have gathered so far they are still working that out
folks i would not be afraid of dust instead embrace it because from what ive read it will expand the world of eve it is an added dimension where you can go there yourself and some day interact with those that are there from your spaceship or station some day when technology permits it will mean walking on planets a far step more than the current planetary interaction we have it is a future only eve have the possibility of bringing to life at this point only because of the uniqueness of eves online gameplay style it is the way to go and it is in the end for us
if you want my vote can you please tell em what you are going to do for the black op ships as they are not very useful atm they need a buff and have been for over a yearso my questions are when are the black ops going to get their jump range boost when are they going to use less fuel and most important when are covert cyno going to be allowed to be activated in empireso if yall can explain to me how are yall going to make this happen because there are more titans than black opsand i think every black op pilots would agree with me on this make this happen so black op pilot will have more use for the ships than to sit in a station collecting dustthakswolftin21
i own a redeemer and agree that something needs to be done about black ops ships there are a lot of balance issues that ccp has been ignoring bo ships are one of many they need to devote some time and effort into making bo ships more useful and used
that is a ship class that needs luvin to be sure i think as a csm i am going to continue support that ccp regularly review and rebalance ships over the course of a year id also ask ccp to be able to clearly describe the intended role of any ship where it fits how it works in that role and why its worth what the market expects to sell it forweve seen to many ships sit for too long in the wtf is that thing even good for or just as bad that thig is an i win button state and its time for ccp to commit to taking managing ship roles more seriouslyissler dainze
i cry everytime i look at the widow sitting in my hanger and remember how useful the ship is ie not usefulthis ship class has so much potential but it is all unrealised due to the prenerf that has not been removedi believe this ship class is on a lot of csms agendas and would expect the next csm to be bringing it up to ccp again i believe but as to ccps reaction to it coming round again well that is with themif i get elected i will certainly keep pushing ccp for a satisfactory answer
lol black ops ships are used all the time although i agree that resists and jump range should be slightly boosted to say they are useless is wrongpick your bridging fleet better to use them as a solo pwnmobile is wrong an important part of the fleet for example are blockade runners to tell the truth with a decent fleet you can move around enemy space with impunity and strike with deadly effectsi would love to see the two aspects i mentioned buffed slightly but there are far more important things to sort via the csmvote for trebor he is concerned for player led improvements not power block monopolies
i must admit that i am conflicted about black ops this is because i absolutely love the concept of black ops ships ive trained black ops to iv even though ive never flown onei would love to see black ops buffed and because of the november prioritization crowdsourcing ccp knows you do too  black ops buffing was the 4th most popular item on the entire csm backlog and after the csm filtered the results it rose to 2amazingly a huge number of players want a black ops buff despite the fact that like me almost none of them actually fly them so ccp has been given a strong message  lots of players will fly them if they get buffednow all that remains is for it to get slotted into the pipeline hopefully well hear something soonwhat is the conflict i mentioned at the start simple if csm gets consulted about possible black ops buffery i would have to be very careful to avoid advocating buffing them too much
apart from that last part i completely agree vote for me insteadi cant fly black ops yet but ive been in black ops gangs flying both sb and recon and theyre damn fun also been dropped by a black ops gang and while i got toasted it was still fun they are definitely something you cant do properly without a decent sized gang of sbs recons blops or just half a dozen or so black ops ships but that gets damn pricey and not quite as effective and support cloaky transports which emphasises the need for cooperative play i keep harping on about eve being truly massively multiplayer which to me says that black ops ships work for what they are intended  sneaking around behind enemy lines coordinating play with other playersthey should not be a solo ship they are not designed as such and they fulfil the role they were designed for pretty well as i see it
as your alliance has been the last couple of successful blops drop we have been involved with i admire your supportdropping multiple supercarriers onto a few cruiser hulls though tells me that you really dont understand how eve worksfollowing on from that why on earth would i vote for you
i will just clarify a bit i am not saying the ship is completely useless they have a use but that use seems to be making covert bridges for bomber or blockade runnerswhen i hear black ops i envision ships ships that sneak behind enemy lines and cause chaos and mayhem maybe not huge damage but they distrupt people plans they direvert resources and attention from other areas and this is what i see lacking with the current blackops ships they have none of the flavour none of the mayhem and chaos they should inspire
get some better trained corpmates maybe
you may address me as sir and respond in the form of yes sirno sir
i came here expecting a complete guide to mud and all you gave was some boring political  
its not mudslinging if you actually are an idiot and some of your ideas could easily be taken as evidence especially since helen is pretty sharpbut it is fairly clear what you actually want you want to be an amateur game designer you want to go to iceland and play the csm game the way ccp wants it played and your lack of tangible results will be hidden behind the nda id much rather the csm grew some teethhow you can actually show your face in public while trying to buy votes astounds me and crowdsourcing is a pretty flagrant attempt to sell the dream that the csm is all about getting my pet idea adapted
trebor id like to ask about your game experiences and contributionsi think its safe to say that mittani is running alongside you in terms of popularity his thread has attracted over 300 hundred replies the bulk of his experience comes from playing for a couple of years and in that time refining spy politics he moved on to writing a column for ten ton hammer wherein he makes statements about the state of the game un no uncertain terms and today runs one of the largest alliances in the game and now has his eyes on having the chair positionseleene has experience as a player for one of the more successful alliances in eve a csm deligate an employee and now wishes to sit on the csm with little stated for aspirations for chairing any reasonable player can see that hes a solid contender with broad experience hes earned the endorsment of yourself and mittani as a possible member of the csmmany of the current delegates have suggested that youd make a good chair candidate and you appear to be aspiring toward this position can you summerize the scope of your eve experience include your csm work  i think wed like a complete snapshot
lol being a professional game designer isnt enoughhe is only buying votes because he doesnt have a null sec coalition ready to vote for whoever he tells them to vote for
last i checked init was a pretty sizable bloc also eve doesnt have political parties which largely do the same thing democracy is inherently a selfish expression of opinions as the voters are asked to back the candidate that best represents their own personal goals or ideals it is inherent in the process that people will rally around a candidate that focuses on their aspirations labeling the nullsec blocs in that way is spinsterish at best and ignores the heart of the democratic process in allowing voters to choose the candidate that best suits them rather than the candidate that best suits you blocs will vote for their internally raised candidates precisely because they represent the goals andor ideals that the bloc stands for likewise empire voters and lowsec voters should and do rally behind candidates that espouse the ideals of the players in those areas my critique of trebor was based on research conducted on his own public comments and the reports of people who had a close working relationship with him i was careful to be concise and presented the material in a manner that reflected the audiences i was speaking to the end result is that trebor is a bad choice for csm for anyone who wishes to continue the success that csm 5 started in terms of having a receptive ccp staff who would actually pay attention to and use the csm as a stakeholder development partner as the stakes go up so should the scrutiny of the csm candidates if this were csm 3 and we knew that ccp in fact didnt give a rays ass about the csm then this would be unnecessary for the record i voted for mittani once and vile rat three times commence the mittani alt trolling
most everyone else that has ran for csm in the past claims to be a game designerprogrammerwhy should i believe this guy
courthouse for what its worth i can appreciate you digging up the details but i was concerned with the way you presented details that werent volunteered in the public record first and second the way you volunteered the opinion of someone who is running but who was not interested in having their own opinions aired outyou packaged things up in a way that people will hear it thats a halfhearted description of finding a way to run a scandal ragquality series of posts look at how bad this guy is he even does that oh what a rube if you have reason to question a candidate use their post as a reason to ask about their views  let them answer or optionally hang themselves for ithey guys i think ill post a thread now
helens opinion was disseminated to other forums by others first while it hadnt made the rounds at eveo yet it was there for interested parties to find in my view that made it already a part of the public record and i copied it here i referenced the origin of the record instead of a secondary or tertiary source to remain as credible to the original source as possibleall information i posted was obtained from public searches of evesearch shc the csm wiki hosted on eveonlinecom and the relevant links provided from those sources ie his homepagetrebor had been asked about a few of these ideas before and he avoided answering them much as he does in many of his answers here on shc etcobviously it would have done no good to directly cp the post i made to goonfleetcom to here because the writing reflected the nuances and lingo that readers and posters to goonfleetcom use i modified the post to shc and kcom to reflect the audiences there i distilled the information down to base factual records with a supported conclusion in my post here such that any criticism could be offered against the barest of facts and not critiques of my grammarprosepersonal biasi dont expect people to actually click those links and read the garbage that trebor has spewed on these forums for the past couple years let alone come to the same conclusions that i and many others since have come to but it would be difficult to argue against me via the points i bring up because the lions share of words are trebors and helens not mine i merely consolidated them into two concise and pointed posts and offered a logical conclusion based on the information provideddid i pick and choose my references sure evesearch gives 35 pages of responses when you search out trebor on shc he has something like 700 posts i couldnt possibly have included all of them because 98 of them are irrelevant to this discourse in the first placethe ones selected were done so because of the specific relevance to this csm election and his recorded opinions and ideas on development or balance issues that as a csm member he would have a voice in any future discussions ofedit if theres mud being slung here its because trebor mixed it up placed it in the launcher and stood in front of it hoping that no one would pull the leveri pulled the lever
when you pick and choose you are editing as such you are not presenting the barest fact but your own opinion in others words
if i had selectively quoted his posts or paraphrased as you have you would be right rather i presented his posts in complete contextyoure bad at the trolling and only making the trebor fanatics look more zealous and desperateif you want to discuss the veracity of my claims i welcome the challenge trolling however is not what im doing here today
for some definitions of completeeg a link to a post and your interpretation of what it say does not equal to complete context especially when that interpretation completely misses aspects such as context irony and brainstorming
is english your second language i have to ask because your argument would make sense then as english does tend to have rather bad adjectives for specificitycomplete context in this instance refers to the presentation of trebors posts in their original form with all preceding and following posts visible i could have made screenshots of just his singular posts and referenced those but not having the thread available would have been editorializing his context i did not do thatokay so context is taken care ofirony the irony here is that im the only one making sound logical arguments in this threadirony checkbrainstorming
how typicaland how typical for goons to derail yet another thread into mudslingingthout i do have to say in todays politics mudslinging seems to be a valid weapon it also indicates clearly that the side that does the slinging feels weak and as such needs to revert to this kind of tacticsa lot of people will vote trebor to spite goons some will vote him because he got high credits from other csmfact is that trebor contacted helen and that way defused a volitile situation and helped clear things enough so they could reach the endgoal exactly what i see in a chairmanwomansomeone who leads  assists  meetings to help reach the endgoals

nope english is actually my third language and on topic my fifth language japanese has taught me quite a lot about the subject of contextfirst of all linking to a thread does not infuse your interpretation of his post with context let alone complete your interpretation of his posts are necessarily the product of the context of your views as those are what read interpreted and produced the statements about trebors views they are your views of his views not hiswhy is this important well because when i read his posts my interpretation was wildly different from yours that is because complete context is not just a thread full of text it is also youso you could not possibly have the complete context by just posting a hyperlink
i have no problem with people honestly disagreeing with me in fact i appreciate it for it challenges my positions and makes them better and before anyone asks i checked dierdra vaals vote match and all of the candidates who i mentioned in the op have significant differences with my profileone of the reasons mynxee was such an extraordinarily effective csm chair was that she was far more interested in getting stuff done than getting credit for getting stuff done the next chair would be wise to follow her examplethe lottery was just something i did for fun and you will note that not only is there no way for me to tell whether or not someone voted for me but it is specifically designed so that people can scam and get extra entries this is eve after allhowever i cannot in good conscience stop the lottery for one very good reasongiven the number of goons who have entered the lottery if i shut it down it is entirely likely that they would drag me into a bathroom at fanfest and give me a swirlyfinally with regard to questions about myself and my campaign i refer you to my campaign page or thread this thread is not about me it is about the effects of the smear campaign directed at me upon other deserving candidates
youve been my corpmate for how long and you still expect drama
youre wrong because i know 5 languages and understand what context really is doesnt provide a clear definition of contextyou set up your credentials just fine but didnt actually make an argument the following paragraph that was separated by a quote as to suggest a reply to a different part of the post and thus a different thought was barely a sophists case on interpretation which was equally misaligned from what would commonly be called a logical argument but ill attempt to round the edges for you and hopefully your next reply will fill in the blanks youre incorrect because youre arguing that context is the same as interpretation it is not context would refer to his words that were posted within the scope of the thread being discussed as the preferring comments andor discussion would have prompted that particular reply unless provided by the author there is no reasonable or rational expectation that a reader of a written piece will understand the personal interpretations of wither the author or other readers this is the absolute philosophical core of the study of literature in historical context trevor didnt provide an introspective footnote detailing his mental exercises he went through or how he hoped his piece would be taken in lieu of words that may be misinterpreted at a later time the reasonable step for a reader is to take the words at face value in context of the thread in this case and discussion that was occurring around where he made his comments you brought up irony before and ill address that a little more seriously here i believe your claim may be that one or more of his suggestions were done as ironic asides not necessarily as serious recommendations if i were to accept that argument how many ironic asides are we allowing for these csm reps to have i detailed many badly thought up ideas that he has shared over the last few years most of those he posted about more than once but there seemed little point in indexing his entire posting history i personally dont believe that they were ironic at all offthecuff maybe ill grant that but then he ran with them as if it were some holy whimsical writ in the end theyre bad ideas that would be bad for eve trebors abject refusal to address serous concerns regarding past posting made by him in light of his having spent the last year on the csm where he may have learned something important or had an experience that changed his mind on x y or z issue where his previous posts would no longer be relevant because of a b or c reasons is a deafening silence
for the last few months bots have been heavily discussed on the forums and yet only one candidate clearly sets getting rid of macrobots as one of his nine priorities
me
the entire of csm 5 has been working to get ccp to allocate more resources to the fight against bots right from the beginning of our term during the june summit for example i had several informal conversations with ccp devs about botting and rmt and still more at subsequent meetingsthere has also been an ongoing thread in the csm internal forum on the topicccp recognizes that fighting bots deserves more resources and they have started to allocate them ccp sreegs will be making a presentation on the subject at fanfesti discuss my position on botting and rmt in this post in my campaign thread and mention what ccp sreegs is up to at the end of this post
only one i think every csm candidate has concern about macro useits one of my main issues
its always been one of my priorities and weve finally made some progress therewell see later how that turns out but ill definitely keep pushing to get rid of them
that is not what the same list i see i seereducing powerblocks vacuumsa kudo reward system for alliancesa fair chance to empire corporations alliances to settle in 00 spacei believe that but i was a little disappointed that only one had that explicit concern on the message on the voting list and yes you may even have talked about that in the forums before but 95 of eve community doesnt know thatthanks for a great response
vote for trebor reelection 
i am not really fond of most council member at all and the fact ccp is limiting players rights and gmae playing due to pirates in high sec and the looting going on everywhere with little to no resonse to concord but yet if you by a ship that was stolden from another corp you get hammered even if you had no knowlege of it so the bullies csd and ccp fubar anyone at any time with little regarde to players and only there pockets so he forth i will be challegeing any parties whoo will cause unduely grief stealing and scamming also rulles that need to be put into effect to police the systems better and to keep all pirates and looters at arms reach away so that honorable players have no need to worry about ganking from lowwer class pilots to make a name form themself or selfs this in some players eye will look like a  sesion but no its not i have been playing this game for 5 years now and little has changed on the pilots behavior some good some bad and others are just gankers and ers also this new part of joining corps or alliances and stealing from them is also a dishonorable thing witch all that do that should be banned forever in eve it is possiable to do good and treat new players well and teach the ins and outs of the game if ccp has the balls for incursion maybe they should set good standing against bad that would be a great battle enough said good luck to all and fly safe as for the griefers die quickly your boring me null

as someone who was a big fan of the csm in the past i would like to open this discussion and i would like to know csm candidats opinion about my open letter to ccp i do think i make a resonable point witch should be discussable i have put this in jita speakscorner because i believe i belongs here so future csm canditas be honest and tell me what u think and i have a few buddies with alooot of accounts willing to votemy letterdear ccp somehow i lost my urge to vote after running a black op assemly hall for over 16 months in those 16 months it got twice the attention of the csm and u in iceland devs in general of speaking it got voted on second place in assemply hall voting thingy a while ago yet i see no changesi have asked a few times if it got noticed by u devs in general yet no replyso im sorry to say that my opinion is that i can not be botherd to vote for csm anymore its a joke in my eyes if u dont agree with me prove me other wise or do u think 16 months is a too little time to make changes or make a comment we are looking into it ecthemmo playing eve for 25 yrs
short answer nodiscussions are good well thought out ideas are good general consensus among contributors to your thread is also goodhowever none of these things alone will make changes actually happen there needs to be a whole lot of things lined up for time to actually be spent on making additionschanges theres consideration to the impact on the game development time it will take and therefore take away from other things the possibility that any changes will drastically change existing gameplay ccp managements strategic goals for the game and of course whether the devs see it as a good idea at all anywaythis particularly applies when it comes to tweaking a ship class  something that is rather subjectivecsm isnt there to get every idea through to being developed its there to put forward what the representatives feel are the best which are not necessarily the ones that are popular on the forums changesadditions that ccp could make and to act as the first line of player feedback to ccp on what ccp are planning to do hopefully heading off disasters before they go into developmenti see having csm delegates who are intimately familiar with game and general softwaremultimedia development concerns as incredibly important which is why im standingregardless dont get disillusioned about csm  it provides players a united representative voice we should do everything we can to use it
i see csm something like a union as imigo montoya stated voice of players but with no actual power tbh i dont think it meant to have power in the first place ccp is a profitable company and as company they make annual plans what they will do what they will achieve during the year and so on if ideas of csm are according to ccp plans then those ideas see the light otherwise no
i prefer the conciseness mittani is a lawyer who likes to bloviate too much for the sake of reading his own words peeps that run for csm wo knowing anything about it and who think they are gonna change the world little obamas end up being a huge disappointment i imagine those of you who have served on the csm previously know of other members who turned out to be worthless i did see mention about peeps being tired of the meeting if they paid attention yes
essentially mittani and i share a lot of views but electing a single rep who believes one thing or another isnt enough if you want to have any chance of making points to ccp and have them listen you have to have a united front so to speak if the csm was stacked with reps that had similar ideas to the mittani or he has similar ideas to anyone else without saying one or another copied anybodys platform message then the csm might get a lot done in terms of fostering postive development as well as breed a new respect within ccp for the role the csm could play as a voice of the community so why should you vote for me the mittani is the goonboss hes gonna get elected pretty much guaranteed but do you really trust an unchecked goon really no offense to my goon compadres r3drum 3 but id prefer someone a bit more moderate and introspective
i will forward you all to my more recent post on specific platform info thanks for continued commentary good to see peeps care about the process it also counters the comment about united front but not all from 00
you can vote on her now
well the elections on so its once again time for me to advertise the csm public chat channel ingame this channel has been around since the csm3 election and lots of past representatives and current candidates hang out in it if anyone wants to poke their head in for a chat wed love to see some new faces
i can read i just cant type im glad you pointed that out so i could change it and keep from looking like too big of an idiot too late i knowi understand that the csm is more of a sounding board than a tool of retro change i guess the point that i wanted to make is that there have been some change that have occurred in the past that i would have liked to have seen go a different way however there are some things that are still in place that i would like to see developed or others just left alonei am not against bettering the system bit not at the risk of losing the things that players enjoy and look forward to i will admit i dont know all of the little issues but like i said i have a life that requires my time outside of eve i have been reading the csm reports from the past and am about half way through but that just leads to the point that i made before there area lot of us in eve that dont have the hours on end to keep up with everything thing i read the expansion notes and the dev blogs every day at lunch and in the evening i run missions there is a lot to learn and i am willing to take the time to learn it in order to serve on the csm i feel there is a demographic here that has been forgotten and that needs a voice i want to be that voicei appreciate your comments and i want to hear more am i so far off in my opinionand i am not a carebear but at the same time i dont see killing newbs at first sight a sport or an accomplishment an apocalypse against a reaper is not a challenge its like hitting a kid on a tricycle with a landrover i wasnt in the reaper or the apoc but i saw it happen 
poses need love
they need to be unnerfed wrt to ship stats resistshpfittinghardpoints etc then their jump range needs to be increased to something reasonable less than a capitalclass ship for sure but more than it is now an actual useable range i mean currently black ops need to make two covert cyno jumps to go about 5 or 6 systems in some cases its so bad
another round of free gametime come on devs make me want to come back for real til next time 
people keep talking about changes to 00 adding more ways in to 00 or changing the capspoint here is fact is dont change anything with caps just plain and easy give them more things to do in game more specialization options
today is the 2 year anniversary of this postanyone with a decent size monitor would at the very least concede that the size of the font is horrible the ability to customize the displayed font is tantamount to have a successful uithe player community has asked for this longer than the shortcut change that was implemented and requires roughly the same development resources in terms of who would write the code and the code layers that will be impactedplease fix this please
old cynos were awesome i remember the first time i saw one 2007 or so i was a noob barely out of a rifter i undocked from my corps home station in half and saw that there was a nidhoggur carrier outside the station i was like wow thats pretty cool really big and awesomethen it cynoed out in a vortex of lightning and noise back when people used sound in eve and i was so excited it was the coolest thing id ever seen in the game i was like cynoooooo in corp chatanyway i moved on and over the years gathered a disdain for capitals deciding that i was going to be a subcap only pilot also there wasnt much chance of me affording one last year i grew tired of having no access to the easy logistics a carrier of my own would bring of course by then all that would happen is the dull bloop as the ship goes invisible and plops into a pond before the next system loads it kind of saddens me that i never got to see and hear that dramatic thunder and lightning effect on my own shipedit oh i guess ive already supported this moral support
agree  get it back to the cool way
supported possibly again but its not like ccp have done anything
jaguar should get an ab bonus  everything else
i support jiggly boobs but let us not forget the plight of the jiggly ass that should not be left behind either
hehyou said behind
in between your biting sarcasm you make a good point if a caution window were to pop up after the uninject button is selected it would act as a safety net this would be like the same caution windows that pop up when you try to attack a neutral target in high sec space it still makes sense
why would you ever want to throw away skill points your example doesnt even make sense
it does though as stated in my original suggestionmany players are given default skills that they have not trained nor will ever train you will not lose any skill points because you did not put any on it to begin with so why have the skill makes sense to me
and only you
supportedcaldari industrial level 1 im looking at you
i can see why you might possibly want to do this for the limited benefit of being able to clear the trash out of your character sheethowever i like bang for your buck and while this wouldnt take heaps of buck ie development time to implement it also adds stuff all bang so isnt really worth ccp or csm time to take any furthernot supported
the only point to this i can see would be allowing players to transport valuable skillbooks for others in complete safety inject skillbooks podjump to alliance home uninject trade skillbooks to fellow playersi dont see why that would be a good thing
im not sure where anybody got the idea that the op specifically wanted to get the skillbook back i read it as just wanting to be able to remove the skillgetting the skillbook back however would make this exploitable in the extreme
why would we have the skillbook back because of the used term uninjectinjecting a skill you obtain a skill lvl0 and loose the skillbookuninjecting a skill logically would make you loose the skill and gain a skillbooklogically
i support being able to delete useless skills whats the point of having a bunch of halftrained mining and industry skills from 2006 on a pvp char that hasnt used said skills for 5 yearswe got the ability to delete old jumpclones why not this its just a logical extension
exactly that is how it is intended as stated above in my suggestion once the skill is uninjected it goes to a separate deletion window where it sits for 24 hours it cannot not be transferred or used from this deletion queue once 24 hours has passed you can then confirm deletion or restore the injected skill similar to the character deletion feature already used in the game
it is logical thanks for the support
my only issue with this is account hacking what would stop someone who hacks your account from just deleting all your skills
if you manage to hack an account just sell all characters its not worth deleting them once the original owner cant get his account back
now i do agree with your idea since its clear of misunderstanding
revising my original opinion since it is now more clear to me what you are actually asking fori dont see a problem with it but i also dont see the need deleting a skill uninjecting is not a good word for this  it has connotations involving skill books that you probably didnt intend simply for the sake of the appearance of your character sheet is a bit like ironing your bed sheets in the morning so theyll lay flatter on your bed you think it looks nice but no one else really cares about your sheets bed character or any other
now i do agree with your idea since its clear of misunderstandingthank you for your support
can i just lend you some tippex for your monitori genuinely cant understand why having a couple of not so useful skills is bothering you so much ocdi can however see how this could be a waste of time and a horrible thing to misclickit just seems like only a very small number of players could possibly want this selfnerf feature unless there is some kind of benefit to balance it out and none of the benefits are a good ideaseems like asking for the option to send your isk to devnull just to make it a round number
consistent ui design something eve lacks in a lot of areas is always a good thing
id like to see it for skills you have injected but never trainedmy ocd just cant cope with those level 0 skills that have been sat there for 2 years doing nothing
hey man i do really appreciate your support for this idea but im gonna ask you to stop bumping becausea if the forum mods see that string of bumps they might lock the topicb people are going to think youre my alt and im bumping my own threadc posting without supporting creates a kind of countersupport which people can see when they look at how many replies vs how many supports the topic has topics that traditionally have many more replies than supports show that many more people disagree with the topic and are posting their arguments against itd i have my own method for gathering support and directing people here that im constantly working on behind the scenes thanks so much for your evidently enthusiastic support though if you really want to help the best way is to get as many people as you can to post and click support
playing slowly beats playing terriblynot at all
thread cleaned of spam please do not bump this thread you are more than welcome to discuss the idea
right however currently all of that is arbitrary and unrelated to role or mass
i would say that is apart of how they go i use fof whenever i do 00 ratting solo in a raven most of the gangs that come in have a jam capacity so it still makes me a threat i have gotten quite a few kills that way changing them to be smarter will increase their use as a main pvp missile which is not what should not happen they fill a unique situation for missile ships that turret based ships cant enjoy it would be overpowering missile boats to do this

i wouldnt say it needs a nerf a rebalance maybe you still die pretty easily in them if you suck like me
i can agree with the speed nerf its pretty crazy but what if they just toned down the speed and buffed the other pirate frigates esp the succubus and worm i think it should be t1 frig ceptor faction frig  asault frig  destroyer pirate frig its not clear that the succubus and worm are where they should be daredevils seem ok but balancing them with ships of a different class does not seem appropriate dramiels are not just 70 mil to properly fit them with the grid restrictions i see them more in the 90 mil range if the problem is that they keep locking t1 frigates then maybe slightly nerf their lock time that would also make it so they do not replace interceptors im not sure the dram you describe is much better than a lol firetail havent really looked at it much though

good simple idea
doesnt everyone just use webs to instawarp and logoffski when anyone dangerous near gate
bolded the part that im going to address  scanning a computers memory is something that a lot of people consider and invasion of privacy so its not so simpleone of the issues with botting is that we dont really know exactly what it is that ccp are doing some of this is because if they publish how they are detecting bots then bots will evolve to behave differently some of it is for privacy reasons one thing i will push if elected to csm is simply publishing updates showing that they are actually doing something
a simple idea to reduce the profitability of bottingbots can currently be detected by some quite simple metrics  number of ships killed amount of ore mined etc etc bots tend to produce numbers which are highly unlikely or effcectively impossible to have been player driven the server should mark these characters potential bothaving been marked potential bot the character will upon random encounters with npcs 00 belt rats for instance discover that the belt rats are hitting rather hard on that occasion really hard so hard in fact that their ships are destroyed and fastthe wont know when it will happen but happen it will and they will lose the ship and their bot will fly around in a pod attempting to activate weapons which arent there this will have the effect of massively reducing the profitability of bottingthe engine which drives this could be geared to increase the frequency of death spawns over time on any character which continues rattingminingmissioning 237you may be concerned that genuine players could be caught out by this they can petition and explain their case but how many players do you know who are active at the keyboard for more than 8 hours a day every day the bot operators may petition too of course but they just earn themselves fasttrack permaban for wasting gm time word would spread fast enough

drones are so dumb right now these are some great ideas
okay i am looking at spaceship command skills and saying that is a lot of redundant skillbooks there are also flaws in consistencyfor perspective lets look at a real world pilot they start out with a smal single engine trainer something like a cessna they then train up to multi engine and eventually to larger and  or faster moving planes sounds a lot like eve right but here is where i see a divide from real life and eve you dont have to get a new license to fly similar planes from different manufacturers if you have a commercial and multiengine license you are legally qualified to fly a boeing and an airbus they are close enough that a small amount of training will actually make you very profficient in bothso  why do we have racial frigate cruiser battleship even capital ship skills why not a centralized system with specialization skills for each race drones have something like that it would reflect real world training as wellfor instance if i want to fly a logistics ship for the 4 races i have to train cruiser 5 for all of the races if i want to switch to matari ships from my original race gallente i have to go up a very lengthy chain to get comparable ships to what i have nowwhat i would like to propose to strip the race from the ship skills and instead use a racial spaceship specialization for tech 1 ships capital ships need advanced racial spaceship secialization improved racial spaceship specialization for tech 2 and elite racial spaceship specialization for tech 2 capitals in this way there is a clear vertical upgrade path for any ship with small forks in a realistic manner to specialize in a specific ship battleship as a skill still requires spaceship command to be fully trained and vast knowledge of smaller ships but the ship itself has a race specific skill reqwhy you may ask because eve is growing and so are the factions getting pilotable ships in the game players are also breaking 120k skillpoints by training multiple races as i have inferred i fly more then one race myself going foward we are going to get bogged down by confusing branches in an already large treeadding an ore spec skillbook for exmple allows us to consider adding similar ships to the orca and rorqual and only train the appropriate factions spec to fly themobviously this is going to ruffle a lot of feathers ccp would basically have to refund up to a quarter of a players skillpoints yes guessing on average along with any isk invested so they could repurchase the correct skillbooks ranks of skills that havent been touched since before launch day would have to be adjusted to compensate fo the new skillsbut in my humble opinion it is worth it to new players to have the oppertunity to go the path they choose and for veteran players to be able to diversify to adapt to eves dynamic sandboxthanksbobedit adding good ideas to the first postthis makes sense i can fly any frigate but i would need to understand the subtle differences in the races to fly it to its potential so instead of frigate having all the bonuses only generic bonuses could be applied to the generic skill any race specific bonuses in this example projectiles would actually be applied to the racial spec
i dont support this ideaif this ever made it into the game this racial spaceship specialization for tech 1 ships should take as long as training for every races t1 ship to that level for example training that skill to level 1 should be the same as training all the frigate cruiser destroyer battlecruiser and battleship skills to 1 and so on
i could support this as long as the ships bonuses were tied back to the racial specialization skill instead of the basic frigate for example skillso for examplefrigate 3 gives you the ability to fly a rifter or whateverbut you have to have minmatar frigate specilization if you want the bonus  points to small projectiles etcits the difference between being good at a lot of things or great at a few
i have a bad feeling this proposal wont work because eve always had this original setup for years it may seem simple to you but dont forget that eve online is a complex mmo with a learning cliff that is intentionally designed to not only level the playing field for everyone in terms of being able to pilot certain ship but its also designed to keep eve from being flooded by players who only want a fastpaced game
that is the basic idea a frigate would require the friggy skill and the racial spec skill the traditional spaceship command requirement would be removed in lieu of minmatar spaceship specialization i and spaceship command would be solely a prerequisite of the actual frigate skill in your examplealso i very much like where you are going with the you can fly it but not well angle that would actually make sense going to amend the original post with thatagain that is the idea it shouldnt take you longer to go up the skill tree for one race but there is no reason that if you know how to fly a battleship you cannot fly another races battleship with minimal familiarization flying it well however 
in real life there are not 4 completely different propulsion systems fusion ion magpulse plasma 4 completely different electronic systems gravimetry magnetometry radar ladar 4 completely different weapons technologies projectilehtbridenergymissiles 4 completely different capacitor technologys electrolyticoscillatorscalartesseract 4 different reactor technologies fusionnuclearantimattergraviton and so on armour and sheilds are also individual and distinct before you even consider each race will no doubt have designed everything with different specifications computer software and of course languagesflying a cesna does not qualify you to fly rockets scramjets and helicopters nor does it qualify you to use ladar magnetographs or sonar nor does it qualify you to use any sort of reactor
lore dont necessarily make for good game mechanics
nor does real life this proposal simply wants to cut down training time on advanced ships if you think this is a good idea i dont you can do it without trampling on the lore the fundamental premise is that a basilisk and a scimitar are somehow more alike than a scimitar and a munin which is wrong on so many levels
i dont support it the fact that there is a lot of potential sideways training is what makes it so new players have a shot at being competitive by focusing on flying one faction or even ship type well it also gives the different races more charactersince there is no skill cap there has to be skill sinks in the game wanting to fly some fancy faction ship you arent trained for is such a sink if they were made any easier to get into theyd have to nerf them back down to hangar decoration
do not supportit is more akin to piloting a russian fighter vs an american fighter yes similar and all your suport skills are great but you still need to train for that planealso how does piloting a caldari ship let you pilit a mimnitar ship that works on duck tape and hope
this is the best point under such a streamlined system spacialisation is hurt which gives less oppurtunity for new players to catch up or even overtake older players under the proposed system my 2003 char would probably be maxed for every subcap ship and even capitals if i read it right a new player could never have a better char than me for anything in the current system pretty much any new player who specialises is anything other than amarr bs can overtake me in their chosen specialisation this is how it should be
thats the thing it shouldnt but does atm the advanced ship skills cover all 4 factions the proposal is to make it cover only one faction but more ship within that faction
fully qualifying to fly a new type of a big commercial airplane is a big deal for a pilot and takes yearsbesides any rl analogies are barely relevant in the game
it doesnt take that long to crosstrain if your basic skills are in orderyou just need to place realistic goals instead of flying advanced ships from the very beginninghowever general usefulness of for example tech 1 logistic cruisers can be debated unlike tech 2 theyre not all remote repair support etc
so using your examplei am a pilot in the us air force i have extensive training in say an f15 eagle i am told that i am to train for a mig 29 for a covert mission are you saying that because i have flown twin engine jet fighters for several years minimum i cannot fly another twin engine jet at all that my experience as a pilot means nothing or are you saying like myself it should only be a small amount of specialized training to learn the nuances of the craftedit just so we are clearyou would need to train spaceship command to a certain level to enable a ship skill if it is a higher tier skill you also need the class below that but instead of training for frig  cruiser  battleship etc in each race you would train the appropriate racial secondary skill to either pilot a racial ship or receive bonuses havent decided on thatedit2my brother is a licensed pilot i know this but the idea that my knowledge in one battleship and all its prerequisites basically does nothing if i train another race doesnt make sense to me
real world aviation requires pilot have a type certificate for any aircraft over 12500lbs they fly therefore the current ship skills seem entirely appropriate given your real world scenario
the flaw with your argument is that a frig is the size of a boeing it takes maybe 5 minutes to crosstrain racial frigs there ya gotraining from a harrier to an f15 to a sherman tank to an aircraft carrier is probably rl analogues but even then still not there dont pretend story in game or rl has anything to do with what makes a good gamedoes it make sense to not have to crosstrain races not really no the system might be able to use a little bit of trimming up but the current system of encouraging specialization and thus cooperation is a good thing
different races ships are nothing like the difference between boeing and airbusits closer to the difference between the saturn 5 and the russian ship of the time not that close but theyll do you cant go from one to the other without hours of trainingin eve different race ships use completely different system setups and completely different direct interfaces not to be confused with the ui as that is generated by the pod like the difference between driving auto and stick
making isk is not go make a few bil and buy new char
hi i have a ship where i would like to fit ab but dont want to give up dpsneed all 3 painters so i was thinking maybe it would be nice that you can buy an extra slotslots on your ship for huge ammount of money depending on ship classbut without encreaseing power or cpu gridcause we all have uselles slots on ships mostly low and medium i mean the darked onesim new here and its a probably a bad idea cause i didnt think it throuand maybe that subject is already mentioned somewhere  but i proposed it anywaythank you
no why just put 3 reactor control units and 3 processor in 6 new low slots and pouf  enough pg and cpu to put 10 more weapons and create an uberpowered t1 cruiser who has almost the dps of a bss im not even speaking of t3 cruisers and i was not even thinking of dramiels and other faction ships
888 super caps 
this is one of those ideas that makes me question if the op has ever actually played the game
i have a idea for the corpses with implants basicly if the corpse you have has implants then you can train a skill to extract salvage parts for implants so that you may be able to manufacter implants
many people have suggested this over the years and i personally like the ideait would have implications for the lp store and the corresponding reduction of the isk sink thoughit would be best if there was a low success rate around 2 level perhaps  even a 10 chance of extracting an implant would make an unsalvaged corpse valuableperhaps the skillbook itself could be a semirare drop from certain sansha plexes that would fit in nicely with the eve lore
that would be pretty cool and a nice reward for a pvp kill with the pod  and having the corpseso you can get something from the corps1
yeah true about the market and lp for missions but i thought in this game players control the market and such with these new parts to make imparts would enhance more trading and manufactering
not supported people in null are on cheap clones anyway all it does is encourage disco bs gank in highsec while dropping implant cost now that all the implants formerly lost can be salvaged it adds nothing to the game or your bottom line
as above plus anything that can kill a pilot in their pod would reduce the contents of the skull to pulp even if exposure to vacuum didnt lets face it the idea of an intact corpse or even familiar looking body parts surviving a close encounter with the kind of weapon systems we use is ridiculous
whilst the idea is fairly novel and i for one would love to go around extracting parts from the multitude of corpses i own currently hovering around the 350 markwhat can i say its a fetishhaving to add all these extra items to the database as well as skills not to mention coding and testing these features i believe the time could be better spent on something else improving low sec nerfing unproabables etcsteps of his soapbox and drops two penneth in to the hat
the ew drones do need an overhaul but i think all the proposed numbers are way over kill i think slight modifications to effectiveness maybe 810 increases and primarily a drone optimal range increase would be most beneficiali will have to break down numbers to come up with something i think would really work but either way they do need to be looked atbalance eve and support manalapan
i am starting to agree with most people in this thread that removing stacking penalties would be a bad move however i do believe that they should be reduced so that the 4th and 5th ew drones are not essentially ineffectiveif ev drones are buffed up so that 5x ev300  1 small neut and 5x ev600  1 med etc there will need to be a stacking penalty to prevent swarmingi do believe a rclick set mode or rclick scan restargeting range damp target options are a better choice for sd drones than two different types of these drones sensor damping needs to be looked at in generalwhat if there were t2 versions of electronic warfare drones obviously ecm drones would have to be nerfed and the current version would be t2 strength
wowim pretty sure youve just said wildly inappropriate are smarter then a large percentage of eve
wowi cant even believe i am responding to this that is a terrible idea you are basically saying that high sec players do not matter have no mechanics that need fixing and shouldnt even play evesigh just because you are in 00 doesnt mean you are better than everyone
i proposethat the buttons on the left of the screen be click open click closemy reasons are that it would more efficient and user freindly but would not alter the game mechanics in any way the fittings button already has this facilityregardsspiro tass
this would be a great idea cant count the number of times ive click the button trying to close the window
i dont care which way it works either click always opens or brings to the top if open or click opens and closes if openi just dont want it to be different for different windowsin fact some windows change this behavior dependant on location cargo hold docked vs in spaceits extremely frustrating to have a uselessly inconsistant design on this simple ui action
proposing a basic unbonused point or scram on all ships which does not take a slot this brings pvp and pve fits closer
having to choose to sacrifice something else for a point or to not fit a point in order to fit something else is an important choice in pvp and i dont know why you would want to sacrifice that all it would do is boost ships which previously had to make that choice ewar ships logistics snipers neut boats none of which really need boosting it would also boost passive sheild tank ships ie drake to even higher hights than they are already at an extra med slot spare on a drake is a good thing really
those are blob ships they already have no points a basic t1 point would enable pve fits for pvp even if not any good at it the reason theres such a huge gap between pvp and pve fits in eve unlike all other mmos is point mechanics not having one on yourself or fleet vetos you for pvp having one should bring the level of riskaversion down in line with typical mmos
thats right they have no points if they wanted a point they would have to sacrifice something else you want to give them a free one thus boosting them the big gap between pve and pvp is not mostly down to point mechanics either its more to do with damage types tanking types weapon types prop mods and most importantly numbers i have never ever been in a situation where having a point on a pve ship would have let me kill an attacker there have been a couple of times i killed them even without a point though nor can i remember a situation where a pve ship i attacked would have killed me if it had a pointa ratting drake not going to kill that vaga even if it has a 20k point
the purpose is not to make pve fits just as good as pvp fits but to make it not a complete waste of time and yes this would likely decrease risk aversion it would be taking a shot at it instead of just pop out the ecm drones and fun for it since theres no reason to stay around the difference between small chance at winning and zero chance is actually huge
cue the blob of noob alts in shuttles tackling everything in sight
you are a really bad posterterrible idea
same reason ppl do it now in mass noobships with a point fitted which cost less than a shuttlethis is all about peoples need to engage carebears without taking any risk as theyre not pointed and can warp away at any time
i dont always point up as it is most people just assume they cant warp in my experience
this 99 assume you will have the point so not having the point gives you an advantage in that you dont waste a slot which is how it should be
you realize that will be a buff to pvp setups while it doesnt help pve setups at allthe pvp setup now has a free slot to fit more tank extra ewar cap injector or eccm the pve setup gains nothing as they dont need the point and typically are otherwise illequipped for combatyou just made it even easier to kill pve setups not supported
what kind of stats did you have in mind for the basic pointif its something like a 10km  1 point then ill support
 this
my issue is with people who scan down my mission site and start salvaging my wrecks while im still running the mission my proposal is that salvaging a wreck should be the same as looting a wreck if someone doesnt want them they can be abandoned if they do want them it gives them a chance to keep them
yeh why not and then when all the missioners like you shoot the ninja salvager and they come back and pop your expensive mission ship can you not come and ask for it to be changed back
why are you assuming the wrecks are yours
not this againccp has stated time and time again that salvaging works exactly the way they intended it to work they arent stealing your salvage because its not yours until you turn on a salvager and suck it up into your holdfrankly what they need to do to stop all this crap is separate the loot can from the wreck  make all wrecks immediately blue and the loot cans are owned
disable ownership for anything unanchored in space
i would really love if it returned to the way it was where it was harder to be probed down if you were inside a mission complex now any douche in a t1 frig can probe out a mission runner and make more isk than if hed found an actual complexsalvage thieves are an annoying hassle its too easy to do but i dont think giving aggression rights for salvaging is a good idea
per ccp mitnal per gm faolchu  per senior gm ytterbium  per ccp prism x  per ccp incognito  these quotes are kept handy for your convenience at ironfleetcom
as per my new policy i support this proposal as well as the hilarity that will resultedit and by hilarity i mean the wrecks of foolish missionrunner ships
i agree planets should be biggerthis goes well with the move stations closer to planetsmoons threadi also think most of the models should be redone to reflect actual sizeedit forgot to support
why
ccpplease considerwhile we are interfacing with pi i find that disconnecting from my ships hud while in space very unnervingmakes it hard to tell if someone is taking down my shields or capcan we change this to keep the hud active while we are in our shipsthen when the option for incarta comes up and we can do pi in our room and drop the hud to my fellow pod pilots although many complain about certain things that ccp has screwed the pooch on consider this what was eve like back in 2003 then politely thank them for what they have done to improve our gameplay
incredibly obviously the right thing to do
supported
anyone have any ties to any of the csm candidates where you could get them to comment on this issue or the problems with poss in general
supportedi love a pretty eve
you are currently leading the polariod competition p
i support this product and or service
thats an interesting statement considering that wh space makes up half the systems in eve its not like he is asking for a majority membership of wh occupants vs kspace occupants on the csm you really think that out of 8 cmss that not even 1 of them should represent 12 of the space in evei think it would be great to have at least one csm who can represent the interest of wh residents1 vote
yea ive been living in worm space for a while now and while i was impressed with how much was added to it initially im very sad that they havnt added anything in a while worse they have been making life only harder1 now sleepers neut so you cant solo even low end sites anymore without spending billions on faction fit ships2 its hard enough to move all the bookmarks from one person to another in wh space since you cant open a trade like in kspace but now you cant even put bookmarks into another players jet can what was that for except to make it that much harder on us3 all the active tank fits my corp used were voided overnight when the sleepers started neuting so fleets of ships were instantly obsolete4 there was no increase in reward for doing sites in wh space since80 of isk from sleeper sites comes fro blue books the remaining 20 is the only part controled by the player driven market so even accounting for a decress in supply it adds only a tiny fraction to the expected payouts for any given site basically it takes a lot longer now to make a lot less iskmeanwhile in 00 you can toss up a upgrade hub and farm the best plexes around all day long over and over and they just keep respawningno i dont have anything against ccp and obviously i like living in wh space regardless of all this compared to kspace that is but it would be nice to have a csm who would at least get them to address concerns like this
if he was not banned then ccp deemed it not an exploit i supposeafter all its not an exploit to thieve from wrecks to get aggro from fof missiles and avoid concord response in high security space when this perfectly fits the definition of using a game mechanic to obtain a result you are not supposed to obtainmy point is ccp decides what is an exploit and may or may not change its stance at its own discretion you dont
oh spare me thats a change ah would celebrate for a week if this ever comes true as is would be a change designed for them but not for all other corps in class 56 as this would result in ah eviction capfleet being able to come to every door with little problem and that is what they need their people in csm forace secunda allamarr  started asking old friends to damage control think noone will check corp historieshe himself admits it was an exploit and he himself admits that ccp found it an exploit and fined their corp for 60bil or so though i too think it was a bannable offence seems like you did not bother to read the topic but for 2 postsi am a fulltime wh dweller too and i think that ah coming to csm is their next step to take control of wormholes for themselves and their corp prospectives is what they bother about not all the rest of wh dwellers
first of all i used to be in aharm but i hope that doesnt disqalify me from posting heretwo step was ceo when i was with aharm and ive allready voted for him i would like for atleast one member to be representing the wormhole community and our issues and since my current ceo isnt running two step is as good as it gets based on the many good people i have run across in evei can apreciate the subject of the whole infinete tracking issue and i would like to adress it shortly the issue was raised by aharm to ccp  several times as i understand it that ccp didnt react at the time i will not blame aharm  or two step for tht matter i have myself spend 3 months explaining ccp about bugs with no effect and i would not expect anyone to do the same no matter the issueas i see it the only people that was negatively effected by this was rooks and kings who attacked aharm and renoticed the bug  i tip my hat to them i would understand them not being happy with the way this was handled  by aharm andor ccp it is however likely  to me that aharm made a ton of isk killing sleepers while knowing and using the tracking issue but i find it very likely they would have run near the same ammount of sites had the tracking issue not been in effecti will not speak for ace or allamar but i find it very unlikely that ace in particular is posting here by request of two step nor am i for that matterim posting here because i think two step will make a good candidate1 voteregards pocurk
i didnt ask anyone to post in this thread there is certainly no love lost between ace and i since i was part of the group that asked him to step down as ceo i would also point out that crazygirly is not in aharm and there are plenty of other folks out there that have suggested similar changes i personally would love to see some way for a player to do interesting things to wormholes i would also point out that we seem to have no problems moving our eviction cap fleet around just fine with the current mechanics but our targets have a lot more trouble getting reinforcements well i invite you to take some time to talk to me in a convo or something all i can do is keep repeating that i dont see getting on csm as step 1 in the aharm dominates the world plan you seem to think we have i would also point out that if we took control of all wormholes all the sudden we would be very bored i understand there is a lot of resentment from plenty of folks we have evictedshot atwhatever but i am truly trying to represent us all it seems like most of the other wspace corpsalliances are behind me and i am pleased they are while we may shoot at each other we can all get behind changes like corporation bookmarks fixing pos mechanics and the like
well what i have to admit is that two step is very confident in his answers here and i respect it yet i will stay with my attitude towards all this
hi jonathani like the way you have thought a lot of these things through and i wanted to let you know i voted for you today good luck
you got my vote good luck
no im saying in order to change the websites programming to allow candidates to be added later youre looking at at least a few full days work time which i dont have or at least not time i can just spend on that projectdespite some of them being being very busy corp and alliance level ceos 45 candidates managed to fill in the survey in the week that was allotted to this i was a director every time i ran and despite getting 40 new mails every day this was back when directors still got a mail for every person that applied to their corp i was able to check my mails and act onreply to them in a timely fashion now you may not like it but im happy with the signup period and the messaging and its not going to change checking your evemail is not a requirement to run but trust me it becomes a requirement to be a good csm once youre electedim not excluding anyone people exclude themselves by not keeping track of their evemails and that is not my fault
i went to use it and i got an error all i did was answer the questions on what i want and got this i am posting this since i dont know were else it would go since it relates to this site i also wrote down the time that it broke for me too i tried emailing them but for a mail demon error here is what it saidinternal server errorthe server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request please contact the server administrator webmastermatchevecsmcom and inform them of the time the error occurred and anything you might have done that may have caused the error more information about this error may be available in the server error logit happened at 139pm cst6 utc
this is a nonissue ccp had all sorts of requirements for candidates like filling in the forms providing passport details formatting the candidates blurb all of which had deadlines these deadlines have been added for technical and administrative purposes it really is that simplethis service is no different
great product thank you 
i tried using it but i ended up getting a 500 error 
ccp enforced those requirements to make sure the enforcement was not done in an arbitrary or biased way not so with this who gets to post their views on this site is totally up to the arbitrary and biased views of one player
just wanted to say thank you for this useful tool in helping me decide who to vote for thank you your effort is appreciated
me too with 2 different browsers
thanks for the help i still wish i could do a preference vote though
great tool  thanks
funny i took the survey and it said to vote for joseph ward morris as darius iiihe was singled out as best candidate weirdit said he was 100 compatible
sorry guys server errors will happen occasionally as my little server strains under the load pressing f5 after 30 seconds or so should fix it 
im a new player just upgraded my trial acct  found the link very useful so it looks like kumi katana will get my vote im very excited about the coming incarna expansion all good space operas have live people in them after allcheerssapph

awesome to see the increased turnout would love to see votes double the almost 40k cast last year and thanks for posting this update will be fun watching the meter spin
yeah i am really excited about the turnout so who thinks we might see a candidate break 10k votes hopefully it will be me
im winning
would be nice to have a teller at the eve client logon screen next year
not until you make a new avatar
i dont see whats wrong with his avatar
damn rebels always causing troubleback on topic wish we could have one of those spinning number dials to show the vote tally as it adds up that would be pretty cool
biwinning even
whats the cure medicine to make me like them not gonna happen imoh charle
i see you people have been drinking tigerblood
every vote is sacredevery votes is greatif a vote gets wastedoveur gets quite irate
my personal gut feeling is that trebor is dirty i really dont have an opinion on goon stance but i did drop a vote for mittani on my alt wouldnt vote for vile rat though one goon is enough and it might as well be the one i might actually like
this is a lie given the character limits of the forums ill summarizeoriginal post both are missing from your quote to say no edits were done is false now that ive proven the issue what claims do you make to backpedal out of this one
thats called projectionand 1 to jade constantines you are not a goon summary of this whole stupid thread 
seems to me that he was talking about a weapon that would chain damage from ship to ship gradually decreasing his exact words think of it as a giant pinball of pain bouncing through the grid he wasnt actually advocating turning eve into a pinball gameyeah because thats what eve needs more of ascii macro spam granted i dont like the idea but your biggest complaint is that you cant spam ascii seriouslyif theres a need to front load the client with important information but not allow the client to read it until a certain time then this is a way to do it as long as the key is long enough its perfectly secure whats your problem with thisi found this to be an interesting idea in a way it breaks up a large gang into smaller areas of fighting this brings a host of problems  being able to see what is on the field where the snipers are logistics having trouble projecting  and it doesnt fix big blob vs small gang but at least the guy is being creative and thinking outside of the box even a bad idea has the potential to become a good idea over timeyup an idea proposed for essentially dynamically sized containers thats so terrible what is the world coming totry reading it again he wanted to allow certain ships to activate a cloak while still under gate cloak theres nothing in there about preventing someone from using the mwdcloak trickyeah because after a year and a half between posts he might not have had enough experience to change his mindyup a tongueincheek goofing off thread for funny fixes to titan jump bridgestldr goons once again display their lack of character by lying and twisting the truth or their inability to read probably both
goons do not have an ability to read just by design so in a sense you cant call that inability semantics
the problem i haveretired 00 guy now lowly empire industrialist hereis that he doesnt seem to think things through youre quick to defend treb and villify the goons message without reading it in game and in caod id never trust their word on things but in regards to game mechanics you have to give them creditthey do seem to know what theyre talking about more than mostif you cant see that plastic wrap on demand would break courier contracts that the cloakingundergatecloak ability would make covert ops capable ships nighinvulnerable and thus render moving expensive things nearly 100 safe and how inherently insecure it is to send system data to clients in advance i cant explain it to you simply enough poorly thought out and silly ideas are a reallife isk per dozen but a csm rep needs to be able to take the 5 minutes to critically think them through to shut down the gamebreaking onesif for no other reason than to not waste ccps time or more cynically to not give them any more ammo to shoot their feet withoh and the limitedvisibility idea it already happens on broken nodes and if youve ever tried to use a carrier to refit in a group you would know how shoddily ccp codes closest ships and how that idea would never work
i dont like a lot of his ideas either that one included my point is that he is being misrepresented that is what i dont like im one of those people who gets very annoyed when people are intentionally misrepresented even if i dont like or agree with that personfor example i dont like obama at all i think hes slime but when someone goes around spreading lies about him ill try to set things straightyou cant have meaningful or constructive conversation when that conversation is based on lies and half truthsalso sending data to clients in advance is not insecure if it is done correctly there are cryptographic protocols designed to do this specific task bruce schneiers applied cryptography book has several
but then you run into client processing requirements depending on the strength of the encryption and its method not saying a reasonable level of security cant be attained but ultimately i think client processing is not the source of lag its server processing and the limitations of the singlecore system architectureeveryone is entitled to bad ideas but is it really a misreperesentation to say this guy doesnt appear to sift through ideas very well and is running for a job that asks him to do exactly that
it is if the ideas being used as examples arent really his ideasterrible idea  but im pretty sure that the mittani doesnt want to do that it doesnt matter how terrible that idea is  it cant be used to judge mittanis fitness to be on the csm because its not truecrucify people but do so honestly
there is plenty of cheap encryption that could be used for this purpose server processing is responsible for some lag network latency and throughput are responsible for other lag client processing is responsible for some too sending a batch of encrypted data as ships start jumping or start warping will help reduce grid loading lag just send the decryption key at the end of the dump and make sure the cipher is strong enough to resist brute force for a few minutesi contend that the job of the csm isnt to sift through ideas it is to represent the player base there should not be a requirement to be a game design expert to be on csm just an ability to read summarize present argue debate listen and think critically oh and the ability to stick to the facts when presenting the combined opinion of the player base rather than staying onmessage to your coalitions political biasedit ipad fat fingers
nice analysis there but you are wrong on that count hunches and gut feelings do not qualify as projection they dont ascribe feelings or redirect personal failures on another they simply make one feel that a person is not to be trusted and is guilty of something which is currently unidentifiedi said it was a gut feeling because i have no evidence of wrongdoing i simply feel that it existsthis is a result of my reading trebors post and responses and subconciously recognizing something which triggers a defensive mechanism what it is cannot be identified as it results from a familairity with past experience i cannot say who it was that caused these feelings or created the situation that caused me to subconciously recognize similiar traits and examples of character i just know that somethings fishy and that i dont like the individual in question as a result this doesnt mean im right thus its a hunchi hope youre not a pshycologist if you are you should learn to spend more time analyzing an individuals responses before making decisions as to there character by your call im ascribing personal feelings decisions and character to an individual i have never met and thus dislike yet i dont dislike myself and i am a good person who chooses to treat others with respect when they deserve it such a person should then be someone i respect perhaps even take a liking too and support youre assuming that i dont know myself and have a denial trait which prevents me from selfexamination a lack of objectivity and inability to accept blameyou would in general be wrong in any case as moments where i ascribe to that character are fleeting everyone has moments of denial where they project blame it is an immediate response as a result of recognition of wrongdoing and generally lasts no longer than the situation it resulted from or 3 daysi have no place or stake in this race anyway aside from voting for candidates i am simply putting forth an opinion which i believe is relevent to the case i think in time you will find i am right
if it was just a question of presenting the eve communities pet requests csm6 will have to strongly corner ccp about the lack of genitalia customization options in the character creator as well as the need to order pizza in game clearly sifting is part of the jobthe csm is not a request aggregator its intended to be a useful interface between ccp and the playerbase one of the functions is a sounding board for ccps ideas one is a means for players to request priority fixes in both these capacities a csm rep needs to be able to consider the fix or enhancement and try to figure out if it will break things more than it will help them if arent able to apply a basic sniff test to ideas before giving a thumbs up youre going to be a drag on the rest of the council when they have to shoot down the change that you should have never brought up or nodded at approvingly
actually no i think we wont
you cant tell him what he thinks this is an outragebasically you responded to him saying what he thinks by saying actually no which is a stupid thing to do because that isnt how things work
quoted for even more hilarity this is excellent stuff better than charlie sheen at a press interview
checkat least you know what you are talking about and thats worth the effort to vote for the first time in my eve lifechanging my pvp experiences more and more to small gangs and solo stuff taking risks is just more fun and satisfying
prom got all my votes
i believe your sentiments experience and opinions are top notch but i dont believe that you will be able to cooperate with others your emo rages which i experienced firsthand in local unprovoked is quite well known convince me id love to vote for you but the csm unity has shown to be quite vital if not a must for them to be able to achive anything of valueand since i already cluttered up several other threads with this pet peeve of mine might as well ask you cloaks your opinion working as intended need fixbalancingnerfbuffpie
i rage because i care as for cloaks what aspect of them are you talking abouti think covert cloaks work as intended theres really only class of ship that really packs a punch and can use them bombersyoull need to be a little more specificthere are a bunch of things that one could perceive as annoying
got my vote
prom 4 csm1 votewe should solo together sometime  heh
1 vote
my vote goes to the only solo pvper i see here solo and small gang needs boosting blobs need nerfingthe goal of eve for me is to be the best player as i can not to join the biggest alliance in the game we need more advantages to player skill not skill points i dont care about sov however i would like to see 00 more populated and fragmentedmake it so small groups can get in and stand on their own without paying rent how about a penalty to member counts of alliances too alliance fees multiplied by total member count 
didnt readall i do is vote vote vote
what are your thoughts on the megablob coalitions such as drf and nc do you think they are fine as they are or should they be nerfed if you think they should be nerfed how would you do it if it were left to you
i will get this coalitions are formed as an easy option to hold sov in 00 if ccp kept their promise of making sov changes for small corporations to hold space then this wouldnt of happen the structures themselves require a large fleet or a fleet of supercapitals something a coalition can provide during war times hence everyone blobs up into one
will be sending at least one vote your way perhaps more well see
you have my vote
4 votes from me
i like your humble factoriented presentation you make no empty promises and i think you got the role of the csm right to highlight the small improvements to ccp not to try to move something big that will get rejected for sureyou have my vote
many thanks to you and others spread the word if at all possible ill be very happy to answer any questions your friends may havemeissa
you coming to fanfest this year i know tyrrax is finally showing his ugly mug if so hit me up drinking lots
id buy that for a dolla 6 votes here p
as much as you may despise such activities goonswarm is a large alliance and in any case the scams perpetrated ingame by goons are entirely within eves game policies violating an nda has farreaching realworld consequences to draw a correlation between ingame activities that you do not agree with but which are entirely within ccps policies and violating a realworld legal contract doesnt make much sense
so you assume that i am not as well educated in these affairs as your holiness and eminence grise the mittani himself this alone seals my vote against you but thank you for taking the timei even had thought of a rhyming poem to thank and compliment you on your expected replies however the professionalism is sorely lacking and thus i take my leave sorely disappointed good luck in the days to come
nah not this year maybe next though i miss iceland and its weird hardboiled egg smell
vote added for the 00 and all eves peoples true representation
seriously thats your response how very mccarthy of youalso youve elicited the very classic example of the fallacy petitio principii begging the question any attorney should know this all politicians will ignore it of course
oh no latin words they burn us they buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurn ussssssssssssssssssssss
im not going to be locking up the furry vote lets not delude ourselves
uhm you want to get rid of t2 bpossorry thats like a basic intelligence test and you failed horribly how in gods name can you run a spy ring and be that stupid
thought you were supposed to be a lawyer as well as a leader it wouldve been easy to take apart my argument given its own structure i must assume youre not a very good lawyer if you cant pick a bad argument from a good one
what youre disappointed because hes not roleplaying rp and rl have very little in common almost nothing in common actually something i discovered years ago and why i dont bother with it roleplaying is a fantasy one in which you idealize or exemplify traits which dont truly exist in fact never have been seen in the scope of human behaviour shakespearean witticism and the like have never had a place in real human communication this is the heart of where lies begin in playacting pretending roleplaying all you truly do is lieits delusion
hey you never know stranger things in eve have happened
2 votes for ya 
t2 bpos are nowhere in my campaign message i dont know why youre allmad about them that said trying to insult my intelligence is like trying to suggest im unattractive
i retired from law last year lawyering is banal and terrible and mostly evil
the mittani for csm no more bull go to iceland and kick ass and chew bubblegum cya on ts oh and yeah on fanfest ofcourse cya in the bar edit 2 sent ya 5 votes d
as mentioned in a certain movieif we are to survive a new balance must be found in normal times evil ccp would be fought by good but in times like these well it should be fought by another kind of evil lawyer voted for the mittani
first you said this in vote match so yeah its part of your platformsecond youre right that insulting your intelligence over this is similar to suggesting your unnatractive both could be insinuated with bayesian probabilitiesprett2given that you dont support t2 bpos the chance that you are market stupid is high puevegiven that you play eve and are space important the chance that there is something physically wrong with you may be high havent evaluated this one yetthe first is definitely right
i guess this post is the math nerd version of that guy a few posts back quoting a bunch of latin words and expecting people to carequotes statistics 101leans back satisfiedanyway im literally a beautiful man deal with it
lol i was more likely to vote for you before your campaignyou lost when you set out to smear everyone else instead of showing why you are a better candidate protip stop being that arrogant little  but then again that might be your true self after all
if you abhor arrogance you were never going to vote for me dont bother lying about it vov
the problem isnt so much mittens i actually think hed be a pretty decent csm chair though i think hes totally misunderstood how much power it would give him its the fact that hes trying to pad the whole csm with his cronies drowning out any independent voices
youve got my voice hope youll manage to do somethingdont pay attention to those trolls
what are your thoughts on enhanced roleplaying features being added to the game through incarna
lol you think he really cares about incarna not a bit he is guilty of what he accuses everyone else of its called hypocrisy
you have my vote

another vote for ripard teg good work on lost in eve
thank you so much to ira tyr3l hope you liked part 2 jita and chuc chuc i totally support one vote for me one vote for seleene seleenes a terrific potential csm delegate and id love to serve with him thank you for your support and you are absolutely correct that is item 1 on the list of things i think about the csm however im finding that a lot of eve players want to know what their potential csm representatives think about issues and how they would fix specific problems in the game if they had the direct power to do so doesnt mean i can i fully recognize im running for csm not game developer but players do have the right to know what i think about specific issues and thats a good way to sharefirst dont limit yourself there are an absolute ton of corps out there that cater to the casual eve player and yet still live in 00 my own alliance is one minor plug heh play when you can is increasingly being recognized as a valid way to play eve by a lot of corps so when looking for a corp or alliance just be up front about how much play time you can give and when i think youll find a lot of corps are more open than you thinklowsec is a good place to look too though a lot of faction warfare corps are built around player bases with casual play times since they dont have to worry about defending sov so id start therenot exactly a csm issue unless i misunderstood your question did igrins are we related ive never run across another toon with that last name before thank you for your support and thanks about the debate it was fun jadejayne are great guys
i have received the sole endorsement of ingame name marcel devereux the developer of aura for android phones this is a fantastic app and im thrilled to be endorsed by someone who knows so much about development of apps for the eve communitythank you marcel
thanks for taking the time to reply i was referring more to the stark contrast between hisec on lowsec can or should anything be done to ease the transition and perhaps blur the lines between hi and low sec
one question rip you think you are going to be able to spend enough time on csm stuff as this has proven quite a problem for several candidates in the past
believe he answered that questionbut yes he is and has talked to prevouse csm members to get an idea of the time commitmenthe has also offered to take on additional roles for the csm that would take even more time and effort
found the quote
the learn to fly post on your blog made for great reading and i cant see any reason to disagree with you good luck mate
get tech 3 in whs taken care of and youll be the man youve got my votes
i value every persons opinion regardless of whom or what they believe in let me try to explain it the best i canroleplaying is not sufficiently supported in eve online which i strongly disagreed with with the upcoming release of incarna the hole concept of rp will be lifted to the next level where currently rp is limited to faction warfare incursions and a players imagination the future will include the concept of walking on stations and having conversations with npcsevery character in eve is by definition rping yet i am still myself and dont want to change that in any wayin the first part of this statement i only imply that every player in this game is by definition a rping characterthe second part im using myself in a philosophical way to say that regardless of the changes to rp in the game the character would still need to be able to decide whether or not to be part of it even though using myself as an example may be selfish it also gives some information on who i am my character being very close to the rl mei dont feel that my explanations are irrelevant only explained in a bad way i think rping should always pushed further and made better everyones opinion and ideas on how to improve rp will count as equal i hope that this reply has the answers you are looking for
thanks for your vote
thank you that explanation was very explanatory and satisfactory
well my votes are casted
you really worked hard on this post and i like the stands your making you have my vote 
i see you talk a lot of fancy words but i didnt notice any changes from the last time you sat in the csm chair i get harassed a lot for having a hot toon this has been a real peeve i know you have a lot of eve friends which will probably get you reelected so i am inclined to vote for you too i got my isks stolen by dbank and you werent there to help me get it back i contacted the guy who took it and he bought be a golem which was cool i wonder what you would buy me in a similar situation another serious issue that you overlook is the autopilot bug as far as wormhole mechanics and fixes if you know how to use bookmarks it all becomes a nonissue i would like to see you stand up to ccp when the concord doesnt come fast enough when some jerk suicideganks my ship i support you if you make this agenda
i would suggest that you repost your request in this thread it belongs to a candidate who will be eager to promise to do all of these things and morethank you for your interest and of course the bump
how does anything you said constitute me being a troll i am genuinely concerned that you are not a good candidate and your smug tone does nothing to enhance my opinion of you you were caught out misrepresenting the facts and now you are hoping to deflect attention by attacking my character rather than answer the questionyour claims dont match your record hell your record doesnt match your recordassuming that i created an account with a name that would mess up evesearch for undisclosed i presume trolling purposes is tinfoilhattery of the highest orderif you were any good youd be able to answer me calling you a liar when you have been caught lying is a simple statement of fact not a troll and not impolite given that i also allowed for the fact that you simply dont really know how the csm worksps i dont know why you would think that any publicity is good publicity especially when you act like this but youre welcome i guessedit hahaha i enjoyed your response to the smear campaign thats the best doublespeak yet 
question  heroyou have claimed trebor lied can you cite the specific examples leading you to believe this and backing the example with evidence to support your claimalso tinfoil hattery this sounds eerily familiar to hero  mittani who knows
honestly not someone i would vote for
you are convincing the facts you bring are solid you get my vote max
seleene stole some vote from you but there been others left carry on please
hi treborhave you had any news on this matter pleasethank you in advance
i inquired and received a brief internal reply i and mynxee and dierdra vaal have requested some more detailsi hope to be able to provide a more detailed answer soon
hi mittans someone on shc mentioned that you arent really liked at sa and that not all people from sa were in goons intrigued i went there and found this i think velius has something there
1 from megood job sir
if just would like 1 thingno warp scrambler on a lv 4 none it only will punish the weak pleayers and they will even lose ships its not pvp its mission fun rather give all enemies more hp instead if they rly just want to have ships destroyed or making the missions harder i am here for the weak and will always vote for them so everyone can have fun game experience i know im probably the only one losing ships because of scrambling so its probably made just in order to hurt me and a few others it wouldnt be a matter at all just to remove stuff which doesnt hurt anyone else except the weak the whole idea only to punish the weak is far from adorableanother thing which would be nice to see is some boost on command ships maybe they should be legendary ships but nowadays they are barely above hacs i would say give them either a additional med or low slot as they got higher skill requirements than a t3 ofc there is more stuff such as easy access to clone jump even for rookies will fix pvp a lot aswell special counter measures module in high slot in order to provide hugeespensive ships with blobb resistanceadd a new feature called kamikaze attack self destruct should only be usable on a pod a ship however in term its smaller than its oponnent may be able to use a kamikaze attack which will hurt both ships and the smaller one usualy completly destroyedif you bring something of that stuff up i will vote since you did already great work on way to many improvements which i was considering a great addition honor firestorm i dont find your character hot so at least one lesser
i would suggest that you repost your request in this campaign thread i am sure that candidate will be eager to promise to do all of these things and moreregarding the illegal rmt isk that you were scammed out of i recommend you file a petition and include as much detail as you can  names places your bank account information etc i am sure that a helpful gm will take care of you immediatelythank you for your interest in my campaign and of course the bump
1 vote for you treborall those arguments against you relating to your dumb ideas are pretty much pointless those ideas that are due to a lack of knowledge of eves very particular game mechanics and technical inner workings or simply just shots is th
goons be damed i gave you one of my three votes ive read your blog and i think you will serve well on csm 6 good luck1ps no my other two votes didnt go to mittens
hahaha yes im am the mittani  maybe i should be running insteadits not so much that he doesnt know how the csm works necessarily as that he is pretty obviously spinning furiously to a defend the public letter that was sent and b to make it look like he has a whole bunch of methods to approach issues through the csm when what he described was a single processcheck his post here
did anyone else notice this guys ingame name is his reallife name backwardsnot sure i want someone with this much originality of thought involved in the council that looks after my spaceships are serious business issues
youre really terribad at this whole internet thing tried clicking your own link also using bold text to make your internet drama seem more dramatic is pretty failpsi think he knows a bit more about the csm and how it works than you do and trolling him with bull doesnt change that did you goonies ever stop to think that running a smear campaign against someone who has actually been on the csm and is pretty much regarded by most as having been successful would perhaps be a bit more effective if you didnt go absolutely over the top with all the drama the goons have a bad rep and you might be too isolated from the rest of eve to see it but no one is going to shed a tear if the goons all disappeared from eve tomorrow screaming at trebor does him more good than it does youdont believe me well see on the 22nd
you sound angry im not screaming or threatening anyone just pointing out with due emphasis mind why i dont think trebor is a good candidate nobody has even attempted to explain his comments which leads me to believe that with all the  and vinegar on here i have made a reasonable pointoh man i messed up the link sorryoops clicking them still takes you to each post mind you so ill presume you read everythingbold text is awesome you have no idea what you are talking aboutin any case my point still stands i know that he isnt ignorant about the csm process which means he lied or misspoke i believe is the new way of saying that mentioning that isnt bull and the fact that all you have to counter my points is ad hominem infinitumno word on the vuk lau quote either but then that was something i heard in local chat so who knowsas for you including me in you goonies you couldnt be further from the truth pquestioning not screaming at trebor told me what i wanted to know and he didnt even have to answer my questions to do it  if you dont think this csm election is the most important thing youve ever participated in then i dont know that you even deserve to vote i presume you do though because youre willing to argue your points with a troll what we will see on the 22nd is pretty much nothing to do with what does me good what does me good is voting my conscience rather than being a blinkered idiot who votes as a bloc for a goon captain because she is told to or for a guy who spins so much he has his own gravitational field because i hate goonies grr which just means that well end up with another bunch of insufferable s instead of people who might actually do something decent welp
i cant actually believe anyone around can take the fact of being member of csm5 as a good point  im playing the game for 2 years and the game is only going worse the time used by the dev on the request of the csm is for stupid updatetheres so many problems around ty insurance refunds all the nullspace belongs to 45 alliances no space for any small pvp corp the game is filled with botters courrier missions were incredibly nerfed low sec totally deserted due to lack of interest caldari ship completely useless in pvp the list doest end   that i really wonder what was csm5 exactly doing  there is no way any member of the previous csm is going to have my votewhat did we actually get in this extension  1 year of work to get incursions and a stupid pi revamp nice job guys 
i looked it upfrom herei dont really see what the fuss is here other than vuk lau saying his complete lack of understanding of real eve

ransom piracy a dead end industry yaar were hated the length and breadth of eve for obvious reasons  but were as much part of eve as the jump gates  the constant nerfing of ships to make them generic  alliance pvp corps calling themselves pirates not honoring ransoms  how are we sposed to stay in eve   we dont do blob warfare is it the end for us are we all to be herd animals whats in it for us if we lend you our support seleene talking to my friends they would like to see a ransom contract system that holds ransom in escrow until the victim is in station ransom honoured
1 vote in before my account runs out for a bit after reading most of your messages i can only realise youre the best equiped person to be head chair on the csm be honored its my 1st vote since csm went live and i can see now youre planning on making the csm6 what it was always ment to be with thanks to all the work done by csm5 ofcourse
you have had my voteyou seem the best candidate for my believes of what eve has the potential to be along with the knowledge and experiance to best ensure that it happenson the subject of iterations what is your feeling on pve content within eve should missions be revised  improved rat ai improved or adjusted to better match a more realistic opponent ie less rats but better stats to be closer to pvp combatwhat pve content should be improved or implemented to keep us bears happy d
i voted for you because youll know when ccp are telling porkies about things like start up delaysthey wont be able to pull the wool over your eyes and claim issues you have the experience to drill down and say actually no that was most likely caused by human errorhaving someone with the knowledge to be able to counter ccp deception is critical for the csm this is the only candidate equiped with this abilityplease vote for seleene i have he may be based in 00 but he has the interests of all of the community in his mind dont let apathy or the mistaken belief that power block voting guarentees him to get in your vote is critical and your vote makes the difference dont let the opportunity of getting someone with prior knowledge into the csm slip past
i logged in this morning and found that seleene had sent a letter to me personally thanking me for my support the rest of you csm candidates should learn a thing or two from this guy hes nice being nice gets things done speaking of being nice im pretty dismayed by the amount of attention and support that mittani is receiving with his negative im going to be a bastard campaign i really hope that he isnt as much of a bastard as he says that he will be but im not betting my life on that that kind of a confrontational attitude can cause a lot of grief on both sides  why would ccp want to be cooperative with someone whose primary goal seems to emberass them every time they turn around
you have my vote
gave you two out of three votes good luck
in case you arent sure yet on who to vote and are still reading thru all these stories about what they all will change in this game i can tell you thisif you vote for this guy you will vote against vuk now isnt that something we all want

a vote for draco is saying that you want to have a sane voice in the csm meetingssomeone interested in all aspects of eve not just those of nulsec lots of block votes are being thrown around for alliance members looking after their own interests a vote for draco signifies a vote for the players of eve who want the game to be better
thanks pjyes thats a valid point while i live in nulllow sec with my main i am interested in making eve as a whole a better place and not just one specific area i want to represent as many play styles as i canas noted in my op i have much experience in many other areas
thanks to everyone that hsd contacted me in game to offer their supportalso look for me in some upcoming interviews in popular eve news sourcesfinally whoever you choose please support the csm and vote for someoneissler dainzevoice of reason candidate
how do you respond to charges nobody appears to care about your campaign at all
i fully support this candidate many of his thoughts have been voiced by others in discussions ive sat in on i do believe he has herd them as well and set up a workable set of solutions he is not underestimating the complexity of eve and i like that
supporting the removal of t2 bpos is a remarkably dangerous position and one that i doubt any of the market community would support
up you go for great balance
if youre sitting on a pile of t2 bpos and my candidacy would hurt your continued enjoyment of this feature then you have a choice to make i feel this mechanism bad to begin with and horribly unfair to new players and if you are a single issue voter then i strongly encourage you to not vote for me and instead vote for somebody who would better represent your interests
i just got a few more choice endorsements d help me get electedfor great justice and maximum trollageps look at my offical campaign video
just voted for you

down with the bots
i must admit this is the first one i have read in fulltwo important questions i have are about the station and gate turrets found in high and low security systems selecting their targets why do they not solely focus the majority of their vollies fire on the aggressor particularly with departure jumps i have taken station sentry fire for defending my frigate against a battlecruiser pulling a station jump my frigate didnt last much more than a few seconds under a complete tackle and heavy fire granted my frigates shields were about cruisergrademy other question should station turrets be more powerful in my opinion they should be able to more easily melt andor rip apart the ships of those who attack others departing the station
ok lets talk about a few things faction warfare whats the point so you get to be up another race kinda like a constant war dec for those who wish to participate but what do you really get out of it what is the benefits of being part of the militia some recommendations have been a boost to lp to to double depending on how much control of a system you have for missions others recommend lp for every kill you get for you militia out there what do you think what do you want assault frigates are they broken are they just expensive t1 ships do they need balancing hybrid weapons just projectiles or lasers with different sound effects how about maiking all hybrids do anywhere from 50 percent to 65 percent more damage or refire total  banking  investing can it add another dynamic to gameplay what about selling shares of your corp on the market day trading p  investors receive dividends off of corporation profitsall of these issues and ideas came from you with the exception of fw as i got into a month ago and have the same questions you the player are telling me these are the issues that affect you please keep feeding me catch me on the forums eve gate eve mail or yell at me in local because everyone has something to bring to the table your eye catches it let me be your voicebutch
okay quick note why is everyone trying to make eve to easy lets take the jb issue as a prime exampleif i want to know where my enemies jbs are i can simply warp around the moons in a system okay it may take me a few minutes but hell if eve was meant to be simple everyone would start with 50mil sp able to fly a titan and get a gift of 3bil isk per monthfor those who complain about the big power blocks with all this space boo hoo guess what they earned it by playing the game and forming alliances that stood up against the s that was thrown at them yeah its hard for new corps to get out into 00 but as we have seen in the past nothing lasts forever and failscades do happen man up wait for your chance and then take it if u get slammed out of ur nice new space by a massiv fleet from another alliance then guess what you werent as prepared as them and therefore aint ready to hold the space as for players from empire trying to impose their views on 00 and vice versa stick to what you know ffs peeps i mean really would you call the sky guy to come fix your prized sports car or get the guy from the garage to come and deliver your first child get real 1 for mittens p
i would suggest you not shut down this topic because its a serious issue for some of usfor myself i could care less about open source or not and honestly i do think you should have been able to monetize it but thats not the issue what i care about is that you took on a very large project went quite a long way with it then dropped it i appreciate that the cost became prohibitive that killed eve metric as well but something about this bothers me with regards to the csm this is a major commitment and depending on your real life this is a monetary commitment i definitely couldnt afford to be in the csm understand that im not trying to come down on you you made an amazing product and are obviously a bright fellow that clearly has a good understanding of the game but there is something about the dropping of capsuleer that bothers me with regards to thisironically if your platform included pushing for ccp to have a way to integratelicense the high end 3rd party projects i would vote for you without a second thought
dude you support the removal of t2 bpos i cant think of a faster way to loose support of the market and industry section
thing is with nullsec voting blocs well already be getting a bunch of 00 candidates elected why should all csm representatives have to be nullsec experts surely its better to have some mixed in from other backgrounds as you say those who spend all their time in sov space shouldnt impose their views on empire lowsec fw etc
actually my goal isnt to make eve easy its to make eve balanced i agree eve should be a very challenging game and i also admit im not the most experienced when it comes to how to resolve jump bridge issues i think players need to remember that ccp arent looking for game developers theyre looking for a voice to the players even if i had the most brilliant solve for every issue that doesnt mean ccp will go and do it just because i say so as part of the csm
when i say i will not allow capsuleer to be part of my campaign i am referring to the application itself my experience and knowledge of all that transpired from the beginning to the end of its life cycle will serve invaluable on the csm and third party apps and the eve api are incredibly important to mejust want people to stop thinking my campaign is a hidden agenda to somehow resurrect capsuleer and profit from it that is why i emphasize i will not discuss it
i do not support the removal of t2 bpos i support a change that will bring balance to them in fact i discussed the high run bpc change with several industry only players that i have great respect for and while they didnt like the idea of change they liked that idea a lot better than simply removing them from gameim sorry if you feel that they are not in need of change i believe otherwise again remember ccp may agree with you and never make it a priority change if it has cost me your vote then i hope you vote for a candidate that will better represent your needs
i have started an ingame roc the vote channel where i will be happy to discuss my csm campaign with players
friendly morning bump i also voted for youi though disagree with the aoe back on titans as it was we do need an aoe weapon but id rather see something a bit more limited maybe 30km to 50km radius is affected not the whole gridmore than that though we need a level 3 dreadnought to counter the level 3 carriers
wh space havnt given it much thought to be honest i had a char live in one for a while and my former corp was living in lvl4 for ages as well as my alliance farmed lvl5 ones when wh was released but with all the patching that happened i havent been quit in touch of it so would need to do a bit of a research industrial effect currently wormholes are flooded with towers no one can take down as there are no dreadnoughts that needs to be addressed some what as wellsuperdreadnaughts with the last titan boost thats what they sorta became i mean gun dps is of a dread but doesnt require siege 3m doomsday i guess with the aoe dd it would be like a superdreadtitan in one ccp hate adding new ships especially another supercapital they would rather give titans more weapons than adding another ship
i see some other candidates have serious life skills like programming what do you have outside of eve that you can bring to the table
alright my rl criteriabsba business managementminor economics and computer sciencethat would be the best way to summarize myself without violating the personal information part of the eula even though you all know my rl name
from one shetoon to another i think you could be more concerned about some things i bought this character when my friend told me i could because i didnt want to wait all that time for skills so i could fly a bigger ship and make an impact even though i know it would be better to learn the ropes and get a better feel but i still think i am ahead of the game programming is important yes but also there are social issues in the game that can be addressed like the harassment and the griefing and stealing will you propose to have programming consoles in game i wouldnt suggest that because there can be more done from a game play perspective that would really increase players and then we would pay less as enrollment increases same principle from economicsi wish you well i think youre a really strong candidate with breakthrough ideas that will change the face of gaming
well it is always a risk that you wont be able to kill the target if you run into that situation you could quit the contract and start a new one if i remember correctly i think we also discussed being able to take out multiple contracts at once so if there is one target you cant get to you can hunt another one for a whilein lowsec or nullsec it really wont matter much as your friends can help you without any interference in highsec where they cant help you you arent likely to encounter a ship that cannot be killed by one skilled personas far as the inactive targets goes you could always limit the bounties to people who have logged on in the last day or two or even to people who are currently onlineanyone can see that the current bounty system is completely broken and pointless if you are going to put a bounty on someones head you might as well just deposit the isk directly into their wallet instead and save them the trouble of podding themselves with an alt because thats what a bounty really is in most cases a donation to the person receiving the bountythe bounty system is in serious need of a change and if done right bounty hunting could be turned into a viable career for eve players right now if you want a way to make isk that involves no grinding and is pvp based the only real option is piracy or maybe mercenary work if you enjoy camping and docking games all day fixing the bounty system will add an honest way of making isk from pvp and help promote antipiracy which is pretty much dead right now
alright i am exhausted so this will be quick and i will comment on everyone in the morning31011 brusanan  won 50x fleeting propulsion inhibitor i  chribba dice roll
not rr neutral rr basically we are against cowards who cannot fight without having 5 rr alts in neutral corperations on standby in case there is a danger of them losing a shipand obviously anyone who claims neut rr doesnt completely screw up pvp in highsec just doesnt want it fixed because they benefit from it on a daily basis and often cannot actually pvp without it
i really like this idea its a clever way to get more people into lowsec but only if it is genuinely possible to prevent them screwing you after the contract completesi would propose it is always tied to a corp if the pirate requesting protection is part of a player corp requiring the role ransom negotiator i say this because i suspect that it would be used almost exclusively to con people into getting ganked by the corpmate who is also warp scamming youif you made this mechanic mostly reliable  then it would be an excellent buff for lowsec
what would you like me to focus on more specifically i am always looking for some direction for new ideas and researchthank you for the comments shandir the idea does need some work because as is i have some concerns about abuse i will discuss it with a bunch of guys ingame to see what other input i can get and update the idea accordingly
this part you are mixing upto be more clear in the last 2 years the playerbase increased significantlya lot of these players should be made able to storm into nullsec meanwhile you have to limit the options for the umbrella alliance in his ways to rent out space but you will need to give them this option for now at least for a transition period of timeabout kadaffi and oil slots kadaffi already cashed trillions of dollarseuros the people will take over his country his source of constant income meanwhile countries are freezing his bank accountsin eve people have to take space massively and ccp should freeze the corp wallets of every individual that is under investigation
you cant do that without forbidding players to shoot other players ie stopping what eve is simple as it is again a bit oversimplyfying if i am not renting  i am shooting any limitation on this effectively means consensual pvpyeah people will take over or not this is offtopic however but not because some supreme being changed the eula but we may say people themselves are changing it other countries in this analogy are neighbour alliancesplease elaborate investigation about what  rmt or shooting others 
196 different alliances tainted the ones with the most offenders weremostly harmlessgoonswarm federationintrepid crossingivy leaguetest alliance please ignorewildly inappropriateeach with about 68no the initiative initiative mercenaries or initiative associates members i am happy to sayas for my personal opinion thats simple rmt and the botting that fuels it is a plague that needs more attention ive been telling ccp that since the june summit and it looks like theyre finally putting more resources into the issueone of my suggestions to ccp was that they engage a forensic accountant to help them develop better ways to detect isk laundering
i wouldnt start celebrating just because your friends names arent on this particular list this was just the database from one of many isk selling websites and its quite possible that all your friends just buy from somewhere elseedit not to mention that im kind of angry that you would use the actions of 8 people out of a group of over 5 thousand as some kind of taint on the rest its kind of disrespectful in my opinion
rmt
most of these transactions appear to have been to throwaway chars where the isk was transferred a second time consequently any selfbackpatting for not having your people on the list is pretty premature
your list is inaccurate at least according to the copy of the sheet i had access to the 10 top offenders are from most to least1 unaffilliated 17192 wildly inappropriate 123 mostly harmless 114 dead on arrival alliance 11 5 test alliance please ignore 116 ivy league 107 intrepid crossing 98 goonswarm federation 89 vera cruz alliance 710 intergalactic exports group 7generalizing the prevalence of rmt in any alliance from this list is problematic since a client list from a single english language website is prone to systematic bias and the number of people rmting on their inalliance characters is insignificant compared with the number of people trading on unaffiliated characters
an excellent point and sorry for the minor mistakes in my list i just did a quick hand count of a list i made sorted by alliance and missed a fewit should also be noted that quite a few of the unaffiliated toons were likely laundryalts
bumpalso i was a tad busy skipper
thanks for the support although im sure many candidates meet those criteria just to clarify im not a corp ceo not that it really matters i have however been a director of two different corps one of which had an afk ceo so i was for all intents and purposes the ceo which is much the same functionreal honest good honest scammingspyingcorp thieving fun and fair are what its all about
hope you get voted in
having known and flown with imigo for a while i can verify that he does indeed love eve ive had numerous discussions with him over the state of the game mechanics things that need improving things that need changing and the like while we havent always agreed on every issue he has a through knowledge of the game and while looking at things commonly shared is also aiming for various areas most other candidates dont even think of as needing improvement but which could improve the game and gameplay remarkablyalthough i am in the same corp as imigo i would recommend that people vote for him because of what ive outlined and what he stands for im not just helping out a corpmate if youre unsure just post a question or hit him up for a chat
i support white tree
i also voted for white treei am white tree
voted for white tree you should too
3 votes for white tree
i am voting for white tree
sounds good got my vote
i think i understand the t3 issue better now there should definitely be a way to refit a t3 in wh space it doesnt make any sense to force players to take their t3 out of the wh system into potentially hostile space just to refit
5 votes good luck

this morning i got an email asking about a few points in eve i decided to post the reply i sent to this person here i thought it would help to see some of my ideas when it comes to certain questions that have been asked1 delayed localthe idea i have on delayed local would be a tier system empire local would have a 30 second delay this is for movement around when in a war this gives both sides an advantage and a disadvantagelow sec would be two minutes enough time to move through system dock up and move out again or to probe out your targets if there are anynull sec 00 would be 5 minutes this is for the ability of moving large fleets into position and allows the use of covert operations to be effective for example whats the use of a covert cyno portal if the people you are attacking see you coming in local chat i want the ability to get behind enemy lines more easily for small fleets thus boosting smaller gang warfare2 mining incomethe idea of mining that i have in mind would be to remove all bets from a static position and have them in moveable plexs just like cosmic anomalies you would be easily able to scan out the belts in your mining barge and hopefully this will disrupt the botting quite a lot the bots would have to go to planets and then scan mining sites out then go to the site and then get in a position from which to mine etc rather than a botter to set up some simple bookmarks for the bot to warp to3 lev 5 in empirefor level 5 missions to be move to empire they would have to be improved upon quite a lot one idea would be to implement the new sansha ai to the missions making them a lot harder and their fore making them a group thing to do this way a larger payout would be split to multiple people the overall payout per person would be slightly larger that lev 4s but the lp would be quite a lot larger4 more vulnerable wormholeslonger lifespan for wormholes plus the restriction of poss in certain class of wormhole class 1 and 2 would be small pos only class 3 would me small and medium poss only and class 4 and 5 would be all types of pos this would make corpspeople have to manage larger scale operations in wormholes with more poss to do what they would normally do in one single large pos in a c1 wormholethe attackers would then be able to actually attack a corp in a c1 c2 c3 easier but rather than just attacking 1 pos they would have to take out multiple small or med towers to completely eradicate a corp from a wh5 sound alerts in channelssound alerts in channels would be a simple thing you can set channels to make sound once another person talks also a separate noise would be played if your name is linked in a channel the sounds would have to be set to each channel individually to avoid the massive amount of beeping 20 channels would create if you had them all se to making a noisethis is just a few of the questions that have been put to me so fareve truth
ok taking them in ordersov and pos mechanics i have a common thought about they are boring as all hell and test the patience of saints i have taken down a pos through legal means and also taken one down the hard way i do not know what could be done toi make it better but something has to be doneforce projection    no i dont think the jump bridges need to be removed again this a a function of boredom vs playtime in null the jump bridges were supposed to allow us to skip having to move through large patches of home territory just to get to the fight the issue that seems to have developed is that larger alliances are using it as an omnipresence so one fleet fights on all frontsas i said    i think removal would be an extreme reaction to a minor problem if you dont want the omnipresence there must be some mechanic that could keep a ship from leaping hither and yon without shiutting down the ability completelysingle biggest thing that bugs me the ui from overview to the rigamarole of sharing bookmarks    the ui is the albatross that hangs around the neck of every damn player in the game it scares new players away and frustrates the hell out of veteransaside from dessies there are ship classes i never see mentioned except as pretty hanger queens    black ops leap to mind and with the recent modifications to the super carriers some of the old standards of the capital ships seem to also have fallen from grace dreadnaughts for examplebut there is always room for more new shinies i think t3 frigates would be an obvious first choice but i would prefer t3 dessies to get the nod first it would give us a reason to skill them up and make those hulls the basis for new awesomenessity my own wordwhat have i done in eve damn    i started as a miner moved on to run missions joined corps for wars explored lived in a wormhole run missions to 00 run races and events in low and null i have helped manage a pos i have interviewed and been interviewed i have recruited people and been assistant fc i have ganked in a gatecamp and been a dessie squad attacking a hulk i have run plexes and scanned out anomalies i have traded and i have built i have been podded and i have podded other people i have escaped with a thread of hull left and i have sat in shock as my ship blew up around me i have done research and invention lived in lowsec been in a renter corp in nullthings i have yet to do serve on the csm go to fanfest huge fleet fight fly a cap ship of my own scam things i wont do lie to a friend and yes i think i have friends that i have never met exploit a bug and risk removal from the game macromine i am a player of the game    like youi would like the game to be better i assume you would tooi havent done everything    but i am looking forward to the future    i do think walking is stations may be a tipping point for the game i want to be on the highwire with it trying to help tip it on the side of legendaryvote for me pleasemike azariah for csm6m
sorry mate but from what i read on vote match your opinions on t2 bpos of the ones that gave a written opinion to match it yours was probably the worst your basic failure to understand the oppurtnity cost involved in t2 bpo ownership and describing it as printing money identifies you as a very dangerous person to put in any position of authority on marketindustrial mattersas a matter of fact if you disagree strongly maybe you could make your case here
okay taking your ideas in order with the immunity from losing votes you promisedgrinsi agree that bots are a major influence on the game as a whole but it is my understanding that they tend to hang in the more distant corners of nullsec for a better ores and b fewer hunters wandering through any idea to make botting more difficult or just down right nonprofit is worth considering problem is anything that we can imagine can be programmed around if the programmer is patient and it is worth the effort right now rampant botting is reputed to earn multiple plexes worth of isk per month it is worth it color shifts might be a way to make it more interesting and slightly tougher on the bots but i would bet dollars to donuts it would only delay them a week or soi have seen lots of folks suggesting fixes that all boil down to the same thing    making lowsec more tempting to bring more people into it all of these have the same basic problem at the root of them better bait will only work until the pirates kill off all who come for it again now this one is slightly more interesting    but would you consider a modification into it rather than just moving the border of where lowsec really begins what if the border was fluid as pc kills in an area increased    concord might respond with a stronger presence if there were no pirates in the area concord might go elsewhere and the sec status would slip this would mean the border would not always be in the same place from week to week as you said ideas are easy to come up with and you need a group who can consider them and find the obvious to someone flaws within themthat is what the csm is not devs they are a group who evaluate ideas put forward by the players they take the best as they see it forward to the ccp at the same time ccp brings ideas and plans to csm and again the csm gives opinions the nda is the bidg fly in this ointment as some of the things the csm sees is not reported back to us but you have to see it from ccps view they are a business    giving away future plans is not always good for it and we can be a rabid pack of dogs who take the slightest mention of something as eityher a promise of nirvana or the voice of dooooooom see the reactions to incarna captains quarters and jump bridges for examplesi agree lowsec needs fixing but i am not sure that an economist is the right guy to consult for the repairs maybe a biologist or a psych major rebalance the predator prey or alter the perceptions af riskrewardm
out of curiosity how would you react to a proposal to bring back the small chance of inventing a bpo in modern research that would make the argument moot without the removal of anything    and inviting me to argue for the removal in that thread where you said    um no i am not prone to feed trolls more than their basic daily requirementsm
thanks for standing for csm mikehope to see you reporting from reykjavik some day soon 
i was talking about blurring the boundary not moving it but i like your idea too sounds harder to implement but im almost certain id find it endlessly exciting to never know for sure what the security status of a system would be tomorrow id definitely live out on a fringe world just for the thrill of being hurled out into lowsec every now and then without actually moving too but against my will and i can see it now that the naysayers will claim over fire and brimstone that half of highsec space will become uninhabitable but thats impossible because the amount of lowsec ganks in any area will be limitedif your idea were made real id want what i said also applied that the security status levels would mean a lot more from one number to the next that could make systems averaging 05 security even safer than with my proposal as any sharpminded player can clearly see that that system doesnt have a lot of ganking going on in it if its to remain at that security level for so longperhaps ccp would chart out the average amount of ganks per dayweekmonth per pilot for each security status level increment and use those values to plot a graph that gives each system a number of ganks to expect depending on the number of pilots in the system then at downtime each system will count up the average number of pilots throughout the day and the total ganks and adjust its security status down if the gank total is under or up if its over systems close to the top or bottom of security status numbers would vary only slightly while systems on the fringe would change rapidly on a daytoday basis ah but you got the ol hamster wheel turning inside my head thanks for thati find this quote interesting i dont currently have any solutions to offer to that extent but itll likewise get me thinking
im not exactly referring to the csm letter so much as most of the responses in this thread you know when incarna was first announced five years ago i remember there being very little objection i didnt see much support but the this is a spaceship game bitter vets mostly kept to themselves except for the odd post back then there was no capital sunk into incarna we werent just about to receive the productnow skip ahead to about a year ago incarna is about a year from its initial release we now know three to four years of development time resources and capital already in use and suddenly the player base unites against the conceptthere was a time when we could have stood up and said no that time has long gone the product is here get over it it will barely effect you if you dont want to use it if you feel the need to quit over incarna then go have fun trying other mmos i did that for a year starting last july and i found myself coming back to make a new character simply because i couldnt find an mmo that satisfies like eveincarna is coming you should have spoken up four years ago when it was reasonable for ccp to drop the idea
thanks for getting these points out in the open for all to see those of us who have followed the csms attempts over the past year have been tracking this but other players may not have noted the true depth of worry around incarna frankly if incarna is to be taken seriously by the playerbase there had better be one helluva huge reveal at this years fanfest otherwise i am going to add this to the long list of semiimplemented bits n pieces ive seen from ccp since i joined back in 2008 faction warfare  failbig industry expansion  orcaplanetary interaction  clickfest or as my wife an avid facebook gamer noted  its more boring and uglier than farmville pi 2 replaced clickfest with annoying processes  failincursions  happen in only six 6 random cough bs flag constellations with little or no impact on the vast amjority of playersweve seen so many halfdelivered promises and this is shaping up to be another one i appreciate good marketing like the next player but at least all those had quite a bit of planning and some semblence of intent before being released and abandoned so based on ccps previous history im just not going to hold out much faith this expansion will be any different and given the lack of planning is on track to be worse
i would imagine that before the june minutes were released most people like myself thought incarna would be a 6 month of work and then release deal of like everything else ccp had done as soon as the players found out that it was going to take 18 months and the rest of eve was to be pretty much abandoned during that time there was the uproar no one is necessarily united against incarna as a normal release but its obviously just sort of a graphical update to improve immersion for eve its not going to add anything of substance to the actual game and abandoning eve for 18 months is a long time for that it should be not have been a surprise this was not going to make players happynow we have this csm letter talking about fleshing it out even more  ie longer than 18 months sorry that really sucks for those of us who like to fly space ships it has already been 3 years and fw occupancy still needs 3 or 4 iterations due to it being broken everyone acknowledges it is broken dominion is only half implemented and then will like need fine tuning no one is really fighting like they used to before the great wars are in the past history now you hear more about bots than anything else happening in null sec and the devs are developing dresses and hair bows instead of new ships or worse they trying to figure out what sort of gameplay they can bring with incarna some players complain that they want to punch and shoot at each other but really that is not how wars in this sci fi universe are fought we have clones and huge space ships you dont fight spaceships by kicking them or shooting them with pistols i would just ask anyone who wants more than just the basics in incarna how much more time do we need to wait we have stuck it out for the 18 months players have already been waiting 3 years for a fix to faction war do we need to wait another 3 years really those who want more out of incarna i just want to know how long the vast majority of resources will be tied up with incarna in june 2010 i was told they would be tied up until december of 2011 i wasnt happy but i swallowed it if they are going to do more fleshing out of incarna before they get to any of the broken features i try to interact with in game i just want to know how much longer this will take if csm is just complaining that incarna isnt good enough for them and they expect more in the same amount of time well i think that is a bit unrealistic i dont know allot about this but i do see that ccp has made these incarna characters look better than any other game i have seen if it were easy to do this in a mmo dont you think lots of games would look that good that time was spent and they created something really top quality no you cant punch a pirate or shoot someone but that is not how the wars are won here lets just let them get it out and get back to spaceships then as time passes if good ideas come up for it great but lets not try to force creativity the basics are great for incarna its looking really nice thats fine for now they can add stuff later
theres nothing in this that wasnt obvious to most people the day the vampsinstations tech demo was announced but despite that i can still imagine ccp devs all sitting around a table tucking into their rotted shark and rolling their eyes at all those silly eve players who lack their visionhonestly i hope they just get the damn thing out as quickly as possible and with as little damage to the existing station interface as possible that way they can forget about it as quickly as possible just like every other expansion feature of recent years
after doing the candidate analysis survey at
you can vote right now id like you to consider the following what will a csm with 9 00 players in it 6 of them for the sake of their powerbloc will bring to eve  probably the end of the csm or turning back to a csm with no power at all ccp considering it lost in initial purpose to represent the player and turned into another meaningless lobby  except it has no real power apart from what ccp decidesuse your vote in a good way vote for me  to keep the csm representative 
i agree got my vote sadly i have but one account with which to vote with but ill vote for you would be good to see some fresh unjaded input into the csm o7
im honoured and i hope all of you empire players who feel distant from other csm candidates be it because you dont fly a nyx dont have 10b in your wallet  or 00 players tired of 00 as it is enjoyed right now by powerblocs rents politic immobility due to napfest and thinking it need a fresh look on it will consider voting for me
bump
tumbleweed
twiglets sold me tbh1 vote grats 
protip windy already has enough votes to be in the csm vi grats to windy on the election
youre right i reckon 3 votes just about seals it
morsus mihi candidates were always 100 on the task preventing ccp to screw this game even moremm candidate had my vote this time too
theres two weeks of this to go dont forget to keep reminding corp and alliance mates to get out and vote
good question reaverhelens reply above clears up a bit of the mud while it isnt sufficient to convince me to that side of the fence it does somewhat put things into overall perspective going into that further i am not personally fond of the cynical attitude presented right from the beginning by helens goonswarmcom post yet we have to take into account that hes been there and i have notwould i pick up a torch and yell lynch  not at this stage however you will not see me pressing support pamphlets into the hands of pods and podettes either
few have you not been to jita lately say in the past few years
my friend drove drunk and injured two people after i had offered and was on my way to pick him up hes serving a year for felony hit and run i happened to be first on the scene immediately after the crash am i equally responsible for his actions
you sir are mad
tbh i rather vote for mittani then any of ther other fake candidates in fact i already did with all my accountsand what do you got against goons really they are enjoying the game as much as any of us in fact maybe even more sometimes because of their community you an angry bob alt or something that lost to them
ccp games presents an official trailer
oh gee i dont know maybe we should ask all the people goons recruitment scammed or try reading about them saying all they care about is griefing other gamers
and how is that differet from other players in eve exactly i know i have scammed my fair share and i have killed my fair share of noobs and empire newbs as well made me quite rich actually i know i go out and shoot random people for fun and have gotten a few billion isk just dropped in my lapbut do you honestly think goons want to ruin a game they spend so much time playing you are just trying to portrey them as the bad guys and all they do is bad regardlesssure they like doing things like blowing up graveyards and whatnot but so what its their right to do as they see fit in the sandbox that is eve why do they need to conform to your arbitrary standards dont like them start your own alliance and go after them
if you dont scam in eve youre not doing things right
remember that time our last ceo announced on video that we played this game to ruin your gamegood times good times
remember that time you lead the largest coalition of players in the game into the largest war in eve and wonneither do i
i should be called king more often its got a ring to iti listened to this recording and enjoyed it immensely start at 1600 did you rgarcia
after a bit of thought i cast my vote for little mittens why like him or not he is one of those guys that have stood out in this game his force of personality has shapedswayedchanged many apsects of the eve sandboxso what will he do if he becomes a csm member his ego certainly cant get any bigger maybe his milky white breasts will though but he will definitely be an agent of change no doubt in my mind ill go as far to proclaim that he will be the most influential csm member in the history of eve bar nonewill it be better for the game dont know about that one but one thing is certain for me anyway if he ruins everything ill have a valid reason for cancelling my accounts
anyone who was dumb enough to get scammed deserved it
hi i have encountered many dishonourable people in our alliance many of them are rude uncultured and often infantile this is a reflection on a community in a game called eve online but that is not your complaint i would like to ask you a question you see someone on a sportsfield shoulder charge an opponent who is off the ball if the game is called american football then it is fine because the rules allow it if the game is called soccer then it is not ok because the rules do not allow it eve online has rules anything that is not forbidden is allowed and scamming is as legitimate a form of income as suicide ganking or even running missions and mining do not complain when people play by the rules if you dislike them play a different game that suits your delicate sensibilities the best advocate on the csm will be someone who knows how the game actually works and for that reason im voting for ron
the only thing worse than pubbies crying about ehonor is the people who respond by defending it by saying its part of the game in a boring professor tone instead of sheer mockery
scamming is a part of eve a dirty part but a part nonetheless but scamming is wrong to do but everyone plays eve for different reasons however i dont want the head scammer himself representing me and all of eve he has no right too he hasnt earned it what has he done to deserve it nothing he has no respect for others and now wants people to respect him so back to the same question why should a scammer the head scammer get the honor of csm he shouldnt
hes gonna
maybe depends on who votes if people stand up and make the statement you are not deserving to all scammers and vote accordingly he will lose but if people dont vote and all goons do it comes down to a numbers game
if youd like i can ensure that happens though ill need you to front some isk for the gotv campaign
you misspelled ehounoure
not voting for mittani because the goons scam is not a bright ideanot voting for mittani because hes a useless sack of sht however is that said in the end its just a game a fantastic game but a game nonetheless mittani and his friends on the csm is almost guaranteed to produce some quality internet drama if little else alex has promised us that he will use his awesome words have power technique to twist ccp to do his bidding also be interesting to see if alex and co can refrain from the mobbing in rl or if theyll do a more elaborate version of mazzs sulky spoilt teenage princess routine if things dont go their way
i actually liked his article a while back with the corruption expansion idea boosting lowsechope he influences a little more development in that area when hes csm chairdispite many peoples distaste for goons from my point of view mittani seems to have more insight and embrace for the spirit of the game than mostmy 5cents
i got some unused shiny votes make your offer
provide your comments on this tread here and get the chance to win free stuffthere is a lot of trust issues with buying votes my offer from last csm still stands
i am a honest businessmen you pay isk i vote its called a winwin situation
you got my votes as well this is an important issue i would use linux if the game were easier to run on it even if you dont win ccp should be made aware that there still are folks out here that even though are not currently using linux wish to do so all my attempts to use linuxeve have failed exacerbated by the number of eve patches any number of votes for your position shows the desire for linux support is still a validrelevant issuegood luck
as long as eve runs just fine on wine and indeed it does as far as my experiences go i see no reason to try and force ccp into spending precious manpower on a native client id rather those people were occupied on making the game in general better
i used to run eve on linux and the cedega integration was awful the eve client is not linux native period i had best performance running eve on wine the linux client sucked hard i think that the linux client was only for the small part of the linux users that are too lazy to use wine
thread lacks meat and potatoeswhat are three items you want to change or bring to the table at csmwhat is your position in eve who do you represent
we are all excited about the 3d virtual world that eve is going to introduce in the future but first we shoul have the programmers fix the current problems and focus on the dynamics engineering of the game they fixed a lot of things for pirates and gankers but what about miners and industrialist as we all recall we had a equal choice of choosing a profession when we first started the game when did the programers become prejudice against the industrialist while pvp is a favorite amongst many players those players make up the majority of the game we must keep an equality of all professions in the game it is not always about fighting and having wars its about peace and diplomacy human decency and clear communication is the key for a growing game such as eveUFFFDi also believe that attention to details is as much important to every players choice of employment in eveUFFFDexample the graphics collisions are packets that travel over a network to your computer and back to their network hub depending on the amount of hops it has to take the packets in the eve game are really good but only if the engineers work on the compression pvp has evolved so much that this game has become the best at person to person realtime fighting but wait thats pvp they have forgotten about industialist and the pos stationsUFFFDpos the force field is pretty cool but man does it lag peoples processor so much that it takes longer to get a blueprint in to research it is really annoying for players and has been going on for years no changes have been made to organize these packets this is why you need to vote for me because i know how a game worksthinking of the little people the poor people of eve no job disabled bed ridden college student they all dont have the money for the latest computer in gaming i know the feeling because i too have an older model computer we need to fight together as a team if you vote for me i will fight for you and making sure you will not be left behind together we fight divided we fallUFFFDwhen i become csm 6 i will listen to your evemails and i will convo you for any situation that needs to be fixed or feel that needs to be done i will not promise you the sun because i cant give it to you but i can promise i will work hard for you and try to find a solution to your problemknowledge is power vote for mjjackson for csm6this ad has been aproved by candidate mjjackson
we play ccps game i am a fan of this gameif i wasnt i wouldnt play anymore i am glad we have a say in the direction eve may take in the future ie csm that is part of the reason i like and play the gamemoreover i am doubly glad that ccp has as big of and hopefully a bigger view of eve than alot of our players seem to havei want eve to be big if that means encompassing multiple consoles multiple genres ie rpfpsspase pew pew whatever i support it i want it to be a great game i want it to suprise me in the future like it suprised me when i discovered the game
let me put it this way i dont really care about the dust since i dont even have a console neither i plan to buy one for me as an eve player and a member of a csm the words ccp team is working on the dust link means that ccp team is working on a combat system for pi that i am waiting for almost a year for me as an eve player there is no difference if the combat system gets a random number generated or linked from the dust database instead and as for the dust itself that is another developer working on it and it doesnt takes eve developers resources from me so the dust is out of my concerns
please vote for a candidate anyone that has as a part of his or her platform an antibotting policy opps sorry about that most of the player base is currently botting knows someone that bots or doesnt care plus ccp likes it too much
can i vote with my multiple alts or is that only one vote per human
one vote per account as i understand it
depends if you mean alts as in separate paying accounts yesif you mean the three characters within one account noeach account gets a vote doesnt matter who is behind said account feel free to cast many votes in my direction if you have many accountsmike azariahalso would appreciate a single vote if that is all you havem
ummm yeah err how do i respond to that i dont fly supercarriers and so have not dropped supercarriers on any hulls let alone cruiser hulls regardless of what some of the thousands of others in my alliance may or may not have done following on from that you should vote for me because i have a fairly solid understanding of logic seriously though while i havent been able to experience all aspects of eve particularly those things limited to certain levels of skillpoints like flying supercarriers i have delved into every aspect that i can to see what its like even if it doesnt particularly interest me eg mining pi spying regardless of whether or not i personally enjoy an activity i will try it because what i do particularly enjoy is analysing game playbecause of that i have a broad understanding of all aspects of eve which i look at with a critical often pedantic part of being an academic eye i really like what ccp have done with this game even if some aspects dont specifically appeal to me because what they have created draws in so many peoplei recognise eve as being built from the ground up to be a massively multiplayer online game unlike many which are online with massive numbers of players all engaged in a singleplayer experience im looking at you wow the things that people often gripe about afk cloaking can flipping suicide ganking are mechanics that encourage player cooperation to defend against in these examples this to me is what makes eve special and i will fight to preserve thatamongst many other reasons of course so just vote for me alreadyedit typo
so what are the csms going to do about this buffer because its the most important issues to 60 of the pvp world esp the black op pilots if you want to improve the game you have to improve the ships that the eve players want
where did you get that figure of 60 also my experience in software development has confirmed what i learnt doing my degree  what people say they want and what they really wantneed are not always the same thing
there are problems with blops but fuel and range isnt it the fueling issue has been tweaked already and on top of that you can jump blockade runners of which tier one can warp cloaked the jump range issue is not something that bothers me at all considering id like eve to retain some sense of scale and range not to mention that the ships can jump ships into cyno jammed systemstheir problem lies in actual combat effectivenessthey have less than t1 raw hit points weaker grids and for the most part poor damagetank ratiosat their very best they are expensive substitutes for their t1 counterparts only with a cloak and cyno
i agree with prom herethe jumping fuelrange thing is a none issue it is just they are toothless glass ships at the moment no i have no objection to a ship being 1 of those things but never bothspeaking personalyl i would love to see them buffed with more damage and a damage buff for the first 6090 seconds after coming out of cloak but to leave leave them at no more or only slightly more effective hp than the tech 1 ships bigger and tougher is not always needed if you have optionsi would love to be in small gangs of these ships that get behind lines and wreck havoc on the oppositions support but at the moment the firepower and fragility of these ships does not really support it
feel free to check out my campaign thread bo boosts are one of my top items to be clear no csm candidate can promise to get them fixed buffed or anything but i can as well as others promise to continue to drive the point that has been made clear in previous csms and the community for almost 2 years now as a bo and bo bomber pilot i do want to see them used more
thank you all for posting your thoughts and what you tend to do however i have now made my votethis thread is now closed again thank youwolftin21
i am arguing that you cannot provide complete context despite linking the thread since your interpretation necessarily modifies the context in addition to not actually being completethat is to say even if one were to say that the reader who somehow encounters that thread would be able to achieve the complete context by prefacing it with your interpretation you are modifying the context in which the reader reads the textit is however not the complete context if you wish to define complete context to only cover the text well thats your prerogative however not everyone shares that same view i dont know what kind of soft philosophical classes you were exposed to while studying law hi mittensalt however on my side completeness is a term used carefullyid go so far as to say that the complete context is not possible to recreate not even for the author when he later rereads his own textoh and vote trebor
ohmygod walls of text and vitriol flying everywhere youd almost think that the us presidential election was underwayi see some folks acting like grownups well like grownups are supposed to act and others doing their best to tear things down hmmmm  lets see who to supportanswer  ill go with the rational grownup trebor regardless of whether he knows it all he doeesnt and doesnt pretend to either from what ive seen good luck and please keep all these forums and posts going i have lots of popcorn left
thats a pejorative argument for the exact philosophical reasons you detail below and i offered previouslyit is however not the complete context if you wish to define complete context to only cover the text well thats your prerogative however not everyone shares that same view i dont know what kind of soft philosophical classes you were exposed to while studying law hi mittensalt however on my side completeness is a term used carefullyid go so far as to say that the complete context is not possible to recreate not even for the author when he later rereads his own texti have never claimed to be a lawyer and in fact am not ive addressed the mittens alt accusations as well you arent helping your case any by resorting to those tactics eitherthe end result is that this is a discussion of political and not philosophical matters given the tendencies for political punditry to focus on key phrases or buzzwords as opposed to contextual quotations id say that what i provided was as complete as one can reasonably expect to bethat said the koolaid runs deep in this one likely for the same reason that im bellied up to the mittensvrkrutoj bar and enjoying my nullsecbloc flavored grape drank as wellyoure welcome as always to try and address the issues raised and encouraged to pester trebor to actually answer to the accusation as i believe ive shown myself to be of reasonable demeanor and capable of rational conversation id love to see trebor respond to these and im sure many of the unsure voters would benefit from the exercise
simply searching for macro on the candidates page i find four who explicitly address macro use in that medium aloneim unclear about your concern
thank you for illustrating a vital role of csm  filtering the ignorant illiterate walloftext posting from bothering ccp csm needs people who can critique and clearly communicate ideas so that ccp can get on with solid development rather than filtering through keyboard diarrhoeagriefing stealing scamming piracy looting and pretty much everything you have mentioned are an integral part of the game without pirates who would pirate hunters hunt without griefers who would the heroes protect the innocent from if youve been playing this game for 5 years and havent worked this outthen again there are also the forum trolls

im an indecisive person and i would love to change my name im supporting this
seriously is it that hard to fix font should be bigger and better its very difficult to distinguish between il1 89 b6 and so on i check wide font option in settings and it helps somewhat but font still looks horrible
fully supported
10
i suport this as well but i have one question why the heck do t2 ships have only 2 rig slots makes no senceto have a more advanced ship with less slots then a t1 ccp realy didnt think that one through i think
actually it does wolf rig slots are supposed to reflect the amount of jury rigging a hull can withstand the ill tweak this here to get it to do what its not designed to do kind of modifications so it makes perfect sense that a more advanced ship built to higher specs and tolerances would allow for fewer onthefly modificationswell makes sense to meoh yeah and support for the op
actually the jaguar was one of the reasons why the ab bonus didnt left sissi back in the daysreaching over 4k with a bit of pimp heavy tanked and unscramble

many ships have bad bonuses and should be dealt with however to address the current issue yes afs are mostly shunned because there is always some better ship for the jobfrankly i think the 4th bonus should complement inteceptor role not compete for the role so no warp scramble or mwd bonus pleaseafs need more dps so a straight damage bonus on a real weapon system not rate of fire or useless weapon bonus with the goal that each af can deal as much damage as a daredevil or a dramiel or at least a taranisotherwise you might sell the enyos and hawks as hot dog stands
fix hybrids
hey skinsin you forgot to hit the support button lol
all capitals must be massive not bs sized so far only the titans are1
i agree totally which is why i said earlier that i would support an increased damage nerf should target prioritisation become a reality and besides in my mind it would only be applicable for targetting npc ships not player ships
very true but in their current form theyre useless you might as well not fire anything at allat least remove their ability to target lcos and the like
another good point i would in all honesty be happy with this at a minimum would you care to support this proposal kind sir
a suggestion like that would allow them to effectively be targeted missiles in pvp im a big fan of making fofs not useless but im not so sure about this particular boostliang
quite frankly the dramy is op i meen come on i can run lvl 3 missions in it and just kite the npcs while my t2 hobs do the killin boring but i also agree that there has been to much nerfing already un nerf the ships and mods especaly the drake come on whos stupid idiea was it to nerf a ship thats ment to be a tank all this whineing nerf this nerf that makes me sick its no wauner councel games are more fun only reason i even have to play eve any more is for my friends so it is now nothing more then a paid chat site like yahoo or facebook mabe ill run some missions or mine or even find some thing else to do in game but i wont enjoy the game i like i did when i first started so much has changed and not for the better captians corters whats that all these buggs and inballances and thats what they come up with i for one would rather see themfix some isiues with game play
i dont really understand all the buffs dont nerf debate by either boosting or nerfing something you are changing the metagame in some way and everything shifts either upwards or downwards based on the outcome its clear that the frigate bracket is generally balanced as a whole the only problem is the dramiel why buff every single frigate in the game to match the dramiel and then have to look at the ramifications of a power creep it has on other classes are cruisers obsolete now that frigates are stronger etc other than saying the glass is half full instead of half empty not only are they more likely to screw something up and change the game balance drastically but it will take about 20x as long for designers to do properly
the daredevil and cruor are more expensive than dramiels and they have weaknesses that can be exploited by other classes of ship daredevil  no dual prop due to 3 mids if youre using the 90 web you should more commited in scramweb range in general limited range guns require cap slower than speed fit interceptors making it more vulnerable to kiting outside web range cruor  no dual prop due to 3 mids if youre using the 90 web very slow slower than some afs no neut range bonus making it vulnerable to being kited at 6km neuts not very effective against ships like jaguar hawk hookbill worm etci dont think price should be the only balancing factor and as pointed out the cruor and daredevil are indeed more expensive than the dramiel but also are generally balanced
actually all the frigate bracket is not generally balanced t1 interceptor and faction  asault frigates  pirate frigates except maybe the succubus and worm which are weakthe problem is dramiels are oped compared to their subclass of frigate  pirate frigates if you give them a slight nerf and bump the other pirate frigates such as the worm and succubus you have some other variety for those who want to spend 100 million isk on a frigate like you said the daredevil seems about right make the other pirate ships about that powerful trying to balance all the frigates so they are equal regardless of whether they cost 200k isk or 100 million isk is a bad idea
i would say get rid of them all to gether there useles except to watch them blow up and fix the insurance payout i meen you pay for full covrage insuranse platnum and get a noob ship civ gun char type specifec a civ miner and 1 trit plus fraction of what your ship mods and rigs cost then you gota turn around and spend hours to weeks mineing or doing missions to get enough isk to buy another ship it makes no sence to pay 20 to 110 mill for a frig of any type and only get mabe 150 k and a noob ship for your purchase if my insurance company did that to me i would cancle them in a hart beat its clear the insurance program wasnt realy thought out and no before you whienrs start bashing im not saying over pay on inshurance just make it worth geting it pay out with a better ship and closer to the cost of what you lost not some thing worthles and pay acording to the ship and fittings
thats because you arent in your pod guess what capitains quarters will probably eliminate the problem at least something good can come out of incarna maybe
ccp do some sodding balancing hybreds should be the most commonly used weapon system being used by half the races in eve the most popular used races too yet few use them because they suck
dont want a top speed bonus and want an agility bonus instead get a jump freighternot supported due to it already existing
bump
i have to agree with this proposal there is so many pos off line now where ever you go in eve just take one system metserel 23 pos 18 offline times that by the rest of eve
if you really want that location shoot the pos mechanics are already in game to help you with thisthere is no shortage of moons additionally this could be easily exploited through the use of an alt corpthese threads always just give me a vibe of i want free stuffps war declarations are not costly people are just lazy towers are on the corp assets screen if a corporation is no longer active closed you can petition ccp to remove it i believe as for lag there is no evidence that poss are contributing to the lag monster
i like 38 please look in to this ccp
all id like to see is the ability to reprocess frozen corpses for frozen food
im a 3 year eve player and i have myshare of posts in the forum but this topic is by far the most irasponcible and down right prejeduce topic i have ever seen any one who agrees with this should be ashaimd and arested for hate crimes get a life plz its a game after all and no one haht say where some one else can or cant post you make me sick
bump
as a keres pilot i have to say that it seems a lot of you have never really flown an eaf before the keres is a fun tackler with the ability to hold them down and not get shot at assuming you have the right fitting which someone hinted at earliersmall cap booster ftw and for those of you suggesting a dps increase from the ewar frigs they are not solomobiles the eafs role is ewar while the other fleet members take down the target if you want a solo frig then you need to fly interceptorsbutthe ship does need some changes the speed and the agility of the ship needs to be buffed damps require you to keep range but if you cant keep an orbit at 25km around a target so your damps actually do something then its not gonna do you any good the other complaint is the ehp if your strength in the ship comes from throwing damps and kiting the ship i need to be able to survive long enough to pop their dronesaka not die in 3 vollies from a wave of warrior iis better resist and more hp will make people fly the ship more
they are going to change the ui to be more like what a windows taskbar none the less might as well hammer some logic into itim calling lowhanging fruit on this
same as meta 0 modules scram i 75km 2 strength or disruptor i 20km 1 strength1 free mid is fine and making it slightly easier to kill pve fit is fine at the tradeoff of making it possible at all to kill a pvp fit in it more ship popping is what eve needs regardless of which side
thats the same stat as the t1 in fact for the disruptor its the same stats as the meta 4 overpowered do not support lose the 2point scram reduce the 1point to the same range as a t1 2point and i would consider it
thats just dumb i always try to warp if my ship is going down usually align and overheat to try and outrun point even if someone has a point on you stuff happens to get you free you can pull enough range to get oor they can cap out as to the ops request im a bit torn on it on one hand it would instantly upset the balance of the game suddenly shield tankers would get a massive boost to their tanks of course this would be balanced a bit by giving armor tankers the ability to use their mids for different things cap boosters tracking compsewar moar websit would definitely boost the hell out of the retribution which would suddenly become quite the solo boat not to mention helping the 2 mid slot frigs as well enyowolf with a web heheheh such a change would also boost mwds since more people would fit them on frigates since theyd be less likely to run into a scram all that said having to make choices and sacrifices to achieve certain capabilities is an important part of the game choosing to fit a point and which point to use is an important choice in the game without points pvp doesnt happen so the choice has consequences if you choose to not fit a point and count on a gang mate for tackle you get an advantage somewhere else in your fit for that advantage you trade the assurance that your enemy will stay around to die making a point an integrated feature to all ships removes that choice and its corresponding consequencewhile it would be nice to balance things a bit between pvp and pve fits in the end though i think the idea would just create too many balance problems so not supported
wrong those are the stats of meta 0 t1 mods the worst mods in the entire game cannot be overpowered unless youre looking for risk free kms against them those stats are too low to be viable it needs to be more than meta 0 75 km scram range of the meta 0 is too low to be viable at least give it 9km or so
worst idea everi counter propose that only pods have built in warp scramblers lolstill a horrible ideanot supported
support it should have been on every ship in eve to begin with
while the idea has potential merit its too late in eve development to add such a thing such fundamental design concept should have been added in beta or not at all it just changes the dynamics of pvp too muchif the purpose is to bring pve setups closer to pvp the proper way to go would be to change npcs to be more like players  much smaller numbers stronger attacksdefense much shorter battles and make npcs warp off when they get into hull unless pointed
ok guys useing frigs in highsec wont work at all do to macro programing ease but bigger rats will put a major cramp in there day by bigger i meen like cruisers and or the ocasional bs granted lower bounties the low or nullsec rats of course dont want them qqing that highsec is to opas for the rorqual leave it a lone its ment to be the biggest for a reason if you make it smaller to fit in whs you gota give up its main purpos and that is a flag ship for industrial and combat operations
make those probable mining belts spawned with dynamic location and not static like the current ones too
whats the new policy mal i might be interested in subscribing to it too if its amusing enough
im assuming to support the proposal that salvaging flags you to the owner and thus resulting in an aggression timer loot steal baiting meet salvage steal baiting killmails to follow
never understood baiting in high secim going to try it today in a mining system tyalso ive ninja salvaged before the funniest part seems like 75 of the time instead of hitting a player id hit a bot in a mission they didnt particularly care if i thieved from them
what hilarity mission runner shoots you your salvage boat escapes they dock up and bring their own pvp ship out and gank the hell out of you because you think all mission runners are carebears or they dock up come out in a cheap frig let you nail them kill rights and hunt you down when you are salvaging or transporting goodsyes please change it
there wouldnt be any kill rights if they shoot you only if he ganks you
well said makes no sence to give them another way to bait people only thing to do is make it harder to scan them down i myself and pretty good at scanning but i dont mess with missioners i would rather hit a complex and get much better salvage and loot if any thing ccp should give more incentive to run complexes in highsec as of now they are far and few between for any decent ones in the years that i have been playing i have been scaning for about 2 mabe 3 months and only scanned down 1 decent complexso i say lets increase the sawn rate of them or give corps a and alliances a low or nullsec system off highsec of there own to work with free from invasion oh wait cant do that pvp wine fest there
give them what they ask for and then laugh cruelly as they regret it forever
im down with that
forgot to support before
a lot of the times you cant be close enough to see the ships you are shooting at why not replace the ship icons with the look at camera and increase the size of the window of course this function should be optionalanother example would be the cameras in x3 terran conflict see here youtube  x3 terran conflict gameplay
what i would love to see is a sytem wide scramer and webber over a jammer those to would be much more benificial to any corp or alliance in 00 to proteckt there main system and it should be deplyod at the pos like the turets and other pos defencis but instead of just targeting one ship at a time there system wide bubblesthat only corp or alliance members could warp in
can we extend the request to japan too looks pretty devastating
wow that is a fantastic idea i support it 100
i support the idea of revamping corp permissions im personally fond of a unix like group based permissions system it seems a bit easier to understand as an added bonus theres tons of documentation out there explaining it alreadyliang
eve doesnt allow enough departmentalization at the corp level

thread title should state csm 6 two step exploits in a wormhole do you
i understand some folks are still upset about the whole tracking disrupter thing but i think i have covered this pretty thoroughly on my blog if you dont like it dont vote for me but there is no need to keep posting the same thing over and over again
pretty thoroughly if you mean basically saying it wasnt me gov is thorough then you did a great job in that blogyou and your corp are nothing but cheating exploiters and now you want in on the csm for insider knowledge id hate to think what youd do with that
good luck two step
raised several times as in they kept making petitions with different wordings until they found a gm who didnt understand the issue and gave them permission after having a list of gms declaring it an exploittwo step even if we ignore that you used it during pvp honestly i dont get why it would matter if you used it before rnk came or not you used it in pvp is it a correct deduction then that you think botting is okay since it is only used for pveif people vote for k162 members then that is their choice but they lose the right to complain when exploits are used against them imo
again if you read my blog that isnt what happened no that isnt correct botting is clearly against the eula people should be permabanned for doing it period end of storyoh of course that makes perfect senselook one of the criteria for being allowed to run as a csm is that you cannot have any serious warnings or bans against your account ccp has allowed me to run therefore they consider me not to have been found guilty of exploiting i understand that people are concerned about the whole thing and as i have said many many many times by now it was clearly a mistake both by me personally and by the corp as a whole what i am asking is that i am judged only on my personal mistakes which is that i didnt ask clearly enough about exactly what the gms said when we were told it was ok to use tracking disruptors

if the website had not excluded certain candidates it would be very nice it is really the only mechanism that tells you how these candidates will actually vote on proposals the campaign posts herein jita are mostly fluff of course if someone says they disagree that ccp have one thing be a priority over all others and you think they should  well that may cause a big discrepancy in the percentage maybe that candidate thinks ccp should spend allot of their time on that but not more than everything else therefore they disagree it was pointed out that these sorts of questions cause problems to the mechanic if they are answered honestly so you have to sort it out for yourself and not just go by the percentage if someone agrees agrees strongly to one thing being a priority over everything else then the only truly honest answers to the rest these sorts of priority questions would be disagree or disagree strongly but that doesnt necessarily give an accurate overall reading of their perspective

thank you sir may i have another
grrr shhhhh  go take a look at my hybrids nice idea this thread
i noticed that ms pacman can use even more votes
yeah im still not seeing what youre getting at as both of those lines are in the quoted part of my post if there was a character mishmash between the copypaste from goonfleetcom to eveo i was unaware of it and any undesired changes to the formatting were unintentionalits sort of hard to  up a copypaste mechanic especially since i did it twice but if youre hung up on that then i doubt theres much i could do to satify your need to troll this thread
pinball style doomsday weapon where did i even suggest that he was looking to turn eve into a piball gameif that was my biggest complaint then i would have focused on it it was included in a list of bad ideas he had brought updedicated individuals could crack the encryption clientside leading to significant advantages you think monkeyspheres invisibleinlocal stunt was bad this would be much much worsehang on let me titancannon a hundred alts in newbie frigates on your fleet and  you well continue this discussion when you load in stationill just wrap up a couple hundred construction blocks and issue a contract called caldari navy raven for 700m isk trust me its a navy raven in theredue to the limitations of post length ill have to address the rest of your post in a follow up itll be posted shortly
someone else posted a decent retort to this point but for the record ill just put out there that there are very few ways to survive a gate camp and without an ingame means of determining whats on the other side of a gate before you jump through making any changes to further limit survivability options would be bad for the average eve player furthermore making recons and covops into invincible permacloakers instead of having the ridiculously short vulerability period they have now is also a bad idea eve thrives on riskversusreward implement this and youd hardly ever see a person outside of a gangfleet in anything other than a covopsrecon not to mention making it perfectly safe to transport high value items like bpos without riski mentioned in a previous post that i would have loved if he would address these points and even gave away a very powerful escape mechanism by mentioning that a reply to the tune of i used to think that but my experiences in x y z have changed my mindhe hasnt bothered to reply to those so for now i wont substitute an excuse for bad ideasits almost comedic how many funny fix ideas turn into real implementation perhaps an astute reader may catch on to this and say okay so tongueincheek reply on this one but thats still one bad idea which really only serves to further my original thesis that trebor is bad at eve and would be a bad choice when it came down to ccp saying hey we want to do this next what do you guys thinkneither really as ive maintained decorum throughout this thread and have taken the time to address several peoples posts with reasonable constructive replies catchall commentary works well in caod but it really undermines your credibility when youre trying to make a high road argument
alright alright while i can agree with the op on a few points i hardly think that bringing up a few examples of bad ideas in which are simply original suggestions that indeed may sound stupid but in my book and probably trebors as well just shooting ideas on the table no matter how terrible they may sound can serve as starting points for other ideas we all do that when brainstormingand yea yea trebor might not know eve as much as you or i but we have to think on what exactly makes the difference between a good and a bad csm your arguments against trebor are only onedimensional as they attack his one major weakness which in this case is probably game knowledge but his many other qualities far outshine that of course theyre are plenty of csm that are probably more suited but i disagree that this lack of knowledge is as detrimental to his abilities as csm as you believe it to bethe facts are indeed laid out and now the interpretation of these facts is what its all aboutanother fact is that i can see a lot of agressivity towards trebor in the sense that you are trying to undermine his campaign by exposing his less pretty qualities fair game but still all it is is negative projection just like negative advertising cold hard fact or not peoples opinions about who makes a good csm is entirely subjective
once again goons need to train up reading comprehension if possible which apparently it is not i didnt like a lot of the ideas that were brought up a lot of them have major issues however that wasnt the point of my post my point is that you are intentionally misrepresenting himtypical goon behavior but i figured that the casual reader or one unfamiliar with the lameness of the goons in general should be made aware of your stunts
shotgunning ideas is what you do when youre developing from the ground up once your platformprogrampresentation is framed up you stop throwing out random ideas and start working within constructs and limiters people who continue to shotgun ideas after this stage are detrimental to the process and ultimately will cause delays due to investigations into plausibility of implausible or improbable functions or drama due to their ideas being summarily dismissedthis is business development 101 stuff if youre interested i highly recommend checking out tedcom and watching some of their presentations on dynamic development processthis is where you and i are going to diverge on our opinionsi would hope for and expect my csm reps to have outstanding knowledge of at least one major thematic area of eve whether that is missionrunning lowsec piracy industry and marketing 00 bloc politics etc i do not expect a csm rep to be an expert in all of these examples or any other examples one may want to bring up being highly knowledgeable in one area and perhaps familiar in one or two others would be fantastic as that person would potentially have a very keen mind to any changes or additions that ccp may offer along the lines of or affected by whichever their area of expertise liessomeone who is verbose charismatic and lacks understanding of many basic areas of eve would use the csm as an its all about me show visavie jade constantines run in csm 1 as a csm and a playerbase weve grown past that stage to the point where ccp is beginning to utilize the csm as a development partner not just a focus group that they wind up ignoring afterwards i want all of the csm reps not just my favored few to reflect thisi never presented my opinion as objective i presented the sourcesfacts that laid the foundations of my opinion in an objective manner but i was clear when i made my case that it was my subjective opinion behind the postyes this is a negative piece on trebor hes had some very zealous sycophants giving his nether orifice a good tonguing for the last few weeks and it was clear that he was to be a crowd favorite i chose to look into him to see what the hype was all about and was appalled at what i saw the shock of it all led me to want to share my findings as i felt that others would feel equally duped by him and would help me to see better candidates to the csm this time around
youve made a point that i was misrepresenting him and have yet to back that accusation with anything resembling an argument let alone a convincing one its hard to picture that taking someones words within the context that they presented them collating multiple instances of these and presenting them as a theme is somehow misrepresentative typical goon behavior would involve more  jokes and 4chan memes its bad enough that youre making a horrible argument but when you cant even identify what a typical goon action is and see that what im doing here is extremely atypical i would question the basis of your understanding of politics and the electoral process and suggest that you may be too young or immature to contribute meaningfully
you saw that huh
the whole point is that they are generalizing the goon mentality and using that to discredit any argument you might put forward as having evolved from the goon hive mind they refuse to allow for the fact that you are all indivduals with different perspectives thats typical for trolling forum posts with propaganda intended soley to discredit the original author of the post and any who agree with himherfor all we know the are all trebors alts but that too would be generalizing trebor might not be a bad guy for all we know he just lacks the ability to communicate himself and reach his intended audience with a post that truly represents his point of view and character there is a software engineer here in canada that has developed a letter editing tool intended to eliminate an authors miscommunication of his intent effectively it pulls apart a post letter or other document and analyzes it for communication of the ideas therein once this is done and the process has found a typical audiences interpretation it will communicate this to the author and allow him to edit his writing for better communication of ideas thus when he has finished his document the intended audience should receive it with little difficulty in understanding the intent behind it useful tool wish i had one

after seeing a lot of johnathan walker posts this csm election i mostly just want to know if hes a furry a roleplayer or a bear or some combination of all threethis is a pretty pressing issue please address it
tell you what how about you link me your source i know exactly where i pulled mine from and its unaltered link yours and well compare notes
sure no problemyour postmittanis postapparently your post in this same thread but with additional contentsatisfied
after all the drama that the goons and their bunnies have gone through to smear trebor he could support replacing eve with ponies online and id still vote for himfact is that the drama has almost certainly helped his campaign more that hurt itwhat remains to be seen is what happens during csm6 itll be interesting to see if alex and his boys can behave constructively or if theyll resort to the same sort of drama there that led earlier csms to irrelevance vov
roleplayer  nobear  absolutely notfurry  this one amuses me but noeditsomeone whos not intimidated by famepopular support and calls bs on brainwashing hell yes
honestly no i did an overlay and all 3 posts have the exact same content with a very simple exception after the 2nd paragraph there is a cripes in mittanis post that didnt appear in either of the ones you linked of minei have previously explained that cripes is an emoticon that we use on our forums and it doesnt translate here i did include it in an additional copypaste along with underlining two words to match the exact appearance of the post from goonfleetcomactually im done trying to explain to you how copypaste works youre clearly getting angry because your trolling isnt working
wouldnt that imply that since eve is already created then we should try to stay as close to the original product as possible of course improvement upon the already established system is what we want but nothing says fresh ideas cant also be something to think aboutdrama due to their ideas being summarily dismissed really seems childish in a professional environment i dont see a reason to get attached to ideas that were simply shotguned out there also the csm does not have much say in suggesting full fledged solutions ccp devs do that im not that worried that it will cause much of a problemi dont think it would be productive to argue about that since i do believe this is really a matter of opinion the all about me factor in my opinion depends greatly on the csms personality its not easy to measure when you base yourself on what they say especially when the speeches are part of a politicesque campaigni laughed at this one because it is indeed true i do think that trebor does indeed get way more credit than he deserves but then again this does reflect human nature people follow the masses and can be converted by the slightest indication of good leadership and after they chose theyre allignement changing ones mind is almost shameful too much pride to give up on what you believed so much that youd hide your disappointment by blaming the goons of foulplayi dont believe trebor is a bad csm candidate but hes not the best either his other qualities in terms of organisation and communication is what i think is good about him but theres plenty reasons to expect more
you must be a complete idiotfifteen seconds of clickingyour post he has zero clue about how this game works but doesnt let his lack of knowledge get in the way of offering an opinion he wrote some pascal games back in the 80smittanis post he has zero clue about how this game works but doesnt let his lack of knowledge get in the way of offering an opinion hes also even more of an unfunny got in real life than he is on the internet  a feat that i didnt think was possible until i ended up trapped in a room with him for 8 hours a day he wrote some pascal games back in the 80slets play spot the differences if you can tell me that there is no difference between these two snips courthouse the entire community should realize how ridiculous your wild claims are as a whole when your comprehension is seriously in need of some work
im browsingposting from an iphone maybe its the platform and limited screen size but your links are all the samefrom here if theres a difference somewhere from a later copypaste then its likely an edit done to the original post after i posted here ive put far more time than what would be reasonable into your phantom tinfoil ravings that honestly have nothing to do with the topic at hand ive been reasonable and evenhanded this entire thread your lunatic ravings about goon conspiracies is not only unfounded but likely having the opposite effect as the people looking to these threads for guidance in placing their votes are seeing a lot of angry posters making wild intangible claims youre best bet will likely be to set the keyboard down and go for a run or something you look like you could use some endorphins right about now
i wonder if we can get this thread to 15 pagessent from my iphone
for me peak comedic value would be if this thread got longer than trebors csm thread
how stupid do you think we areyour original post does not match the source at the time stop blaming others be a man or woman and take responsibilitypathetic display of manipulation community 1 goons 0 try again
johnnie walker go drink some whiskey and calm down a bit youre trying to stir up a conspiracy theory but i just dont see it
someone whos better at database parses should query how often this tired writeoff has been used on these forums because im pretty sure the score would be much higher on the community side
conspiracy not at all this is just simple facts now if i wanted to talk about stealth edits to the forums in a way that doesnt show edited by now that would be a conspiracy
good post quoting that blobs were cool when i started playing eve im still enjoying large scale warfareand with supercarriers online im not sure about that but solo and small gang pvp is so much  better its actually the only way to play the game and have fun btw penalty to member counts wont do much we will just get razor mk i mk ii etc   vote for prom
theres nothing wrong with fleet warfareits the fact that pvp does not scale very well that needs looking into
deservedly the longestserving csm  long may it continue meissa works harder to help improve this strange place in the stars that we call home than anyone ive ever met
a welldeserved bump for meissa he doesnt make a lot of noise but his qualifications are strong a vote for meissa will not be a wasted votea vote for me will be better of course 
meissa is probably hard at work one vs oneing in local and i dont know what a csm would be like without him so goodluck where ever you are and i hope to spahm you on facebook soon please stop recycling my campaign from last year
goons often mock roleplayers in eve because they have to do so much goddamned work to roleplay this is because the ingame client provides essentially no immersion whatsoever so you might as well be rping by post on a forum somewhere yakking about space politics or whatever ive actually unironically enjoyed roleplaying in better formats i used to be a huge oldworldofdarkness mush addict and that worked out great because the medium of text on a mush is very conducive to rp incarna is a controversial issue in some circles however its going to happen period incarna is the wod mmo engine alpha ccp is developing it you cannot stop it the csm cannot stop it its foolish to think otherwise however its also a nuanced issue because if ccp didnt use the wod code in eve making the games crosscompatible where possible the development resources ccp is expending on wod would provide no utility for eve whatsoever the eve playerbase cant prevent the wod mmo nor can the csm but through incarna eve can at least see some benefits of the wod development personally i think eve desperately needs immersion part of the reason why people point out that im the same in eve as i am in real life is because theres no immersion im watching a ty dated ui and a picture of a spaceship but in practice im zoomed way the  out anyway because the game lags so badlyso my immersion is 1 a ui that is based off an excel spreadsheet 2 a zoomed out bracket   and a bunch of other  s around me you could practically turn eve into a multiplayer roguelike  anyhoo you get a seriouspost from me wrt rp because i think incarna is something that eve needs even though a lot of people do not realize it it needs the immersion factor some people will instarage because i say eve needs incarna but they are fools they are fools not because they are wrong to disagree with me some may say eve is immersive enough etc but because since incarna and wod are inevitable and thus thoroughly pointless to rage against
dude im sure youre a chill nerd brosef to hang out with in rl but youre kinda losing it just go away
first i could give a flying f what you look like second you still havent responded to your full  statement in the vote match system about t2 bposi meanwtf dude i may have done it in a  way but i did call you out on something you wrote down that pretty much any market veteran would consider the intellectual equivalent of peeing into your own mouth to deal with your dehydration your response ultimately is to link facebook photos of yourself good god dude the only think you are unmasking here is how far your opinion of your abilities outpaces reality of course like youve mentioned you are a lawyer so this shouldnt be a surprise
you seem like youre on a nerd crusade and youre not voting for me anyway idgaf vov oh hey you edited your post seconds after i repliedyoure unironically surprised that after popping up like an antagonistic sperg raging about bpos that i trolled you reallyyou might be mistaking me for a candidate who will grovel or suffer fools for votes i am not that candidate one of my planks is ruthlessness and my space empire is based on crueltywho even cares mds blocvoting for kalrand if they have any sense youre not going to vote for me feel free to angrypost some more though
no i am disappointed that i once thought mittani to be above the negative stereotypes i have come to believe of all goons where i once believed pure cunning brilliant strategy and execution were dominant traits i have found these overshadowed by arrogance and condescension it is unfortunate life is full of disappointments i had hoped that i was just misreading but this was not the casemoving along to the next candidate who i may be able to rally behind certainly not stopping hereinsert rebuttal flames about feelings being hurt blah blah blah i know theyre coming  ing off potential voters is never good political strategy
from where i see things csm is a sounding board as said before many times when i read your the mittani statements and posts im interpreting that you will turn it into more then a sounding board lobbyist group is the closest thing in my mind for comparisonthe actual questions1 you say the other candidates are lying to us and promising us things but arent you promising us things as well at its core each candidate is telling us how they want to do things you appear to me as no different same dish different flavors if you understand my analogy2 in regards to unifying the csm do you intend to do this through your own personality and way of doing things i dont see much detail on how you will accomplish this3 if you do so what do you think of the event that ccp just shuts out csm alltogether will you take actionif any to circumvent such an event i apologize if this has been asked already 14 posts of reading and mind went blurrythank you for your time
i will be voting for you i am resident in lowsec 99 of the time that i am in eve whilst this would normally be the springboard for me to rant in tedious length about what i personally do or do not like about lowsec i will not be doing that fix it or dont i dont really care i dont really mind the lowsec mechanics i even dont care about gcc and gate guns and i would argue that most pirates dont really care about them regardless of what they might say when they get all riled up and shouty as you mention and as is glaringly obvious to any eve player with even a teeny brain the csm will never be responsible for massive playchanging modifications to the game so regardless who i and my alts choose to vote for the likelihood is that not much will changeso why am i bothering to vote at all why am i bothering to vote for you and why am i bothering to waste all the forumkids time writing about it simply put because from reading your articles and from watching the parts of your career that have floated dreglike down to us lowsec scumbags you seem to be an intelligent articulate guy who has a deep commitment to the game im sure we wouldnt agree on a lot of stuff but we agree on quite a bit of it and thats enough for me i know you wont change anything for the better but  it youll be a cat amongst the pigeons and thats good enoughalso nice puppy
itt mittani still says unironicallyloli was considering voting for mittani because maybe if this game got worse ccp would do something and having mittani as csm the same guy who cant even manage an alliance and destroyed his own alliance 3  4 times the game would get worse and ccp would do somethingunless this was the plan all along because if it is then mittani only you would be capable of making something go from bad to worse
thank you for your reply mittani and from one old school wod musher to another you have my vote
by that logic shouldnt everyone responding to this thread be trolling you since the candidacy is little more than an angry sperg anyways i would assume that the mittani could handle a little harsh criticism and not repeatedly refuse to acknowledge his original statement good lord you would think a clever and ruthless type you claim to be could come off more as a slick willy instead of a dubya dont mistake power with the undestanding of how to actualize itso one more time definitely not the last did you state that the removal of t2 bpos was a good idea in the vote match system
there is only one true godand the mittani is his profit
freudian slip there
oh man youve really lost the plot but please dont stop its not often we get quality stuff like this
dear leader hasnt destroyed the alliance even once under the kind guidance and wisdom of the dear leader we have grown strong and numerous and our reach extended greatly the five year economic plans are all on track to exceed quota and every goon has bread in one hand and a rifle in the other to think that the dear leader is responsible for our past hardships is the strange ranting of revisionists and capitalist roaders once dear leader has ascended to csm chairmanship and you have experienced the brilliance of themittani thought you will see the insanity in opposing dear leaders will through his guidance we will all flourish in a new posttrebor society
seriously its some pro ruthless clever stuff hereplease link pictures to show how hot you are again that was some pro stuff mate
thats not a bad analogy an effective advocate for the players would essentially be a lobbyist group ive hit these questions before but like you say its a loooong thread 1 since my campaign was announced many candidates have moderated their statements so they arent caught in the open promising to fix blasters which was the stereotypical lol csm platform joke in years past the issue isnt people making promises but making promised wildly outside the scope of the csm  promising to make design changes etc i can promise to be a ruthless bastard and to attempt to increase the power of the csm2 i wont know exactly the best path until i know the makeup of the csm after the 30th different personalities have to be handled in different ways i have one of the best records of making disparate groups work together for a common goal of anyone in eve however 3 i have serious concerns that ccp might stonewall the csm especially after the monstrously daft open letter that was just published such a letter plays well with the voting base  and ill probably be pilloried for daring to criticize it but  it you need to apply pressure in a canny way pressure on the upper management from the media wrt the summer of discontent appeared to work quite well as the pressure was tailored to people who can do something about it ie  were getting nuked in the press order our line devs to do an interative bugfix expansion and do more blogs about lagfixes as opposed to the open letter which complained about a lack of gameplay in the wod engine alpha ie incarna to linelevel devs  people who 1 cant alter incarna or axe it since its an engine test 2 arent beholden to player or media pressure at all anyway so thats an example of a political move which is popular with voters but accomplishes nothing incarna isnt going to have much gameplay the line devs cant stop it or change it and the playerbase raging about it isnt going to change it all the letter can do is  over csm6 such that we start from a position of ccp expects the csm to throw tantrums and resign en masse note how few from csm5 are going for reelection dont bother with these idiots how will i try to overcome this i have no idea at this juncture the first step once elected will be to gather intel and talk to as many ccp people as will be willing to chat with me about how the csm5 did from ccps perspective because its all well and good for us to hurf about high profile stunts from jita park in practice none of us actually know how the csm is doing from the ccp side i suspect what i uncover will be ugly and possibly damning the job will be much harder now thats for sure
im going to take a wild stab in the dark here and answer on mittens behelf by ensuring that 90 of the people on the csm are the leaders of my closest allies
thanks for the endorsement i have some dated views on lowsec for what its worth i think the region is the most neglected area of the game a couple of years ago at eve vegas there was a design competition which my team won drafting a corruption expansion for lowsec theres a tth column about it however like you say me being on the csm isnt likely to have any direct impact on lowsec gameplay as for a cat being among pigeons there are a bunch of posters in this thread who are absolutely certain that because im ting on people who are idiots and not being nice to every poster i will lose this election and lose it badly i appreciate your savvy analysis of the situation pigeons are tasty
let me get this straight i openly announce myself to be an arrogant manipulative sadist and now you are shocked shocked that im an arrogant manipulative sadist i got nothin
i just picked up the eve tribune endorsement for csm chairman
i bet you feel real good about brown nosing in a creepy rp way but you should stop
friday bump
thank you good sir
good question and yes as e man correctly states this is a job that i wouldnt be applying for if i wasnt willing to commit to it i spoke to several csm members to get an idea of the time commitment required and will be devoting at least an hour or two a day to being a csm member and much more during busy weeks ive also volunteered to keep up and host teadazes csm database for the new term and could probably be talked into taking the role of the csm secretary as wellon top of that ive also commited to hosting regular player roundtables on topics ccp is asking us about to get direct player feedback on issues if elected i expect ill be doing that once a month or so during my termand that doesnt include the time im updating my own blog i invite anyone interested in my run to read itthank you so much for those that are interested ive written two long posts regarding why i think ccp is so focused on incarna and what csm6 can do about incarna the second post i called learn to fly and covers why i think the development of incarna can be a hopeful thing and how i think csm6 can affect the course of incarna
i am really hoping you get a chance to help fight the good fight sir
well i think i might swing form trebor to ripard youll get at least one of my votes hope you get in
i spend months of hesitation because of many points but i made my way for itnow im successfully living in low sec and became coceo having fun with blues 10 ss has ive never thaught it was possible and belive me youll learn hundred times more with those guys than in months of high sec grinding forum reading or high sec grieffinggriefferslow sec living is a large team work where trust is something you cant fail or your days are over you must fix your goals and the time you can spend playing and belive me corps living in low sec accepting casual players who want to learn and want play in team they flow more than you thinktry to convo some low sec corps dimplomatics or join ig chanels explain your goals the time youre willing to spend in game and then find the one that suit you its that simple to find one where you can get tons of fun either with winnings or with losseswe dont ask api keys to our players and we have no trouble with our guys trust goes on both ways and its the most important if they want to give it to us than its their choice but we dont ask them because this must be a volunteer act of trust and were not the only ones doing this so you have all your chances
even though trebor sucks hes got my 2 votes
hi trebor if you look in the eve stuff files there are new fonts already theyve actually been there for a while now that arent in use ingame theyre much easier to read than the current one although theyre obviously based off them maybe half of this question has already been done
if by playerbase is unified and furious at them you mean the 5 of them that are screaming in the forumsi cant seriously believe they are still people who thought that for 18 months theyre wasnt going to be anything devoted to eve this rumor arised from a misinterpretation of the ccp team allocation chart and sheer pessimism of some very loud forum hogs who spent their days just broadcasting their miscontentment with the game the csm has helped the changes come through very progressively as their role became a bit more defined over time also these changes were mostly incorporated during the tyrannisincursion expansion production timelines which by the way were full of content for the space eve evidently the 18month rumor was never a deciding factor in the evolution of the csm roles in fact thats all it was a rumorand im pretty sure ccp does an excellent job ignoring the loud forum hogs because they know that they dont necessarily represent the playerbasethe csm on the other hand they do represent the players they do it in a contructive way rather than by screaming and shouting i believe that thats what trebor was trying to say expressing miscontentement agressively to ccp is probably not the most effective way he favors a more diplomatic method where analysis of the problems at hand can be done in a more civil and contructive manner
oddly at least we have common ground at least this much is somewhat reassuring
ill tell you from an outsiders perspective what csm5 was exactly doing csm5 publicly engaged in a very visible manner the players at large in crowd sourcing effortsnovember 2010 crowdsourcingaugust 2010 crowdsourcing csm5 aggressively pressured ccp regarding the often cited backlog for timelines and deliverables in the june summit which mynxee blogged about it was discovered then that currently there is no process in place to ensure that csm issues placed in the backlog are properly tagged named or otherwise identified for purposes of querying or tracking this second point alone is massive forget campaign promises forget if elected i will speeches the very core of keeping track of our ideas was found to be sorely lacking no member of csm 1 csm 2 csm 3 or csm 4 sat down with a copy of hansoft used by ccp went through the wiki and produced a list of items from records to push back on to ccp as a result of efforts by csm5 we were provided with the june 2010 ccp deliverablesif anyone is serious about the csm having this kind of public call to accountability and with measured transparent updates from ccp is critical to the entire effort of both sides unless this continues to be pushed all other points are moot forget lag forget 00 forget industry or missions or botting if your questions and concerns are lost in the shuffle it is all pointlessin short csm5 loudly professionally and aggressively called ccp to be accountable to us all with such dedication perseverance and skillful execution that refusal to comment was not an option we the community won a major battle and the work goes onthat among hundreds of other examples is the level of commitment csm5 brought to the table and with that in mind should be one of many dominating factors to reelect trebor i would be hard pressed to split my votes were all previous csm5 candidates running
those list is the proof of what i say about csm5we have new icons on faction ammo new mwd icons nice thats such a huge leap forward i mean the game was absolutely dying because of that you just forgot to speak about what interest real players around  balance  why an honest miner player should end up with a ty gameplay in front of a rock for 1 hour to get a ridiculous amount of isk  because there are thousand of bots around that makes the same thing 2424h and ruins the economy of the honest playerwhat actually did csm5 about that  nothingwhy should a caldari player discover he is just good to be a joke in pvp  why his missiles are only good to fill space with lags and never reach their target who has already been destroyed by muns or lasers  thats minimum a 14 th of the population of eve that has to make an alt to be able to enjoy even just a little pvp should it be nullseclowsec or factionnalwhat actually did csm5 about that  nothingnah instead of this you guys have faction icons on your missiles or modules  after the farmville pi you can try to do a corp hangar mahjong csm5 really saved the day
no csm can just bring things up for a vote before that can happen a proposal has to be raised in assembly hall and if it gets sufficient support an interested csm will raise in one of our meetings often ideas are tested and refined in features  ideas before being moved to the assembly hallthis process is slow and requires some effort but that is by design it makes sure that proposals are subject to scrutiny and hopefully improvement first by players then by an interested csm and finally by the full councilproposals that make it through this gauntlet are hopefully battletested enough to give them a chance of getting noticed by ccpps my apologies for getting a bit behind in replying to questions in the thread yesterday was a wonderful day  my eldest son was accepted into his college of choice and there was much celebration  but that meant i had less time to devote to composing replies
the point is we asked ccp in our internal forumswhich our advocates monitor so that such questions can be passed on to the appropriate teams inside ccpon 7 march for an update about the new font including specific questions about the status of that font those questions have not been answered as of this post the only response received so far was a sentence in response to an earlier question in that same thread related to sharing information with the community about the status of the new font no promises made so far digging into stuff files just provides one piece of isolated information the fact that a different font is there it does not answer the questions we asked about whether the new font ccp told us at the june summit that it was commissioning is still a go if so what its current status is and what the plan is right now regarding deploying a new font the csm has asked ccp a simple question that has a simple answer we should not have to search through the eve client data files or constantly monitor sisi in an attempt to discover cluesthe meaning of which we can only speculate aboutthat point only to possible answers to such questions on topics like this that were discussed at a summit and about which users make direct inquiries it is not unreasonable to expect straightforward and timely answers from ccp especially for something as uncomplicated as a status update request
youre wrong there we actually discussed quite a lot of balance issues at the june and december summits balancerelated proposals were part of the crowdsourcing exercises balance discussions have been conducted in our internal forums if you bother to inform yourself about what csm5 has done by reading the detailed information that is available to anyone who wants to know and which has been typically been announced linked and discussed in this forum along the way then i think you will come to a different conclusion than that csm5 has done nothing just because your pet issues did not get attention doesnt mean weve been laying around eating bonbons for 10 months
i just blogged about why i feel it is so important to vote in this election for a diverse csm and for people who will fight the good fight for eve like trebor
wicked blog post mynxee and yes this is indeed a call to arms well done
trebor daehdoow i do hope to see you get in you have alot of great ideas sadly nc envy you for your awesomeness but thats ok no one takes them serious minus their minions
no one takes them seriously besides the largest single faction of people in the gamewell then
thanks for the wizardry callout but its actually trebor suxquite possibly but as i said and mynxee comments on im trying to get a clarification and possibly an etaps some of you may enjoy these electionthemed lyrics
my bad but it has been at least 25 years since ive played that game memory fades when youve done as many drugs as i have not to mention being old
a few questions for treborin csm5 it was noted that there is concern about tracking of submitted items to ccp what can we expect from ccp and csm 6 going forward we have seen some comments indicating that new or improved tools would be of great benefit to future councils are there any plans on either side to have this happenwill the csmnews mailing list see an increase in activity this yearassuming top vote count would you choose to go for chair of csm6 or return to secretary duties would you mind explaining your reasoning for either or
good luck
my issue with him is that hes simply failed to outline any sort of idea related to anything the csm does instead resorting to grandstanding and a childish youre all lying liers platform the other goon candidates have at least attempted to show they understand what the csm is for and outlined some of their ideas but mittani just seems to be relying on the fact that hes the mittani and there are hordes of goon s who will vote him up purely based on that
go seleene go this is a call to arms as my blog post linked there says i believe you are a vital front runner in continuing to fight the good fight for the future of eve
as a change of pace gumpy is actually not trolling a vote for draco is a vote to grief vuk
i have known draco for many years now god help him lol and if you vote for him like i have ur not be disappointed he is 100 commited and always has been and he knows wot he is talking aboutso make your vote count and vote draco llasa gl mate
its true a lot of folks arent posting here why they wont be voting for me but i think there is support for someone with my viewpoint and proven experience as a csmim not doing this for a vacation to iceland i think since a certian spork tosser got piched out of the csm and now there is a huge number of folks that need a candidate and if enough of those folks vote for me ill commit the time to represent them i will show up do the work and keep my silverware on the table no matter what the emotional climate may beissler diainzevoice of reason csm candidate
issler is always my choice there is such a unique depth to this game unlike most other mmorpgs i would just say that without a voice for the side of producing and building things there would be less stuff to blow up do you really want that to happen you want someone in there to help make sure you never have a lack of targets
ive voted for issler i didnt see any other candidates that seemed to talk about what miners like myself need to see changed in evegood luck isslerjs
i am excited to see this election will have record participation the csm can make eve a better placeso who should vote for me any of the below industrialist independent pilots anyone interested in seeing low sec being made relevant again pilots that think most candidates are only interested in big 00 power blocks you think that the huge increase in the population of eve requires new resources moons for example miners pve focused pilots folks that like spacellamas pilots worried about the stations being flooded with a deadly neurotoxinso i promise if elected i wll do all i can to bring focus to these issuesissler dainzevoice of reason csm candidate
i didnt vote for you issler but i wish you good luck all the same the manufacturing and mining part definitely needs some love
thank you i can only hope that this interest will grant me your vote for the csm these are very specific questions before answering i think that these concerns although important to you and highly influential of your game experience should not be the main thing dictating who will receive your vote in the csmto give you my personal opinion about these matters  i strongly believe in the sandboxrules of engagement and firing power of station and gate turrets should be variable especially in 00  id be delighted to see dominions system upgrades allowing for turret placement and configuration in claimed systemswhen it comes to high and low security space i believe they are quite balanced at the moment perhaps it would be a good idea to increase their damage and reduce their ability to hit small ships so the damage is a bit more even on various shiptypes any changes to the turrets would have to be closely calculated thus as eve has a very fragile balanceadditionally it makes no sense that someone docked in a station cannot look out a window to see whos camping outside its a whole new game mechanic but i feel such a thing should be implemented which would change the way station blockades are made of course such radical additions to the gameplay require a much indepth analysis and the will to evolve in that direction from ccp
good morningany other topics to discuss hope everyone has a great day fly safe

seems my corp has been rejected rentspace for political reasons i will try to find a clarification on these political reasonsseems to me that if you are not involved in any eula violation that you have no political reasonsi will not hand out details on this matter yetthis underscribes the need for ms pacman to get into the council
the questions you should be asking is1 how did iskbank get away with rmt for so long freely without ccp doing anything2 why are nc buying the most isk3 why the sudden interest on iskbank i did make a thread about this exaplaining all of the above but nc devs deleted the thread
one thing you touched on in your blog csm platform that interests me greatly is blackops battleships also a subject i have yet to come across on any other platformothers may have touched it but im only about 13 way thrunow this issue to me as a black ops pilot is very low on the list there are many ways arounda limited fuel bay and you have to keep in mind that this is a subcapital with jump drive capabilitieswhat i am interested in is what other issues you see plaguing the ships and what improvements you would bring to the table

voting a goons candidate whatever he may say means voting for goons politics isnt it obvious enoughhow can you trust a player whos in an alliance who made griefing scamming and metagaming its trademarkany goon once elected will do whatever he pleases and possibly annoys the highest number fo players and will say rotfl im a goon whoever was stupid enough to vote me expecting to not be scammed deserves to be scammed

one way to get a bpo even a t2 version could be dependant on getting your hands on a ship by fair means or foul and diassembling it fast and dirty low percentage chance slow and considerate higher deconstruction times should at the very least be matched by the build timeway i look at is if youre prepared to sacrifice a ship and up to multibillion ones at that to roll the dice on a bpo why shouldnt you be able to certainly makes sense on an external to the game basis the only downside as per usual is that the massive null sec entities can throw iskies at an issue until they get what they want mind you the same could be said of existing t2 bposskills would also affect chance thoughts
reverse engineering i like that idea the percentage chance could be modified by the relevant skills of the inventor tell me aside from the possibility of the bpo would the player get some of the materials back as well sort of a semi focused reprocessingit is not that i hate bpos of the t2 variety    far from it i just have a problem with awards from what has been thought to be a flawed original process the lottery still being in existence with no chance for a more equitable process working in a similar veinas for large organizations throwing isk at something till they get it why not there should be some advantage to having a huge organization and lots of iskm
minerals andor components i cant see why not though it should again be skill and chance based probably better left to those people who have a better idea of in game balances and csmers as a side effect it might be a carrot for those people involved in industrial espionage if you cant sell the ship or move it break it down and move the bpobest of luck m
no their original introduction was a terrible idea and should not be repeated think of it like knocking up some chick you dont love you shouldnt have done it but that doesnt mean that your only remaining option is an 8th trimester abortion or knuckling down and spitting out another 100 bowel babiesyou have to appreciate that to market folk like myself this is the equivalent of arguing that all pve should be instanced or that titans should be handed out to all market folk generally keep to themselves we are probably the single most soloplayers in eve because there is little reason to work with others consider us the eve ronin this means that we dont often make our desires heard on the other hand we have very strong opinions on matters we understand and on a handful of positions we will go to the mats with anyone who disagrees because its not a matter of opinion its a provable fact if you follow basic economic theory like time value of money and oppurtunity costyou should also appreciate that the md crowd are some of the most cutthroat people in the game and when someone makes a statement that we know is wrongheaded we will swarm over them like pirahnnas on a mildly ed donkey so dont take it personally ive done the same to most of the other people who have posted this stance the mittanni decided to ignore the issue and instead post pictures that prove he is an attractive man seriously so you at least are doing better than he iswhile i dont expect every csm candidate to understand the complexities of the eve economy i do expect them to be willing to investigate complicated market issues the threadnaught i linked is probably the single strongest set of arguments for why the removal of t2 bpos is a terrible idea
 tehg  as youve pointed out not many have the fortitude or willingness to take part in market pvp it could be argued that the complexities mean that there are fewer opponents meaning an easier road for those that do take it until your liquidity r
im glad youre so in touch with the playerbase even more so than the players themselves are for a moment there i was convinced me and many many other players ive talked to really wanted incarna to be a success
as i saw almost only fanboys on the coments of the cq devblogs i began to though that i was alone thinking there were something wrong hereseems i was notthere will be no use to cq with the initial release except the 1st minutes of discoveries of the superb graphics and playing on the room with your shiny avatar finally movingbut whats worry me mostly here is that you seems to say that we will be forced to activate cq after the patch while i really dont want toi remember well when i anchored my 1st pos on high sec on abudan dont remember the typo UFFFD ice belt system 1 jump from rens allowing rd pos that one of his interest was to gain time with no undocking while miningi dont stay on jita when im doing business im almost always on a safe 1 jump from jita cause there way too much lag on jita and being docked on 44 is awfuli dont even want to think about what would happen if i have to be on captain quarter of jita 44 would be a nightmareim very interested by what we can gain with incarna but i dont want some shiny graphics but no gameplay and only lost time when dockingim really not on pvp but honstly i would prefer having pvp as only activity on incarna than nothingjust give us an option to not unpod or be on a safe place if forced to and i will happily go fight my comrades cause hell i dont risk to lost my shiny ship here and i suppose my vest and boots wont cost me that much to buy back after being killedif we have to go to qc when docking at least give us some minigames it will only ask you a few hours of coding and will change lots of thingsthe webbroswer on the big wall of our cq some cards games and why not a oldie arcade game lying somewhere its always better than nothing and moreover people wont have to alttab to do that if you add them ingame while if done well can give a lot of immersion
of course everyone wants incarna to be a success no one is hoping for failure if the outcry after the june csm minutes was not because ccp was taking so long and using so many resources on incarna and therefore ignoring the rest of eve what was it about or do you not think anything happened after the june minutes were publishedi really dont think what i said is controversial
i concur i hope kumi wins
bump
what kind of ships you want to bring in the game also what do you think of ducks
i would love to pass a vote for a warp cloaky interdictor or t3 battleships and frigates my duck policy speaks for itself you feed them grapes
how will you be able to form an effective coalition to fight the goons when the only replies you have managed to get are goons pity trolling you
as stated in the passt goons arent here to ruin the game they just want to ruin your gamea goon never did anything good for the community but only for goons well not completely true some goons have done something good for the community thats when they logged off and stopped playingi think the biggest difference between me and a goon is that i look at making the game as enjoyable as possible for me without ruining it for others and where i can even help them to enjoy the game morei think thats also what created my biggest personal clash i have with goons in generali am sure my feelings about goons have been well documented since the first of them popped up years ago and are no secret at allthat is in general also the reason why i dont see anything good comming froma goon in the csmwhy would they be actually be helpfull in there for the communityi feel this is just one of the many scams and tricks the goons want to play to ruin your game a lot of sheep will hop over that bridge because lets face it in all of history of mankind there were always sheep who jumped on a big mouth bandwagonsadly enough virtually all of those cases the sheep found out they actually walked into a lair of wolves ready to have them for dinnerow and look i am not hiding behind an alt to post my opinion why not because i am a fool but because i dont care if people disagree with me i dont need to use alts to defend my opinion because i feel weak in itthing is the goons never did anything ingame to warrent them being trustworthy in any case so why would i even consider trusting one or even more of them to represent the community as a whole and not just as a community of goons
preach on amen
some goon created evemon and released it to the community do you use it 
thank you for having an unreasonable hatred of me even though you and i have never met or interacted in this game all because of what i am
there is a difference between hating someone and disliking their playstyle and because of that not willing to trust any of themgoons have a well documented history of being untrustworthy you decided to join them and thus accepted you would become untrustworthy in the eyes of most of the communityso why would i be held responcible for your choice of directiona bad apple ruins a barrel of appels a lot of bad apples in a barrel only speed that up
this hatred must endwhat have we become
we shall overcome we shall overcomewe shall overcome somedayoh deep in my heart i do believewe shall overcome somedaythe lord will see us through the lord will see us throughthe lord will see us through somedayoh deep in my heart i do believewe shall overcome somedaywere on to victory were on to victorywere on to victory somedayoh deep in my heart i do believewere on to victory somedaywell walk hand in hand well walk hand in handwell walk hand in hand somedayoh deep in my heart i do believewell walk hand in hand somedaywe are not afraid we are not afraidwe are not afraid todayoh deep in my heart i do believewe are not afraid todaythe truth shall make us free the truth shall make us freethe truth shall make us free somedayoh deep in my heart i do believethe truth shall make us free somedaywe shall live in peace we shall live in peacewe shall live in peace somedayoh deep in my heart i do believewe shall live in peace someday
that is like a klansmen from the  or a al quaida member saying why hate on me i have never doen anything to you lol
your hatred is preventing you from being the person you want to be
posting in a goon alt thread
goons cant ruin any game they made the game better more people more advertisement saying that they havent achieved anything in game yet claim to have won evebeing part of nc doesnt mean you won eve it just means you hate pvpmittani tries his hardest to mimic previous goons that actually made goons something in fact ever since he got power goons have been failing if tcf didnt dissolve and merge into goons gs federation would just be another crappy renter alliance in the northdont mistaken goonswarm pre mittani era with goonswarm federation theres a huge difference
im fapping pretty hard to this here thread
dear opa cure was recently developed for butthurtness it involves quitting and giving all your stuff to me please sir rid yourself of the loathsome butthurt and heal thyself immediatelytldr shut up and give me your stuff then quitalso u mad
renaming an insane asylum or prison doesnt make it a social gathering
most of the goons answering to my posts have always finished by not english native or other sweetness like this so even if opposed to how they answered my posts i cant judge people i dont know the fact is that i dont have a very good opinion about themnow can i think they have nothing good in their opinions  i dont really know since for what i read atm nothing serious or structured has ben put on the table posts but i cant seriously say they cant or havent something positive to addanyway most of the answers right here has on many posts from them are close to insults or teen attitudes so just ignore them
are you for reali flew alongside goonstest in fountain and there were times when they were asking for people not to join the fleet so they could get a fight from it  you know that alliance that was the biggest and apparently richest in the game which has now crumpled under the pressure goons failing lolas for gsf being the big baddies  theyre just a bunch of people playing a game and having fun eve is designed as a pvp game and theyre getting into that if you dont like them because the hurt you or you disagree with their playstyle thats too badhowever consider what the game would be like if there werent any pirates scammers griefers or any other kind of bad guy without villians would there ever be any heroes
you realize the mittani was fairly influential in goonswarm before we conquered and subsequently lost delve right and was at one point ceo prior to this current tenure
confirming goonswarm was created in jan 2009 there was a reason i said premittani era and as for your influence remark goonswarm were weeks away from dying before they disbanded bob they lost their allies and were losing space faster than any other alliance that hardly makes mittani look good p
i really should have kept this thread going so nice to see the loyal minions put so much effort in brown nosing their masters with clichUFFFD memes orkasmi think i got the message across but once a sheep always a sheepoh and to all the fanatics that stopped posting it wouldnt by any chance have todo with everything i said being true would it a vote for mittani is a vote for changing the ui hahahahahahahahahahahaha
everybody please take a moment to appreciate delegados avatar
that inability to see the big picture is why you sir are a civilian and i am a bonafide general the key point here is that it is the leaders of numerous allied alliances who are looking to stitch up the csm this means that they can discuss and make long term plans for the advancement of their powerbloc without even causing the nda to break a sweat
1 from me 
1 for a man who will push ccp to make good on its backlog of broken promises and empty feature
hi everybody its me dr i have been busy in rl and i have noticed the more i focus on rl the more nc is easier to laugh at taking the game way too seriously to a point where they have to control all csm seats directly or indirectly just for some security thanks to dierdra vaal the vote match is on this isnt the first time the vote match has been used and i would love for you guys to see the one from last year the reason is simply to show who is sincere and who isnt for example last year vuk lau queen of nc was against number warfare and blobbing to the point where it was a priority however all through his terms he made sure numbers always had the upper handi was surprised mittani didnt do the same thing of being insincere yet has done the error of making it once again obvious what his agenda is and in short it is ccp hold ncs hand make us evade pvp make the broken mechanics stay supercaps for all by now though he has already gotten all his flying monkeys to vote for him so you can almost guarantee he will be in if he isnt then i guess his coalition thinks he is a joke much like rest of evei like the vote match it gives a clear idea of who is talking  and who has contradicted themselves nc should really read what they say alot of the stuff they are against on the vote match is what they said they will improve i did also notice trebor deahdoow have the same opinions of eve now that he did a year ago what people need to understand is the csm need to have a balance if everyone from nc are in eve will just become propve voting for trebot isnt a bad thing he has some really good ideas and having him as csm creates that much balance we need which will be missing if only nc are theremost my votes went to prom  peter power reasons for this is because there has to be a balance it would be nice to see someone focused on api and third party tools to get in as lets face it third party tools make your eve life easierdegrading people who are not 100 00 focused is really stupid people that focus on each area should work in a team whether they like it or not hisec is important and changes in highsec need to be made as well as lowsec and 00tldr if you voted for mittani then you really are an idiot according to the vote match his priorities are keeping everything the same buffing number warfare aka nc and the key areas he wishes to work on is changing the ui buffing macro mining and making it harder to claim space omfg at least vile rat put an effort into his prioritiesas for me rl is getting really fun and sadly i dont have enough time to play alternative reality online but good luck to all the people who want to help improve eve though i doubt in a year from now things will be different sadly by then there will be an estimated total of 10000 supercarriers and unless there is a change now 500 supercarriers will get pooped out monthly bearing in mind theres approx 4000 supercarriers in 00 as we speakedit oh noes i used a  instead of a  so glad i changed it before the internet police noticed
while i wont deny that other nc based representatives are running solely to protect their 00 interests some have clearly admitted so i want to confirm that i am not one of themwhile 00 and nc are a very important part of my eve life i do care about the whole universe of people from the high sec carebears to the 00 pvpers my campaign calls out specific areas of focus where i want to address low sec and reduce blob warfare i want to support the community and ccp in addressing concerns in all areas of the gamenow lets address the 500 lbs gorilla most 00 reps and many nc reps are here to stop the nerfing of jump bridges and titan bridgesthe joke of it is that so many people think axing titan bridges and jump bridges will prevent blobs and limit range they will not i dont care what anyone says with or without these things fleets will still move around and nc allies will still move to protect one another it will just be slowerso thats what you want right limit range think about it range is not the issue i have been in ops where we spent an hour getting to destination to help allies without jbs or titan bridges we will just lag out 3 times as many systems in the process but the large fleet will still get there you have not prevented anything but upset players which i might add will not stop them from going after good fightsso its about speed how is slowness a promoter of good pvp the aggressor would then have the ability to move in attack and leave with less fear of counter attack cause they cant get there fast enough you think thats good game mechanics maybe it is in some casesthe real point is we have to find ways through game mechanics to reduce the effectiveness of blob warfare find reasons to use varying ship types and split fleets up so there are multiple things that have to be done by multiple fleets large alliances and coalitions will always have the ability to send 1500 people into single system to blot out the sun with our drones no amount of mobility nerfing will stop that at the end of the day large groups like nc deklien coalition and droneland russians will project there forces if and as needed lets focus on reducing the need or effectiveness of blobs not nerf the ability
look it thinks its people
on the vote match what i found funny was nc saying yes to moving lvl 4s to low sec because there is no risk yet promoted blobbing and number warfare to the point where nc say this is our sandbox if we want to feel secure by naping everyone then so be iti laugh at people doing lvl 4s or even lvl 5s when it is so much easier and safer doing sanctums in the north most people have an alt in a nc alliance to rat test stella polaris wi and mostly harmless made this really easy and anyone can confirm how easy it is todo sanctums without any problemstldr nc you talk about no risk  reward yet your actions and way of playing is no different than lvl 4 mission runners risk  reward should go both ways there should be a risk involved in naping 50k people
dont generalize i did not support moving all level 4s to low sec nor do i promote blobbing mechanics i just put a whole post about that above yoursin fact i have clearly stated that the riskreward balance is low sec is a mess one of them has to be adjusted
can you really blame anyone for criticising nceverytime kim jong lau went up he lied out of his arse and contradicted everything he said however he only got in because of his statusnow we see a lets control and ruin eve campaign by nc now i know some nc people genuinely dont want to ruin eve but it doesnt help that you are in nc when theres a campaign set out and work in their favour againpeople may have different ideas of eve but it doesnt help when you are nc and saying i dont share ncs views kind of makes you sound like a hypocrite dont you thinkthats like working for ccp and saying i dont like ccp wtfif you want people to take you serious and believe you arent part of the problem you would have campaigned without being part of nc but lets face it you are more in favour of nc ruining eve just by being in their coalition
ok let me set some things straight herethat may be so and i def cant speak to past events as i was not part of them i do understand the overall point of what you are saying but im not here to debate the validity or integrity of other playersi am one of those people in fact you might be surprised to know that i am not an official candidate for nc in fact the main nc leadership does not support my position as a candidate i am actually only running as a representative of my alliance now that said my alliance is in the nc and i do have a stake in the ncs well being but im not going to tailor my campaign to only suit those interestsplease get it straight i never said i dont support the view of the nc what i said is i am not one of the people campaigning solely for 00 interests i didnt claim to have no 00 interests i do but only in the overall view of the game i am not here to make sure nc stays what it is or keep what it has in fact anything that brings us more pew pew is wonderful
anger will tear you down and tear apart your souljoin me in praising the lord and spreading our message of forgiveness
1010 that was so funny and original well done mateunironic
thiswhat youve done is summarised a whole group of candidate responses and done so with flagrant disregard for accuracy your alt posting is infact so far off the mark that it doesnt really seem to summarise any candidates position is this deliberate misdirection or just poor reasoningyou also seem to be exuding a highly toxic amount of butthurt please show me on the doll where the big bad nc touched you
kalle demos the worst poster on these forums hates me vote mittani
actually you can have the 1010 for being a clichUFFFD honestly what is it with widot and generic commentslets once again look at all the facts shall we1 mittani didnt even understand half of the points on the vote match check his comments he even comments and gets confused with basic questions and prefers to focus on ui changes over everything 2 for the past several years nc have branded themselves as one voice one opinion one thought can you blame everyone for thinking you guys are all the same after all you are who your best friends are3 you set out in a nc to take over csm campaign then complain when people criticise you if you had issues with this then you would have done what two shots did and left nc4 now that it is obvious why nc are getting branded as one big fcking fail how can you expect anyone to take their candidates serious when half of them are contradicting themselves and openly saying they only want csm seats so they dont have to pvp5 your thought may be different but lets face it you are in nc and nc only have one thought after all there will be no diplomacysaying you are not part of the problem yet holding the razor banner just makes you a hypocrite but by the looks of it anyway on vote match most people wont require alot of time to work out what ncs agendas is
so let me guess you got goonswarm recruitment scammed even though their recruitment process is detailed on their site as only recruiting from somethingawful
lol no i just dont think scammers should be in a position if influence with ccp such as the csms are and mittani is the head scammer of the worst scammers in eve
and its hilariously funny that idiots who were too ed to know that fell for it
these tears are beautiful
some of us are voting for mittins wi  test on the off chance something bad happens and the game becomes unplayablethus providing an exit window from the game without making it feel like quitting im not a goon testie or wi this isnt a wi thread anyhow but ive flown with them and they make local chat fun for us that are in corps and alliances that are prohibited from using local theres not really anything wrong with any of them save the occasional racist or sexist comment coming from the minority scamming is part of the game its not limited to goons accounts belonging to guys predating alliances scammed from time to time well before goons enteredorganized in eveand truthfully if youve been scammed by any of those three alliances youve probably been scammed by a nigerian prince or banker grow up
why would you want to be in such an alliance
voting for mittani or any goon candidate simply and explicitly means voting for a certain kind of playstylewhile its undoubtedly right to say that they know how the game works that doesnt mean they may want to improve the gaming experience for those gamers who dont enjoy hulkageddons scams griefing etc etcso it all simply boils down to what you like do do in eve what do you like being done to you and where do you want it to steer towardsanyway i believe mittani will be elected anyway given the huge number of goons who will vote for him so mittanis election is not the pointthe point is if you dont like that kind of playstyle you should simply focus on the candidates who look the more interested to develop the game in its general structure scope and options and simply avoid those who want to keep the loopholes in place and would even advocate a sharp reduction of contracts font size telling you that the player who isnt able to use a 10x magnifying glass when reading contracts deserves to be scammed
of all the scamms the recruitment scam is the worst people pay money to play eve they dont know much they joina corp get scammed leave some stay ofc but scamming recruits isnt the most obvious scam sure if you have played eve a while you should know the goons are scammers for recruiting but sonehow not all do why should the worst scammer of scammers who loses money for ccp and causes true grief be aloud a position of honor as csm and i dont think mittani will represent eve like most of the other candidates will i dont think any goon should get cam as well if they win what does that say about eve
this is the interneti dont even know youyouve probably never even seen me in gamei dont scam ive got about 8m isk across four accounts and 5 charactersi couldnt care less about ruining the game for you especially since ccp has done a good enough job of that alreadyyou despise me because i gave someone 10bux to feed his kid im the evil one hereyou discriminate against me because of what i amnow i know what my grandfather went through in the first half of the 20th century as a black man living in the south thanks for bringing bigotry into an online video game

supported
yes
yep let worm turn  these are the ships of choice for entry level pve  so lets make them them a pvp asset then these guys can make the transition into skirmish gangs
supporting buff on the af
how will that make them any more useful or complimentary to the interceptors youll still be way better off picking a cruiser just as you are nowother options exist that can do what you want give them ability to use warp disruption field generators by giving them a cpu bonus for fitting them give them ability to use gang links with a fitting bonus like that of the bcs give them limited ewar immunity through a charge consuming module make charges rather large to allow for 510m total before needing to restocketccruisers already fill the medium tankgank niche and since they will always be much cheaper thanks to insurance and lower base cost making afs into direct competitors to them is counter productive
yep boost makem more so
i would propose that perhaps a further damage reduction might mitigate any advantages gained from this change
idea while i was spamming fofs this morninghow about make fofs like a smart bombor any kind of timer based activated weaponshieldrepair then while your fof missile bay is loaded and launched it will begin autotargeting local nearby objects it cannot be scrambled and doenst count to max targets but this will atleast tell you who you are going to fire your fof at and perhaps the fof tracking time duration will make fofs not as potent as just pressing the buttonexampleenter plexspot nearby ships press fof bay buttonfof begins spinning green and tracking 1 or several of the enemy ships makes tracking soundthen when it finds a target the missile launchesthis adds a slight 20 sec delay to instant fof spam while fof finds soomething to home in ona variation of this could be you launch a fof missile instantaneous but it starts with a very low velocity like 50mps and as it homes in on a target it will increase speedc and change directions

agility is completely irrelevant as any halfdecent freighter pilot enters warp instantly if anything a warp speed bonus would be something that would actually help
please give the phantasm a bit of quality its not much better than a t1 cruiser 
i like pos mods especially disruptors affecting caps and supercaps i am indifferent to the rest of the changes
agreeing the csm should pushchallenge ccp on this issue one of the selling points of eve is the player driven economy with the massive influx of isk that bots can achieve their existence in game threatens the legitimacy of that economy since warfare including sov is directly linked to the economy this issue calls into question whether eve is really a competitive game or not if it continues to be dominated by botting i certainly will be playing it less and probably drop down to one sub ccp should take this issue seriously
apologies if this has been suggested before a cursory search on evesearch found nothingthere are many faction items available exclusively via the lp store that are seldom purchased there when they are it is typically to expand the collections of a handful of connoiseurs and faction loyalists these tend to be items that are only marginally useful to most pilots but which could potentially be very useful to those in certain specialist roles eg faction target paintersthe low availability of these items is primarily the result of the unduly large and inflexible amount of lp required to purchase them more mainstream items dominate the market as there is much higher demand for them sellers are assured of a greater rate of isk  lp redeemed and a speedier saleone possible way of righting this market failure would be to periodically increase the lp prices of the most popular items in each faction store eg as ranked by total lp spent on them per month and reduce the lp prices of the least popular this wouldnt need to be done more than once per month or however often insurance values are adjusted to match mineral pricesmission runners would still earn a premium on the popular items but i think wed see a bit more diversity in what people spent their lp on and eve will be the richer for it
i dont if they need to be continually reevaluated but the numbers definitely need to be looked at again i think changing the lp price of the popular items would only increase their isk price and not see any change to the compilation of the faction modules the under utilized modules are likely not popular because their numbers do not justify the cost so either these modules only need to lower in lp cost or the statistics increased
i always did think that there should be something else to do with the bodies except brag about them you cant even properly display themofftopic make an anchorable item in which you can display frozen corpses itd be like the heads on poles for space
no supporti like the way pod killing right now is only to grief and to resolve a personal issue once it becomes a source of income it will be less special
sounds like something for the station a trophy room to put all the corpses
you already can put it in your cargo and use it seriously yes maybe the primary skill biology and a second one needed to do this like learn speed x8 autopsy looks crazy but wy not
it introduces nothing meaningful into gameplay and will ruin implant market
it would not hurt the imp market if it was used to make imps that were different than the lp store ones dare i a say t3 imps

math doesnt indicate intelligence it just shows how much time someone is willing to waste on a subject that barely serves any purposeanyways this game has its dumbtards atleast the ratio is considerably smaller compared to world of daycarecraft some dwell in highsec some dwell everywhere else location has hardly anything to do with it
i like where this is goingbut trebor should not even get readonly access he could still come up with ideas that wayheap where the pubbies belong
supportedneeds more effective bonus and needs higher ehp dps is not an issue  they are eaf
eas are too fragile have bad capacitor and really bad lock range to make their workthey need either resist bonuses or signature radius bonus like interceptors for survivability and capacitorlock range balanced with their range need for using ewar effectively their speed and agility however seem relatively fine
i agree with most of this but i also feel that ewar friggs are the step to combat recons and as such there skill should be removed and skills returned also they should be added to the covert op skill
it seems to me that the repackaging system really only applies to ships containers and possov modulesis it really necessary to be able to repackage every moditemi propose that all mods which dont have a smaller repackaging size are automatically repackaged and stacked on action ex removal from ship slotwhere a mod is damaged and cant be repackaged its gets a new icon that shows its damagedmodify the rclick context menu to remove repackage and only allow repackage on single items or maybe only items of same type ex multiple containers ships possov itemsi tend to wait till i have a number of unpackaged items then ill select all and repackage all the server seems to process every item when i do this surely putting undue load on the servers if items were repackaged and restacked automatically it would spread the load and eliminate the number of false repackage requestsany viewsedit addressed possov and damaged mods
i highly doubt the false repackage requests actually ever occur as a means of spreading load its probally extremely negligable the code would do pretty much the same amount of work either way and possibly a little more due to the calls on repackage being automatic its not a situation in which load needs to be spread out either way the same amount of server work needs be done and rapidresponse isnt important as long as its done in a reasonable time
when i said select all i mean select all items like many 100s of them where i may only have 15 mods to repackage its a lot easier to select all and rclick repackage than finding each mod and ctrlclicking each oneeven if you have 1 mod to repackage and you select all and repackage it takes a lot longer to work than if selecting individual mods even if this is a low priority thread at the server end i still think its putting unnessessary load on the serversidechanging the way repackaging works would reduce the workload however small of people methods of doing things and reduce the amount of clickrclicks in the game
autorepackaging every single item every single time you change a fitting is not a good idea mission runners will change fittings between practically every single mission this would add up to a lot of extra database stuff for both repackaging and reassembling its also good the way it is because repackaged items would tend to get stacked and when applying stacks to a fitting it only applies one when you may need several fit you would also lose your drone groupings every time you swapped drones which would go a long way to making drone groupings uselessin short no it would make life more difficult for more people increase server load and provide zero real benefit to the gameedit considering to how rarely i actually repackage things i would assume that most players dont repackage modules until they are going into storage or being sold your select all  repackage issue is probably a nonissue compared to what you are proposing youre trying to fix something thats not broken
personally i dont want all my items repackaged automatically have you ever had to swap out a set of 8 guns especially fitting the new set when they are packaged unless im completely missing something hitting fit to active ship on a stack of packaged items only does it one at a time but on 8 unpackaged items it fits them all at the same time
you are missing something its the samewhat is the source of that information provide some evidence before you make claims about server loadin any case its as simple as making autorepackaging a client side option youre not required to use it
do you even play this game nuhuh isnt a valid point of argument magically make it so more database calls is no longer more isnt an intelligent suggestionfact 1 it would make it more of a hassle to quickly change fittings more database calls per item means worse performance and when fitting something in a stack only 1 gets fit not all meaning more up to 8x as many clicks clientsidefact 2 it will degrade serverside performance removing a fitting would do 3 database calls rather than 1 and fitting a new would be 2 database calls rather than 1this is why the eve database is managed by people who know how to do databases and not you
confirming this is not how mmos work a single point entry causes no more server load than any cycle sync check that happens constantly in the background in other words any mundane action or nonaction in gameplay in fact if packaged item do not have unique id its probably healthier for the server not sure how eve handles this specifically no offense but youre making a fool out of yourself

pointless proposal pun intended
in my first days of eve i was planning to become a glorious minerhoweversoon after couple of days i discovered that mining was just about using dumb exploits and bots or reprocessing drone loot from macro space how in the hell it does make sense to mine your frigging minerals and jettison them in space then get alt to haul it oh godwhat i would need is hidden asteroids i can find by exploring and scanning for minerals in the asteroids when id finally find a good one i could spend a little time mining it and relatively quickly under level 4 combat mission time get the minerals without absolute need for alts curse them

hi eliseits been argued in the serious discussion section on kugu and im sure on here as well though i dont troll this forum nearly as much that there needs to be a technetium rebalance what are your thoughts on thislovedental floss
for those unfamiliar with the issue some 18 months ago or so perhaps longer im terrible with dates ccp changed the materials required to build tech2 components moreover they rebalanced the component need for tech2 items what this did was remove the promethiumdysprosium bottleneck a problem which had begun to spiral out of control unfortunately all this did was create a new bottleneck in technetium which exists pretty much solely in the northern regions of eve so there are two alternatives to deal with the problem the one that people are drawn to is a completely redistribution all moon minerals while on a personal level id be tickled pink ultimately this will not solve the problem the bottleneck will still exist it would just have different benefactors the easiest and most pragmatic solution is to use a tool that already exists alchemy there is an excess of moon minerals that are simply not worth mining including r64s why not just tack onto alchemy to include r32s youll hit four birds with a single stone and the tool is already there so theres no added work involved now about the pos question i remember when poses first came out i was so excited when it onlined i excitedly mashed buttons and asked ok sweet so what can i dooh i see  i can sit in this little blip needless to say it was a bit of a let down but that topic is ancient by eve standards  the major complaint was that small entities couldnt fathom building an outpost the harsh truth of the matter is that outposts arent that big of an expense anymore so while a revamp of the pos system would be welcomed its not that huge of an issue for me hey id just be happy if the anchoring skill let me queue up pos mod anchoringonlining
lowsec to me has the most potential in eve to be awesome right now it has little going for it but there is promise with ccp adding some lowsec content with incursions as i mentioned earlier i dont want lowsec to be a tier version of 00 the reason lowsec isnt super popular is essentially because of the risk vs reward  simply put it is too risky and not nearly rewarding enough to rectify this obviously you can either decrease the risk increase the reward or find some sort of happy medium decreasing risk would be selling lowsec short  that is not the answer all that leaves is increasing reward the rewards dont have to be straight isk it could be something thats more intangible something unique there is no one single fix that can bring lowsec back but there are a few small things that together can make a big difference booster production exclusively in lowsec would be a start add in bonuses to alchemy after making alchemy relevant again commitment to boosting factional warfare more highquality level 4 agents better exploration et cetera on their own all these small changes wont do much  but together they snowball into uniquely rewarding part of the game and the final question about incarna from a gameplay level i dont see the big draw with wis at the end of the day im going to continue to play eve because of what drew me to the game the spaceship flying around looking pretty ba from a business level i understand why ccp is devoting so many resources it opens up a new director for their business and their game microtransactions for cool hats spaceplastic surgery will and probably somewhere down the line some wild minigames will net ccps business some mad bank this freight train is already on the tracks and there is no stopping it what i can do however is make sure the train doesnt go careening into a village perhaps i took the metaphor too far what i mean to say is that i will make sure that incarna will not adversely affect the core fundamentals of eve online  the game we all play i dont see this as a looming problem on the horizon but if it turns out to be i will be the first one yelling about it thanks for all the questions thus far keep em coming and dont forget that voting closes march 22
for what its worth the eve tribune thinks youd make a great csm delegate
thanks for the intelligent responses excellent points and i agree with your views 1 vote
hehehe how did you guessto each their own i like to do my campaigning up close and personal and thanks mate i hope theres enough sensible people to get the right people in 
k fine lets ignore your statement about t2 bpos for the moment lets look at your platform1 the csm makes unrealistic promises to get electedthis is a nobrained dude of course they do anyone running for a political office makes unrealistic promises including yourself the difference is that the unrealistic promises they make involve design changes that are supported by their developer stakeholder status your unrealistic promise if there is one ill get to that latter involves a much larger change in the very nature of the csm which ccp may not actually have any obligation or interest in listening to 2 now while i just argued that you are making large promises that you have no ability to back im going to do a 180 and say that you actually are campaigning on an empty platform your basic campaign comes down to there is clearly a problem im going to fix it because im a proven cutthroat dude this is a completely empty statement 3 you say your ability to redirect the csm is proven through your ability to politic now honestly i dont know you irl and you very well may have that bu there is no evidence of that any of us could possibly see the leadership and politickig you have shown in eve is meaningless for a task like what you are mentioning part of this is because while leading in eve does take talent it also takes the kind of skewed priorities and egomania that make for terrible collaborative leaders in the real world this isnt just targeted at you but anyone who claims that anyone who can devote 40 hours of their life to leading people in a computer game are not the kind of people i would ever want sitting in a board room negotiating a deal that involves real issues becausethat person has already shown that real issues come second to gamesits a bit antiintellectual3 what this all boils down to for me is that you are arguing against the excessive politicking and lack of results from the csm which strikes me as a somewhat unfounded statement see stakeholder status but this picture you are showing of the problem and the solution is painted by the most grandiose politic double speak i have seen in quite a whilethe csm shouldnt bring player problems to ccp it should bring ccp to the playershow you get a pass on criticising empty promises and flowery politicking while writig the sappiest politicking campaign of any of the candidates is beyond me the only explanation i have for it is that you are riding the cult of personality you to be fair have rightfully earned the entire spiel quote about how the csm does all its business on their private forums and at the summit instead of publicly and spin that as some insidious plot is hilarious of course thats where they do their work i meani dont get that in the slightest how could you have a usefull conversation with devs about a potential feature in public without either violating nda as for transparency the recent csm was pretty quality about releasing good minutes and informing the players about what they canbut you turn on the loose change music and make them all a pack of evil liarsironically you getting elected may only prove your campaign stance that the csm is filled with double speak politicians who promise the world that they cant deliver and in the end bring nothing to the table
the csm has proved 5 times to be a toothless paper tiger that sell out for a free holiday in iceland from what i can see the mittani is simply saying lets change this as a result he is standing coincidentally or perhaps because of this the number of players voting in the csm elections is dramatically higher for that reason im voting for the mittani
youre attributing a higher voter turnout because one person is running laughslet the mittaniwashingcontinue there moderated eyeroll
please present your assertion for the reason there is a higher vote turnout this year i am all ears
man this was almost off the first page not cool
mittens a selfish requestcan you bring up the legion and how much it sucks once you get to sulphurville it needs a 7th turret this probably wont work but heck doesnt hurt to try
you have my votesif trebor wins the chair im going to have to lifequit
i went out drinking last night and only now around 6pm have recovered from the hangover welpsure and no doubt ill also bang the drum  again  about a second midslot on the retribution no doubt i will be ignored because lol amateurgamedesignersoncsm i love votes votes make me happy mmmm votes
one of my main concerns with all the claims csm candidates make about what they feel needs rebalancing is they never really elaborate on how they imagine it being fixed sure we can say this or that is broken and we want some utopian new eden but as far as quantifying the changes they are proposingi hear you say you want to break up the power blocks by changing 00 logistics but i cannot imagine how you could do that without hurting the smaller ones even more large coalitions have an easier time with selfsufficiency i cant even fathom a way to accomplish these problems and frankly i have not heard any here either
i do not necessarily want to make logistics more difficult what i do like to see happening is several tweaks to the way things work in general in 00 i dont claim to know the perfect means to do so in every case but i feel that if its done well in cooperation with the players it can turn out really niceexamples if you make mining and industry in 00 easier with more production slots dont know much about mining but im sure there are plenty of ways to improve that lol not as much stuff will have to be ferried in from empire this reduces the dependency on supply lines and makes 00 more self sufficient an increase in the number of entry systems would make it easier to get in and out and open up 00 to more casual visitors and reduces the ability to pretty much lock down a region for regular traffic by permacamping a small number of entry systems by making it more difficultexpensive to control many systems with just one corp or alliance you force them to concentrate on where they really want to be where the nice resources etc arethese among other changes large and small would stimulate the existence of multiple smaller entities that battle over shorter distances and smaller areas than today the exact ways and means however will need to be discussed at length and none of this is final or unalterable i do however feel strongly that a change in the current 00 that has been moving towards a more uniform stale and generally boring state ever since around 06 would be a huge improvement to eve more small scale wars more opportunities for small groups of players and less of the current state of powerblock vs powerblock
thank you for your support hope so too thanks for your continued support despite my annoying blog posts
endorsed good luck
thank you for your support diomedes calypso made a good point in another thread so i want to echo my response in hereyeah youve hit on why i ultimately decided not to promote the vote match tool on my blog it was and is a great idea in theory but the questions really should have been more clear cut and less loadedthey were great interview questions but poor poll questions as a result it didnt surprise me to learn that most people didnt get more than a 6065 match with any candidate and then got a 6065 match with a lot of themlooking over my own answers and how other candidates answered i realized i could have selected the exact opposite position on many of the questions and not have to change a single word on the comments i postedfor anyone who matched with me at 60 or more if youre thinking about voting for me but an issue or two is making you hesitate send me an evemail or post in my jita park thread with your concerns and ill be happy to talk with you about themi want to commend diedra vaal on what was a great great idea but the execution was ultimately flawed hopefully the tool will be a little cleaner next year
well to be fair ccp does not have a lot else to go on and also people active on the forums tend to be the most engaged and bestinformed players  canaries in the coal mine if you willsure some people overreacted to 18months but a lot more expressed significant concerns over the allocation of resources ccp had decided upon and the apparent disconnect with the playerbaseand to ccps credit they did listen to the players the level of engagement with the csm rose and some resources were reallocatedthe result was that the october meeting and the december summit were much more pleasant and productive for everyone sure we raised significant concerns with ccp about microtransactions and incarna for example but there were no are you kidding me moments like in junewith respect to ccp and the forums ccp does pay more attention to them than you might think some devs are afraid to engage for fear of being beaten up but i think this is a mistake constructive personal engagement with the players has generated some significant benefitsfor example last year ccp karkur approached the csm about her skunkworks project to improve the contextual menus we gave her some feedback but i and other csms urged her to engage with the players directly she did so and the resulting thread was very helpful and made the end result better not to mention it got her a coveted techii titanium assault sporkand right now ccp sreegs seems to be following in her footsteps in a thread on botsi think this kind of engagement is just flatout good business it improves the game and it builds connections between the players and the devs  both of which directly impact the bottomline through improved retentionif i were ccp hellmar i would award significant prizes to the devs who demonstrate the best engagement with the players both about game issues and socially i think the returnoninvestment is compelling
the evidence does not support that ccp has the faintest idea what that means
it sounds like this is precisely the kind of attention youve been trying to draw with the spork awards totally agree
all that comes into my head after reading this is you unctuous sycophant
i have to admit that jonathan is one of my more enthusiastic supporters and will probably be disappointed to learn that i cannot walk on water unless it is frozen but his point is well takenthe sporks while entirely silly are a token of appreciation for hard work that has helped the players and the csm intended to draw attention that effort and encourage more of itif you support the csm and the devs that engage with the csm then you can join in the fun by bringing a spork to fanfest and displaying it ill bring some extras plastic not titanium to give out
cheap gitt
in order to get a titanium spork just like the devs you must perform a meritorious service that benefits the players of evei always keep a few on my person so if you manage to do so in my presence at fanfest you might just get one on the spot
i have a shiney presence
upon reflection that alone will not be sufficient
the women in my corporation will not agree with youchecks wallet yup they wont agree with you
i am impressed with your work on csm5 endorsed and good luck
ccp xhagen and ccp diagoras have spent a lot of time making sure every csm item in the backlog is tagged as being a csm item which increases their visibility teams now know that if they pick up a certain item because its csm theyll get the additional bonus of some hugs and the potential for free beer at fanfestnot a big thing but every little bit helpswhile there have been discussions about putting resources into extra csm tools i would prefer if at all possible that those resources be put into work that can benefit the entire playerbase not just 15 people awesome though we all are one possible avenue is forumbased tools that can be used for csm tasks but are also adaptable for use by everyone else  as anyone who has seen my stomach will tell you i personally love to have my cake and eat it toocsmnews was intended to be a lowvolume mailing list for important announcements so as the manager i was reticent to put too much through it  perhaps too reticent it is worth considering making it a little bit noisier so i have started an internal discussion about the feasibility of doing a weekly status update summarizing what issues the csm is currently working on nda permittingfinally with regard to your question about what i might do if i was elected chairman i can neither confirm nor deny the confirmation or denial of any potential plans i may or may not have to even consider the possibility of entertaining any thoughts in that regard whatsoeveri trust this makes my position perfectly clear
youve got my vote
new blog update posted my eve mail has been flooded the last few days and im struggling to reply and keep up with as much of that as i can while following various forums as well thank you to everyone so far for your support with this field of candidates i am going to need every vote
i have to admit at being very impress with the q and a you did for eve uni so much so that you have my 3 votesgood luck
iterations 00 needs some serious love for small to medium gangs there seems to be just nobody around except botters or huge blobs there isnt much in between
i noticed that you strongly support moving all l4s to lowsec could you explain why you feel this is a good idea
fixing old problems is something that should not be forgotten also i liked those few ideas i read about exploring one time use folding space modules local that can be changed by sovereignty holderand you got inside look on things on top of that and managed to show your case in such way that old employer cant tell you to be quieti dont like microtransactions at all but i understand your view and point on allowing it on vanity items keep it only on those and its good cant win on everything spaceships expansions indeedyoull get my votes
if l4 missions were moved to low sec if i wanted to do them i would just get in a t3 ship have it setup so cant be probed downit looks to me you think there too profitable so you want them moved to low sec so if i want to goto low sec to kill people im going to have to get back in my t3 ship and stay in low sec because l3 missions will take ages to get sec status backupthis may push the price down of the best loot that drops in the 00 plexes because the people that use to buy it for doing l4 missions in high sec i doubt are going to want to use it in low sec
draco is on the slate of candidates that the tribune has endorsed for the csm for those who are curious
i have it on good authority that mr t laurence fishboune milla jovovich and brian blessed all support this product andor service
last year we conducted interviews with what seemed like roughly eight or nine billion candidates running for the csm i cant imagine that many people read them i know that most of our staff didnt were still open to anybody who wants to run an interview but this year were not aggressively seeking them out indeed last year the one candidate that we spoke strongly against turned out to be a complete embarrassment when she did get elected and finally ended up being removed for an nda violation were still having fun with the i told you so bit over thatin any case after careful study and after long conversations with several of the csm candidates we have decided to endorse a slate for this years electionhappy voting
huge thanks for supporting the csm with your voteim hoping that a lot of the folks that i would best represent arent active forum folks i definitely hope i get to be the person to fill the hole that seems to exist in supporting the miners and pve types of evebomberlocks you rock for voting for someoneissler dainze  voice of reason csm candidate
id vote for that
hii like your presentation and i have voted for you because i think you would make a serious and welcome addition to the csm being another helping hand between players and ccpi do ask you though for some reflections on the followingas a roleplayer im disturbed by the lack of physical realism this universe has to offer the real universe is a dynamic place in which moons orbit planets orbiting stars that vaporize any spaceship coming too close i miss bad spaceweather induced by the local stars making it hard to navigate dont wanna see the nebulea as we saw them in the early 60 red plasma planets in young solar systems with lots of astroids blue plasma in nebulous systems with lots of gas and ice and  by jove  ice astroids always farest away from the starofcourse gameplay and the war on lag are of utter importance but since none of the csm candidates have mentioned these do you think physical realism will get a place on your agenda make love not warand fly safe while doing it
hanging out in nourvukaiken this morning come on by and say hibutch
i realize i didnt do the drawing yesterday so i will do a large drawing tonight expect a bunch of winners
from your campaign blog players to be forced into wardecable npc corps after their first monthwhy do you feel players staying in npc corps is a problem
you come out as one of my highest matches on vote match but one of the areas where we disagree is that you feel the war dec system needs completely overhauled  whats wrong with it as it stands
i endorse this candidate
the idea is to fix near riskless gameplay characters immune to wardecs this just an idea to fix that issue it also has an added bonus of encouraging group play the only risk they are vulnerable to is suicide ganking which is not substantial enough i do not want to force pvp on players but there should not be a game mechanic that over protects them from itlike all my ideas if i get a lot people that dislike the idea i will definitely drop it from my campaign or even change my opinion on the matteri feel that there is too much advantage with the aggressor i also think adding a mechanic where win conditions can be set optionally would be awesome as well it is currently an imbalanced mechanic in favor of the the aggressor that is now just used primarily to griefi am always open to thoughts
i fail to see your point i doubt there is any candidate in favor of rmtbesides you should post this kind of things with ms pacman not all the people know that shes your alt 
in the platform it has been declared that ms pacman is an alt of extreme and also explained why
today ms pacman will be interviewed by eve uni approx 1900 hrs evetime and will also be one of the four guests at debate 4 of lostineve
i thank eve uni for their time you are a great group of peoplei enjoyed being with you taking and answering your questions
chribba killers for csm
imigo i spent a good amount of time living in 00 but one of the things i missed out there was missions i like the fact that in high sec if you had a bit of time to kill or wanted to raise standings there was a mechanic for doing that what i would like to see in 00 is the introduction of a method for raising standings whether it is in the form of bounty tags being redeemable for standings with various factions or the implementation of mission npcs in stations with all the alliances out there that have stations and also have good standings with different npc corps it just seems odd story wise that those factions would not send emissaries to extend the reach of their influencewhat would you lobby for as a method for raising standings while living in 00
whats your position onpos mechanics ie how very little works rightthe flogging the dead horse thread has lots of supportand has been ignored by ccpi think people who run for the csmshould keep there alliancecorp roles seperate from their csm rolesthe csm should not be a place for metagamingor ego boosting
in what way do you think pos are broken
the number of roles needed to enable jobs to be donepublic use is an option but it dosent workalliance use isnt as easy as it could be
i miss you haldont let it go to your head nowyou had me at racisti too will cast my vote for this dude
i dont want to derail mikes thread but my previous issue aside i actually do support hos campaign so ill respond simply to bump his threadyour first comment is contradictory market is difficult to make money in which drives down competition which males it easy to make money in the reality is that it is difficult to male money in the market bit that doesnt mean there isnt competition the reason for this is that its the single highest potential income source in eve there really is no limit to your earnings except for your abilititywhich brings me to the point about bots im not convinced bots are as significant an issue in the market place as some people think consider the 01 concept which lead to the eve001 tool i can say that i only barely thought about picking this up because real money making on the eve markets doesnt have to involve updating all of your orders 247 simply 01ing up to some limit is a really good way to get manipulated and see your profits cut apartthats why i question how a bot could work without getting easily manipulated the worst thing about a bot is that it will keep doing stupid stuff if its told to which means it could be manipulated into bankrupting someone overnight the botter could limit this risk by maintaining a limited wallet balance but that limits the effectiveness of the botalso mike kind of wanted to apologize for the tone i took earlier just took a hellish midterm that i had been studying for and took the wrong path with how i stated this i do hope that if you are elected and this topic comes up you will take another look at it and reverse you position
see this is one of the differences in style you should be paying attention to yes i may disagree with you about a subject but i do not depend on my cult of personality to drive through it i go and i read the thread you referenced i listen to your opinion    this is what you want    someone who will listen is willing to learn about the things he doesnt know and maybe even be willing to change his or her mind if the arguments are validthe vote matching is a great concept but more than that you should not just look for a representative who agrees with you on 20 odd selected topics you want someone who will listen to you when you disagree on some as yet unnamed topic in the future maybe they still will disagree after they listen to you but you will know you had a chance to put your ideas out there and not get a picture of your candidate in returnthat is why i think i should stuill be considered a posibility for your vote even if you do think my original answer was just plain wrongm
no worries i appreciate being asked questions    and the bumps as to midterms i remember those    no offense was taken i actually read it as you were doing serious consideration of a topic and gave me a chance to explain rather than just reading the vote match comment and writing me off as an idiotm
your comment on the cult of personality made me smile quite a bit because that is something i see as a huge problem with the csm and to be honest politics in general the sad fact is that the ability of the cult of personality to get someone elected is inversely proportional to how useful they will actually be in a collaborative groupa cop cult of personality will build on someone because they are charismatic dogmatic strong andor entertaining these arent inherently negative attributes however for many people being a recipient of a cop will lead to arrogance that is where the problem comes from copers mistake adulation for moral authority celebrities commenting on politics irl is a good example of this but it can be seen anywhere heavily published phds often have problems working together for the same reasonultimately the 2 most important qualities for a leader in a collaborative setting arehumuility  the ability to accept that you may be wrong which leads to better listening and independant researchanda self sufficient ego  anyone who has read raynd understands the difference betweenarrogance and ego ego is important because to be a decision maker you have to be able to male your final decision indendantly of others views at the end of the day that may seem contradictory but its not humility allows for listening ego allows you to make the decision you think is right and not live and act for others a leader must have ego a cult of personality is not built on either of these they gain a feeling of self worth and a belief in their skills through the eyes of others which ends up keeping them from actually ever learning anything or realizing that they dont know what they are talking aboutthe main reason that term made me smile is because i just used that exact phrase to describe the mittanis authority
i suppose ill give you my last two votes after all there are certain points we disagree on but short of running for csm myself that applies to any candidate heres my hope that csm doesnt ruin the game that a council of players does not become so corrupted that they place their voice first over the interests of individual playersim fairly certain that csm5 was fairly seeded with corruption fairly certain corruption has progressively increased since the csm was initiated and made available to the player base i agree with community involvement and would like to see more but the csm delegates are becoming increasingly more likely to press their own interests some or most even think they know better how to improve the game for all than those they representa csm delegate needs to recognize that his opinion is only a drop in the bucket that he or she is only one member among many of the total playerbase for which he represents they need to recognize that the assembly hall posters represent only the opinions of a few more individuals than make up the csmgames get ruined by player input and suggestions ive seen this happen a dozen times or more and watched the games topple and die what started as something good soon saw its downfall in playerbase input there will always be players who think or pretend they know while they push forth ideas to satisfy their own egos or make the game easier for them old players from beta or shortly after who want to make themselves more powerful by reducing the ability for new players to gain power there is almost always a motive when a player volunteers his time and effort they are not doing something for nothing in most cases but instead applying themselves to strengthen their personal position within the game potentially to make themselves a profit outside of the game people are demons monsters who have no interests besides themselves this is true in almost every instance
trolling is the only thing a goon knows how could i possibly try to interfere with that
wow that was almost edgy wrong but at least almost edgy
historic moment goons are now in a position in which they dont have any good will lefttheir current leader has effectively completly annihilated any sympathy left with his natural unlikabilitygoons a well meant pro tip your leader is a confused nerd with aspirations of grandeur he is as im posting poking his little  at your very recieving s get rid of him
nawgoons are great theyre like this neat alien disease injected into eve for the most part they dont even recruit members from within eve they strive not only to play the game as it is but to change the game to give advantage to their play style griefing scamming and breaking as much stuff as they can if they can skew the nerfs and boosts of ships and weapons to better suit their style so much the bettergoons are also the only gaming group im aware of that have their own real life legal defense fund they need it people for some strange reason sue them go figure guess theres no sense of humor with some peoplesince they were formed before and after they entered eve in every endeavor inside and outside eve goons have one primary driving motto if it can be broken it should be broken this simple motto drives everything they dothey say were not out to break the game whatever game that may be this is true they are not out to break a game theyre just out to break the way anyone else plays itif all that sounds appealing to you then you should vote for mittensor perhaps some other goonwindjammerps i write this with the full expectation that the mittani will be on the next csm he should be able to get enough votes from his own corporation to ensure that it wont be the first time a big mouth goon with a large image of himself got up on his soap box inside the csm and it wont be the last however this one just may cause ccp staffers to be hospitalized due to splitting a gut from laughter
that is quite interesting that you would say that goons are ofc indeed great their guidance of how one should experience online entertainment and ofc judgement when one does not fall between the paramaters of online gaming bounderies of experience have indeed been shaping educational and indeed plainly helpfull to progress our species
i support the goons ruining killer gandrys game
if the nc control the csm then the majority of this game eve may as well just quit nowccp already devotes enough resources to 00 time to focus on empire space for a change
facts huh looks like you need to look up the definition of fact so you can distinguish them from rumour speculation marketing and opinion let me demonstrate1 you seem of the opinion that mittani is confused opinion is not fact2 you seem of the opinion that nc has one voice one opinion one thought i can tell you from my perspective that i have seen considerable evidence to the contrary3 people have speculated that the fact there is a large number of nc candidates means that the nc is trying to take over the csm there are however plenty of other perfectly reasonable explanations for this such as the other fact that there are a lot of nc members speculation is not fact4 branding a group a one big fcking fail is marketing also which half are openly saying they want to be on csm to avoid pvp please make a list with quotes rather than starting a rumour rumour is not fact but heres a fact one of the issues im standing for is more opportunities for pvp5 that the nc only has one thought and that is there will be no diplomacy is something you pulled out of your ass something you pull out of your ass is not facton that note im calling you out as being full of excrement ill be happy to continue this discourse if you have some actual facts that are relevant to the csm discussion to discuss
the degree of inchoate hate directed at the nc by people who have a fingernails grip on reality is impressive and it definitely shows that whatever were doing if it drives some people this nuts were doing it right i wish that a lot of nc candidates had run in years past we might have caused someone to start throwing grenades into their local post office or something
its cool when people call me angry and mad considering how entertaining this is for me watching you all get emo whats cooler is finn calling anyone mad its like someone rolling around in horse  then jumping up and down and calling everyone  facefinn at the risk of being generic like every widot  goon  test member stop posting now
my question is with the nc completely dominating the list of rmt that was leaked to evenews24com and spreading like wildfire across all gaming websites what steps is nc taking to get ride of the rmters riddled all through their coalitiondoes any leaders within the nc have any statements about this so voters dont think by voting for a nc candidate im voting for someone who harbors rmters
i think there are a few miss conceptionsfirst i am a 00 resident and also member of the ncsecond not every nc member votes for a nc representative or atleast not with all accountsthird finnnotagain zero is as relevant as the last part of his name statesthe empire community and alliances outside the nc can blame themselves more than the nc if the nc gets a more prominent representation in the csmwhy blame the nc for getting more people to vote isnt the real issue that empire and the other alliance blocks just dont care a lot less who is in the csm and thus generating a lot less votesthe reason the nc works is because the alliances in it realise that being a solo alliance or only a small block alliance wont help you survivexdeathx ra wn etc work like a team too where certain intrests are at stakeit made the big fubar to allienate most alliances in the game which at a certain point made them stand virtually solo the end result is well knownthis doesnt mean the nc will live forever nothing remains everything changes but you shouldnt be mad about the fact some people work together you should more focus on why others cant
i have 4 votes to give youre getting the lot of them i appreciate people that like balance
the way people act behind closed doors is usually a reliable indicator of their personal attitudes and personality how enlightening that you defend your exposed behavior by suggesting that using such language to viciously insult people is done only because the goon audience is more likely to accept the message that way it also suggests you will say whatever you think you need to say to any audience including all other voters to gain acceptance for your message whether or not your message is what you actually mean
this is basic communication you frame your message for the audience who is to receive it it doesnt mean that the message changes fundamentally or that the person is presenting themselves dishonestly for that to be true youd need to demonstrate that my opinions and positions expressed in different places are incompatible with each other which you cant so you are resorting to rather dull fauxoutrage in lieu of making an honest argumentin any case i came here to post that ive just wrapped up an interview with lost in eve and it should be available on their site by early next week
complaining about getting scammed in eve is like complaining about getting shot in call of duty
my name is kell tarhun and i am proud to announce i will not vote for any csm candidatereason why not i see no point in giving rights to start support action on my name when i personally got no influence or interest in it when i am interested in something i give my own opinion in proper place for example forum or reporting somehow to proper placelimiting my own voice to voice to some dude who thinks he might be better representing myself just beacuase 1000 voted for him i find stupidif suicaidal self exploding leader of 2000 votes is more important than santa or even better example how about representing men of top 1000 models in their relations with those 1000 models while their free time who wouldnt like to does it make sense for those models nope i bet that lucky guy would die happymaking structures that gives rights to being heard better as ccp suggest makes me personally sick for me it is just aproving someone is more important than you avarage eve player if i do not accept sth i can just quit and do not pay my share to eve online community i feel personally offended by idea of csm csm candidates got no rights to implement anything  they can just talk i do not thing that eve players are not capable of writing or talking  even with mistaces as me my language is understandable those representants are minority of eve online this game got way more players than couple of csm candidates voted by playersi u think that president or politican of your own country represent your interests in any way i think you might be naivewhat is more they will get propably some votes however with same pleasure i can vote for pizza lasagne that food could represent me in pretty same way as csm candidates i belive every players should be represented by himselfdo you feel better when someone else talking about some stuff in your name even if in many cases he might be right there are lots of situation when u will disagree with his opinion but you voted for him it means damage was done and you can nothing he will represent your ideas even if he get mentaly sick while thatto csm candidatesi personally not attend to harm your feelings or argue with your ideas or that you want to sell your soul to ccps game you are interested in making real ideas in way you find interesting you put lots of effort to to get support in game mechanic ccp organised propably less or more succesfull however in this game i belive every player is important so making you more important than guy who just play this game for fun and ocasionally write his opinion i find very very wrongthats why i am not going to support any of younot because you are right or wrong i find your ideas statement as important as any other eve online player if game designers are interest on ideas of minority of eve who support voting or read forum in time of elections thats a way of organising community in my opinion i belive your will be representants of minoritywish you best in your choices
im running because there should be atleast one good looking avatar on the csm
it would be nice if this were possible but to listen to every damn player would logistically be the full time job for a group not one community manager question is what group would be willing to listen to the idea of the huge population to distill those ideas and find the gems amongst the gravel if there was such a group how would you choose them let ccp put their own people with preconceived ideas no waitwhat if the players chose amongst themselves to form this groupthat is what this election ism

you can scratch that one from your list as at the end of csm2 csm and ccp agreed on such a procedure in our case pattern clark removed himself under csm pressure from council and i replaced himhe got removed as he never attended to meetings he just was in csm2 for the free trip to icelandafter this issue there is a procedure possible to remove a csm from council

whos paid for by big business rmters and which ones are sponsored by religious freaks amarians like in real life american politicsalso whos giving out plexs to pay for votesreal questions though which seem to be completely ignored1 whos for cleaning up the forums banning the constant stupid spam topics and totally special posts proper racist sexist obcene religious mumbo jumbo as this has risen massively in the last year or so2 whos against rmt and macrobotting rattersminers etc3 whos for balanced game play both pvp and pve4 whos not edly biased when it comes to null sec and hold stupid views regarding ccps impartiality eg whos a it haterlast and no means least5 if a goon or test alliance candidate is chosen are they going to undergo psychiatric personality screening before being flown to iceland i wouldnt want any damage done to such a lovely country
im canadian
im belgian but as far as your questions go i have no link whatsoever to rmt been consistently bashing the existence of them and nonrmting macros im for a balanced gameplay for both pve and pvp im not biased when it comes to nullsec or anything really if it ruins my game but is better for the game as a whole ill support it
hello there as you may have read im french and ingame unaffiliated to any powerbloc not 00 ones at leastwhile i agree that not all seats should be taken by goons or their associates and in rl not all representatives should come from the same country i think youre going a bit far isnt the part about american politics being sponsored by big businesses and religious freaks a bit uncalled for however i understand your concern for what its worth 1 and 2 i very much am if you had word of my recent posts about rmt regarding the info leak of iskbank and my general opinion about this forums i vouch for severity against both those problems as they prevent us for enjoying the game to its fullest3 i am every aspect of the game from miners to pirates from space nuns to scammers is important to have a complete and coherent universe4 i feel that ccp is impartial or can be made so easily because if the csm doesnt trust ccp then nothing can be achieved 00 needs balancing as the rest of the game does5 i must admit i loled  that said im sure the goons will get at least a csm representative if only due to their sheer numbers  which when you look at it that way seems only right im quite sure mittens doesnt needs any more votes to be elected already and im looking forward the opportunity to seat at the same meeting than him it will surely be interesting to say the least
ya see nobody cares about the important issues that face eve so why should any of you get my vote when not one of you took the time to answer my question on a topic that the player base has been after for a few years
weve put that issue to ccp during csm 5 but i wouldnt qualify any weapon system as useless just not as useful as they could be thats a significant difference however we requested ccp does take a look at the hybrid guns and come back to us with a sensible tangible proposal to make them more usefulso during csm 6 the elected members among which i hope to be will most likely check what solution ccp has in answer to our requestwe havent ignored you during csm 5 be assured of that this is in the csm 5 meeting minutes by the waycheers
i did express my opinion once about name changing it is here
basically i vote for a name change like 910just i have different opinion
everyone  read and support read and support this idea has to get more attention
am i correct in assuming the sp thats in these deleted skills would not count towards the characters total sp if so that would make my 900k cyno alts even more versatile once i remove the unneeded skillsyou might also want to suggest that if a skill is a prereq of a skill thats in your char sheet it cant be deleted until the offending skill is deleted not just queued for deletion

shameless bump where are the freakin trolls
its really simple actually fof missiles should target aggressors only with no need for removing lcos or the like however the primary issue is how your ships computer tells the fof what is an aggressor with ewar on you what is the system that deals with that obviously there is a target recognition system as all aggressors are still shown on the hud targeting or no problem solved no friendlies no neutrals and certainly no misc structures gates for example
signed dram is nice but it chases away all the other frigs except for slicers
supported would be nice to go out in my taranis again and find something that wasnt a dramiel
dramiels are only good for noobs and cowards
and yet dramiels still die by the truck load to skilled pilotsdidnt malcanos just kill another dramiel with a badger this last weekanyway not supported they are not that hard to kill step 1 get neuts step 2  step 3 dead dramielseriously just get your curse pilots onto the field to primary and solo the dramiels neuts will stop their mwd and ab fun tracking disruptors will nullify their guns and you cant outrun a full wave of warrior iis
i supportthis for as long long as the nerf to dramiel does not denature it dramiels should remain dramiels just wash it down enough so its got something to fear beside its own pilot stoopidity
you are literally edthe point is not that they are killable its not hard to kill a frigate with something biggerthe point is that within their own class they are unbalanced which is why every scrub who has trained minmatar frig i and gallente frig i flies them the fact that a good pilot in a less impressive ship can kill a bad pilot in a dramiel does not make them balanced
supported on the condition that a rookie ship be requestable at any time from the stations insurance officejust in case you usually dont need one but find yourself in the rare situation when you do need one

id love to know what youre talking about warp instantly you say youve discovered something that has escaped the attention of everyone else id really like to be able to enter warp instantly after jumping through a gate if this can be used with other ships itll have a major impact in evei support the ops proposal the sub warp speed bonus is a legacy from the days before warp to zero though it still has some small use for moving the great ships when they fall short by a km or two when jumping to a station agility would be a much more important bonus for a freighter these daysregardswindjammer
do wantalso while youre at it give freighters a low slot to put a dcu ii in
good idea
makes perfect sense
1 angel ships are taking over the scene and you see nothing else nerf the angels a bit too
if this was implemented while leaving seiged dreads immune to pos ewar this would not only nerf scs but make the dread relevant again1

hi fellas the whole neutral repping thing needs to get nerfed a bit if someones going to sit outside rens station in their logistics and repair whoevers going down hardest i think these neutrals need to share the risk of the warriorstwo options are a 60 second aggression timer that prevents neutral reppers from docking or jumping gates 30 days of kill rights awarded to the party who lost due to neutral reppersim more partial to the aggression timer after a squad of 4 neutral logistics repped my opponent i lost my drake my corp mates decided to spring a trap well the next guy to neutral rep on an engagement was doing so in an machariel upon our battlefleet landing he just docked up pretty as you please with a 60 second timer hed have been dead its obvious the neutrals just want to hold that status until they can aggress something easy to kill that poses lowrisk eve is about pvp which involves risk its also about choosing sides lets make it so that choice sticks to neutral reppers just as it does to active combat pilotsbest regardsisaiah harms
have you tried pvp away from stations
90 of engagements happen on stations and gates
not much to comment on i support the idea greatly
you tell me goose99 kb linked
uhim not into war decs these daysbut yeah if neutrals are going to take part in a battle they ought to have consequences this seems like an exploit to me its just a great way to win simply because you own more accounts
eve pvp is all around pvp comes in many shapes and you cannot always avoid it the structure of eve really means there are few places to pvpstations gates belts and safespotsanomaliesno matter if youre in hisec lowsec or 00 everybody deserves a fair chance and currently neutral logistics isnt really fairneutral remote repairing logistics have been ruining the spirit of eve ever since they overtook the role from alt falcons being able to have a neutral logistic in hisec gives you the advantage of moving around free of risc and wait commiting the logistic in combat until you decide to this phenonema is an increasing factor of why people dont even want to engage in fighting in empire wars they didnt start themself in fact theyre preventing the desire to play the game as intendedunfortunately for the victim of neutral reps there are really very little to do if you engage the neutral logistic ship it can dock up as soon it wants and then you have wasted important timei am in total support of this suggestion logistic ships are fragile but repairing people that have aggression should indeed transfer aggression and make you unable to dockjump for 60 seconds like if you had shot someoneeve is all risc vs reward and logistics in hisec have almost 0 risc and is very very rewarding when you commit a ship in an engagement it should be commited and not have a natural ability to just disengage instantly the moment you dont want to commit anymoresignedpinky denmark
hello council members and fellow eve players my name is paintchk and i got a few ideas you guys should considerim not sure what you guys can do but here are somethings you guys might likefirst is cockpit view this is when incarsionif im spelling it rightcomes outthis view is a option a pilot can have in the options normal or cockpitwhat this does is bring your character in the bridge of your ship or the cockpit it depends on what your flying lets say in a hurricane you have set the option and can move around with ais just sitting at computers working or walking around doing random stuff you can customize it to have chairs posters etc etc you have a chair which you can steer your ship and lock on to stuff right outside a massive window you also choice to move the chair around targeting sounds like a problem but when you sit in the chair more screens appear to see around the ship or that overview in normal view but when you sit in the chair it goes into first person view of your characterif your interested in this just message me or replay and ill fill you in on the restas for the cockpit of a frigate it shows the bodyarms legs chestof your character from their eyes setting in a chair with steering targeting and other controls around you this also gives you the chance to introduce the stick control like the ones you can use in flying games or something but you can use both a mouse and the stick at the same time just throwing the stick option out there i think people will like it some i hope but for customizing it you can add some small posters or hula girlscome on how can you not have a hula girl in a cockpit also a small radio to listen to the sound track so again reply if you want more info about it
hmmi hope you know that what you posted called wall of text by meaning nobody going to read because of reading process difficultyhowever as my bio says i am stupidthat is why i did read ityou mate giving suggestions about awesome graphic effects which is cool i just not sure about how many players have such powerful pc that could afford itno offence just rethink it
you mate giving suggestions about awesome graphic effects which is cool i just not sure about how many players have such powerful pc that could afford ityeah i know most people dont have computers that can handle that type of effects but its just a suggestion my computer could hardly handle the character creation thing when it came out
second is ship damage or destruction as well as objects that can be destroyed or damagenow its cool to see a massive explosion when defeating a ship or blowing up a station or escaping a battle and your ships is on fire a bit but overtime a poof of fire and a massive shock wave gets a little old and the fire doesnt appear to often for you to noticeso what i purpose is better destruction looks or designlets start with ship damage okay im flying a hurricane and come under attack they get past my shields and start getting through my armor then i see parts of my ship falling off then my shields drop to 25 then major parts of the ship fall off one of engines go a massive hole is shoot into my ship and i can see inside my ship it just falls apart with more damage then i warp out and get somewhere safe after coming to a stop fire from spots that were hit start show massive fires i then repair myself in a station and it shows the parts i lost get reattached that is one cool effect on ships the bigger the ship the more pieces come off now for destruction of ships i didnt get the chance to warp out and everything is o and my ship is going to blow my capsule ejects and my ship explodes from the inside out not in a poof of smoke but in pieces and fire they dont float away completely so you can still salvage of course now if a enemy hits me with a round or missile it either goes through it or stops and explodes and then my ship starts to explode boom for frigates they dont really loss many pieces as a bc but tiny parts so when your ship explodes it flys out of control and then explodes now heres a option you should really consider when your frigate is about to blow you have the last chance to smash your ship into the enemys the bigger the ship the more damage it does but your capsule doesnt survive sadly now heres the best part of that when that ship smashs into lets say your ship and the smoke clears you see part of that ship in your ship as damage think about it and get a picture in your head yeah pretty cool huh as for repairing your ship the station pulls the wreck out and you can sell for scrap or somethingas for object destructionits the same deal as ships a big poof of smoke and a shock wave now lets start with poss now during a siege the shields start to fade as the strength decreases and static electricity starts to spark inside the bubble not effecting anything in it then the shield fades and the station starts to take fire as the armor takes damage small explosions happen in random places and pieces start to rip off fire and smoke come out and then the final shot hits it you start to see explosions from the inside start to happen and then you see tiny bright lights come out those are escape pods just a add on effect then the station either explodes from the middle the hole thing or from the bottom or top down or up pieces fly off after the explosion the shock passes the ships and rocks the ship no damage but the effect from the shock wave now if your in the  pit view it rocks the inside the ship and everyone fells it now for turrets and other objects they do pretty much the same thing but now there is such a thing as a lucky shot there are two types first lucky shot is hitting the objects powercore and destroying it instantlythe second type hits it in the powercore but damages it but doesnt destroy it then makes it venerable to capture from enemys this lucky shot can also be used for ships same deal but the guy inside the ship that is disable has the choice to abandon ship or self destruct then the attacker can capture the ship a pirates dream
hiwe met again
1 for better graphics
actually being able to claim salvage rights wouldnt be such a bad idea who wants to declare war on 18 corps above example just to clean up the pos in one system where is the personal benefit aside from a costly killmail they get nothingonce a pos shields go down it should be reasonable for anyone who finds the pos to have the option of salvaging it i dont think a 30 day salvage claim is really viable at least with the way it was presented in the op 15 days with no option for the original owner to recover after that period has passed the claimant who wants access to the pos then gets an unlock item for the pos concord issued and capable of installation in a mid or high slot for use where it can be cycled up within 5km of the derelict pos and allow the pos ownership to transfer to the player or his corporation simple easy and you can use it anytime after the fifteen days has passed easier yet would be a concord issued script which could be loaded into a high slot module for the purpose 5 min cycle time
better idea offline poses take constant damage from meteorite impacts and suchsmall towers might be destroyed in about 3 weeks and larger ones take longer1 no free stuff2 you can still get stuff by war decing the offline tower3 benefits people who are less inactive
ill have to add to the wardec and shoot the tower crowd this is a mechanic that is working as intendeda pos is a corp asset a corp is a group of players a group of players should be able to keep a tower online and defend it if they really want to keepuse it this should mitigate the issue of unforseen rl circumstances because a whole corp hopefully wont be hit by concurrent rl issueseve is a game that encourages cooperative and competitive play if you want to play solo thats fine too but if you play with others youll get far more benefits
its not working as intended space is littered with hundreds to thousands of offline poses that nobody wants to get a group of people to spend ten hours shooting the point of this isnt to make it easier to knock down a pos its to make it harder to keep an offline one up
aside from that many faction mods are same or worse than t2 counterparts in order to justify their costs theyll have to cost less than t2 its not just the prices that need to be looked at but stats too
yesthey wont do this or anything else besides fapfap over wod until subscription losses get too badbut what the hell im bored supported
i agree the lpisk cost for lp items shoudnt be as static as they are however im unsure if tweaking the lp cost is the only way to go there changing the isk required would make for a more dynamic isk sinkchanging low demandvalue faction items to be more desirable for buyers as well as sellers would be a good step to streamline faction items moreit would help to make missioning for corporations which currently have bad lp stores worthwhile too spreading out the population in the processcould go wrong with a bad implementation though
supportedactually this might help to get gallente looked at right now few use them for pvp except for a few specific ships but they still see a lot of use in pve if pve becomes heavily antidrone nobody will fly gallente pvp or pve
38 supported 1 2 bad idea i think maybe resist and dps can have random value in range dfined by faction group
which skill lets you launch 1520 probes
no
lol no to horid lazy people wanting easy isk
next purpose is fighter or bomber controlnow i havent gotten this yet but if this isnt available yet heres a good option for carrier pilotswhat you can do is fly a fighter or bomber plane having this can create dogfights between fighters and help you take out problems your ship or other fighters or bombers cant handle but when you blow up you dont go to your clone it wouldnt be right so this is just a small thing to considerso thats all i purpose for you guys i hope you like it and consider it if you still need info just ask me and ill answer as for the rest below its just addons for the other things i couldnt fit insoon when in cockpit view and your ship takes damage red lights come on as warnings sparks fly small explosions and cracks in the windows appear and when your sitting in you chair and your ship explodes your character puts hisher hands up and a explosion happens you then wake up spinning out of control in your capsule and your character regains control the ais dont survive but theyre not importanta good side of cockpit view you can set your ship to autopilot and it flys itself and you can roam around but the bridge with just chairs couch and other isnt that fun all the time but you can walk around your ship cargo bay drone bay gun deck captains quarters engine room and a viewing room you can do a few things in each room for entertainment but by yourself isnt fun so you can have your friends on board as well say heshe is trapped in a station and you fly in and they can fly with you hang and chat cool right this can really make chatting more fun i know you guys are gonna ask what if the ship explodes well you guys can either have sacrifice or escape pods for everyone sacrifice is basically when pilots come onboard the captain has the choice to either give up his capsule for one of them a good captain goes down with the shipso thats all i got i hope you guys consider this and hope to see it in the game
hey nice name  i got shot far too many times doing paint checks in the last tourney i reffedthe issue i see with all three of your suggestions is this what do they add to the game besides eye candynot that i dont like eye candy mind you but eve is a deep game with an abundance of interesting choices to spend a significant amount of time i would estimate thats precisely how much time these features would take to add eye candy features like this just wouldnt be worth putting off the other things that could use developer time for much more engaging resultslets be honest  once youve wandered around the bridge of your ship and had a look around a few times why would you ever go back there
stop posting walls of text
lets be honest  once youve wandered around the bridge of your ship and had a look around a few times why would you ever go back theretrue i have to admit but with incarna coming out i think its a thing to consider doing and plus it would take a significant of time to do so good points but its just something i think would be a good add on for the game
details my friend detailsit be pointless to putbridge walkingother areas to walketcetci like to get into details about things but i sometimes overdo it
to sum up the best ideas i have seenusing a drone group as the indicator for when to apply a stacking effect rather then each individual dronematching the effectiveness of the drone sizes to their counterparts in a module sense small ecm drones should be balanced to reflect this as there is nosmall ecm modthe reasoning behind both of these is the amount of dps lost when you dont use combat drones on avaerage even a flight of small drones equates to about 80 dps sometimes more the stacking protocol by group makes swarming a lot less effectivei would even support a larger stack penalty for each additional group than is given to modsand would make up for that substantial dps loss if done in conjuction with a balanceing to equivalent modulesew as a whole has recieved a large boot to the head multispecs are near worthless even on bonused ships i understand the reasoning but i think there is a general cry for alarm as i have seen a large decrease in the number of ecm ships in fleets and small gangs dps is the new battlecry as ecm is not effective enough at this point to warrant droping dps ships for it sensor dampeners are strictly for snipers now as it should be but even snipers dont use them tracking disruptors are wholly ignored even when scripted sorry to move on to the ecm track theredrones need the two changes i opened with and thanks to those who thought of them when stated it seems to me that there is no other solution that could be better or keep in game balance as well

fitz i agree that something needs to be done in this area i am not too sure about having that many tabs seems like it would be difficult for leadership that would have to be able to see them alli was just on new eden radio hopefully they will have a recording up sometime as well
i was thinking more about it and it could be coded so that when you anchor for corp and then right click as a director on the hanger in space you will see some thing like assignment tab when you select that it opens a window and it lists each section with a drop down window if the director selects the drop down he then see every corp member all he has to do is select the corp member and the section then becomes that corp members area and their name is assigned to it and no one but them or a director can get into it no idea how to code that when people leave the corp it becomes unassigned any stuff in it falls into a hanger that directors can then do with as they want or something along these lines

i have been playing this terrible game for 6 years and have voted in every csm while playing  the presence of the mittani and his spamming crew of thousands appears to be the only difference in how things are being run this year if the presence of person who can entice 6000 accounts to vote and the backlash of those who despise his kind is not the reason for the significantly higher voter turnout thus far what is its easy to point and laugh ask galileo

you cut that out right meow
since you know ccp follows the csms advice and suggestions part and parcel all the timethis process is no different than any high school student council election process the difference is our guy isnt promising soda machines in the cafeteria or that theyd be a really good class president because they watched the west wing
got my vote
being in uk i often forget what happens in us or what doesnt in mittanis case  things are starting to make sense on why mittani is so desperate and serious about playing sarah palin online making up for lost time i see im just glad we dont have an internet spaceship prom he would probably go all out for that too i kindda feel bad for all the things i said about him now i just figured it was some political ambition you know something to keep the alliance moving wasnt aware it was all about closure and building selfesteemwell since you are probably already in due to numbers again and nothing else have fun in iceland though dont expect anything will change just because you are hot headed and emotionally unstable

i have three cats this is not my faulti once had two cats but my orange tabby died not too long ago this sent me into a bit of a state and my wife decided that i should get a kitten to try to get over it i resisted for a long while then one day she showed me the webpage of a local rescue a tiny black kitten with a broken tail had been found in a wheelwell of a car trying to keep warm in the depths of the wisconsin winter black cats are adopted far less than any other kind of cat too anyway so i melted and we ran out and adopted the kitten and since she had become foster buddies with the kitten in the crate next to her we adopted her friend too so im now at 1 cat 2 kittens and an increasingly massive alaskan malamutedarius was the hotheaded gsf ceo i have ice in my veins vov

im dumb youre the one chasing after the vote of someone who already votedvote kalrand for csm hes the goonswarm candidate you can trust and if he fails miserably he has a handy rl name that lends itself well to childish barbs like dillhole or dillweed
hi mittens since you wont lie to us at all please tell us how much you paid evenews 24 and eve tribune
test and goonswarm paid 2b4b respectively for the en24 ad and nothing for eve tribune since thats an endorsement not a paid advertseleenes people got pretty angry that wed beaten them to the punch for the en24 topofthepage space so their paid ad ended up on a sideline you angry about that too
mittens its pretty ty that you and your alts have been slagging off people like me and trebor for runnining entirely open competitions saying that its immoral to buy votes while youre spending billions behind the scenes buying endorsements and advertisingat least with our competitions everyone stands a chance to win youre just lining the pockets of the mediai guess thats eh honesty people get when they vote for you huh
im sure its entirely coincidence that en24 which previously was a blatent supporter of pandemic legion has suddenly started posting links to pls leaked forums at exactly the time that mittani and the nc started bankrolling them
woah there are still people who think you can buy somebody for as little as 6 bil
sunday bump d
the questions are a bit broad on the vote match website however that website was what lead me to vote for you but it was only after i tried prioritising a number of different ways and really looked at what it was telling me after i looked at the individual comments and tried a number of different variations it pointed to you being an interesting candidate to find out a bit more about my recommendations are for anyone using this tool to not take it at face value if it was twice as long and factored in the candidates comments then maybe you could use it without asking anymore questions as it is it is an excellent guide to sift through the large number of candidates but only as a starting pointwait this is just a video game
looking a bit more into the comments is what persuaded me to vote ripard too is a great tool but when you score at least 50 with almost every candidate including ppl you almost never agreed with in the past it calls for closer examinationtldrvote ripard
youre both exactly right thank you for your comments and for your support i felt much better about how i stacked up compared to the other candidates when i saw how the comments were presented and im glad to see they made a difference in new news im happy to report that i am one of the nine candidates endorsed by eve tribune for a seat on csm6 i find their comments about me to be fair and accurate thanks guys
i support your support of this and feel the same i think you would be an excellent co council member whatever hope to see you in iceland
i voted for  pig today you should tooif he turns out to be a ty csm delegate blame mynxee not me i voted for all of her choices except that dude who said that there were no cynoscaps in lowsec and that other dude who insider traded
just picked up an endorsement from the eve tribunenot someone we always agree with and not someone in our political sphere in eve but through numerous conversations hes made it very clear that he loves the game and is committed to working within the csm to improve it we believe he should be reelected and that he would help provide balance and still work cooperatively within the csmtheir choice for chairman was a classic example of an offby1 error however
since you deleted my latest comment on your blog post i guess ill have to post it here insteadallow me to refresh your memory you said that either mittens would be bad for the csm or he is lying and ask how can you trust a man whose entire election campaign is based on liesi replied thuslythats actually a really interesting question the only reason i know who you are is your unsourced accusations read lies about mittens actions and intentions setting yourself up as the antigoon candidate seems to be working out pretty well for you so maybe you should try asking your constituentsfor those just joining us the unsourced accusations in question are that mittens is involved in the supposed smear campaign against trebor and that mittens wants to try to use the csm as a vehicle to advance his own petty ingame interests at the expense of the vast majority of the players of eve
why should he not delete your post when you dont even get the timeline right
because deleting comments you dont like is bad thats why i dont know anything about timelineson topic ill accept that as mittens mobilizing goons against trebor could be fake but i doubt it if trebor had had linked it when i asked for citations i would have dropped it from my argumentgot anything for the he wants to try to use it as a vehicle to advance his own petty ingame interests at the expense of the vast majority of the players of eve part
i deleted your post because i did in fact already address the questions you asked which were not quite by the way the specific points you make above but also because i knew you almost certainly couldnt resist the bait and would post about it in this thread where i could address it in front of a wider audience thanksas for the mittanis involvement in the smear campaign against me according to a goon jabber leak he ordered a noholdsbarred posting op he hasnt bothered to deny it and a previous leak from the same source in which he identifies me as a target was confirmed by him in the very next post in the threadwith respect to your second concern the mittani would be a fool to admit this in public but given his history ingame which i hasten to repeat i entirely admire  in an ingame context you would have to be a fool not to be concerned i addressed this issue in a comment to the blog post interested readers should check it outanother interesting post is a wonderful demolition of the goon smear talking points by andrea griffin its a fascinating exposure of how outofcontext quotemining worksfinally with regard to setting myself up as the antigoon candidate i did not do that the mittani did and to be precise im not antigoon  or antianyone for that matter im proevei am not at all worried about the smear campaign  on the contrary i was praying the mittani would be foolish enough to go after a candidate with strong qualifications such as seleene or myself and thus increase nonpowerbloc turnout its a classic case of the emperor has made a critical mistake and his pattern indicates twodimensional thinkingmy only concern as i pointed out in my guide to mud is that it will generate too many extra votes for me and divert votes away from other qualified candidatesunlike the mittani i dont have any particular desire to be chairman my primary concern is that csm 6 contain delegates that will work their asses off to improve the game for all playersincluding of course the goons
because thats so much easier than copy pasting sweet damage control brahgiven his ingame history is that all you have you say as a statement of fact and in bold that he wants to try to use it as a vehicle to advance his own petty ingame interests at the expense of the vast majority of the players of eve and when i ask for citations you present nothing but wordy variations on hes a tricky sort of guy and i dont trust him can you provide a single case of outofgame malfeasance a quote that says he would abuse power or even push for a change which would benefit his alliance over others would you deny that he has been against overpowered supercarriers and against the technetium buff which benefit his alliancefacts are awesome please provide one
you have my votethank you for your work on csm5 and best of luck with your csm6 campaign
thanks for your previous work and i wish you the best of scottish luck for csm6 heres hoping the pothole fixing continues rather than sticking on new content every 6 months youll be getting my vote and hopefully those of my corp membersas an industrial player  a corp mainly doing missions and industrial work i would like to see some effort put into bringing the indy part of eve some much needed care an attention the last few updates and new addons seem to have been mainly aimed at pvp00alliances its about time the smaller corps were also given some attention and stop ccp always aiming to get players out of empire and into 00 to be able to play half of the game mechanics or any new ships they decide to introduce or adding pi to totally feck things up for indysid like for the small fixes and changes to continue such as icon fixing ui corrections drone ai etcnow fix things like the lab and factory use restrictions and i will be even happier  11 is very poor for a game based on advanced science and spaceage technology that had been set way back many years ago been playing 6 years long before the player base grew over the quarter million mark and the settings of any npc station have not been upgradedadapted to match the number of players wishing to buildresearchinvent i like to play my own way and i am paying to play after all if we are to retain good players and good friends made over the years we need to fix whats broken first before adding more dough to the mix
hey there trebor you are getting all of my votes because of the great work that you did with csm5 good luck 
dear seleene do you think space brothels will be full service in incarna
this is where the vote matching falls a bit short as eve stands right now no theres no point to move them to lowsec what i would like to see is an expansion that adds incentives to lowsec and rebalances all agent missions in general the goal is multipronged not favoring any one group over another the goal would be an improvement of the entire agent system with more options and opportunity at every level of playif such a change did occur its not going to go out of its way to alienate anyone ccp understands where their bread and butter is and any alterations to the current system would certainly take into account all of the above and much more bear in mind that my entire campaign is focused on iteration i want to see the game move forward i want to see unfinished features fleshed out and more game play emerge from the game we currently enjoy the agent system has not had a fundamental rework or iteration in the better part of four years the underlying code of the agent system dates back to 2004 i dont think anyone can deny that it needs help
stop trolling of course they will be i assume thats what ccp has in mind for the ultimate scifi simulator right also my replies to this thread will be slow in coming in egypt for the week and finding a stable net connection here is proving to be a tad difficult
eve tribune has published their list of endorsements and i am on ita good overall list considering the huge field to chose from
my votes you have them all of them id like to see a lot of people make it to csm but not only are you campaigning on issues that i personally find relevant i feel youve got the strongest ability to see them implemented good luck
saileene will make a good csm i promise
i endorse this endorsement since it it endorses me
i find it quite sad that you didnt take the time to be completely thorough in your study of the csm candidatesof course i say this because i havent been interviewed i can understand that the process is a bit tedious with all those candidates thusotherwise this list doesnt seem bad most of the people on there are those id enjoy seeing at the csm with me id like to add something thus for anyone interested by this list as a way of guiding your vote  remember that some of these candidates have either big alliances backing them up or are already very popular due to their previous work with the csm or ccp while they have every right to be at the csm and are likely to bring something interesting to the table they are pretty much elected already your vote wont make a difference on the first few candidates except for chair maybe which is not really important but is very much needed by the smaller ones who will have the remaining seats
well mostly being bittervets we went off what we knew about the candidates what conversations wed had with them in our capacity as an internet spaceship fanzine and what their campaign threads were like while we arent going to be altering our endorsements youre certainly welcome to speak to a tribune staffer and give us an interview in order to prove us wrong and show why we should have endorsed you
someone post the list of names ffs without that this is a ed clickfishing thread i give insufficient s to do so myself
the mittani for chair i was under the impression the goal was to make things better not worse sorry but im not voting for a silly goon any of them he has already stated that the only reason he is running is to keep ccp from touching jump bridges and to make sure 00 stays the same as it is now not voting for any nc candidate either harboring rmters is not exactly the shining example of leaders we need on the csm
i couldnt agree more being endorsed and all 
glad to see ripard on that list along with me a good selection considering the huge field to chose from
my thanks to the staff of the eve tribune for their endorsement
well this just about says what everyone needs to know i for one will be completely disregarding each and every person endorsed by your faux publication
thank you for the free bump
i for one am pleased i didnt get endorseemnts from this fine publication
typos in my eve
i guess its just a coincidence that mittens bought out the editors of en24 figure being discussed is 10bn and that mysteriously eve tribune also jumps over they lying to youaint that right mittensthanks for telling it straight
wait i was supposed to get paid mittens
in all seriousness if you didnt you lost out as hes been chucking isk at everyone else everyones supposed to get their cut along the way as the nc and mittani buy their way into the csmi know youre nc and you kind of have to vote for mittens as chair but you should probably at least get what the other guys got
conspiracy theories own i should have run for csm years ago perhaps next alex jones can do a special about me
ok since you loathe people who lie to us how much did you pay eve news 24 to run a huge take over ad supporting yousince you plan to be completely honest with us i know youll answer
idk why you think buying adspace is a big scandal lil altposteranswered your question already in the other thread
lady crazy you are partially correct seeing as how were going to endorse mittens anyways i should have tried to shake him down for some major isk first ah well maybe next time
independent endorsements best endorsements keep up the awesome independent work and thanks for your definitely not paid for suggestions
thanks again to all the in game support im getting sad that the eve tribune didnt bother to reach out to me for an interview but i think it just goes to show im not an insider candidateminers and industrialists members of small corps or independent pilots let me be your voice in the csmissler dainzethe voice of reason csm candidate
hey isslerjust want to say that you have my vote best of luck with your campaign for csmphlyk
backtothetop
clearly these candidates have overinflated sense of importance of self
hello there  thanks for your vote its very appreciated honestly no let me elaborate a bit while physical realism is something noone can really dislike i fear that correcting the astrophysics of eve is too big of a task for a too small public most of the players even amongst the roleplayers are quite happy with a vaguely realistic universe without entering too much in the detailsfor example im sure a much greater proportion of the roleplayers would enjoy seeing binary stars first remember all those systems are binary starsystems although i believe that it would be so much of a change that theyll retcon everything eventuallya dynamic universe is a big nono in any case  this was discussed before and ccp stated that not only having the celestials moving would cause much more stress on the servers it would also render the current bookmark system completely useless so unless they someday want some kind of grand change to the bookmark system for other reasons i dont think theyll invest the development resources in such a featuredont lose hope thus  other improvements are on the way some of the things you mentioned may be in the pipes there was recently a debate concerning accessibility in eve which was not made very easy by the nebulas also the recent addition in terms of effects such as god rays and new texture sizes are all factors pointing toward an iteration of our space background someday maybe towards more realism something like stars relative luminescence would be pretty coolalso i remember reading that ccp was rather dissatisfied with the current look of stars this along with the addition of largescale game effects could pave the way for a redo of the stars possibly with effects such as thermal damage when too close solar flares etcall this is pure speculation based on a few facts thus i think the best advances we will get during the csm 6 term in terms of rolepalying will be through incarna but who knows  if ccp opens the discussion about physical realism ill be glad to weigh in
having held many conversations with gehen i am impressed with his commitment and interpretation of ccps guidelines and will be voting for him i urge my friends and colleagues to do likewise
thank you darranibal  ill also use this opportunity to thank the other players who have sent me emails of support and the kind players at eveuniversity who i had a very nice chat with i welcome all players unsure of my dedication to eve and my selfless commitment to its improvement in case of an election to ask me further questions 
the problem is the cost ratio you need a counter that is equal in cost you can get 2 supercarriers for a titan so naturally theyll build more supercarriers theyll continue to dominate until a like cost ship capable of destroying them 1 on 1 5050 chance is introducedother options would present other problems like a drone screening vessel for instance you could introduce it with a bubble effect that just damages drones problem is the dsv would have to have such a tank that it could reasonable protect itself long enough to be of use this could lead to other problems
i still like discophoons more titansscscarriers all carry smartbombs or atleast in my alliance to be able to refit and kill off drone dpshere is new eden radio live interview podcast that happened earlier today linkothers i will post as they get released
i endorse this charecter u have my support and vote

lol i won twice today and i also won a couple days ago and hot tubes won 4 times in totalclearly choobs and i are both chribba altsstay tuned for brusanans 3rd party escrow service coming soontm
i have been following your posts in the time that you have been running for csm you have wrote about most of the topics that are important to me i know you must feel as i do and it seems that the programers and staff at ccp may communicate with us and act as though they understand what is going on they still seem to have no true understading of the effects that each issue has on the game play we need someone who will be our voice to the people in ccp and have the persistant attitude to not give up but continually press the importance of the issue being actually fixed and not just masked as ccp seems to have the potential to do now you are still my vote for csm
hey manalpan i like what you have to say man you are right about the problems with eve i vote for you man please get them to fix the problems
it seems to me that you are the csm canidate that has his finger on my pulse of concerns and therefore i vote for you
manalapan i was just curious as to what your actual ideas about fixing neut rr are they are obviously bad except to carebears and highsec weekend warriors but how do you propose that ccp fix them
oh and also to what about corp taxes are you referring increasing the things that can be taxed or eliminating the corp tax altogether
if you get elected i would like to see the idea brought up to include a bit more diversity in what is offered on the lp store for mission runners you hit a point where there is nothing new and exciting to work towards on lp so it looses its appeal maybe rotating what is available every so often to keep it fresh
i thank lostinevenet for having me at debate 4podcast of this debate will be released monday march 15
vote this guy hes bringing up good stuff unlike these 00 alliance muppets
hi allus thanks for the interesting questionfirstly there already are agents available in 00 either in npc stations or agents in space i would be hesitant to suggest npc agents being available in player stations because they wouldnt be accessible to all players who have sufficient standing with that agent because of player standings this goes against how missions workalso if youve got some time to kill and there are no roams going down or you just want to chill there are always anomolies and complex sites doesnt raise standings does a pretty good job at lowering standings with the faction youre shooting though but still good cashone thing i would like to see and is a specific part of my campaign is more npc nullsec which would work as a stepping stone for newer playersgroups to get a taste for 00 this would also make for more agents in 00more ie higher density of agents in space would be cool as well as further expansion on the pirate missions which require interceptors or something small and fast to complete avoiding hostile gangs that might be aroundedit typos
you get my vote for the use of the word pendantic
thats as good a reason as anyive had an interesting discussion with roeth whitestar via eve mail which i thought id share because it covered some pertinent topics
wow kal you hold up pretty darn well when trolls are out looking for blood but seriously folks lets be franki have been reading up a bit and a lot of players are interested in your corps doings since they are labeling you as a goon but most arent really that aware that there are more than one goon corp in eveomg reallyand really honestly trulyforgot where i was going on this umdangreply resetthis doesnt seem to be the breadandbutter style of running for office that ive seen in the past ideas are laid out in a public forum and discussed with relative ease there really hasnt been a goingbackonhisword kind of moment that ive seen yetand while the points are generalized to the point that a sixyearold can understand it and also that it isnt centralized on highseclowsecnullsec you have to realize that a point when implemented will change the game this means that if a point directly impacts you cursing of csm and ccp will ensue these candidates are for the most part sharing the role of ccp in directing change and offering a vote for someone who doesnt care about making a personal image but more of the common player that is the person that will outshine the rest without need of a spotlight and make things betterthat is why i vote for kalrand
i endorse this candidate for csm
i voted for kalrand you should too even if he gets his its and its confused sometimesas for the smallmidsize corps controlling space in 00 i think the current systems should have backwaterextremely lowend systems attached to them maybe with hinkylooking stargates that might go offline periodically maybe 1 belt a planet and a moon or something that makes it too much of a pita for big alliancescorps to bother with but that would be enough to interest a smaller group and let them lay claim to their piece of the pie
i do agree pos roles do need a good look at a few points i think should definatly be lookd at arethe condensing or roles maby only 3 or 4 typesthe ability for public use as you saidthe ability to set the use of certain things on the pos to use standings rather than a password ie jump bridges and control of pos gunsas a csm rep i would defiantly put forward the pos revamp idea so if that happens i would defiantly like some more input on how poss and their uses effect youeve truth
thanks for the comments people and yes i might be a weirdo but its part of the charme of getting things done i guess i sure hope to get the win i am full with ideas i love to see added and i am sure a lot of you will love to see someone in office that actually does do something for all the community and not just for selfish reasons may it be for corp alliance or a single pilot csm is a team that mediates between the players and ccp and thus no place for solo play or own corp andor alliance
question how will someone with admitted selfdiagnosed aspergers syndromewhich makes social interaction extremely difficultsucceed in both working closely with the other council members and ccp you know youre going to be in the same room and having potentially highlevel talks or banal talks for that matterare you sure you can keep things productivealso your list of promises makes it look like youre trying to run for junior dev which is not what the csm does really
i will not even comment to that i rather be the smarter one in this know the truth about aspergers first before you post
im actually going to give one of my votes to kumi and im standing for csm myself sounds like you can bring something really new and innovative to the csm and that sounds damn good to me
thanks sure can use every vote i can get in
rofl ruining my game would be a hard thing to do because i do all sorts of things in this game and not only with this characterthe only real downpart at the moment is you still trying to sound interesting are you sure you arent just a goon alt which got into razor to spy on socalled alliesyou sure sound like a goon
the op really amuses me in how uninformed they seem to be very unfortunate
the op is not they you very silly lad
ive enjoyed killers posting so much that he features prominently in csmtxt the ongoing archive of the grief ive caused merely by running for officeluv2csm
you dont cause me grief mitty for that you just arent important enough for me so sadly your ego wont really have any effect herefact for me is that you or any other goon wouldnt bring anything to the table which would represent the community the only group you and your puppets would represent are the goons but presenting it as something everything needsfor goons this is just another scam or trick they are doingso accept the fact i vote for people who care for the game and want it to be a good game for everyone and not for some semiplayers whos biggest goal has just been the opposite
10
yeah killer  you represent the opinion of a great majority of players it would be nice if they stayed in their own area of space and be gooney to each other and their nieghbors but i guess they are lonely and want to mingle well itll be a year of goon watching to see if they can restrain themselvestimely post  thanks
and indeed your ownintorweb pixel faces aside is it true gerneal sir that half the other csm candidates have approached you to buy your manifesto and remove yourself from the race for the princely prize of a fully t1 fitted bait maller 
good luck i voted for you with all four of my accounts yes i am turkey voting for christmas the 00 factions wield a lot of power and historically they have been well represented in the csm community secondly eve needs new subscribers these subscribers will initially spend a lot of time in empire so its important to have a csm who is willing to look after empire interests finally i support the development of more openinterfaces within eve a playerbased developer community would be a major asset to ccp and citizens of eve and should be encouraged
you got my vote  as long as certain people use the csm for their own agenda to protect their own interestswe all know it will never be given any real kinda power to make eve better for all of usthe csm has so much potential and it was our chance to pull together as a customer base and get the game working better so we can all have more funbut sadly due to the selfish few i cant see it changing anytime soon
actually the 00 alliances are pulling new subscribers not yet out of their baby slippers to go off into 00 and take advantage of all that is available there theyve been actively recruiting like this for some time with no more requirement than 1 million spi know this because i have been attempting to recruit for a month for an alt corp and my recruiting campaigns worst competition is nullsec corps that have access to the most valuable resources in the game rather difficult to offer something which can compare to that overallthey even put alts into your corp or recruiting chat to snipe the guys who might be interested a member of goonswaffe told me that i think in a rather candid moment in recruiting it really is quite disappointing seeing a corp grow to 7 members and drop to 3 in a couple weeks most of those lost were kicked and the other was a test alliance spy according to his old ceo he dropped inside of 5 hoursso will they really be in highsec
further proof why we need people to stand up against those alliances if they have their way this will be one hell of a dull game good to see someone like windy actually trying to spice up empire again and take on the big boys
just to clarify those people caught in the rmt exposUFFFD were customers not that this excuses them buying isk outside of plex is still against the eula its just not quite as bad as running the isk selling racketi just dont want people to get the two confused
so what is the nc going to do with all those people in their coalition on that list that were customers of a rmt sitesince wildly inappropriate is 1 on that list does that mean they encourage this behaviouris it a sign of having a nonprofitable section of space that is being rented to you forcing members to seek alternate ways to gain incomehas vuk lau leader of the nc made any statement condemning or embracing rmt since this list was leakedhas anyone at all been kicked from the nc that was on the list
lets also be clear that there are a lot of players from a lot of alliances involved here i can imagine what ncwi leadership would say about this but im not going to put words in somebody elses mouththat said an alliance couldnt and shouldnt have any control over what one of their members does with their own credit card against the rules of the game or noti just had a good look through the spreadsheet on eve news 24 and noted the 85 of those involved being in unaffiliatednpc corps so as not to tie back to their main how many of those are associated with your corpalliance i wonderpersonally they should all be banned plain and simple but thats up to ccp i would like to know as part of my campaign how much they do actually do about rmt including this event
another interview and discussion on new eden radio tonight they assure me that the download will be available in a couple of hours listen in to me and a bunch of other csm candidates answer questions from the irc channeledit its available to download from this link
how can we trust you to repersent players who dont lie cheat or steal their way through the game to make a good rep for the other players
i belive those who created game can easily handle whole stuff they made into real so sophisticated mathematic equations that are not very common in other space games propably thats why they decided to get us to idea of csm i admire ccp for being open to ideas even more i admire freedom of speach to let me disagree with some  but i belive giving just a group of people theoreticly more rights to influence ccp minds is move that will move to slow extinction of our communityit is like you on your own limit your own pool of imagination and ideas by letting small gruop of people inside game decide for the rest that small group will change game in the way they like not in the way whole player base likesure some ideas are wrong some are good but why guys who are not capable of doing such a cool game are in charge of decidions that influence us allmost of them are just capable to make proper impression i belive they are very creative in self presentation csm idea propably gives them some meta funabout your last question sure we form ourselves into groups that what corporations alliances are made for thing is look on those structure in current game playhow many existing corporationsalliances are in charge of game map i belive about 05 of eve population minority who is slightly more organised takes control over the rest do you think those minorites are capable of represanting whole eve universe in my opinion that what election is in this game thats why i am not supporting itaccording to me csm construction by defoult support minority structures correct me if i am wrong but i bet that 99 of eve players got no possibilites to participate as electors due to their style of game play some are indyviduals some hate structures some play in random way for fun giving up freedom of ideas of developing game narrowing possibilites to suggest your own idea why narrowing well one single genious mind need to convince brick wall of csm electors to even get to ccp convincing us that csm represent our ideas and minds is in my opinion very cruel sure it makes things simpler for ccp menagement but it is not the reason why i play eve i like diversity
it is your right not to vote or believe in the electoral process just as it is mine to try to take part in it i didnt expect i would turn you around in one notein one sad way you are right that the election and the game is run by minorities so many people dont vote that the minority elect the representatives that is one truth i wish was not sokell may have lost faith in the process but maybe a few folks reading this have noti am asking that you dontread listen learn maybe run in the next election once this election is decided go to the assembly hall with your proposals your voice can be heard because it is not just the 9 seats and that is it the election is the beginning of the process not the endandif you think of itand havent given upmaybevote for mike azariahm
how much actual impact does the csm have have a read m8 it may not change your mind but it might help you understand why some of us are running
so basicly u are saying that csm exist because ccp employees dont play eve or if they do they do not know what is going on i find this a very good conclusion giving the fact that soo many spaceships are broken even entire races i would sugest giving employees chars and send them out to 00 sec allaicnes and get them to know the game outside pve we all know devs dont pvp 
id like to know when or if the tech ii bpos be removedso heres the bullettech 2 bpos should be removed from game and the owners should be compensated in some way
i like
supported bring back the old jumping and cyno generator effects
well of course it can be done just do know that it will add lagg meaning the war on lagg will go bad but i guess we can always do some tests and figure out a way to have the idea and with minimum lagg issues perhaps add a onoff button for it as well
i am pretty sure that movement of bodily tissue will be minute enough that it will be hard to notice weve already been told no running and jumping so there probably wont be much movement that proper undergarments couldnt dampeneven so this thread is about going for total realism in this game even when such realism is not pc therefore i cannot in good concience not support this thread just dont make it ridiculous ok ccpedit spelling
that is smart maybe when ccp adopts this idea they will incorporate your suggestion as well thanks for the input
i cannot endorse this idea enough the amount of useless skills i injected whilst not sure what to do with this charecter drives my ocd nutsi dont care for the sp back most of the useless science trade and industry skills i would delete are trained no higher than level 2 anyway 
the isk difference between a tier 1 bc and a tier 2 bc is next to nothing but the performance difference is enormous making almost all of the tier 1 bcs useless same goes for frigates cruisers and bssthe tier system is horrible
bump
security status need to be easier if im not allowed to gank people easier in hisec the economy will be going nutsmaybe i should just be regenerating sec status pr hour instead of having to kill rats low sec pirates shouldnt be able to just camp all day  come to 00 and work for your fun
i love to see the same thing happen what is the point in having repair drones of any kind if you do solo missions etc it sure will be a good change to have this simple change added
this quite simply to which i would addbalancing by cost doesnt work especially when isk inflation faucets and rmt are rampantsupporting op
valid point besides the waste on database keys its also causing extra lag all put together so a simple switch in the option menu would be good to have indeed
noob ships are only fun for duelling  nothing better to solve an issue noobship to noobshippinky
this is a better version of this idea but i support the general conceptif it was simply an onoff switch i would not use this  if it was an off switch with a button to request noobship i would
i vote yes
except the caldari boats are supposed to shield tank while gallente are supposed to use armor tank  hence a clear difference in powergrid and cpucertainly hybrids need soemthing happening
well it could be done but you forgetting that the caldari race uses launchers pretty much as default weapon but i do agree with you a lot of ships are made useless because of the railguns not working as they should the guns are simply to weak for it so csm needs to take a look in it how to improve them just enough to make these ships usable again
i would really like to see a ccp post about hybrids just a very simple yes we are looking into it or a no we think theyre finenot a priority right now basically let your paying customers know whether they should start crosstraining or cancel right now without having them waste any more of their time it would really be helpful
i have to agree to this although there is a usage for this very speed bonus as seen in any other ship as well trying to get to a dock or in some cases to a gate you can jump to 0 km but you will often reach 1km or slightly more or the same with a gate of course then you need to use the engine to reach that gatenow call me stupid all you want but i say even that 5 speed bonus can help out to get that faster specially since a lot of the capsuleers do automated runs and go afk knowing the auto pilot only goes up to 10km and flies the rest at normal speed you will need that tiny bit extra to get there fasterso i say why not keep it and then add the 5 agility to that this should improve the ship more then changing it from speed to agilitywhat do you think about that
dont you get agility from training advanced spaceship commandpinky
fat ships need love too ccp stop the discrimination of the obese internet spaceships
not everyone have an alt account or a friend nice enough to provide the web
this is a great idea i would love to see this implemented
wouldnt it be easier to make super carriers vulnerable to ew and give figher bombers a smaller scan resolution or give pos turrets a smaller signature
this is a great idea there needs to be a balance
i would say that ewar only affects supercarriers not titans but the warp scram and warp disruptor mods need to be able to tackle any ship not warp stabbed that is
i often said it and i guess ill be saying it again bots are bad they need to be made illegal and owners banned if they do not take their bots offline eve was not designed to have bots running around doing the job you should be doing as capsuleer it takes the fun out which causes goons in the long run besides that specially new capsuleers are victim of bots since they can not mine as fast and much as a bot so bots are very unfair in that as well specially if you know that some bots are actually mining in fleets multiple retrievers hulks or similar ships
no he is doing just fine he has just enough rope
so what youre saying is that everyone with a t3leadership alt bought that character with illegally purchased iskwow  can you just send the list to ccp so we can get those cheaters banned straight away and make the game a better place for all of ushint if you want constructive dialog in response to your post dont make stupid sweeping generalizations at the beginning of it dumbass
while offgrid boosting is a terrible mechanic on many levels the op is a hilariously dumb whinerand fwiw my link alt was entirely homegrown
ongrid only makes some sensethe alternative would be for warfare link modules to increase sig radius or decrease sensor strength while active making the ship no longer unprobeablefleet command ships would get a role bonus that negated these penalties
the problem youre looking for is unprobeableliang
no the problem is a force multiplier sitting god knows where providing more support than a bloody triage carrier at pointblank range ever could  the probing part is just something leet pvpers such as yourself latch on to in the hopes of defusing legitimate complaints about a broken gameplay aspectoffgrid links are worse than the 150200km failcons of times past since their presence may not even be known off scan and require specialised boats to find even whenif they can be probedcut ganglink effects by 80 when boosting from offgrid or make ongrid the only option to facilitate t3 survival in the role add a combat bonus to command subsystem or give them 1 free link to allow for more firepowertank saves a command proc
you are assuming that its just wannabes and rmt buyers im sure established pirates and plex buyers that use it toyou have to understand eve pvp has absolutely nothing to do with good fights and all about securing wins via any advantage you can find this is why you have things like this and i think its pointless to try and change things like this
i am tempted to make my own version of this post to keep the idea minus the ragetearsop  please reword your original post to not sound like a complete douchebag
why are you so angry and why are you so bent on turning this into some turn base game play
then why mention those things at all eve is always going to be a place where the many have an advantage over the few and where multiboxing is not only allowed but actively encouraged thats an entirely separate issue  if you think that should change you should post about it in another threadwhether you mean to or not your words suggest an association or correlation the most you can claim is that you dont imply a 1 to 1 relationship between rmt and broken game mechanic implication being much stronger than suggestion better to leave it out of the discussioni would encourage people not to support the issue until you change the op accordinglypersonally im against it because of the extra checking required  the server overhead for fleet bonus calculation is problematic enough already youre effectively saying that as well as fleets suffering from massive lag when jumping through gates they should risk encountering even more lag whenever anyone warps to a new location the whole thing suddenly becomes much more sensitive to the actions of the fc and a lot of bonuses would end up being recalculated twice once when a fleet member arrives on a new grid and again when the fc catches up
guess its time to bump this back to the top sure could use some support here folks
every year this is a hulkageddon and this year we saw more ships added to the kill list my question is will ccp draw a line at some point if hulkageddon goes too farwhile ill admit i dont like the idea of hulkageddon i tolerate it however i am concerned that it may at some point become too powerful i dont want a 3 month long hulkageddon as a matter of fact limiting it to 1 week would be nice or to at least have some ground rules imposed by ccp for player run events like this as it was this year i dont see a major problem but if it continues to grow unchecked it could result in carebears letting their subscription lapse during hulkageddon
not possibleat any time iyou can go to high sec and gank someone at anytime someone can gank me coming out of a station  for my cargo or for the kill  just like jita ccp has concord to take care of it  but other than that there is nothing ccp can do that is the game mechanicsfor ccp to impose even more rules to high sec  low sec  what you can do in the game would be silly
as long as there are to many goons in the csm you most likely wont see much happen to it something sad to see actually hulkageddon should be banned or at least have some rules attached so 10 and 09 systems for example are offlimit to hulkageddon
mmmmmhhmmmm sweet sweet tears this ladies and gents is the most concentrated form of energy and the fuel behind hulkageddon
if you really have a problem with hulkageddon i know an mmo thats much more suitable for your gaming type
you were aware of the rules and the type of game you to play prior to putting down cash to play this game righti mean who is stupid enough to play a game and try to change it with out really know wtf
first to cry youre qqing gratswhile im not sure how broadly you define such things for me crying has a higher standard of angryness behind it but if even the slightest dislike of anything is crying then yeah enjoy also enjoy this post as well as its a bit defensive in natureanyway yeah i dont like hulkageddon or ganking in general thats just my personal preference like how i dont like mushrooms on my pizza sure some people get really emotional about it some dont and some people pretend to be overly passionate about it in order to entertain themselves and others but youll never guess which one i am on subject i see that their is not really much ccp can do in this case ah well just my 2 cents
cockpit view well simply put this is not one of the things that i would be getting i rather would focus on the space stations first getting the whole station available for exploration is more a priority then the cockpit of a ship but it is however on my long term list but again after the stationsand please make it a little easier on everyone with your text next time a lot of text and all in a big wall as mentioned it could be handy to have a few breaks
cockpit damn i cant even see my ship most the time because im zoomed out so far theres simply too much going on around the ship to just use a cockpit viewthe only time i could see myself using this would be when traveling gatetogate in highsec
actually a good one skills are often done 4 times to get each race besides that it takes way to long to learn them all specially if you add in the fitting that will be required as wellso making 4 skills into 1 and then in some what shorter time periods then i mean the lvl 35 skills the rest is easy this should solve the problem however i fear ccp will refuse this since they want you to pay up for the game so giving you a lot of time needed for the skills insures them they will get payed more so unfortunately this good post has a bad side and may never be solved i hope i will get in csm6 then i will try my best to get at least something done in this
nope
lets not its a bad idea along with the rest of your postits good the way it is
ship damage and destruction well to show ship damage could be fun to see sure can use additional graphical features for the destruction well there are already some graphical features in this although you dont really see much of it thanks to the bright flash during the explosions i would however say that this should be added but with a switch to turn this on or off when wantedsince such graphical enhancements give extra lag you may want to turn this on only if you are sure your pc and connection can take it and most of all are not in the wrong place to view something like this
nolets get customizable paint schemes first
this  good idea blast wave that pushes ships away nondamagingly from large explosions such as structure destruction would be cool if lagtasticthis  terrible idea cheap 1 hit kills just because you rolled a 20 are dumb and theres already a coded critical hit mechanic for 300 damage called a wrecking shot this  bad idea there should be a mechanic for capturingboardingproper piracy but this is not it
dear ccp after a few mounths playing eve i have descoverd the joys our writeing in my own persinal bio but there is one problem its too small we need bios to allow us more text for more intresting and funny bios so people can get to know each outher more and spred funny jokes via the bio please ccp this would be much appreciated and i would love if a csm member brought this up
well it is a nice idea i sure would love to bring it up if i get in csm6 can always use good ideas like this
its set at the current size to stop people creating lag  apparently one of the things that has to be downloaded to the client before you load a grid is the full text of the bio of every pilot on that grid i wish i was joking but i cant support this idea as it stands and fixing this properly would probably involve a disproportionate amount of work
its ugly as  looks like a minmatar presenthow about some ports on the sides and maybe you know a smallstation feel to it
i can see why this topic was made the lp store is indeed rather pointless at this current moment items are to highly priced items you can get are rather useless compared to the regular versions and for some you need other items to get the lp store version so i am suggesting to change the values on the current items in the lp store and on top of that change what they need a little bit so they are more wanted besides that it might be interesting to get new items in including fittings and ships perhaps skillbooks that are only available in the lp store this should make it a lot more interesting to get those lp points and taking the time getting them
supporting my own proposal
1 make all the rats have omniresistsa this wouldnt be a smart idea to do as many already suggested2 make all the rats have omnidpsa this wouldnt be a smart idea to do as many already suggested3 make all the rats run away when losing if not warp scrambleddisrupteda already happening with belt rats although not all will4 make all the rats drop better loot and have higher bountiesa well sure sounds good but bounties can not be too high and drops can not be to valuable but there must be a slight change indeed5 make all the rat spawns smallera likely not happening if you like smaller rat spawns go to high 10 space no rats there 6 make all the rats switch targetsa having shieldarmor tanks would be pointless if they would switch targets but i think there is something that can be done about this to improve at least a little7 make all the rats use capacitor and let us neut them and turn off their modules if they run out of capa could be interesting although it would make them a lot weaker at the same time
npcs have been running away since forever this happens if you into a spawn and kill the smaller ships first escorts then the larger ships might warp out
if this is just going to apply to belt rats that should be simple enough and good changes as long as the spawn difficulty is in line with what can be accomplished now at approximately the same speed ie highsec rats should still be doable in a t1 fit t1 frig 00 rats in a solo battlecruiserif this is going to apply to missions and other pve every single mission and site will need to be reworked so completion time is roughly the same as it is now missions have been nerfed nonstop over the past couple years with every possible nerf except reducing bountiestime salvage value nerfed with additional rig sizes lp nerf with fw buffs meta 0 drop rate nerf mwds in deadspaces too easy probing mechanics etc reducing gamewide bounties due to longer completion times too difficult sites etc would have serious deleterious effects on the whole eve economy however bringing pve fits closer in line with pvp fits is good as long as income rates can remain relatively balanced
all of the above and maybe i want npc battleships launching one or two tech i or augmented drones now and again
1 make all the rats have omniresists i dont agree with this completely pvp ships often have resistance holes and so should npcs 2 make all the rats have omnidps pvp ships often do specific damage types so its logical npcs should follow along in similar style 3 make all the rats run away when losing if not warp scrambleddisrupted  too often npcs try to kite and use long range weapons so warp disrupting them isnt an option hence i dont agree with this for every ship 4 make all the rats drop better loot and have higher bounties only if they scramdisrupt and have higher resists and better ai 6 make all the rats switch targets i like this 7 make all the rats use capacitor and let us neut them and turn off their modules if they run out of cap perhaps i think you have an unrealistic goal of merging pve and pvp fits a pveer will still not be too quick to engage a new local as they often have backup and i think making all npcs tankingdpsing the same would hurt a lot of the diversity that makes eve kewl
the ultimate science fiction simulator lets have some science thenthis proposal is about a massive science and technology eve expansionempires throughout history have invented and adapted technology to gain advantage in eve all technology is commoditized everybody has access to the same modules rigs and ships there is no concept of design quality or innovationthis proposal seeks to introduce these 2 concepts in doing so we hope to seeplayers competing in a new ongoing technology race to discover new superweapons efficient powercores faster ships fewer drawbacks better bonuses new abilitiesskulduggery in spying and stealing these advances to merge with your own or to sell onlicensing massproduction and hitting the market with these unique selling points or hoarding for your own allianceeventual commoditization open for allside effects wed also hope to seereduction of 001isk trading people can making buying decisions on specifications as well as priceentire new tree of advanced science skillsthis proposal is not designed to replace t1 t2 and t3 modules as with all older technologies they become commoditized and t13 is no exception these new items are an addition that were going to call innovateitems here but perhaps this could also be an idea for what t4 would beit should be pointed out that this will not create an explosion of new advanced items for each success that produces something desirable there will be dozens of failures and unremarkable products compounding this the superproduct might not be reproduceablehow best to implement it i dont know i suspect it will take a lot of thinking by clever game designers but heres a few of my thoughtsthe output of innovation will be blueprints they will be produced through an inventionlike process where you put all your items in the cooker wait a few hoursdaysweeks and see what you get out the difference is there will be a lot more input items to achieve something really good cannot be achieved by trying massinnovating with the same inputs over and over againthe buildable items will have different attribute values to their t1t2 counterpartsmuch of the time its a zerosum game for example an innovated tracking enhancer might have a difference 1 on its falloff and 1 on its tracking attributes zero sum items are generally reproduceable that is you get a bporeally good items are ones that give an aggregate attribute boost in the attributes but are very rarely reproduceable that is you get a bpcthe innovation process can use t1t2t3 modules or previously innovateditems as a base that is innovateditems can be reinnovated uponpartial ideas can be used to improve the chances of success also for example a spy has stolen papers from an alliance but the data is incomplete without other understanding from the alliance scientists or perhaps a whisper of some kind of new stealth technology appeared on the eve internet equivalent with a few vague specifics in it that gets scientists minds whirring
continued 22this leads me to datacores and decryptors an equivalent for innovation not necessarily called datacores and decryptors could feed into the process there would be many hundreds of different kinds that represent ideas and understandings these could perhaps be the partial ideas that can be stolenboughtsold success cannot be relied on collecting zillions of these thoughhybrid units could also be created by using two different modules as a base combining or mixing the resultant attributesevery now and again ccp will seed entirely new capabilities into the game which can be discovered by players theyd do this by adding new ideas datacores this would create a more natural playerrun science newtechnologies ecosystem
i cannot support your idea because it would be game breakingwhat if i had a blueprint to a webifier t1 lets say that i took ideas from an energy nuet blueprint and a scrambler blueprint along with ideas that reduce cpu and capacitor use and an idea that increases range would i then have the ultimate tackling devicewhat if i had a strip miner blueprint and i added ideas that halved the cycle time and doubled the yeild would i then be able to stick three of them on a hulk which i similarly modified and be able to satisfy mineral demand for the entire regionwhat if i had a slasher blueprint which i made a stiletto blueprint from could i then modify the signature radius on the stiletto to 0 which would make the ship invulnerableif anyone could add any attributes they wanted to any module that would result in at least a couple modules entering the game which have such a huge unfair advantage that nobody else could compete what would you think if the 0 sig rad stiletto used the superweb to point drain your cap and stop your ship how about if the incredible hulk sucked dry three solar systems worth of belts in six hours and put them on the market for prices too low for you to competethe idea is great but you probably should have made a post in features and ideas so that we could knock the hard edges off your proposal so people could have an easier time swallowing it here i would like some kind of modlue variation beyyond meta levels but i dont think that this is the solution
i sure dont want to do that the first thing goons will do is probe and steal from your wrecks which on turn causes aggro and loss of your ship even if you didnt do anything anyways this will be a very bad thing for the capsuleers that just start out any 10 space mission will be a death trap in no time making it nearly impossible to do anything without having some goon swarming around you like a fly to sh
eve is in part about risk versus rewardwhat is the risk in engaging a pve ship already in combat with a specific pvp ship the only risk now is that you might lose a bit of time probing for someone the risk that person has is in part because of the fitting choices needed no drones cant fight angels vulnerable to neuting shield mods often increase sig lose a few mods and in part the travel where you can gank to your hearts delightthis counters 1 mod the risk of adding that mod is not in relation to the reward gained by iti also fly unprobable ships sometimes but they are not t3 it is possible though the fitting is very harsh then
its good for goons indeed pointless for people that do not gank others so i say no go unless the only one able to salvage a body is the owner living clone of the body then it could be something interesting to have
could be nice some walking interactions when in space not the way you say but maybe someone

reading through the list of candidates for csm6 i was surprised to see a large number of people who are well jerks im not slandering their names or telling you not to vote for them i just want to make sure potential voters know who theyre backing so in order of importance i present to youmanalapan mastermind behind the dynasty bank scam thats right he lied to people and stole something like 500 billion from investors right into his own pocket scamming is a part of eve and i vehemently oppose any effort to control or make scamming illegalbut still is this the kind of person you want to elect to a leadership positionarden elenduil prominent member of ninjas he doesnt even try to hide the fact that he griefs carebears in hisec for fun once again valid gameplay but any player who griefs others players for the sole sake of sadistic pleasure is someone im hesitant to electprometheus exenthal first let me say this guy is very skilled i have nothing but respect for his abilities imo hes one of the most talented solo pvp pilots in the game his videos are also pretty badass this said hes kinda a douche ive run into him a few times in game if he kills you he gloats if you kill him he calls you a bunch of noobsblobbersetcany member of the goons dont think i need to say much here goons pretty much pride themselves for trying to break the game for everyone else and are pretty much the most untrustworthy bunch in the gamebefore a flame war starts let me reiterate one more time all of these people have had significant accomplishments in game and are all talented in their own ways im not trying to question that or take that away from them i only want to bring to light certain personality characteristics most people may not know about if you still feel like they are the best candidate to represent your needs by all means vote for themaerilis posting with alt because main account is inactive
i had no idea who manalapan was but now that i do thats pretty chill hi5 duder
im guessing itll never be an issue but if you ever do come into 00 when you dont die to an aoe doomsday or find yourself paying rent to an alliance almost blatantly bankrolled and supported by corrupt gms and developers you can reflect upon this statementk bye
so what youre saying is that he plays eve
strange am surprised you didnt i knew about it was pretty big and i think made it on ic news as well as forumsanyway one thing is to scam on a personal level but scamming a lot of people who trusted a bank kinda sad i am trying to start a plex bank once i have enough isk and maybe get chribba and other rich guys onboard but getting people to trust in that since that scam is tough 
you said gms and developers thats plural care to drop some namesalso why are you letting a dead alliance still own you like this
the only reply needed
protipp avoiding the use of pubbies to refer to anyone not in sagoons at least in public will probably aid your cause no end as a bonus itll make you look a little less like scientology members
vote vile rat for csm i will be a jerk for your interests
hey if we were like scientology wed be chargingtojoinuh nmseriously though pick a a stance and stick with it these guys have accomplished a lot in game and they like to destroy other peoples shipsperfectly valid part of the game and not that theres anything wrong with that but theyre really terrible human beings because of it and should be shunned for an out of game thing because of itis this hello kitty online or eve do the people running have a good understanding of game mechanics or not their chosen playstyle may be a way they blow off steam or their way of thinking outside the box to castigate us for it and make the accusation that goon csm reps of which there have already been several over the existence of the csm would destroy the game is remarkably shortsighted and frankly demeaning to your own position
ive ranted a lot about mittans campaign trying to bring down trebor for no real reason that i can really see it kind of pi55ed me off because of the hard work that trebor put into the csm last time aroundthat said i dont really think mittens vile or helen will ruin the game at the very worst theyll just mess up the coming csm and itll be back to basics in csm7 in reality theyll probably try to make sure that the goons part of the game stays the way it is the jump bridge drama and at best theyll push for a supercap nerf there isnt much else they could push through because even though various people have hinted at trying to extort or blackmail ccp devs into doing things their way too much of that leads straight to rl legal trouble and permabans which im pretty sure mittens and co will avoid if they can also given they way mittens shc campaign fell on its arse when exposed after which he decided to try to play the openly ebil malishus card i dont think he has the real life capability of doing thatthe only tools that work with ccp are the professional approach ie slogging through the details of features processes and various items and as a last resort player rage like last summer but even the latter would become blunted if used too often as players and ccp would become immune to ittldr the world will not end if mittens and co get into the csm as theyll end up having to work with the others or become part of the lolfreetrip crowd that no one really takes any notice ofas to the pubbies bit and paying for sa it obviously gives members of sa a community feeling but itll never improve the goons public appeal in eve dropping the use of that term in public at least will only help you
and another touchy subject for the goons i see goons just need to see that their time has come and get out while they still can more and more will vote for those that are not corrupted fools or goon people want results and not loud mouth talk with a gun up their rear ends threatening otherspeople want to play the game without being buggered all the time just so that goons can have some fun goons are just heartless sobs that have nothing better to do it seems then to pester people that do want to play nicelyand even on the forums again its the goons that swarm around like there is no tomorrow just again to make sure their egos are present and people know they are around if you think about it it really sounds like the goons have some personal issues that they blame others for
eve is pvpbe it market shooting or political trying to pretend otherwise is to be remarkably deludedin short deal with it
having read your post and looked at your stats on the goonfleet killboard i sure hope youre good at markets
oh no my kd ratio ohdearactually now that i look at it my kd ratio is pretty damned good when i actually play so im not sure i get what youre trying to say here
i was on new eden radio this weekend for those that missed it live you can download the show at
lost in eve posted the debate you can find it at
so if things go the way the polls suggest then the nc  goon  tapi partnership have already got 6 of the csm seats secured that means at least 23rds of the council will be run by a selfserving clique of players with a single political goalthe majority of the votes have already been cast and the tactical voting manipulated by mittens and his cronies will be hard to stop but its not too late to make a differenceplease visit your user settings to reenable imageslets stop these buggers stitching up the game for the rest of us and making it even duller than it already is shall we vote windy for the win

its a shame people refuse to unite against the goons all nongoons together and we will make a difference but nothing is lost just yet even if we only get the last 3 seats we sure will be a menace for them they simply can not keep ignoring people that do not wish the goons around
hi white tree can i ask why you have recently changed your forum settings so that it no longer shows that youre a member of tapi why are you trying to conceal this during the csm elections
yeah what he saidmubarak outwindypops indypops
i didnt change it at all it always was that way i actually couldnt figure out how to get it to show it shows in some forums but not others no sure why downs its not like im hiding it am iyou know what with my name being plastered everywhere still doesnt mean he didnt say italso dont pull me on directly calling out another csm candidate when gw is doing the exact same thing
my latest blog from my website feel free to comment thereabout 150 years ago in france a political philosopher called alexis de tocqueville muttered darkly that in every democracy the people get the government that they deserve well he presumably said it in french but actually that grumpy old cheeseeating surrender monkey was right the governments we elect are a very accurate reflection of what we ourselves representok so the csms not a government but it is the elected representative body of the universe of eve players as things stand with only a few days to go it looks certain that the ncgoon block will succeed with their mission to seize control of your csm early polls and surveys suggest that they will certainly secure 6 out of the 9 seats through a combination of block and tactical voting thats 23rds of all seats the reality is that theyll take more and do you know what it probably is the government we deserve it seems likely that the csm will now become a simple parallel of whats happened politically within eve were always told that eve is a sandbox true but if someone takes a great big  in a sandbox then all the sand sticks to it and thats the way were headedif we allow the csm to become a mirror for the political stagnation of the game itself then heres what we can expect1pitiful lack of political diversity they talk together constantly in game plan operations together and share a single political and economic vision for our game while 6 or more of them will sit there smugly at the csm table theyll bring with them just one agenda theyll carry a majority without independent candidates voices even being heard motion passed back slaps all round lets go to the pub2dearth of genuine debate and disagreement but its not just that the agenda of the csm will become massively skewed towards one alliances interests sure  mittens hopes that by bringing 9 people with the same view of the game to the table will put the csm in a stronger more combative position to negotiate with ccp but it will also mean the death of any meaningful debate discussion and disagreement between csm members well lose the richness finesse and careful consideration that comes from having multiple voices heard at the table3 huge increase in the potential for exploitation whats particularly sinister and calculating about the nc  goon takeover is that the candidates put forward have been from alliance leadership this has several consequences firstly it means that we will be represented by people who are already spending huge amounts of their game time organising their own members with less time to focus on the csm more worrying though is what it means for the nda non disclosure agreement that members of the csm have to sign to ensure they dont gain ingame advantage from their privileged access to information however the nc  goon alliance leaders from the csm can freely plan and plot to make sure their alliances are perfectly placed to benefit from coming game changes without even breaking the nda 4 a big two fingers message for the wider playerbase a homogeneous csm made up almost entirely of carboncopy 00 alliance leaders sends a very clear message to the eve universe you dont matter its bad enough that the blob mentality has largely destroyed dynamic fast paced pvp in eve youve not got to blob the csm to get your voice heard whilst 00 alliances may thing theyre the beallandendall of eve the simple fact is that theyre not theres as much excitement intrigue innovation and colour taking place throughout low sec and empire its a huge world out there  with thousands and thousands of mercenaries traders industrialists going about their business every day sadly though their voice will not be heard

theres simply so much fail there that im not sure where to begin but ah well lets start with the obvious shall we en24 doesnt support pl en24 doesnt support anybody theyve actually got an editorial policy very similar to the tribunes in that as long as things are factually valid theyll let lots of different folks submit their opinions and points of view you can read riverinis thoughts on the matter hereof course theres an ad that went up for certain candidates those candidates bought ad space thats how ad space works they sell it to people
goons should not vote dont listen to them either they just want the game to be messed up for you and mess up so badly till the goons are the only ones left problem with their way of thinking if you can call it that is that when too many people leave ccp will shut down the game and so also for the goons so not so sure if the goons can be called intelligent life so to say
you sound madbro
as a hatter hesheit just posted in killer gandrys waaaaaaaah thread that goons threatening your corpalliance is grounds for legal action i cant tell if its a bit of falseflag trolling or if the claim really is that shooting your pos is blackmail but whichever way it is im amused
as i already was saying goons try anything false flagging i did not nor did i troll or did anything that is bad i only said what the truth is i cant help it that you jump to the ceilling as soon as someone actually dares to say something against you as goon
the mittani let finnagain zero into his campaign thread this be amusing to see this thread go to  fast as finnagain argues with everyone no matter what including himselfpopcorn
if mittens can grief you right out of your mind to the point where you think that razor alliance is a goon corp i think he deserves more votes
kumi isnt just a crazyposter hes running for csm because according to his platform he has aspergers and this allegedly gives him some sort of genius level iq which we should be respecting or somesuch idki guess that makes him eveos version of cwc
eh only half points then driving someone out of their mind isnt as impressive when its a very short trip the goon campaign for csm seats this year does deserve some extra points though since simply existing seems to drive some folks into paroxysms of nerdspew for a while now ive thought that the nc was king of the makingyouloseyourbysimplyexisting game but that may not be the case anymore sad day
wow nice friends you have there mittens finnagain i have been a reader of eve tribune over the years i was really pleased to see you making a come back over recent weeks however if this is the level of your journalism and political comment then im sticking with en24 from now on
this thread is not journalism or political commentary its a thread on eveo not an article on the tribunes site im writing as an independent human being and pointing out that i enjoy seeing people lose their everloving minds because the nc or goons simply exist
diving to new depths by making fun of people with disabilities mittens
ive never bothered with this crap before but youre getting my vote the blind fury you clearly inspire in all these important internet commentators is the best recommendation you could have
nope here in goonswarm we have always mocked spergs not a new depth at allsince you do little but incoherently rage out badposts i will point out that in the latest dsm aspergers literally no longer exists anyone claiming to be a self diagnosed aspergers is a merely a socially awkward nerd looking for a medical excuse for being pathetic which is something that deserves even more scorn
its ok ill be nice
you guys got a thing about making fun of people based on things over which they have no control what a bag of s as usual your reprehensible thoughtless remarks are based on lies distortion or just being a lazy  who doesnt bother to check his facts for your information dumbass aspergers was not removed from dsm it is now combined with other disorders in a broad category called autistic spectrum disorder go look it up there is probably a disorder in the dsm that applies to you
narcissistic personality disorder naturallyclaims of aspergers are often used to excuse and garner sympathy for a persons personality defects im not a socially maladjusted jerk i have aspergers i feel that this belittles a serious condition and that those who do so are thoroughly reprehensible considering that a mere 0206 of the population are estimated to have aspergers  and those figures are likely higher than it should be given the popularity of the condition ala attention deficit disorder  it is highly likely that the majority of i have aspergers claims are false statistically in the highly unlikely event every person on the planet with aspergers had access to the internet they would only account for approximately 16 of the regular internet usersman i love statistics
honestly if any condition was going to give you an advantage on the csm itd probably be crohns disease
u got my voice mistiks
thank youand is it monday already
hee thanks i think and yeah if i turn out to be a ty delegate despite mynxees endorsement i think i can guarantee that mynxee will fly to california and kick my ass i was asked by evenews24 for a response to the rmt expose they did on iskbank last week i blogged about this last week but heres the sound bite version i gave en24the anonymous nature of the receipt of this data makes the chain of evidence a little tricky for ccp and doubtless a ton of the affected toons were just isk transfer mules now on inactive accounts still i hope ccp digs into the transaction logs follows the money to the affected toons and reduces a lot of them to negative isk balances that to me is a more fitting and harsher punishment than temporary or permanent bans whether they take the time to do this or even tells anyone theyve done it will be interesting to seeseleene was smart enough to just point to his blog post i should have done the same in other news i am one of two candidates that received the endorsement of the guys behind the evecommune podcast thanks guys this podcast also features a fantastic interview with ccp xhagen so i recommend everyone go out and have a listen to it
lol i dont think we have to worry about that but just in case ill pencil it in on my april 2012 calendar
i vote ripard and so should youregardsmiss missy understandings
i voted for you i think ccp should continue to work on refining or improving features they release not just release a 10 version of something and then move on to the next marketing topic
please dont mock my dyslexiawhat a weak response i hope  will be interesting  damnit i want mynxee back already mynxee for head of ccp iayou say that like its a good thing i havent heard that much pointless snickering since i used to watch beavis  butthead i dont mind podcasts by people who are clueless about eve i love lost in eve but when theyre aggressively wrong and critical about things about which they know nothing  i turned it off halfway through
there was another one before that in reaction to the jump bridge nerf summit report where gs had a calltoarms for major 00 alliances to take over the csm iirc we already know they got involved partly in order to maintain the status quo despite it being obvious to anyone living out there that force projection is one of the main causes of the stagnant nature of large parts of 00
after reading the entire threads of many other canidates and never befor voting having 4 chairs over the yearsyou have my vote trebor just remember us small fry when you get theregalantriaceo pegasus mining korp
ill reply to some of the pending questions later today i have to head down into the anime mines this morning but i just wanted to post a quick headsupthe csm just published a devblog to help explain what the csm is really all about and what it has achieved i think youll find it interesting reading
bumping to say that we want the real life photo of treb and seleeneplease visit your user settings to reenable images
yesterday i was a guest on a marathon 4hour csm election program hosted by dj drizzcat of new eden radio many candidates showed up and each was asked the same set of questions  the recording of the entire show is now onlinethe final question was interesting  if you could change one thing about eve or ccp what would it bemy answer was pretty much what youd expect from me more resources devoted to improving and rewriting the eve ui since thats something that is of immediately benefit to everyoneso far pretty straightforwardlast up was the mittani who dropped in at the last moment when asked what one thing hed want the mittani did not hesitate  a usermoddable uifinally something the mittani and i can agree onfor you see back when i ran for csm 5 the two things i said eve needed were a renewed war on lag and a usermoddable ui i said so in great detail my csm 5 manifestoso i guess the mittanis position is that i am an idiot and all of my ideas are dangerous except for the one that the mittani thinks is the best thing that could happen to eveit gets better in my csm 5 campaign thread i caught a fair amount of flak for my ui proposal and how impractical it was however id thought through some of the technical and metagame issues and was able to give good answers to some fairly hard questionsso if the mittani gets attacked for this dangerous and idiotic idea he can save himself some time and get the answers from my thread of 10 months agobut wait theres more the other thing hed like to change is ccps dysfunctional internal communications and he gave a wonderful example of a case where a ccp dev discovered a way to make his part of the code much more efficient but didnt even think to let other people at the company know about it so they could use it in their own codewhat he forgot to mention is that he got that example directly from mynxee csm5 chair in an msn conversation  the same mynxee who was labeled by the goon csm alternate helen highwater as a dribbling rdso there you have it the mittani gets his biggest ideas from dangerous idiots and dribbling rds
excellent comeback there treb i think youll have to wait a while until mittens can consult with his advisers on what course of action to take will it be to grab the bull by the horns and admit that his apparent claim is mostly just a front to block any change that might hurt him and his vacuous followers or that he doesnt care anyway because his ponies are shinier than your ponies or will he deny all with a chorus of goons echoing no u enquiring minds want to know
my personal thoughts on that are that he took some items from previous csms which might likely get more looked at with incarna on the risethen just hope that during csm one of those points actually gets worked on by ccp and start chestbeating how he made it possibletypical lawyer trick
the ui thing was never the issue csm ideas like lets make titan doomsdays pingpong the dominion sov changes sound like a great idea and remove jump bridges are why weve become unhappy with the csm both show that people who have no idea how life in nullsec works are trying to make decisions about how nullsec should benow this idiocy about how we want to use the csm to buff our alliance the value of technetium and the power of supercaps are two severe imbalances in the game that favor our alliance while hurting the rest of nullsec we want both of them fixed which should tell you where our priorities lie can anyone present a reasonable counterarguement to this saying you dont trust us is one thing but this is us flat out stating we want to give up two of our biggest advantages to bring more life and balance to nullsec topics like fixing the ui and lag are things everyone can agree on but when it comes to nullsec balance i dont think you have a sufficient understanding
consider the facts nine of the remaining twelve csm5 members vuk korvin mazz sokratesz teadaze trebor helen highwater alpha12125 and elvenlord are null sec players most if not all in sovholding alliances seven of those peopleincluding helen highwaterattended the december summit where the fabled destroy null sec discussion occurred even discounting the dangerous idiot as helen has so charmingly described trebor null sec was more than adequately represented by informed players in the december meetings did all those peopleincluding your own representativereally fail to speak out against these bad ideas that youre so worried about all this drama sounds like spin to me especially having listened to the recordings from those sessions
i met the player of helen highwater once or twice at the uk live roleplaying event the gathering and suffice to say he really shouldnt be labelling anyone else a dribbling idioti mean i love eccentric people as a rule and liveroleplayers are pretty amusing but helen was in the category of players i dont much appreciate exploiting the volunteer program to gain extra spells for his npc colour mage that i always considered ruined large scale fest events with its essential tendency towards corruption and cronyism no doubt if helen had been running for csm back before the huge bpo scandals hed have expected some extra skillpoints for his main as a reward for time served and fair rewardim glad that ccp closed those loopholes and drew a line under earlier scandals but i do think its a little rich for a player like helen with a history of corrupt behavior in massively offline liveroleplay fest systems to run for election without fully disclosing his previous experiences of being a played npc for the lorien trust
my understanding is that my representative did speak out against it i cant see vuk lau having supported it either the devblog had a narrative that they wanted to remove jump bridges and so of course they quoted the candidates that spoke out for it as for the rest of the nullsec players if any of them did agree with the idea that jump bridges need to be removed then im against them regardless of what part of space theyre from i was in nullsec before jump bridges were introduced and logistics were a nightmare in those days also bear in mind that back then much higher levels of compression were possible and people had more incentives to mine in 00 even if it was still boring as all hell logistics are bad enough as is we dont need to make a critical but unfun part of the game even worsethe idea that it will reduce empire size and force projection is just as silly if you look at the prejump bridge maps youll see many multiple region alliances covering the map many of whom were in coalitions if any nullsec players support the removal of jump bridges as a way of fixing these problems with the game then they dont understand the game
just a quick note that ive updated the third post in this thread so it contains an index to trebors top 13 posts in the threadas this thread is getting really huge i thought it might be helpfulmore replies tonight as time permits
by devblog i assume you mean the minutes from the december summit as an aside drafting of the minutes was a task shared by ccp and some members of the csm well just trebor and myself to be quite frank i worked from a recording to complete the section on core trebor drafted the section on the null sec sessions and shared it for csm and ccp comment and feedback over the course of a week only one person who was at the summit asked for a change which was minor and unrelated to the controversial topics and this person was not helen highwater who provided no input whatsoever he did offer to do a style pass but failed to follow up on thatvuk and elvenlord were not pleased with the draft but since they werent at the summit they could hardly suggest content changes however i note that there is no evidence that they took any initiative to encourage null sec players who did attend to refute the draft and demand that its scope or accuracy be changed if there were questions about that
counterpoint youre jade constantine
countercounterpoint takes one to know one
long exposure to jade constantine has inoculated me against him
while i dont think you can make a case that the latest changes to the game are mainly aimed at pvpetc heck incursion was pve  though not industrial  and theres been lots of little ui tweaks that benefit eveyone not to mention the contracts improvements on a personal level i agree with you i like industrial stuff and i even managed to have fun running a manufacturingresearch pos so id like to see that aspect of the game get more lovebut as ive pointed out what i personally want cannot be allowed to affect my decisions as a csm so when i run into a potential conflict like this i need to make extra sure im not fooling myselfthus i need good metrics to make the case to ccp that putting effort into this area of the game will make them money  either by attracting new players or retaining existing onesif you look at the november crowdsourcing youll see several industryrelated items did well notably whatever happened to the industry expansion at 20 with 1318 support and when related items were grouped pos mechanics came in at 4 with 2975which means there is a reasonable amount of support so i can in good conscience advocate that improvements to industry should be consideredthat said the fact is that for some of the devs improving the gritty infrastructure of the universe will not be high on their list of things to do because it isnt awesomebut one thing i try to remind them is that the players dont exist to provide them with chances to be awesome they exist to serve the players who fund their paychecks awesome isnt a reason for doing things its the emergent result of hard thinking hard choices and a ton of hard work
votes for seleene given
after very careful consideration of all candidatesi think you seleene are the best choice to represent the player base2 x votes good luck
as long as you also continuously harass ccp about the stupidity of the gun imbalance you will always have my votes
yes they attempted has you say but thats alland in what it concerns me i cant ever vote for someone representing a bunch of pubbies insulting and having racist comments on peoples threadsits my opinion and im not expecting you to like itseleene or rip are responsable and respectable adults and actanswer likeyoure free to like lolilozboulz coments in pink ink its your problem but for the greater good of the whole comunity they bring absolutly nothing to the table and really expect they will never get a single seat ho yes they bring a lot of pubbie comments support great
just bumping to say that i voted for seleene partly because he managed to sit next to team awesome in a discussion and keep a straight face although i only discovered this after having voted d 
what was this doing at the bottom of the pagealso if you dont give a vote to seleene for his banner campaign alone youre daft
ive read this thread and appreciate your answeri know little about 00 warfare but the history of it interests me and i like your approach in dealing with previous incarnations of eve and perhaps improving them in particular i look on with interest regarding your past experience there and i feel that is likely to be highly effectiveso my votes  you have them good luck
i heard the same lol free bump d keep the good work up dude
signature fail
while i certainly appreciate you continuing to bump this thread the idea that we had some sort of quid pro quo going on or that we werent independent in our decision making is odd and all of it seems to be based on your getting upset at the fact that some folks paid for ad space on a website that sells ad space ah well
your exclusion of the general is inexcusable that was some awesome comic potential right there
i just find it sad that prom whom most of the solo and small gang players approve of gets no airtime in these big epeen waving contests
you have statistics to back this claim up yes perhaps you could post them
disappointed with finnagain for the first time p
wow look at this supposedly neutral finnagain charging round sucking up to mittens and launching desperate attacks against any antimitty candididates one less eve tribune reader here pretty pathetic mate
sorry the decisions werent just up to me youre more than welcome to get in touch with our staffers about an interview however if you like to show why our editorial staff was wrong not to put your name forward as an endorsementive never claimed to be neutral thatd be ed in fact ive gone on record as pointing out that every person will have their own biases and value judgements and accusations of bias are banal im not banned from posting as a poster and obviously the tribunes act of endorsing candidates wasnt neutral since we took a stand on the issue but the tribune is neutral in the sense that none of them compelled or coerced us and our endorsements could very well vary significantly come next election cycle yeah that never happened on either point i personally support mittens campaign but my votes didnt go to him and making fun of the tardrage directed at mittens is hardly sucking up im not sure what you even think i could possibly gain from obsequious behavior as for claiming that ive launched desperate attacks hah against any antimitty candidates ill assume that youre just making that up because well youre just making that up i have enjoyed posting in some of the funnier sperg threads of course i admit it i have a strange fascination with palatr type threads and cant help myself ah well
thank you for your endorsement 
bumping to remind folks there is a candidate that with a focus on mining industry small corporations and solo pve pilots in eveand thanks to all the folks that eve mailed me your supportissler
a vote for darius is a vote for liberty and justice
i am going to vote for you  mainly due to your representation of the rp element of the game but also because of an overall well balanced representation however i think you are wrong to disregard the potential for atmosphere generated by a better more detailed environment particularly on rp gameplay i for one second the moonshiner  lets have more tangible and physical hazzard and beauty reality is in the detail
thank you for all the support and votes keep em coming
for the lack of questions i will be posting some stufflike this endorsement from eve tribunethere is also kugus endorsementkinda surprises me when i saw eve tribune endorsement not because of what heshe said which was very much on point but that i actually never heard of that site before things like that makes me glad that i ran for csm this year as i have met more people from different circles who not only just as passionate about this game as i am but also similar views as to how should the game change to make it more fun 
another podcast is uplink here
thanks for the warp disruptor field generatorsfrom your very important issue on corporation taxestaxing sales orders would screw people who play the market since theyd suddenly find themselves selling at a profit yet making a loss more importanly sales happen in the future so a player wouldnt know what the rate of tax would be when the item actually soldsecondly why would you want to give corps a tool to pressure their members to rat instead of mission running that seems to run contrary to the whole sandbox idea
ive read the thread and like your game philosophy as well as your philosophy as a representative of the players you have my four votes
for those of you werent there manalapan along with several other csm candidates were interviewed on new eden radio today you can listen to it here
ya that is a risk and would probably be a concern with the corporation more than a problem with the ability to tax salesthis would actually go along completely with the sandbox idea because then a corporation can tax whatever they want and not just mission and rat bounties the idea is to give them ability to tax these things it is not required to have these new taxes set above 0 but the option should be thereyou can download a csm delegate interviews and q  a that was on new eden radio here
just completed the drawing and congratulations31411 winternight depression  won 50x 425mm railgun ii  chribba dice roll
i hereby announce my support for manalapan
i cannot believe i missed your scam and didnt get you into my thieves of eve link for posterity can you give me some links to where you admit to the specifics of what you did below is what i have so far thanks manalapan proof services i provide alliance creation U25CF caldari standings U25CF thieves of eve U25CF my links U25CF pos setupswhat makes me tick
i endorse this candidate
i encourage everyone to read this thread as i am labelled as a mastermind i am quite proud to have my intelligence complemented so muchthread
free stuff sure ill vote for you
heres the podcast of debate 4 hosted by lost in evenet where i was one of the four guests
so you want my vote and everyone else to vote for you how will you make my experience in eve a better one my name explains what i do and from what i have read and heard about you you pick on players like me due to a lack of experience this isnt trolling simply me wondering how me voting for you will benefit me in the long year ahead ive seen you in action in sivala ive also talked to a few of the people who didnt know that if you move something in a can that doesnt belong to you you get an aggression timer so you shouldnt be held accountable for your actions at the least convince me right now i dont believe anyone should vote for you i dont live in 00 you dont either why change something you arent a part of your alt lives in 00low sec not your main i have yet to see your campaign list only one topic from it that has no relevance to me or my style of playing eve please elaborate more so about your topics also blowing up your own corps industrial ship with courier packages labeled as 30 day pilots license seems a bit out there if you ask me why should you a person who robs people in high sec by using game mechanics that are more so broken be voted into csm 6
this racest dbag shouldent be allowed to oversee a macro horde let alone real people this guy is in love with poss if you want to shoot poss the rest of your 00 lives hes all for it i couldent get him out of corp fast enoughbarqs
thats because the concept keeps changing back when incarna was announced when it was called walking in stations and before it was called ambulationor was it the other way around we didnt have to worry about a lot of stuff for example the nvidia apex clothing and so on back when incarna was announced 5 years ago apex didnt exist there was also no mention of a new character creator if i remember correctly etc etcwhat started out as youll be able to walk around the place in a year or two turned into 5 years of waiting at the end of which all you get is a character creator and 6 months later captains quarters  a single room where you can walk around hopefully if 5 years ago ccp said 5 years from now youll get a new char creator and a tiny room to walk around in do you really think people would have been supportive back then i highly doubt it back then people were shown what was essentially a pipe dream that weve yet to see materializepersonally im hoping ccp can flesh out incarna within this year not just qc but stations etc if they manage it fine and dandy but if its going to take any longer with other features obviously broken or neglected im not sure the payoff will be worth it if there is a payoff at all there are no guarantees in this business
mazz youre ignoring the part where ccp itself is divided on incarna you know very well that its only the socalled team awesome noah ward and co that is ignoring the csm the rest of ccp seem to have had no problem with csm and most seem to have behaved very professionallyit is your opinion that cuddling up to noah and co will somehow change things but it certainly isnt anyone elses for those who are interested this is what an interview with that part of ccp looks likeso no i dont think its supadum
for those of you who are unaware of aspergers mechanics it is a highfunctioning form of autism ie autism unaccompanied by mental ation individuals with aspergers fall within the normal human ranges for intelligence while it is certainly possible for an invidual with aspergers to have geniuslevel intellect it is no more or less likely than it is in the general populace therefore it is highly inappropriate for kumi to attempt to link the two together in the manner quoted above also since it is fair to assume that an individual with aspergers who also happened to possess a geniuslevel intellect would know that the quoted statement is demonstrably false i can only conclude that kumi is not a genius is not afflicted with aspergers or that both conditions are true
the most interesting thing about this thread is most likely the number of goons attracted to it and their uh fixation on aspergers syndrome
we also go after furries and scientologists with a ing fury
god forbid that a furry scientologist with aspergers ever run for csm
not sure where you read that i claim to be a genius but even your explanation about autism is so far wrong by all that tried to explain it i guess none even tried to find out about it on google anyways the specialists that diagnosed me with aspergers also did a iq test they only could set a minimum due to things i prefer not to tell private my minimum 9according to these specialists is 145 they suspect a lot higheraspys can not communicate as others can hard time trying to explain things as clearly is shown in this topic alone but so far i see i do a better job then any goon trying to bully me and so many others anyways back to what is the topic about no need to pay attention to people who grief others
obsession is everything mate
i think we may be missing the forest for the trees here if we concentrate on this candidates asperger syndrome as oppose to what this person can do as a csm i like her platform and thus voted for this person
i specifically quoted where you said i have asperger syndrome and with that a high iq you didnt not say i have aspergers and coincidentally a high iq you specifically linked them also bravo on the false modesty wherein you ostensibly claim not to have referred to yourself as a genius and then promptly claim that you have an iq that would put you in the top 2 of the population it is only fair to note that the definition of genius is open to wide interpretation and that my usage of the term here is somewhat impreciseas for the rest of my statement i should clarify that the common misconception that aspergers sufferers possess higher than average intelligence usually held among those who claim to have aspergers came from the theories of dr hans asperger however not dr asperger failed to provide any iq scores to support his claim some psycholgists maintain that individuals with aspergers are of average or higherthan average intelligence however this is usually a false assumption since individuals with an iq 70 lowfunctioning autistics are typically excluded from the statistics as individuals with iqs below that level are excluded from the diagnosis if one includes individuals of all intelligence levels who exhibit the symptoms of aspergers in their statistical analysis the curve has a strong correlation to the average populationi do not say this to smear you or to make you look bad although i will admit a certain bias against individuals who proclaim that they have a condition that excessively complicates social interaction while engaging in social dialogue aspergers is estimated to afflict 0206 of the population and every person who falsely claims to suffer from it to excuse their own social awkwardness a notuncommon quality among online gamers detracts from the seriousness of the conditionanyway i guess my point is that i dont think that you have aspergers and i also dont think youre as intelligent as you claim i will admit that i have a limited data set to support this belief but i have seen encountered enough people who made similar claims to have a fair basis for comparison
well the candidate shouldnt have listed being a selfdiagnosed aspie as a qualification theni mean im morbidly obese so i like to sit around a lot and think about internet spaceships would be silly to list as a reason to vote for the person no
mittensits pretty ty of you to try to make any medical conditions of the csm candidates an issue here by all means attack them on policy but its pretty ing pathetic to be so blatantly offensiveyou already have the vote sewn up at least have the maturity and decency to give others a voice without belittling and mockingwindy
thank you for seeing the point of the topic and the vote again you trying to troll if you try that again i will report you i simply do not wish to have someone troll this topicthank you
i dont think you really know what it is to troll though i suppose its possible that you could be trolled by reasonable arguments stated in a neutral tone i do however have a question  and feel free to report me for asking itwhy did you even mention aspergers in your csm platform what possible benefit did you hope to gain from mentioning it i would understand if you had said something along the lines of i have aspergers and doing this is one way for me to push myself outside my normal social routines and grow as a person i would have even respected your willingness to overcome adversity but you didnt do that you intentionally linked it to a claim of intelligence in short you worked to make it a selling point for your candidacy i will grant that it shouldnt be a hindrance to a candidates chances aside from the inherent difficulties associated with the condition but i cant imagine how it would be a benefit so please explain your reasoning
perhaps because he was providing the electorate with relevant and useful information that will help them to make a decision and which puts his platform in a context utterly pathetic that mittani and the other goons have decided to make this such an issue how edgy and cool you all are  like this probably goes down ok with your own kind on your own forums but why do you think its relevant in an election campaign
i dont think that its relevant that a person with aspergers is running for csm assuming that kumi actually has aspergers which i must admit that i doubt that he felt compelled to feature it prominently in his campaign thread however is very relevantto say it another way if he had said plus i have cancer so you know that im insert some beneficial quality unrelated to a diagnosis of cancer it would have be equally absurd this is not about attacking someone with a disease this is about questioning the judgement of someone who is at best trying to use their condition to get votes in a space election point and at worst lying about having a condition to get votes
i just filled in a report against you i refuse to get comment about my autism and how you think it is fake etc
id let you know how it turns out spoiler alert a forum moderator will make a mildly annoyed face and possible shake his or her head at the triviality of your claim but ccp doesnt like it when you discuss forum moderation
you know every time i think you goons couldnt possibly make yourselves look worse in public you go ahead and prove me wrong now its victimising someone with a disability whats next rubbing your faces with excrement and claiming its good for the skin
as someone with aspergers i find it highly offensive that you label people with this affliction as disabled as many of us are very capable individuals who are productive although often introverted members of society
mittens is just a confused little kidhe is hinting at archieving peoples posting regarding his campaignthis is a weltfremd geek trying to implement what he read in some book regarding the governing of fearjust point and laugh and dont vote for him 
the tragically hilarious thing is that you can replace goon with pubbie in the op and its basically the same thing
that statement is kinda tragically hilarious
moron enjoys oxymoron news  11 v
there is no charm in that mate you really really need to get rid of mittens 
amen to that i personally would love to see them getting banned they giving the entire game a bad name including all those that do know how to behave but the problem is that often goons get voted for since they will threaten everyone who dares to think of say anything against them typical looser behavior id say to afraid to hear the truth and there for they act like spoiled 5 year olds with brown in their pants another problem is that due the current ccp rules goons are never punished not even because they eventually hurt ccps income by chasing away other playersits so typical to see the rotten apples win and the others need to suffer from it why not join forces to get goons out of eve so we all can fly a lot saver without having to worry about goon attacks we all combined against the goons and the goons will loose but i guess the most are too afraid to even think about something like that hint goons threatening you or your corpalliance is pretty much blackmail and blackmail is forbidden according to ccp and by any law
yes ladies and gentlemen we really did just have someone say that violencing your spaceboats and threatening your internetpixels is grounds for legal action you read it here first better hire your lawyers now
you really should learn to read finnyi scooted through this whole thread and guess what i dont see anyone calling for legal actionsbut then again you were always and will always be nothing more than a little insignificant troll who reads stuff that isnt even there
now far be it from me to doubt your ability to read and comprehend text but you might want to look at the post directly above mine it saysyoull note that things that are forbidden by law are in fact grounds for legal actionthe rest of your silly insults can safely be ignored but good try i guess
second attempt and still not reading properly huh but then again goons never learn to read i guess and nothing i said was invalid nor against the rules actually it is good that someone dares to stand up against the goons trying to make it a lot saver for all of us
as trolling goes this is substandard things that are against the law are grounds for legal action theres not really much wiggle room there and even if you try to edit it out your post is already archived on evesearch for the record i now not only support the goons ruining gandrys game but yours as well
for the record finny openly admits he needs his goon friends to go for people because he himself lacks the skill originality or plain balls to go for itand to make another thing clear i havent received any threats or such from goons about my opinion nor a slap on the wrist from any leadjust as goons are entitled of their opinion i am entitled to minealso would like to make clear to not feed the finny troll his ego might get way too much boost which could lead to severe deluded thoughts of actually being capable of accomplishing something
this csm has been the best csm ever1 for mittani for inducing nerd rage all through hisec
1 for you i am not playing in high sec
and that is what needs to change goons get not punishment just because they think they own everything for that matter why do you insist of trolling me i just said something that is obvious and the truth and you clearly say that you like to ruin the game for others which is adding to my comments on this and other topics proofing i am right so you can hardly blame me for daring to say what others think
he is a corp ceo of rage ctlq a nc member previously his corp was in defi4nt so hes correct rage is a 00 based alliance
to increase the info a bit morei was part of exceed which at that time was member of xetic alliance xetic was a 00 entityafter xetic i was part of dreamscape this corp was member of norad norad was a 00 entitymy current corp was member of ffa ffa operated in 00 in the early days that goons and ra started out in 00i also been in empire for quit some time doing missions producing trading and only a little bit of pvpyou wont find me much on killboards because i dont care for killmails and as such fly shout or logi a lotlike i said i dont feel the need to hide
was anybody really confused up until now whether this was one big troll thread on gandrys part or whether his nonsense about reading things that arent there was another lie designed to troll no didnt think so funny that he dropped that troll as soon as the quote was provided not that he actually missed the obvious final line of the post right before the one he was responding to gandry just kinda sucks at trolling but he does try so very hard maybe we should go easy on himof course as his very first post also talks about his terror over the goons ruining the game its somewhat less than impressive to see him use his own fears in an attempt to annoy other people ayieeee the goons will ruin all our games run runerm okay well i hope they ruin yours thenahhah i caught you youre a secret goon and you admit that you cant do anything on your ownis there a complete idiots guide to trolling that gandry can purchase somewhere this isnt even really entertaining now on to if you can believe it an even worse troll than gandry no goons get not punishment because threatening people ingame is part of eves core mechanics and despite your weird paranoia you cant actually have legal action brought against you for ing someone up in a video game no really you cant i notice that youve also adopted gandrys trolling habit where if someone points out your bull they must be trolling you this is less than impressive just to be clear youre the one trolling and suggesting that legal action would be appropriate to deal with gameplay in a videogame im the one who pointed out that was absurdly stupid as for ruining your game yes i hope that the goons do ruin it because you produce delicious tears just like if gandry wasnt so obviously trolling hed remove himself from the goons blue list and join another power bloc rather than being a part of their blue list and still complaining about how theyre going to ruin the game for everybody
ofcourse i suck at trolling i leave that up to you no need to try to compete with the master troll fears so when i express my own reasons as why not to vote for goons i express fear odd there i was just expressing my personal opinion and kablam its been catagorised into the section feartry crasping thicker straws the ones you are grasping at now are rather thini am fairly certain anyone with a basic grasp of the english langauge can read i said they are not out to ruin the game they are out to ruin everyone elses gamethere is a slight difference in that but i didnt expect from you to read propperly hmmm i was wondering if you werent a secret goon i never said you were one once again basic english a concept clearly way out of your league you could lend me your copy seems you have memorized it from cover to cover ingame threatening with ingame actions are all legal ingame and any real life threats if they were ever made would just end up in the petition listi wouldnt mind spending a few days in digging up all of the posts where you call everyone who disagrees with you a troll but i think i would overload ccps databasethe you are a troll reply is one which is in general mainly adopted by you in responce to other people who dont agree with younow what would that say about youheck i didnt even have to dig voila your standard reply and other people got from that part it was meant towards real life threats must be very claustrophibic in that head of yours see and replies like that just makes me restate the question arent you actually just a goon alt hiding in razor i didnt join rage to get on goons blue list i am pretty sure goons get that i returned to my old corp because i have friends there a concept that might sound quit aliUFFFDn to you but heck you might wanna try get some real friends in an internet game once
thanks op thats one well made argument one thing tho u mad
speaking of how youre an awful troll got a retraction yet of your lie that i misread that bit above about videogaming being grounds for legal action i assume that since youre only trolling you wont apologize but i can dream i assume that youll lie more about reading comprehension and then not admit youre trolling of course as for your trolling here claiming that goons are going to ruin everybodys game is indeed a claim that theyll ruin everybodys game this may be a difficult concept for you to grasp but when you post a public thread and say that they want to ruin your game that means that they want to ruin the game of any eve player who might read the thread and since 100 of people with a paying account can read the thread would you prefer raving paranoia fear seemed somewhat mild the fact that your fear is your opinion is somewhat worthless not that the but im entitled to an opinion whine isnt amusing somehow i doubt that youre not trolling and you really dont think that someone can be afraid of something if their opinion is that its fearfulseeing as how youre lying to troll me and thats never happened even once thatd be hard since the actual fact is that i call people out for trolling when theyre trolling thatd be the relevant issue but youre not exactly being honest are youspeaking of you trolling by lying got a retraction yet about how a claim that goons are breaking the law   violencing peoples spacepixels is against the law is indeed a claim that theyre vulnerable to legal actionno yes again we see you lying in order to troll the reason i pointed out that shes trolling is guess what not because she disagrees with me but because shes trolling oh and speaking of you lying and trolling interesting that you called me a troll for disggreeing with you and ignored her accusation that im trolling her because i pointed out that her argument was a fail troll funny that again youre lying and trolling while serving as an object lesson for the dunningkruger effect what a surpriseit would help if you could comprehend basic english but i guess ill just have to point out your trolling again the claim was that among other things threatening your corpalliance is blackmail and forbidden by any law see how much clear things become if youre not trolling gandryyou should try it you are so awful at trolling now troll more about how this isnt really an accusation phrased as a question maybe you could make loose change iii the loosening your trolling tactic by the way is known as jaqing off just in case you want to catalog it and yet you stay there and do nothing to actually oppose goons and you benefit from having a huge block of deklein blues on the ncs western flank and then you troll about how much you hate goons obviously not only can you not put your money where your mouth is youre just trolling not that its a surprise mind you
heck i am just gonna put your ramblings on block i rather save my time for the intelligent species of the human populationfor those who wanna know moredarius at fanfestat 0020 you can hear how they think of the mittani and at 2020 he clearly states how they precieve the game
acknowledged you have no actual refutations to the factual and logical claims ive made you wont retract your numerous errors but you will put your fingers in your ears and say lalalalala i cant heaaaaaaaaaar you noted tagged and entered into evidence
thread tldr goonswarm federation candidates will never lock up the space autism vote
mittani tries his hardest to mimic his predecessors molle and even jade constantine and does a really bad job its a shame what has happened to goonswarm this federation of tcf  nc rejects is proof alone how bad he managed a renter alliance
so i took that test thing to see who matched most closely with megod what a bunch of losers does that make me a loser well possible but i reckon not actually my highest match was 62 and basically from there down i only hit around the 50 mark i was hoping to see some closer matches but then actually i have a diverse range of opinions and dont neatly fit into the sterotypes of either being a hardcore pro industrialist or a hardcore pro 00 alliance member etc as such i wasnt attracted to all the leading questions around the hot issuesso then i went to look in detailout of all of them the mittanis was most well written i voted for him as he sounded the most plausible candidatecould he be a total  yep probably ive read his stuff online sometimes and he seems like the sort of person that revels in internet fame covets it in fact from reading his stuff i would say hes more intelligent that most online but still less intelligent that he believes himself to bebut what about other candidates well lets face it we only have what theyve said to go on unless they were previously elected and to be honest i havent been all that impressed with what theyve doneso because of that i voted mittani he sounded very convincing like i say he could be talking from his arse but then so can any of the candidatesdo you know who disappointed me most general windypops being a fellow uker i scoured that list for candidates from the uk and found surprisingly fewwhen i found windypops campaign i thought finally there was something reasonably detailed that could be worth readingbut where is the reason i should vote for you windypops youve spun a very interesting story about the massive conspiracy at hand with nc and goons and you seem to hate them a lot and as a response to that of course they would want as many of them on the csm as possible who wouldnt theyre an alliance it would be great for any alliance to have their views heard on a grander scalebut you seem to oppose it simply because that exists as a concept how dare they try to have their views represented so strongly everyone must immediately oppose it because someone is trying to win an electioni have absolutely zero ties to these guys or any major alliance by the waybut windypops you made me sad as a fellow uker i wanted to see some reason for me to vote for you not why i shouldnt vote for someone else that is a weak campaign and so many people fall down that trap in many other forms of elections councils unions etcso there it is my personal choices and why
mittani cant be talking out his arse youre stuck that far up it brown nosing he wouldnt be able to get a word outwhats the weather like up there anyway is the sun still shinning 
good observational skills there i think mittens was the only candidate who offered something different from the norm although as you point out its somewhat lathered in layers of selfhype and a vastly overestimated sense of self worth but he certainly is intelligent that said seleenes position as a previous ccp dev should be invaluable and would have been worth your vote as well not least because he actually is a game designer not just someone who pretends to be
and uwe boll is a film director and producer but that doesnt mean that he has the skills
person who thinks its ok for one alliance to control all of the csm in not voting for person who doesnt think its ok for one alliance to control all of the csm shockerthe only genuine shock is that someone actually bothered to look at my website
maybe you should read my post again theres quite a bit of antimittani in there toowhat ive done is made a neutral observationwhat youve done is made a biased and uneducated comment based on what you would have preferred i said so that everthing fits neatly into your for or against camps
i needed you to give me reasons to vote for you not reasons why i shouldnt vote for otherswhere are your values what you will do for csm and players what do you like and not like about eveall i know from your information is that you dont like nc lots of people dont like nc but i cant vote purely based on some campaign to stop people being in power i need to be voting for someone that i want to have some power some people who present well and sound like they have good ideasedit  also its irrelevant whether an entire alliance owns csm or not csm is about the improvement of eve online it makes absolutely no difference what alliance the players are part of the csm dont have the final say on anything its ccps game and they are not going to favour one person corp or alliance over any otheri dont know exactly what you imagine these csm meetings to be like but i imagine its something like this100 nc csm  first on the agenda is that all players part of it should pay usone billlion isk each mwahahahaaaaaaccp  does the csm fully back thisnc csm  in unison we doccp  then so it shall be donenc csm  second we would like 50 extra shields and armour to our ships pleaseccp  but of coursereally this isnt going to happen theyre just regular people behind the computer screens people who want to make eve a better place alliance doesnt come into it because ccp arent going to approve alliancebiased based requests
its hardly neutral and antimittani since youve effectively said hes the best candidate and youve voted for himwith a little ps windy is crap at the end of it 
wij van wc eend
i think you need to read my latest blog my friend
im pretty much obsessed with intelligence which is why i have this yearslong nootropics habitmost of the efame and posturing is just to enrage people who dislike me already theyre not going to change their minds about me so i might as well make them as frustratedangry as possiblethanks for the endorsement i think the vote match questions were deeply flawed as if you answer truthfully to the nullseclowsecindustry should be 1 priority coming before everything else question you get ed the truth is that no single area of space should have priority over everything else but this borks you in the algorithm if you strongly disagree on all of them for that reason
you said pretty much the same thing on shc mittens even though i gave you the benefit of the doubt there before it collapsed around your ears so who really knows i suppose well find out when you get together with your good friends and buddies of csm6 for a cup of tea and a group hug
what owns about you is that not only did you completely lose your cool on heap youve come here to bang your drums with hysterical posts  which is net voteshine on you angry badposting diamond
by now it is common knowledge that mittani has gotten all his flying monkeys to vote for him if they put the effort of reading his edly huge contradicting threadnaughts they would have probably ignored the angry hypocrite and voted for a better csmi own no alliance and i dont command 5k monkeys i am not an emotionally unstable internet alliance leader so i cant get swarm of bees to agree with me but what i can do is compare the csm based on what they have openly said in their own wordson the vote match this year candidates were given the opportunity to leave comments the overall priority of mittani was to change the ui nerf pvp buff larger coalitions nc and promote blobbing stuff he feels really proud of promoting not that it really matters he could have just said vote for me im sarah palin and goons would haveblobbingwhen csm were asked about blobbing trebor commented immediately on lag and how fixing lag and leaving the mechanics the same will just encourage people to get more numbers and lag mittani however decided to say i will rent you a constellation in deklein if we fix blobbing i think he got confused with the question but thats ok he got confused with most of the questions note the piracy question vile rat did manage to say something that made sense which makes you wonder why mittani even bothered to run when his own alliance minion was making him look foolish and useless againfactional warfarewhen csm candidates were asked about fw trebor freely commented on how how fw was broken and it needed fixing mittani however contradicts himself again he copy pastas something about backlogs which btw he did for 90 of his comments and then says fw is fine and perfect no one in their right mind would ever say fw is fine and perfect as it is this reminds me of kalrand aka kalmad who said fw is not lucrative enough now anyone who knows about fw will know how stupid his comment with but to no surprise you cant expect anything less from nc who have done little more than nap in eve00  lowsec prioritieswhen asked about lowsec changes trebor sincerely mentions that it isnt a short term fix and lots need to be done in order to fix it it is perfectly understandable why people would favour a balance in priorities sadly once again mittani repeats his backlog rambling like he did on most of the vote match he mentions this backlog on his 00 comment too which is pretty ironic since he started his campaign to focus on 00 nc alone so how is it his priorities involve no changes and his ideas are nothing more than criticismswe are all aware eve is broken ccp know it players know it csm candidates know it but if you want a neutral voice free from 00 agendas and selfpreservation then vote for trebor daehdoow history has shown he can make a difference that will benefit us allif only he commanded 5k monkeys oh and a reminder to all the people who havent voted ncs csm agenda nc have ruined 00 dont make them ruin evemore to come
this is an essay titled why kalle demos needs to stop posting
clearly you havent read any of my essays then
although trebor is the best choice for csm chair your mudslinging thread doesnt help him leave mudslinging to goons
you want to know about ncs policy on botting except mostly harmless widot goonswarm federation test majesta empire and stella polaris the other alliances have a dont ask dont tell policy when it comes to botting  rmteven when a player loses a bot the leader will shrug it offgoonswarm federation have an open policy on botting and venal probably has more botters than all of the east sadly due to afk cloaking the bots arent very effective mittani personally has said its not my job to stop botters its ccpswidot  mostly harmless  stella polaris bot near in branch they have the worst management of any other nc alliance and tbh they are merely there as meatshields so why not take advantage of botting heh morsus mihi created stella polaris just so they can bot and bring in isk for themtest did have an anti botting policy however it was leaked during the fountain campaign that they encouraged all their members to not only bot but find and abuse exploitsmajesta well they mass recruited everything to save their dying alliance and now are filled with botsthe only reason nc are so emo over drf bots is because more people afk cloak in the north making it harder for nc to bot while in the east it is much easier but that doesnt mean drf have more botters ccp need to have a look at where that isk from moon goo is going why are certain alliances giving isk  supercaps freely to random players if anything nc want to be csm so they can protect their botting  rmt why else do you think they are complaining the most about logistics and jump bridgesif you check nc candidates focuses on the vote match its really quite funny mittanis key interests are ui changes and half the questions he didnt even know what was asked hahaha rest of nc were just as bad
nope youre pretty clearly emoraging in the op here and trying to say that those attempting to talk you down are is well kinda obvious in its absurdity good try though speaking of your emoraging conspiracy theories and your notcited claims about dastardly dealings that naturally totally happened and stuff but you cant link to them rather obviously the percentage of names engaged in rmt versus the number of members in even a small alliance is infinitesimal were talking about stats that are less than one percent painting that as some sort of grand conspiracy is simply paranoid gandry trollingim shocked shockedoh no sorry id be shocked if gandry was actually decent at trolling i kinda expect the trollfail from him
seriously youre delusional have a look at my campaign and what i stand for antibotting pro pvp from my experience in the nc flying in ncdc fleets from small gang to sov war ive gathered the impression that the vast majority of nc members feel the same wayat best youre overgeneralising and using terrible reasoning skills
you kidding right everytime i link or prove something about nc mods come in and erase what i say you should know how it works take any leak thread on caod as an exampleall the proof gets deleted and even when it doesnt you just get nc emo babies trying to spin it like well if drf can bot so can webesides i posted about your rmt scandal only last week and guess what happened about 20 mins later ccp delete the thread people read enough kugu to know what has been leaked anyway oh and like most people even nc haha i ignore what emoagain zero says i think he should just create another alt and spam that way i will bother to read his 
obviously because theyre working for the men in black now because youre emoraging about conspiracy theories obviously quote even one single example of this actually happening rather than you dreaming it up to emorage about yeah didnt think soby ignore you mean constantly respond to andor mention yes
according to
lol thisin eve its not paranoia they are out to get you
the amusing thing with this thread is that most goon scams are want to be a goon give me isk lol i scammed utaking isk from idiots is good for the game keep up the good work
i asked myself why should anyone vote for a goon so i watched this video and had a change of heart well done lads good luck in the election

if you now replace 00 with low sec i could agree with you
great idea if you cant loose sec status in 00 why should you gain it
i do agree people in hisec should have stronger incentives to go to lowsec  but low sec pirates should be challenged too like having sentry guns damage multiplier be multiplied by the amount of people engaging in criminal activities hehe and not being able to dock with gcc penjoy being a pirate shouldnt be as comfotable as it is
because no one does only one thing in eve super cap pilots are a bit different but even they need to get out of ships from time to time for implants the characters who stay out of high sec are almost exclusively the low sec pirates who wear their 10s like badges of honor everyone else needs to be able to get into high sec from time to time requiring sec status you know the null sec cyno systems in low sec they are pretty obvious to anyone as they are highlighted on the map when you select recent cynos and you never attack you know where we are now dont act like the only reason you dont attack is because were hiding 20 jumps away were in your space already multiply that several times and you will have the situation you will be facing if this change goes through
the targets hes asking ccp bring him are the scum that already belong there in the first place pirates that watch their sec status like anorexics watch their weight this idea gets two thumbs upim pleasantly surprised this idea is coming from a pirate 
veto are low sec pirates not high sec war deccers or suicide gankers they definitely do not watch their sec status other than to say collectively we have 10 sec status so i think youre thinking of a different group of people incidentally neither would get dragged to low sec from this change suicide gankers are train gank dispose characters more often than not high sec war deccers dont lose sec status because they use war dec mechanics the characters this targets are almost exclusively null seccers who kill stuff in low sec occasionally this is generally in the form of pos bashes but occasionally targets on the low sec side of null sec entry points
you misunderstood my post i never implied veto watches its sec status i know they dont and dont care for it however the pirates that do watch their sec status would be forced to lo sec to get it fixed and thus it would theoretically translate to more targets for veto and company i think thats what the op is referring to and that im more than ok with
i like this and will add it to the op as an extension of the original idea thanks
ill play the devils advocate here and list a few probable reasons for this having not been implemented to dateit would detract from the usefulness of logistics shipsit would make ships without drone bays much less desirable and at a distinct disadvantagegallente ships would have an immediate topheavy unbalancing boosteven if you wouldnt have to manually target yourself the drones would still have to target you which would probably require a lot more coding than the simplicity of the proposal suggestsnone of these issues is insurmountable with the possible exception of 2 but the proposal is not just a simple proposalwith that said though it still makes sense that your own repair drones should be able to repair their own ship sooosupported but in a complete drone revamp package and not just as a single feature
because of the supercapital and sovereignty changes in dominion it is now extremely difficult to field dreadnoughts they are relatively expensive ships even after insurance payout and their siege module imposes some very heavy penalties that makes them difficult to keep alive long enough to do their job they have essentially been replaced by ships with 10x the ehp ewar immunity and the ability to withdraw whenever they pleasebased on some the discussion here i think i have some changes that would give them back their niche without overpowering them against subcapitalschange the siege modulereduce the locked targets and scan resolution penalties right now a sieged dread takes four times as long to lock as unsieged and can only maintain a primary and secondary target this is unnecessarily restrictive i suggest 3 locked targets and a 50 scan resolution penaltykill the active tanking bonuses active tanking is too strong in a small gang context and too weak in a large fleet context dreadnoughts should be effective in large cap fights not skirmishes the active tank bonus is counter to that goaladd a 60 nonstackingpenalized resist bonus to the siege module this would give the dreadnoughts about 25x more hit points when in siege mode and actually allow them to survive their cycle when under moderate supercapital pressureretain the inability to receive remotereps during siege the resist bonus is meant to buy time and no more carriers should still struggle to coordinate their reps with siege cycles and there should be an element of urgency when a dreadnought loses that resist bonus to get it back up in working orderwith that change in place a couple changes to the ship hulls themselves has to be made specifically they all possess an unnecessarily large capacitor buffer that used to support their active tanking role they no longer need this and it should be addressedit is important that capacitor recharge time not be touched as this affects things like the amount of time it takes a ship to recharge after engaging its jump drive instead capacitor buffer should be modifiedbased on my preliminary calculations the following reductions in capacitor buffer should occurcut the revelations capacitor buffer to 13 lasers are still very cap intensive but it should be able to sustain them for the 10 minute cyclecut the moross capacitor buffer to 14 blasters have similar capacitor characteristics to lasers cut the naglfar and phoenixs capacitor buffer to 16 the reppers were the only significant capacitor draw on these ships with it gone the only real use they have for it is running their hardeners for these ships the only real purpose of the capacitor buffer is to make energy neutralization actually require some effort and not allow a frigate sized cap transfer to prep their jump drive edit left the explosion velocity and tracking penalties alone ive heard some good arguments for leaving them as is and i think i was mislead by the previous thread on the ships  modules forum
i wanted to accomplish two things with this change first i felt a moderate dreadnought buff was necessary you can see that in the sensor and tracking changes theyre expensive ships and they should be able to do their job competentlysecondly i wanted dreadnoughts to do to supercarriers what supercarriers did to dreadnoughts specifically nerfing them without touching them see also gallente and the nano nerf gallente and the laser buff gallente and the projectile buff gallente supercarriers are rather poor at target switching their poor scan resolution combined with the fact that their dps is drone based makes it difficult for them to change primaries when the situation changes the siege cycle resist bonus creates a dramatic shift in combat which supercarriers cant respond to efficiently my hope is that the carrier pilots can use the metagame information when their allied dreadnoughts come out of siege to leverage an advantage against the supercarriers
hmmm
all due respect but they are still capital sized weapons morever i did restrict myself to halving the penalties i would hope there would be enough difference between large and capital turrets that you could expect a battleship fleet to have a chance of surviving with the moderate change ive described for gods sake look at the effect of an archons movement on the phoenix when you consider that a microwarpdriving battleship has about 13 the signature and moves 10x as fast im fairly certain we can achieve a happy middle groundthat said if enough people disagree with that change im willing to remove it from the proposal i feel the resist bonus and active tanking removal is far more important and i dont want that part ignored because i decided to tweak a few secondary effects
you say the issue is supercaps then you look at dread damage to a normal cap aeon is quite a big larger than an archon so has way lower damage reduction due to moving imo dreads are fine the issue is supercaps and your first two points only help dreads against subcaps and possibly regular caps not against supers you are also seriously underestimating the tracking of capital turrets fit a revelation now pick random bs put two webs on it do not enable siege mod of revelation so normal capital turret tracking and see that at its normal engagement range it hits that bs for almost full damage when it is trying to maximise its transversal and no that is not only eft knowledge despite eft being correct i have seen the hurt that titans can put to battleships with their turrets well except leviathan they cant do more than tickle a battleship
alright then ill remove the trackingexplosion velocity buff i suppose carriers have enough trouble staying up as it is and the extra signature of supercapitals means theyll still at least be effective against them should i leave the sensors too
if they are so powerful why do i keep seeing kill mails on battleclinic where a rifter takes them on in 1v1 and wins
there are also kills with vigils killing battleships those are not the norm
because it worked so well with supercaps
personally i dont think the dram is super overpowered could use less drones and less than 100 projectile bonus dmg but obviously the real problem deals with the unbalance of weapons acs vs lasers vs rails vs blasters lasers only equal autocannons power at 15 km rail and blasters are supposed to be horriblei have a caldari but i use missilesi put two 150s on my punisher and i deal 60dmg every second while my lasers would maybe deal 2030 every 3 seconds using gammaxraymultifreqso a rifter or dram loaded up with 34 acs using t2 ammo could be quite dangerous while a newb amarrian trying out his lasers has no idea gallente and his rails he already know are horrible and the lone caldari who forgot the missiles might be in for a shockon the other part i think we need more frig typesright now we havescout mining  no upgrade maybe a better 4 laser miner with more cargohold surveyorfast attack  interceptorcombat  assaultfighter bomber  stealth bomberastrometrics  reconmine layerecm attack  ewar special ops2 new types would besupport  snipermissile frigate serve as a baby drakebaby sniper big and fat but very slowtracker  hunter frigate this is type of frig or cruisre that bounty hunters would use like combat frig but also shares some astrometric bonuses sry the magnate reminds me of boba fett for some reasonsome poeple have asked that we could have a command frig as well with bonus ganglinkssome industrial frigs could be invented as well like tugboat or wrecker repair frigate which is used to ganglink repair wounded shipscruisersanother type of cruiserfrigate that could be reclassified already exists with gallenteamarr arbitrator could be a drone frigcruiser with drone bonusesdrones are pretty powerful like acs as wellso there are many more frigs and ships to be made which could become of value if balanced properly but like i said i think acs are overpowered lasersrailsetc are weak and all weapons need rebalancingi was also thinking ccp could implement a new type of frig called heavy frigthis could also be done for cruiserheavy cruiser as well since there are some cruisers that are smaller than destroyerssimiliar to frigates which could be reclassified as light cruisers or heavy frigs while bigger cruisers like omen could be made for heavy cruiserheavy frigate and heavy cruiser ship command could be obtained by training your frig or light frig to iv or vheavy frigs would serve basically as mass attack boats 56 slots double armor similiar to drakes or hurricanesand light cruiserheavy cruiser would be the diffrence between scoutrecon and baby battleshipsbaby battlecruisers who could lend heavy cruiser support against larger fleetsso yes dram needs nerfing weapons need balance and more ships are always in order in ship game where ship shoot ship and blow up ship for player to buy new shipsry for the spam wall of text ive been thinking of posting a thread of my own but i dont know where to start
i was thinking about the same thing today it would be great feature for casual players who do not want to play simultaneously on 2 accounts
currently people have to have a second account then pay to transfer the character over to the account they want the character on once they are done training the only reason ccp would do this is if they had a financial incentive to do it that being that the increase in people training multiple characters would offset the decreased income from changing from the current system i dont think it would

people flying caldari use launchers because railgun fits suck there is some use for blasterfit railgun boats but they are underpowered compared to the minmataramarr cr fits but at least they have similar range i guess so people use missiles instead as they have the engagement range and good damage

just give fighter bombers the same restriction as the titan dd as you can not dd structuresa mom should be used to kill capital ships not structures for that we have the dread witch is unused atm as moms are way better to kill structures
i have a ganglink alt i trained it from nothing and have had it for 3 years this month and it does far more than simple ganglink boosting in fact thats a more recent thing ive trained him to do yes i boost in an unprobable tengu and legion and there isnt a damn thing you can do about it is it a broken mechanic yeah it is but not the off grid boosting partthe problem is they are unprobable because they cant be found they cant be killed and that simply shouldnt be possible imho difficult to find is fine requiring max skills and implants to find them is fine but it should always be possible boosting from off grid is not the broken part so whats really needed are some adjustments to the probing system
ah so what you guys are saying is that what this game needs is fewer roaming gangs and more tiresome idiots who are terrified at the prospect of leaving their home system and their posd up command ships gotchai guess thats about what you have to expect from the kind of moron who brings a bait nidhoggur meant for tanking multple scs to fight a couple hurricanes and a tempest and then dies in a horrible fire of his own making
although the op was terrible idea is good offgrid boosting in unprobable t3s has way too much reward for the risksolution  link modules boost sig radius now they are probable
your answer is wrong they are not probablelearn eveunscannable when the signature radiussensor strength  108change supported because no risk with this fighting methods for loki pilot and give huge boost for gang pilots like 100km web or disruptor range

how does making gangboosters participate in the scuffle reduce the number of roamsyou are basing your assessment on the faulty assumption that a booster must have 34 links making them dead on first sneeze guess what add one or two more boosters and distribute links among them  more tank more gank read my prev post same boostingnothing should be able to affect the outcome of a battle without even being there only others capable of doing it is carriers with assigned fighters but they are destructible and cost the same as a cruiser  eachimagine rr being able to reach any point in a system regardless of range set up watch list and go to safe would be horribly broken and it even requires the pilot to be there and not just a minimized alt clientsecond alternative tactical subspace jammer highslot module that renders enemy offgrid boosters ineffective once in los of charges ongrid communications can be reestablished
not the point i was making liang and rothgar were saying they want to keep offgrid boosting so they can park posd up multilink command ship alts in their home systems but remove unprobeability so that roamers coming to attack them cant obtain the same negligiblerisk link support offgrid boosting is a stupid mechanic but id far rather keep it than return to a situation that encourages people to sit in one system with their command alt in a pos by far the best solution would be to kill both at once and force linkships on to the grid the issue there is that that heavily favours certain types of gangs and pvp styles  keeping a damnation alive and ongrid in a guardiansupported gang is pretty easy but a claymore supporting a fast kiting gang is likely to have to warp in and out as it gets primaried meaning that link support would come and go
just one solution accepted change command modules bonus just on same griddisable from unscanable ship bonus or sit on pos bonus etc
i was going to support you right until i got to the bit about suggesting that such types necessarily or usually at the very least buys chars with illegally purchased isk then i stopped reading
thissolution supported makes perfect sense
this just goes to show that youve never actually faced a triage carrier in combat i meant what i said  the problem here is anyone being completely immune to probesliang
imho the problem is offgrid fleet boostingan offgrid missioner running missions in an unprobeable t3 isnt going to do much to impact the pvp happening in the same system same missioner running missions with level 5 all leadership skills and mindlinks while in fleet with the pvpers will impact significantly on pvp happening in the same systemalter fleet boosting so that boosts are only applied to ships on the same grid now the problem is addressable well theres always intelligent application of gridfu with ongrid but unprobeable t3s boosting the fleet from ten thousand kilometres away at least that issue can be addressed using fast interceptors providing a warpin
your argument breaks down here because unprobeable mission running utterly breaks risk vs reward you are effectively discounting the market pvp that happens with the extra lp gained from running in dangerous areas and yes thats pvpi say this as someone that has cs5 on both of my leadership alts and actually kinda prefers command ships because they can jump into an enemy gang and immediately start providing bonusesoff grid gang boosting isnt a problem if i can scan them down and kill them and if theyrea t a pos then its a perfectly fine home field advantage  there should be advantages for preparing the battlefieldliang
by repairing someone you are not committing an act of aggressionunsupported theres nothing stopping you from a firingjamming their logis b bringing your own logis c not fighting on a station
while im all for nerfing neut rr its such a cheezycheap move i cant support either of your proposals to fix the issueas previously mentioned repping is not aggression therefore should not get an aggression timerkill rights are only awarded if you dont shoot back if youre going to be eligible for kill rights they wont be taking damage anyway so rr is a moot pointi would much rather see the scenario where if somebody gets involved in somebody elses fight they become a legitimate target for as long as the character they rep is part of that fightso if a can flipper is shot then repped as long as the flipees corp can shoot the flipper they can shoot the repper too if a neut reps a wartarget that neut is a part of that war until the reppee is no longer part of the war the war ends the repped character leaves the corp or their corp leaves the alliance
a buffer tanked dps ship can stop firing for 60 seconds to deagress and dockjumpwhatever it can do so while receiving reps if you need to run having your dps cease fire while logis keeps them up is an essential tacticnow assume that you got a 60 second timer every time you repped someone like say another logistic trying to wait out his 60 second timer now he has to rep you andyou have to survive for 60 seconds without receiving repson a cruiseryoure an idiot
do you really think that the ability to jump into a certain death situation and come away unscathed is reasonablethat is what it is used for and what you complain that aggression would disallowso what if you have to sacrifice a logistics to save an entire gang once in a while they are not exactly uberexpensive they are in fact considerably cheaper than the most common t2 fitted bs yes to logistics and all other remote action following aggression rules like everything else yes including concordokken no to the killright thing dont know how the hell you cooked that one up  neither here nor there
yes it would be nice if known neutral logistics could be shot for the entire war although it seems difficult to implement and with lots of weird consequencesi still believe the idea to implement agression timers 60 sec penalty on dockingjumping is one of the most important changes neededwhy should someone be able to agress others while being kept alive with a neutral logistic ship  without any realistic threat to this logistic shipyes you can now shoot the logistic ship when he decides to engage only but that woulda take the focus away from the real target certainly allowing him to dockb not give you a logistic kill anyway because it will just instantly dockalso logistic ships is not easy to jam and all the effort you make to get rid of a neutral logistic ship is taking much needed attention off the real enemy it shold not be without a realistic consequence to engage yourself in someones battle and just being able to get shot is not enough if you can just dockpinky
good luck getting the neutral reppers to leave station they are quite happy there as they are perfectly safe this is one of several game mechanics flaws that lead to a lot of dumb stuff happening in high secrr should get sec hits equal to if they had been shooting instead of the characters they repped until those characters have had a session change and the corresponding criminal flags then rr would have aggression timer only when it is a criminal act as having rr always give an aggression timer would seriously screw up a lot of game mechanics
any neutral actions to assist aggressing targets should transfer aggression whether its remote sebos or repping
on balance supportedneutral parties interfering in a concordsanctioned war any other time you upset concord what happens you lose your shipyes id prefer to see so called neutral repppers get concordokkened because if you were that keen to rep ships at war why not just join the corp thats at war  if its that much of a blight this pretty much takes care of itbut failing that there should be greater consequences than just being shootable a sec hit delay before being able to dock or jump anything to give actions some real consequences
supported though id prefer neutral repping removed entirelyto those who say the act of neutral repping is not an act of aggression i say baloney only because the forums automatic censoring filters out stronger explicatives so called neutral repping is an act and it is taking a side in a fight the act has significant impact upon the outcome of a battle of course its an act of aggression it meets every criterion in the definition of an aggressive act within the context of a battle it has the same effect as pulling the trigger on a gun or missile launchermoreover neutral repping actually acts as an inhibitor to pvp how many times have each of us seen combat avoided for concern that there might be neutral reppers waiting neutral repping is little more than a tool for griefers to use its one of the cheesier mechanics in the game that these people can duck into a station or jump through a gate without having to wait for a timer after taking action which has such influence on a battles outcome is sillyive never seen a legitimate reason for having neutral repping and id like to as things stand it just doesnt make sensewindjammer
yeah sure theyre the same price before insurance try flying a t2 ship some time  losing them actually stingsthat said if you amend your proposal to merely inheriting the aggression timer rather than refreshing it ill support the topic local repair functions normally when youre gccd and lets you wait out to deagress logistics should do the sameif a target has 20 seconds left on his gcc you get his 20 second gcc when you rep him not the full timer
the real problem here is pvp on stations not neutral rr or gate aggression i suggest looking at the mechanics of station games and fixing those instead of looking specifically to nerf remote repairliang
the solution to neutral reppers is neutral bumpers or ecm target damping neuting you know the usual once they dock theyre not repping anyone are theyincidentally the solution to stupid docking games is bumpage too neutral reppers are just a variation on stupid docking gamesadding neutral reppers to the wardec opens up wonderful new opportunities for people to pull lofty scams on naive pilots trying to be helpfulid say yes to 60 second aggression timer cant dock cant jump but the other ideas for punishing neutral reppers are quite beyond the palethe worst bit is if we get the 60 second aggression timer the folks posting about neutral reppers will be complaining that logistics ships are op then when logistics ships are nerfed theyll be complaining that whatever shipsfittings their wts fly are op then when were all nerfed to flying rookie ships with civilian gatling guns theyll be complaining that low ping bastards get too many advantages
i say no because logistics arent currently overpowered the problem here is station games so fix thatliang
if it goes on too long players will adapt the legit miners will leave or change to other playstyles that cant be griefed so easily and the bots will just keep goingyou can adapt by doing mission ops in l1 and l2 missions you can get a surprising variety of minerals there and you often have it bounded by an accel gate giving you plenty of time to react to gankers or you can use ships that can be tanked well enough to survive a dessy alpha like t1 cruisers or bss and drive the cost of ganking upccp really doesnt care much about mining so its best to take the iniative and act on our own to adapt in a way that frustrates the ganker and benefits us
the only person responsible for protecting your ship is you
take a t1 mining ship insure it tank it as well as you can so dessies are unable to alpha it park a salvager near your soon to be wreck and profit alternatively start building mining ships
um im not sure which game you are playing but goons dont run csm  in fact i dont remember a goon on csm v sure they have candidates for csm vibut hulkageddon is more than a year old and completely within the scope of the game i dont participate or even really care about who does  it is no different than any other player run activity in eve ban hulkageddon you should ban killboards and corporations since they would enable it to continue off the recordactually maybe that is a better way then instead of knowing theres a span of a week once or twice a year where organized industry ganking occurs it would be anywhere anytime yep totally ban hulkageddon then watch the membership of hulkageddon orphanage become a fulltime hulkageddon group much more fun for afk miners and haulers in hisec yep
seems stupid just because you can fly an f17 doesnt mean you can fly a jf17remember each race reached space seperately they have their own technology that is unique to themselves that is why each race has different skills
again and again people say the exact reasons why they agree with ops idea and then turn around and say they disagree its contradictory the idea is right now skills like logi hac hic etc are all cross racial each skill applies to all 4 races op wanted to change it so that each cover only 1 race but multiple ship types within that race eg hac  hic  logi of 1 race instead of 4 races of hacs you post sound like you agree with ops idea
the rent is also too  highnerf rent
what have we to google ill get right on it you just need to be more specific
maybe in teh world of eve the mechanics and systems of the different races and ships are different your logis is flawed and eve isnt forced to use logic
wheres malcanis with his law when you need itmalcanis law whenever a mechanics change is proposed on behalf of new players that change is always to the overwhelming advantage of richer older players
text that creates lag right not sure what you understand under a few kb of text causing lag i mean its a lot less then most data that needs to be transferred so think you need to rethink that one 
this is eve were talking about more ridiculous things have happened i think i read that explanation tooperhaps they are not only downloading all the text but at the same time prerendering it so lots of color and font changes might make it even slowerof course the solution is reducing text not fixing the engine
sing jai youre not alone ive started programming an eve iphone app inspired by the late capsuleer app it can read mails all in the app interface but to compose or reply ect to evemails it relies on eve gate unfortunately eve gate will not log in on my phone i even tried it on the iphone simulator and it would not log in sounds like something ccp needs to fix or we will need an app to view it
so i am big on being immersed in the game and i saw a simple thing that i would like to see brought upinstead of being able to right click on a pilot and start convseration how about we change the terms to hail or hail pilot so in turn instead of pilot x wishes to start a conversation with you it would be pilot x is hailing you but the options would be the same of course also consider the development behind this idea should be very simple and easy to do this terminology is commonly used in most scifi shows and movies and i believe for rpers and non rpers alike it would be either a welcomed change or an unoticed change any thought oh mighty csm d
id rather have prerecorded messages to the effect of surrender or die which the autoconvoblocker cannot block
star trek online is that way pretty sure there is the potential of some kind of infringement law suit if ccp made that change
no potential for it at all hail is a general term and thus not trademarked are copyrighted i checked into it  o
this really isnt the most pressing fix the game needs is it would you also like warp to changed to hasten thee to yonder object
no that is stupid it should be more like getting that mfker on the phoneone fckin moment please
geordi found out you were talking about him behind his back and has denied your communication request
well thats my point its not pressing or time consuming whatsoever after all the csm tackles such big issues that wouldnt it also be nice to throw a few cosmetic touches in there as well
isnt there an age requirement on this game you have to be so many years old to subscribe and play
please note that there are a myriad stupid adults age limits are not foolproof

im pretty sure youll agree that theres a difference between a soldier defending the freedom of his country and a serial killer who kills for fun yet your comment would suggest theres no difference between the twotheyre both pvp i only use rl examples because rl is less abstarct and more tangible than internet spaceships and thus the folly of your reasoning more apparent while griefers in eve may not deserve to be compared to criminals you cannot deny there is a significant psychological difference between a player who pvps for gfs and one who seeks only to make another human being miserable think of it this way when you sit down for a game of chess with a friend your goal is not to make him as miserable as possible it is simply a friendly competition a match of wits to pretend otherwise is a remarkably deluded attempt at excusing your own sociopathic tendancies that you only act upon in a virtual world where actions that are socially unaccpetable in the real world have no consequences
either you dont know much about competitive chess or you think nobody ever plays games with people who arent their friends
fair enough ill admit i dont know much about competitive chess but my point wasnt the extoll the virtues of chess players it was to illustrate a fundamental psychological difference between griefers and ordinary pvpers but to modify the analogy to suit your objections picture if you will the most competitive ruthless chess player he talks smack he makes enemies of all his opponents nobody likes him he may make his opponents miserable but thats never his express goal even so i dont have an issue with the fact that there are so many griefers in eve humans are pretty evil by nature so its no surprise that so many of us will turn on each other the moment were put in an environment where were not held socially accountable for our actions what i do take issue with however is the amount of people who insist that theres nothing wrong with their actions that really im just acting like an  toward others and making them miserable because its not real im actually a really nice and decent person in real life
eve isnt chess eve is an exceedingly complicated game of poker where nobody knows all the rules and where the dealer makes occasional attempts to rewrite the rules so that its fair even though its never actually fair some players get better cards and win others are better at reading their opponent and win still others lose because they dont know what theyre doing and it is to this last group that romo skywind belongs
what evidence do you have that i have lost or am in any way less than 100 satisfied with my eve experience the only person on that list to have ever personally harmed me is prom and he killed my ishkur once oh thats right you dont know the first thing about me you just feel the need to insinuate that i have some mental deficiency or have some personal vendetta against your precious leaders or perhaps im confused about my sexual orientation simply because i made a passing remark that goons arent trustworthyderp
at the risk of being dragged deeper down the rabbit hole of a bad metaphore you can enjoy making your enemies miserable without it being the sole reason you play im not a competitive chess player but i have friends who are and the psychological warfare involved can get pretty intense and is a big part of the game you certainly wouldnt be a  to your friends when you played against them but when youre playing to win its open seasonif you approve of the action but not the motivation does it even matter if the end result to yourself is the same
well aoe doomsdays were quite annoying of course but then again so now are uniform supercarrier blobs i think its fair to say goons had very little to do with improving the play balance in 00 remember i met bane glorious face to face who was the vaunted goon supercap thinker and he could barely string two words together on the csm and preferred to do his edgy 19 year old impressions to the developers rather than present much input to ongoing debate fairest thing to say about that guy was that he was a noneventas for the developer corruption scandal we all know the story a gm cheated and got caught should have been fired but wasnt ccp cleared house and instituted some pretty firm inhouse rules that may well have led to a cure that was worse than the ailment allow me to explain sure you had a gm cheating for bob he spawned bpos that were not meant to be there rather than just firing the guy and putting him on a boat to florida so he could seek work with the bush dynasty in electoral reform they slapped him on the hands and instituted what became a collective punishment for their current and future staff and ushows that well rules ensuring that eve developers cannot play a meaningful role in alliance politics 00 wars endgame content etc etc can have no other longterm impact than to alienate and distance such play experience from the developers we are counting on fixing itby making the betrayal of one hired guy gm and sections of the aurora volunteer team influence their approach to hyperstrict separation of work and play experience there has in my view been an impact and that can be see in recent years with ccp seeming to lose touch with the concerns of the player base and lose the thread of whats important in their game world now sure thats one of the things that csm is supposed to help fix but goon candidates in my experience tend to be pretty long on forum noise and froth and very short on delivery you guys are great at stoking up rage threads on the forums that lead to ccp kneejerking and stopping all devs from playing the game in a meaningful way and you are pretty good at inspiring ragethreads that stop doomsday weapons taking out your fleet of rifters again to your benefit but now we have a pretty damned static and boring 00 thats haunted by supercarriers and riddled with jumpbridges for quick logistics and you happen to be in with the current aristocracy there where are the rage threads now there arent any because you like things the way they are and your candidates are running to tell the developers than 00 is fine in your meaty handsbut lets not forget that any time any of us lament the fact the devs seems a bit clueless about this or that aspect of the 00 or alliance experience a big reason for that lack of knowledge was the hue and cry you guys pursued to punish that first cheating gm that pushed beyond appropriate punishment for the person in the wrong and had an impact on the overall collective knowledge of game developers in eve for the proceeding yearsremoved an inappropriate term from the text  adida

while im sure youd love to read deep philisophical meaning into different playstylesand may even be correct periodicallyyour overly verbose premise neglects a key pointthis is an internet spaceship game no one dies or gets hurt beyond the layers of fat choking their arteries from all the hot pockets consumed while staring at a poorlycoded uieverything in the game you get outside of missions you get by taking from another player either you get a good deal on the market or they skin you with prices or you blow them up to take their mods or they blow you upso if you are concerned about pvp actions in a game fundamentally based on pvp what does that say about you
i hardly think a member of goonswarm should be lecturing anyone about ad hominem attacks
then why give myself a member of goonswarm valid cause to criticize you for doing exactly that
you dont have valid cause as usual you are simply trolling
so youre denying you used a racial epithet and ad hominem attacks to disparage a former csm delegate
ah so its ok to use epithets to describe goons in a serious manner out of curiosity do you also rp as emily post in your internet chat brothel

i fear you neglected to have made a point aside from your bigoted and hateful compulsive desire to attack other posters if you want to get involved in the debate whos outcome could have real impact on gameplay for all involved thats great the more voices we have involved in this discussion from all gameplay styles the better and the csm has room to accommodate all types of gameplay from the empire mission runner to the 00 empire builder i represent one of those voices from one gameplay style but i have an interest in seeing all improve because i truly feel all elements tie into each other i even welcome your voice to the discussion but i fear posting walls of text that basically say dont trust any individual from this alliance despite their platform gameplay views or campaign message which i feel doesnt add anything substantive to the discussion hurts the debate many who are truly interested in this conversation feel is necessary in order to make the best decision its a voice certain enough but a caustic voice that i dont feel represents the desire of the eve community to come together and find a way to fix this game that we all acknowledge needs a lot of work if you looked past your personal prejudices about which alliance an individual was from youd make comments discussing criticizing or supporting individual points csm delegates have made regarding gameplay changes wed like to champion or deficiencies wed want to attack as a former csm delegate you bring a lot to the table in this discussion i just wish you were using your role in a more constructive manner
whole lotta mad people itt
i think it is more likely that your own prejudice and insularity arising as it does quite naturally from your role as spokesman for an extremely inwardlooking gaming cult does not allow you to see any point made by nongoon supporters that is why you find it so easy to ignore the points i make here and sweep anything potentially embarrassing under the carpet in the hope that the discordant yelping and bleating of your fellows will hide the evidence behind miasmic smogbut the problem is there is scant room for discussion between you and i vile rat we both know what this election is about as we both know what the role of goonswarm in eve online is about having met my share of past goon candidates my expectations were fully confirmed and seeing what you and your running mate have said about the rest of eve in the context of these current elections there isnt much left to mysteryyou will win a seat on the backs of the minor goon cultists all we stake in this game of words now is the handful of votes that you might con from the witless and the unwary with the mask of apparent civility in the moments between genuine slips
i promise you a direct answer to whichever point youd like addressed if you would be so kind as to state them clearly and concisely i sincerely did not see a point raised aside from a blanket attack on a group based on your interaction with a small handful ill choose to look past your racial comments for the time being since you refuse to address them 
ah jade still eternally optimistic that people read past the first paragraph in your rambling blocks of bad posting shine on you crazy diamond
do you not see a contradiction between the positions you expressed in your campaign thread speaking on problems with stasis in 00 and the essentially boring nature of the current powerbloc stagnation and the organized goonnc plan to fill the csm with seats opposed to any kind of progressive or constructive alteration to 00 sovereignty mechanicsdo you accept that the earlier poster in this thread who was attempting to laud the achievements of goon representatives in achieving positive change in supercapital balance was overexaggerating the role played by bane glorious in csm1 do you accept that the current situation with complete supercapital saturation in 00 warfare makes a mockery to earlier claims of resolving this issue in any form whatsoeverdo you accept that the goonk forum witchhunt against corrupt developers went too far and rather than seeking the appropriate and just punishment of one cheating developer ended up making ccp terrified to allow any of its developers to actually play the game in a substantive way and is a contributing factor these last years to the increasingly alienated and distant impression we get of developers from the core game of eve onlineand lastly are you prepared to tell me that you would support specific measures outlined by ccp that would limit impact restrict or otherwise hurt goonswarm interests in their 00 holdings feel free to provide an examplewould you for example support the restriction or removal of jumpbridges would you support a means of making passive moon income open to intediction by small pvp groups would you support measures that stop huge fleets at single points from being the one and only measure of power in 00 territorial contests
holy  jade really bad at eve online is unaware of how to interdict moon mining income with small gangsyou attack the pos you moron
no because there is no organized goonnc plan to fill the csm with seats opposed to any kind of progressive or constructive alteration to 00 sovereignty mechanics im not running as a goon im running as a candidate for csm i trust my platform will be judged on its merits and not some kind of blanket attack on an in game corporationalliance i happen to be a member of whatever your personal squabbles with a previous csm delegate were about i dont see how it is germane to any discussion regarding the future of the game and a persons qualifications to be worthy of votes death to all supercaps ive made my position clear on this subject i reject your loaded question it is invalidabsolutely yes emphatically yes we are rich as an alliance goonwarm federation is stupidly rich we are literally reimbursing all ships lost both in fleet fights and out just because we happen to have the one moon that is the chokepoint in manufacturing right now technetium ccps vaunted economic representative did not do a good job predicting the telegraphed glut coming and has reacted with all the speed of a stunned snail to see the manufacturing process dynamically balanced after the mistake occured we all fully acknowledge the problem and want it fixed so economic scarcity isnt completely eliminated by one bloc i want our losses to hurt i want our enemies losses to hurt and if they dont hurt then winning is damn near meaninglessid also be highly receptive to the concept of a sovereignty system that made sov more difficult the further from a center of government it is the concept of a large amount of smaller empires fighting over space is fun the concept of what game mechanics encourage under current game design is decidedly not funplatform positions held by somebody who wants to maintain the status quo i dont think so but id be interested in hearing your thoughts on itno kinda yes

i reject your loaded question it is invalidlets break it down thendo you accept that the goonk forum witchhunt against corrupt developers went too far and rather than seeking the appropriate and just punishment of one cheating developer ended up making ccp terrified to allow any of its developers to actually play the game in a substantive way   and is a contributing factor these last years to the increasingly alienated and distant impression we get of developers from the core game of eve onlinelet me be clear i do think that the goonk thinkers at the time saw a golden opportunity to leverage the misconduct of a developer into an ingame victory over thousands of rival players and were not content to allow an inhouse resolution of the issue and kept pressing and pressing until ccp felt obliged to remove significant content in 00 wars from the experience of its development teami do believe this is one of the reasons why eve has floundered these past years because if you dont have developers actually playing in nullsec wars and operating the alliance management screens how do you expect them to gain the experience needed to improve things
im sorry you reworded the question to be just as invalid and self serving as the original if you ask a non loaded question id be happy to answer it
you should calm down and have a nice cup of teayou are not the font of all knowledge in evethere are much better players than you who are far more accomplished in aspects of the game you will never experience accept this truth and your soul will rest easier
okay mr rat lets break it down even more1 do you accept that the goonk forum witchhunt against corrupt developers went too far2 did this witchhunt go further than seeking the appropriate and just punishment of one cheating developer3 did the the outcome have the collateral consequence of making ccp terrified to allow any of its developers to actually play the game in a substantive way  4 do you admit that banning developers from highend content and involvement in alliance politics has been a contributing factor these last years to the increasingly alienated and distant impression we get of developers from the core game of eve onlineand againlet me be clear i do think that the goonk thinkers at the time saw a golden opportunity to leverage the misconduct of a developer into an ingame victory over thousands of rival players and were not content to allow an inhouse resolution of the issue and kept pressing and pressing until ccp felt obliged to remove significant content in 00 wars from the experience of its development teami do believe this is one of the reasons why eve has floundered these past years because if you dont have developers actually playing in nullsec wars and operating the alliance management screens how do you expect them to gain the experience needed to improve thingsi hope breaking up the question a little more will help you to answer it honestly now vile rat
what does this have anything to do with the csm make a caod thread if you want to discuss that do you actually have a platform question or something even remotely csm to discuss or are you just posting here to troll
see this is what i meant youre sounding like a crazyer person theyre a bunch of folks who post on the same forum on the net and then play video games as a group that youre describing them as a cult is just disturbing its even more disturbing that you may actually believe itdiscussion on terminology removed  adida
ill get back to this thread in a minute i have to go sacrifice a goat
thats exactly what a person of your ethnicity would say due to your ethnic stereotype i knew it
so jade im still waiting to hear your defense of your absurdly stupid commentwhat aspect of moon mining did you not understand
well mr rat i look at my alliance management screen my corp interface and i notice it hasnt been updated for 5 years im still running my alliance on a terrible ui that reminds me of an unoptimized excel spreadsheet left as legacy documentation on some awful client siteand i wonder why it has been allowed to linger in the dust unloved and untouched for so long when the eve literature and marketing material speaks of the importance of these space corporations and alliances and the intrigues between them why is this core part of the game so utterly reminding of abandonware from the golden age of windows 31so i ask the question which you have many times now failed to answer despite promising me an honest response do you think your player organization has some responsibility for scaring ccp into barring their developers from endgame content and the alliance gameare you prepared to admit to me that goonk witchhunts against cheating devs went too far and triggered a ccp kneejerk that prevented them experiencing an ongoing and fertile relationship with aspects of the game itselfit isnt a wild out of the blue question vile ratyour organization likes to trumpet its victory over the dev corruptionrife band of brothers alliance to any internet news site that will listen you have dined out on that accomplishment for years now all i want from you is an admission or denial in your words that the witchunt against cheating devs may have gone too far and caused ccp to ban its developers from playing certain parts of the game with the consequence that we are still running our ingame organizations on a 5 year old interface that has never been iterated improved optimized or given the slightest sight of a progressive workoversometimes admitting fault is the first step to gaining an inkling of respect vile rat or as i suspect are you too much indebted to the collective idols of your organization to risk giving voice to the opinion that a mistake was madeeither way i am interested to hear your response
topic for honest debate goons threat or menace do you really not realize the fallacies your argument is built on jade
shush i was talking to the organgrinder not the monkeys

also lawl at the person who roleplayed as a space prostitute trying to talk about how to get respect
this is once again a loaded question let me show you an example of a non loaded questiondo you think that game adminsgms should be able to play all aspects of the game or should their gameplay be restricteda i feel that its imperative that the people who design the game should be able to play in all aspects of that gameplay to fix you must understand and you cant understand if you dont experience i fully support gms ability to play in endgame content as a player provided their accounts are monitored by ccp internal affairs folk to make sure that they arent using their position to gain an unfair advantage as has happened in the pastloaded question i answered the important part above which is that i do feel its important that gms play the game i deleted a bunch of non related stuff and meaningless rants if you ask real questions that have relevancy to the csm election id be happy to answer them
its becoming evident that you wish your candidacy in the csm elections to be considered entirely separate from your involvement with goonswarm vile rat i can understand your motivation for this because amongst the game as a whole goons do have a less than savoury reputation terrible forum posters whinethreads local spam dressing up in bee costumes etc etc but what i cant allow you to divorce yourself from is the responsibility for past actions that you yourself may or may not have encouraged or been partially responsible foryou are standing for election with a history of involvement with an organization that i allege did go too far with the witchhunts and did specifically lead us to the current situation with an eve development team that lacks critical knowledge and experience with aspects of the game i say goonswarm is responsible in some measure for this and i dont believe you can stand in this election on a majority support of goon votes and claim to not be involved with that past responsibilityyou are more politically adroit than your drooling accomplices in this thread i will grant but your repeated evasion of my questons and attempt to sidestep responsibility doesnt really impress why should anyone cast a vote to elect a person who cannot answer a straight question and calls in the clowns from corp chat to save him from embarrassment middebatein the end lets conclude on the agreement that there are certainly many better candidates than you in this election cycle who unfortunately will not be elected because of the organized vote blocks of the ncgoon campaignsyou can take pleasure in the fact and add it with a little relish to your history of behaviour in eve online i will smile and watch the capering antics of your little helpers on this thread and be assured that nothing much changes in the goonswarm
ah ad hominem youre also sounding more than a little odd if youre actually alleging that im taking marching orders from anybody at all anyways let me point out some of your fallacies to you yes there are a few so im not going in any particular order 1 fallacy of begging the question you have made an assumption about why things are the way they are in the game provided no actual proof and then demanded that someone else admit that your conjecture is gospel truth2 hoc ergo propter hoc and post hoc ergo propter hoc you have used as the foundation for your assumption the sequence or coincidence of certain events but provided absolutely no proof of a causal relationship this is similar to the when they removed school prayer from schools society went to hell and the rise of rap music has mirrored the rise of inner city crime arguments 3 fallacy of bifurcation you have crafted a situation where rather than multiple competing influences both internal and external to ccp there is only one possibility and the only valid ways to interact with you on the topic are to admit that you are completely correct or be a dishonest nogoodnik 4 fallacy of ignoring conflicting evidence ccp has made changes to the endgame alliancelevel content some of it like dominion had the express purpose of aiding smaller eg nongoon alliances it not only failed spectacularly but ushered in an age of megalag that dwarfed the state of play during apocrypha and is still wildly unpopular this suggests a reason why ccp might be less than eager to engage in similar changes without overthinking likewise ccp attempted to end the dysprosium bottleneck we saw how well that worked again this suggests why ccp may be less than enthusiastic about making certain changes or may take too much time additionally the fact that they are working on multiple other projects including porting wods engine to eve points to a resource sink to say nothing of the fact that reworking sov andor fixing the ui are massive projects and ccp may believe its a better business decision to alter other facets of the game and so on really youre not coming off all that well in this thread and im not just talking about your antigoon rage
says a lot about a person that a nondirected remark about monkeys gets such a cringingly redfaced defensive rebuttle at random carry on
well gosh i would hope every candidate wants this every candidate is running on their own strengthsweaknesses you see if were just going to throw around personal attacks i dont see how this debate will get any further stop fighting fights from years ago and concentrate on coming together to fix this game please its clear that the immediate issues that we all face are more important than personal grudges and we should be devoting our time to focusing on how to move this game forward im trying hard to extend an olive branch to you despite in game rivalry because this is going to be required of every csm delegate should we be honored with the peoples vote you cant go to the csm as some guy from goonswarm that guy from xdeathx that one dude from the small empire indy corp that would be counterproductive we are all running on the idea that we can make this game a little bit better if we run and if we cant form a cohesive unit to convey your ideas to ccp then our collective voice is weakenedthis is why i reject your attacks and will focus on issues which is what this election should be about thank you i appreciate your supporti feel i would do a good job advocating on the players behalf to get this game fixed ive made my case and feel comfortable that i can do the job if elected you feel differently based on your in game conflict with an alliance im a part of and you use this viewpoint to tarnish your outlook on anything i could say this is sad but i understand it there are many single issue voters out there and i wont be the ideal choice for all of them vilerat for csmthanks everybody be sure to vote early vote often
yeah poor trolling jade i dont think anybody reading along is stupid buy that or if you prefergeez someone is an awful troll oh i didnt see you there jade what a coincidence i know that youre pretty much left only with fiction fallacy fear and failure here but seriously i pointed out calmly and in one line that im hardly following anybodys marching orders that was in direct response to your ahem general comment then i pointed out that the substance of your argument with vile rat is utter garbage and should properly be ignored due to the numerous logical failings that its built on rather than being random that was in direct response to your argument it is telling that your only response is to troll with an ad hominem
was that after you imagined yourself slaying a mightydragon with your 5 sparklesword
roleplaying a space hooker is totally less pathetic than roleplaying a dragon slayer right guys guys
pretty much agree with the op must say i think large scamming ops like dynasty are quite impressive griefing and scamming noobs with copy paste contracts nope not impressive gloating over things like that being a douchebeing a sore loser being a douche so cept for the dynasty dude yup the rest of the candidates are douchebags imho there guess i showed you huh mittens
you should probably explain that remark little goonie i have nothing against dragonslayers certainly but i do think patting oneself down for imaginary forum war accomplishments is a bit sad apologies if the irony went over your head initially
youre funny
q when is ad hominem fallacy not a fallacya when the man is an idiot
this makes it even funnier keep going
i need some more motivation at the moment you are boring me
sorry if this thread isnt what youre used to discussing jade let me helpi put on my robe and spacewizard hatbetter
ok jade as an intelligent guy surely you should be discrediting vile rats campaign by attacking his policies and opinions rather than demeaning yourself by throwing around the csm equivalent of racial slurs
im wondering what moist crevice jade pulled that out from in any case it seems hes running from some truly odd playbook i pointed out and explained several fallacies that undermine jades argument his response is a series of ad hominem fallacies trying to change the subject etc those reading along might perhaps think that jade knows hes got absolutely no argument and is beaten on both facts and logic and can only resort to some thirdrate trolling and personal insults ya know perhaps speaking of how youre trolling again here is what i actually saidi think the reason you cant address the fallacies in your argument is pretty clear as is the reason why youre responding with no u r dum but surprise me actually address the substance of your logical failures rather than furiously trying to handwave them away and babbling about dungeons and dragons
goons deliver in all areas a lot of eve may not like goons however it is hard to beat them in planning and execution and player base inertia consider your enemy he may be an excellent voice for the players yes the 00 mechanics suck we all know this we behave this way because we must play the game this way to winyou speak of aristocracy but i believe that the real aristocracy in this equation is ccp a lot of very bitter vets are what make up the core of the clusterthing the csm is our only legitimate voice and we can make our house of reprsentatives stronger in the face of  ccp aristocracy  eve is a funny game we play the creators as much as any other faction
oh my my thread has turned into jade vs vile rat what to do about thisshrugspopcorn
i dont really see how a scammer is incapable of leading s the real reasons you shouldnt vote for goons is because they want to destroy 00 and make it impossible to pvp anymore while punishing anything that isnt nc who really cares if they are love to brown nose and scambesides goons arent even good scammers if anything people should be flaming them for being so bad at scammingalso
which is why the mittani has endorsed drf candidates a pandemic legion candidate and seleene this is similar to your lie in another thread that the drf killed 50 of the ncs caps youre so obviously just about trolling the goons that you cant even bother to put any effort into it and make it good trolling
report your thread or the posts it may get locked then as its against the forum rules  offtopic posting is not allowed offtopic posts are not prohibited but should be posted within reason excessive offtopic posts that derail a thread may result in the thread being locked on topic whatever a guy does in character within eula boundaries says nothing or not a lot about what he will do out of character do you not trust a person in real life because he plays on the terrorist team in some first person shooter
in truth that part is over vile rat understands there is little to be gained from debating the issue i raised the various bottomfeeders and sycophants posting routine meme nonsense are largely meaningless last word merchants and will sing themselves to sleep in good time
gee you seem to have accidentally missed this twice now youre not going to actually stop trolling are you
i have so little respect for you i cant even be bothered to quote you think about that for a moment it is quite the modern tragedy
assuming youre following your trollscript your next response is to pretend that you werent even talking to me yet again ive laid out a clear series of labeled and analyzed logical fallacies they show why your argument fails you have instead refused to answer to the failings in your argument and resorted to blatant trolling like i said its very clear why you wont address the logical failings in your argument and why you resort to trolling instead but ill keep giving you chances to actually stop trolling and debate the ideas that you claim to want to discuss so again in case you feel like not trolling
you do realize that obsessively quoting yourself is a sure sign of emadness right
any time youd like to actually discuss the issues rather than prove again that youre only interested in trollingdont worry those reading along can im sure figure out exactly why youre totally unable to answer some very clear and explicit criticisms of your argument and why you can only respond with substandard trolling hint its not because you can honestly defend your argument or you honestly made your argument in the first place
so indulge mewhat would i have to gain from taking you seriously ie not like a mittens bloc frothing alt exactly
ah yes resorting to more obvious ad hominem trolling and the truly insane claim that im an alt again just in case you want to stop trolling and actually address the argument which you claim you honestly madedont worry those reading along can see you refuse to answer very simple well elaborated criticisms of your argument and see you respond with ad hominems and trolling time and again and again and again folks can generally realize exactly why it is that someone is afraid to defend their own argument and why theyll do their best to avoid honest discussion any time now if youd like to stop trolling
finn your over use of the word trolling is getting quite annoying you have branded everyone that isnt in nc as a trollinteresting thread always good to see jc putting others in their place pretty inspiring tbh keep up the great work 3
is this some variation of local copy paste spam now
this thread is terrible and ive read digi postsdamn
mlyp
mlmp 
interesting interpretation
i can only assume the place and position is reverse cowgirl inside the spacepods
it seems like time for a bump and if anyone knows of any corps or alliance based in wormhole space i havent been in touch with drop me a line
winning 1 intorwebsi dont care that i live in 00 only a candidate who is this honest and open can be voted for imhogo windy 
no deception is being woven before you and no one is being dishonest and closed with you with regards to their intentions an artificial champion of your salvation has been created and you have chosen to side with it against a phantom threat general windypops call to arms against the nc has been born out of a personal disagreement with goonswarm and test who have spent the last year laughing at him kalle demos and snot shot on caod their wild horror stories about the dreaded northern coalition are routinely fictitious as are their nostradamuslike predictions about events which never unfold these sorts of acts of unabashed lunacy are well documented in the forums archives and are readily available for viewing and history repeats itself with a fair number of general windypops csm platforms being outright lies
we should have limits on the number of csms allowed from each alliance block just like there are limits on the number of representatives from each geographic region for real countrieswe need more csms like general windypops to help balance the csm council or least slow down the takeover by a faction of eve that does not represent everyone
i agree in fact i dont think we should vote at all what ccp needs to do is just go around polling you and your friends to see who should be on the csm who needs elected representatives when general windypops and lorddanger can give us selected ones i am an admiral so i figure that makes me just about as good as a lord or a general so i should have a say in these things too well anyway just my 02 isk 
dear mr silencefrom the outside it looks like you have what it takes to be a csm however in your op you state you wish to improve the viability of low sec do you have any in game experience in low sec  if so in what capacitydo you also realize that imo all the improvements you list is solely geared towards making low sec into hi sec carebear paradise do you foresee any improvements geared towards the natural inhabitants of low sec aka pirates correct me if im wrong but it seems to me you are trying to make pirating even harder then it already is is this by designi know more carebear traffic could be considered a boon to pirates almost in a similar vain as the introduction of hics has been an unexpected boon to pirates low sec is broken is a mere point of view do you subscribe to that pov  if the answer is yes then what are your qualifications to make that determination best regardsscheroba
good questions lowsec experience  running antipirate combat gangs hauling industry stuff between highsec and low sec running poss in lowsec as base points to 00 mining  lots of mining and some mission runningpirates in lowsec  mostly i am initially trying to attract more carebears into low sec but i still want the danger there but it is just going to be a bit harder for the lowsec pirate but the riches would be more from more carebearslong term i would like to see a network of lowsec gates only useable by low security status pirates a sort of pirate gate network i would also like to see a ransom function so that a pirate can ransom the cargo and potentially either get more isk or get more of teh cargo than would generally drop from a killed ship i do not condone any mechanism that then forces the pirate to liveup to his end of the bargin but would suggest a counter that records the number of ransoms against a toon vs the number of destroys so give the ransomee some idea of what sort of faustian bargin he is getting into i do not think that lowsec is broken i just think that currently there is too much risk for the level of reward by reducing the carebear risk we increase teh reward factor of both sides and by looking at other compensations for the pirates to even out the increased risk to them we should be able to strike a good balance that will be palatable to both sides neither will love it but both should gain from the changes which is my ultimate goal pirates trade off new gates and better targets for an increased risk of operating in lowsec i am not talking about a huge increase either my npc spawn would be like 10864 for 4321 sort of idea they do not scramble and they do slighly more damage than gate guns so you can tank them for a while but not for ever combined with gate or station guns the tank time shrinks but it is not instapop like concorddoes that answer your question
it answers some of the questions your lowsec experience seems biased toward carebear antipirate which is fine each to their own you want to buff carebears nerf pirates check granted more carebears means more targets but why make it even harder on pirates and easier on the carebears imo you should walk the proverbial mile in the shoes of a pirate before you become in my mind a credible voicethat being said i kinda like the idea of 10 ss gates only my only concern is how to make it balanced ive actually had a rl discussion about the this subject with teadaze which also highlighted the overpoweredness of these gates the ransom thingie is something id very much like to seei thank you for your time answering my questions though i would like you to walk the previously mentioned mile in the shoes of pirate before imo you make somewhat blanket statements like make life harder for the pirateenjoy the free bumpbest regardsscheroba
granted most of my lowsec is more carebearish than pirate while not being a pirate myself i still agree that it is a valid choice of playstyle i guess what i am trying to say is that in my opinion the major issue with lowsec is that for the level of reward offered and the level of risk involved it is not a good investment risk approximately the same as 00 for much less rewardi think the rewards offered in lowsec are about right if we increase the rewards all that will do is attract the 00 alliances to setup shop in lowsec to harvest the rewards then neither the pirates nor the highsec carebears winfactional warfare is becomming more blob like which inturn means less opportunities for pirates technically they could blob up and join the escaltion circle but for me and some good friends that are pirates pirates have always been about small quick raids over large blob warfare and i would want to encourage that mentality to continue but to do that you have to encourage more easy targets into lowsec not more large groupsit is not an easy issue to solve in one step and truthfully i am not supposed to solve it i can make suggestions to ccp and if i get onto the csm i can give feedback on their suggested fixes but i do not solve it i have some ideas that i will suggest ccp investigatesbut as i stated before i am not out to ruin the lowsec experience for pirates and would not support any solution that did i would just like a bit more balance but in a way that will bring greater opportunity for the pirates though they might have to work a bit harder to fully realise themas for the gate network thing i can also see ways to exploit the system but i am sure that there will be some other ways to counter most of the negative effects of thisagain these are ideas of mine they are not set in stone the only thing that is set in stone is i want ccp to look at lowsec and how they can increase use levels of the systemsthanks for listening
i pleid for a longer campaign period between the day that the list of candidates is being published until the day that voting will start and shorten the time that you are able to cast your votesalso an overall notethe whole period of intense campaigning is now a whole monthi say thats too long we have a real life family kids
when you map out the trends of csm 5 and those visible of csm 6 sofar and establish a few projections theres a fair chance that the running up time next term will be up to 2 times that length independant of participation within csm topic environments and community environmentspersonally it would be wonderful to see some insight in referral tracking independant media blogosphere jita park comunity forums not the general eve forums social media etc it would also be interesting to see how heavy the in game viral activity is evemail based for keywords and sent by candidates  altssame for votes per day per candidate would be damn interesting especially in light of politisation of the concept but also block vote trends and matching events to timelines of trendsalsoplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesread the blog and voteplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesread the blog and vote
yo santorine checking in vote for prom im serious unlike a lot of the other candidates who spend their time spying on each other metagaming and calling each other the nword in local prometheus is the real deal hes a true soloist he understands the game deeply most importantly he understands what things in eve need to change and what things should not be changed hes the voice that smallgang and pvpfocused players need on the csm dont delay vote prom today ssantorineblack legionmath department
good luck
impressed bump for a hardworking independent with the experience of 4 csm terms exactly what the doctor ordered amid all the partisanblock vote stuff
this time more than everthanks for the votes 
a bump for a friend an alliance mate and an excellent player  ive had the chance to have long talks with meissa about eve and ive got to say im impressed by his excellent view of all the aspects of the game in their globality i trust him to make the right choices for the game and the universe we all enjoy
1 meissa
guys guys ass spergers is a very serious illness why do you make fun of these people when they are clearly suffering
well id vote for ya except im still waiting for goon members threats to come true i waited 17 months in iraq for them to fly over and wup my but i had to go home and they still can not find an airport other than that if finn supports you that means you really are an idiot but the fact your making old csm 5 members foam at the mouth is just to good to pass up giving you my 6 votes
we couldve gotten our guy in iraq to do this for you but he rented a chevy cobalt after going awol and then made the inside of it really dirty
youre too wouldnt want you to look like an idiot eh
haha like the chevy deal no finn you can look like an idiot all by yourself what got bored with disagreeing in the mirror talking to your self is bad or at least thats what the va says hahaha
the word idiot is not a proper noun you do not capitalize it itd just be nice if you could write on an eighth grade level if youre going to be tossing around insults about someones intellect is all oh and laughing at your own comments makes you look slightly unhinged
makes you look slightly unhingedah if only mastery of the english language equated to votes
very good you caught a typo speaking of unhinged is there any possibility for a sequel
im not entirely sure whats going on here but ill happily accept 6 votes
ok ill admi to sperging a little earlier i do generally stand by my statements but i could have caged them better my excuse however is that i really dont like you in space its nothing personal just the way you can so easily spout off some of the campiest rhetoric i have seen since the last insert extreme irl political group here rally i watched where they slandered insert irl political group here and get away with itits bad dinner theater at bestso anyways sorry for sperging but good lord your campaign is depressingly succesful for the primitive level of slick thats in itquestion though you said before you are highy arrogant which is expected for any space royalty however do you feel that arrogance will be a hindrance to a collaborative group setting followup question whats the difference between ego and arrogancesecond followup now that goons are napfest nc candy pants troopers how in gods name can you undock with any sense of pride moreover how could anyone respect a leader if emeritus of a group who napped nc and yet claims to be anything other than a rainbow bright auxilliary especially when they claim that they are hardcore i mean seriously im 12 convinced your account got hacked by im down
goons are hardcore elite space pvpers and youre right our pride and honour have been tarnished since joining with the napfest nc blobpact i have been talking to all the other hardcore elite pvpers in goonswarm and we are all fed up with space royalty themittani and his cowardly blob tactics that bring shame upon us all
actually whats depressing is that there are people such as yourself who think they understand what they see in this campaign at the first level and point their fingers saying aha i see through you when they themselves are the dupes not comprehending that there are layers beyond their vaunted insights i run one of the most effective coalitions in the game not because i beat my chest and say arr rarr rarr i am a space mitten but because im a chill guy and easy to get along with unless youre one of my enemies in which case im a sociopath who gives a weve never cared about space honor or elite pvp in fact were terrible at eve online a bad game  since were mostly newbies in rifters newbies in rifters who hate ehonor elite pvp snobs are the natural enemy of goonswarm and always have been entities like bob or tri make us curl our lips into a sneer instinctively those are the people who say that newbies have no place in 00 they say we should know our place their anger and rage as their oldguard game was upended by us was incredibly satisfyingdunno where you get the where is your space pride nc nc nc crap perhaps youve been looking at a goonswarm in an alternate universe that did not revolve around buttes and dongues
errybody loves goonswarm buttes dongues and rifters except those who stand in the way of the jihad
maybe youre right its just that your platform is composed solely of i will make it all better with the loosechange music playing in the background i dont understand what youre even running on other than that let me repost my original statement with regards to thati realize that this is a somewhat unfair argument but i hope you can appreciate that space leadership means  in the real worldwas worth a shot maybe next time but it has a lot to do with who can be a collaborative leader and who can be a dictatorweve never cared about space honor or elite pvp in fact were terrible at eve online a bad game  since were mostly newbies in rifters newbies in rifters who hate ehonor elite pvp snobs are the natural enemy of goonswarm and always have been entities like bob or tri make us curl our lips into a sneer instinctively those are the people who say that newbies have no place in 00 they say we should know our place their anger and rage as their oldguard game was upended by us was incredibly satisfyingdunno where you get the where is your space pride nc nc nc crap perhaps youve been looking at a goonswarm in an alternate universe that did not revolve around buttes and donguesto be fair this is more a troll than anything but napping nc isnt a problem because it shows how you are bad at pvp napping nc is a problem because it shows that you are part of the problem the nc naptrain is a big part of what is wrong with null and yall just bought into it like everyone else who is either too weak or lacks the ambition to carve something out for yourselvesbut like i said more of a trollserious question what do you think of the stakeholder status
ive been passively mining in eve for 3 years now between work and school and am admittedly still a total noob to 95 of eve content especially lowsec and nullsecand though the mittanis platform and attitude alone would have me vote for him even though i have no clue whats at stakei still fail to see why this huge game company would care whether the csm is united or not whether anyone on this pet group is a bastard or is a lawyer irl or notfrankly i dont see why any of this matters after pretty much everyone involved has already expressed that the csm has no real powersemper fi4th tanks 4th mardiv miami fl
bump 
you are a pew pew pilotsound like a angry carebear to me
sorry for the subtlety but nobody knows where this data dump came from im personally confident that its on the level but as a business ccp has to proceed cautiously and investigate these names if you had a list of 2000 people who bought isk and you were the type of person to try to blackmail the seller which is what happened wouldnt you be tempted to add a halfdozen or a dozen enemies to it right before you made it publicfair enough not all blogs are for everyonealso fair enough and it turns out that two out of the four people involved in the lost in eve debates chose me as a candidate that they either will or probably will support
got my vote
im an avid reader of your blog very knowledgeable and informative you have my vote
consider yourself endorsed
congratulations you know that eves ui is horrible surely you are the first csm candidate to ever mention this to ccp that must make you the al gore of eve ui improvements of course the ui is crap of course one way to improve the ui would be to give players the tools to come up those improvements on their own is there anyone with any sense who has ever said otherwise no one is saying that you dont support the most obvious ways to improve the eve online experience were saying that your unique ideas are so abominably bad that ccps development team would have to be hopped up on a gallon of rotten shark liquor to give any of them credence hint if none of your ideas are taken seriously you are a waste of an international plane ticketa candidate is judged by the views which distinguish them from everyone else not the consensus opinions virtually every pilot holds your ideas  your actual conceivedbytrebor unique ideas  are godawful no you cant claim credit for fix the ui as a unique idea well i guess you can tryyou and mittens also agree that the sky is often blue that water is wet and that trees are usually made of wood he does anyway i asked if you do make it onto the csm heaven forbid and meet in the flesh theres probably no end to the things that the two of you will find you in common do you have two arms two legs and a head hey so does mittens do you consume organic matter to stay alive mittens does that tooso yes lets amend our official statement in re your candidacy trebor daehdoow is an idiot whose ideas regarding the direction that eve online should take are dangerous and ludicrous he personally came up with the idea that eves ui is bad just kidding mister vice presidentalso you call it a smear campaign because its you we call it educating the electorate
so basically youre just trying to say that since the idea isnt original it doesnt countpray tell what awesome ideas can mr mittens claim to be his own then if its gonna be ranting and raving and being an ass i got bad news for you
in the spirit of educating the electorate and so that i dont appear to be making unfounded assertions lets review some of trebors terrible terrible ideaspinball style doomsdays which would be the fourth change to doomsdays and which was shamelessly stolen from the empyrean age trailer oh and it would do nothing to mitigate titan proliferationsupport for dominionstyle sov changes that have produced the opposite of their intended effect enlarging and entrenching nullsec power blocs instead of shrinking them and making it easier to invade bloated onescumulative local chat delays making it nearly impossible to say more than a few things in local before the delay becomes unbearable i guess this is supposed to fix local spam which is a massive concern as local spam is killing evesome wacky scheme to encrypt packets travelling between the server and client i dont even know what thats supposed to fix but is sure could ruin a lot of thingsreduce fleet sizes by making the client behave even worse than it already does in large fleet fights or maybe it would behave better at the cost of making it impossible to actually fight who knows itll never happen so who caresdont ban bots just let people in empire shoot them fun fact he fails to realize that the problem is detection not enforcement at least hell get iskbankcoms votei could go on seriously just look for his posts on evesearch hes a crazyposting machine but do i really need to
no im saying that seeking validation for his campaign by saying oh mittani and i agree on this one thing ergo i should be taken seriously is ridiculous as for mittens  id refer you to his campaign thread but something tells me it would be like throwing a wicker basket into a well youd get wet but you wouldnt retain much
im not voting for helen to begin with and id like to hear his explanation as to why he didnt do more to stop this as for vuk and elvenlord lets ignore the fact they didnt speak out against it since as you said they werent there for the rest it doesnt really matter to me where they came from as my point was that anyone who thinks removing jump bridges is a good idea is pretty clueless about how nullsec works and isnt getting my support
i entirely agree that the mittani says that he wants these issues addressed but he has produced no evidence that he actually does want them addressed actions speak louder than words and since he has no track record on the csm until he is actually elected no one can know what he really intendsfurthermore it should be observed that from a metagame standpoint a nerf that hurts you is fine as long as it wounds your opponents more deeply so the argument that i must be honest because i want to nerf this and it would hurt my mates is disingenuousthe devil as always is in the detailsill give you the most probable explanation it is because he like everyone else in the room understood that what was going on was a very highlevel discussion aimed at helping ccp define the parameter space of potential changes the question wasnt should bridges be killed in isolation but rather is killing bridges totally out of bounds as part of a package of changes that makes sensein reality jump bridges are unlikely to get anything more than a gentle nerf as part of a package of changes but i personally think its important for the gd staff to consider outrageous ideas from time to time sure most of the time those trips into the outer darkness will come to nothing but occasionally theyll find a nugget of goldfinally i would like to point out that i have consistently advocated that the devs subject their plans for big changes like a nullsec revamp to public tigerteaming by player experts  while they are still just on paper no matter how knowledgable the 15 members of the csm are on any particular issue there are 150 players out there who know more ccp should use that resource  its just good business  instead of hiding behind their players dont do game design mantra even if players dont do game design no game design survives contact with the players so better for that to happen as early as possiblethe csm with its unique position straddling two worlds connected to the players and under nda to ccp is in a perfect position to organize and moderate such discussions and produce a position document that will be useful to the devs sort of a summit report in reverse if you will
you dont think empyrean age style dd would be cool boring goons are boringand he never claimed the change would mitigate titan proliferation and the use of the words giggles comedy value and a note that it was a mischievous suggestion should indicate that you are looking too hard for dirtyour comment makes no sense in relation to his comment and if anything his comment is closer to what dominion was supposed to be not what it became as such we have no idea if the planned dominion changes would have enabled smaller independent alliances entry to 00local spam is a gs weapon of choice so of course youll find the suggestion stupiddont worry you dont need to know that stuff yet still manage to live a perfectly happy lifepreloading data encryption and topics such as those arent easy to understand for lay people if you want an example of the use of preloaded data in the client just check out that thing that comes up on the screen when you enter your password thats preloaded dataalso you could read up on wikipedia about encryption onetime pad encryption should give a nice introduction to why it wouldnt necessarily ruin everything of course they wouldnt use onetime pads since they need to be the same size for theoretically unbeatable encryption and there would need to be additional measures in place to make it difficult to guess the content type by size and timing but those are implementation detailsi believe it was tamber or someone who said he also had wacky ideas like that until ccp gave the csm delegates a lecture of what the real problems with fleet lag werenor would irelands hunger crisis a few centuries be solved if the nobility started eating babies of poor families which was the last time someone made a modest proposaltrebor even said in the post it isnt the way to deal with lag but rather a starting point for discussiontrebor was talking about punishment for botting not detection of botting a subtle but important distinction that is easy to miss when youre running a mud slinging campaign rather than trying to foster productive discussion
at what point in time have you come up with the belief that csm delegates are personally responsible for raising and passing every proposal mentioned since the inception of the councilwe the players come up with the suggestions to be raised with ccp and while any member of the csm is also considered a player their ideas are raised in the same fashion as you or i would do to liken an idea to a candidates potential is ridiculous at best would you also argue that silly ideas have no place in the brainstorming process would you disagree that all ideas no matter how stupid contribute to other thoughts or aha moments for otherssurely you devilish ledoux have become the personal authority of all human beings on what is considered acceptable thought and you personally are the sole author and editorinchief as to what constitutes proper ideas you may disagree until the sun collapses to a white dwarf about a particular idea or thought and that is your freelyentitled opinion but you cannot go about dismissing the ideas of others because you the sole authority of thought believe the content is foolisheven mittens isnt that arrogant and hes pretty high up there
the original aoe doomsday was cool that didnt stop it being a terrible ideaif its a good idea you should be able to defend it on its own merits rather than attacking its detractorscongratulations you successfully defended the how from all the zero people who doubted it now have a go at the whyideas which are presented as a fix for one thing which only hold merit because they also fix another issue the candidate happens to support in this case blob warfare are dangerous if you cant defend an idea for something as fundemental as fixing lag without bringing party politics into play then that idea is a bad idea
doesnt that rather discredit the rest of the meticulouslycrafted froth youve posted on this thread devilish that you are relying on a oneline kneejerk  what is that even personal attack paintive moan naming fetish not sure to defend yourself from my allegation that one of your candidates comes from a culture of abusing volunteer status for character advancement and probably cant be trusted not to seek personal or alliance advantage through the csm medium is rather sadyes devilish ledoux i am jade constantine a player of this game with a long record of never cheating exploiting breaking ndas or otherwise bringing the game into disrepute a player who managed previously to stand for open election and win outright against the goon block vote and had mostly positive interactions with all concerned in iceland despite advocating a shake up of 00 mechanics that was vigorously opposed by the goonleadership because it would make it more difficult for them to hold large areas of spacei am seeing similar echoes in this new election and similar issues from your friends devilish there is something broken in 00 we all know this somehow the fun has gone for a lot of people its become too mechanical too stactic too boring but its simple human nature that those who are benefiting most from the boredom and stasis will want to maintain the statusquo and hence the ncgoon electorial strategy to fill the csm with reactionary dupes on a brief to assure ccp than nothing should change againnow you can certainly respond with the plaintive cry but its jade constantine again but if you do then dont feel wounded to the quick that other responders here will read your words as just another mitani alt  after all live by the meme die by the meme
the current singletarget deathray is also cool but that doesnt stop it from being a better idea than previous aoe versionso have we established now that you cant judge an idea based on calling it cool or pingpong also the post was made in response to the devblog detailing the dd change so you cant make the argument that it would be the fourth change as the third change wasnt even on tranquilitythats just stupid but its the kind of stupid you get when alas you go digging for dirt and ignoring contextno i shouldntwhy cause were dealing with completely different and incompatible views of what spam is and that leads inevitably to what i wrote abovei can argue why the solution he posted would be worth considering what corner cases we would need to take care off what effect it might have however all that would be like ing in the wind when it comes to convincing your side as we have different goals if you feel this is wrong and you really do want a system that heavily and fairly suppresses local chat during large fleet engagements ill be willing to oblige you or trebor mightahh so it would not ruin a lot of things as previously claimedgood seems the point got across thenon the why side i admit this suggestion isnt really applicable to eg warping to a heavily populated grid yet not because it wouldnt cut down on the load time by a significant amount of seconds for many people but rather because it isnt the right optimization at this moment imhowhat they should and likely have considered is to put a grid caching server between the player and the sol node which would transfer the grid and system state to the client this would offload the work needed to populate the clients grid away from the sol node which causes the majority of the lag in large fleet engagements due to being limited to a single threadafter that is done encrypted packets would be easy to add to deal with network lag the why in your questionyou cannot have any serious discussion regarding fixing lag in general without also including the issue of too many pilots gathering on a single grid that is a fundamental aspect of this issue one you cannot ignoreits kinda like trying to solve the budget shortfall by only dealing with discretionary spending and something that isnt party politics its reality
i never made that claim i merely pointed out the irony that the mittani made a big deal out of a moddable ui just as i did last year and if you bother to read the manifesto and thread you will note i carefully addressed most of the big concerns about addon exploitabilityi understand that you dont like some of my ideas and have no problems with that but at least i have ideas and i have the courage to put them out there where people can criticize them and then modify or even abandon them after due reflectionoh and as for that laundry list of my alleged crimes against mentality andrea griffin and rakshasa taisab have done an excellent job of ripping it to shredsmoving to claims that im an idiot anyone bothering to check my wikipedia page will find that i have a 30year track record of being the exact opposite if the page seems vandalized wait a few minutes the longsuffering wikipedia staff will fix it and id like to thank the goons for by trying to get it deleted theyve not only ensured itll stay around for a long time but have also gotten some people involved in improving and expanding itso while i will take any coherently and politely expressed objections you might have to any of my current positions very seriously indeed you will forgive me if my response and that of those who know me to claims that i am an idiot is one of mild amusement
this is a very cool pictureplease visit your user settings to reenable images
you seem to have confused me for devilish ledoux i in no way support leaving something broken just because it has changed enough already but a chained doomsday is terrible for the same reason an aoe doomsday is terrible in fact the whole concept behind titans is terrible but thats not really something i see ccp changing at this pointif you honestly believe that any idea hated by someone you dislike needs no other merit than that then sorry youre fundamentally broken as a human being if youre willing to change your mind on that issue then ill ask how you feel people using local during a fleet fight is detrimental to your gameplay to the extent that it needs changing right now all im hearing is but i dont like it make it stop and minimizing your chat window is a solution to that problem without impacting anyone elses gameplayagain i am not devilish ledouxim slightly out of date on my dev blogs but its stupid to suggest technical implementation solutions to problems you dont even know exist if your grid caching server solves lag on the server side why do you need client side caching and all the security and concurrency headaches it brings ive never seen eve come even close to maxing my internet connectionthis is a technical fix for a human problem youre advocating making the game broken by design for large fights rather than encouraging people to form small fights the danger comes from the hidden agenda of breaking up blobs which i only ever hear from people not involved in them clouding the issue of lag if youre willing to accept such a broken fix for lag because it also furthers your antiblob message then that is a bad thing
i did notice youre not that other goon however you cannot argue for his position and then cop out later with the i didnt say that he did cardhowever i am willing to concede that devilish ledoux made a stupid argument there and agree not to hold it against youbut to say chained and aoe dd is terrible for the same reasons ignores what really makes aoe terrible damage will be done to all ships on grid it scales to infinity while chained and singletarget are finite and to point out that titans are terrible in general is kinda offtopic as criticism that goes beyond the merits of the dd suggestion relative to aoe and singletarget dd in demanding titanconcept reevaluation misses the distinction of incremental and systematic improvementsone of the major reasons for political strife is that the opposing sides do not realize the other side holds fundamentally different view on the world and thus imagine those against their views are idiots who cant make even the simplest of reasoningmy point was that by assuming trebors suggestion was idiocy you and that other guy are making such a fallacy this does not preclude a discussion on the actual issue causing the disagreement but it does mean calling the proposal for idiocy is in itself idiocyi didnt say grid caching solves server side lag i said the sol node being singlethreaded causes the lagif trebor had asked in corp chat about this before posting i would have told him why his solution probably isnt the right one and that the above suggestion would likely be better the how does not solve the why and trebor has acknowledged that after having heard more details from ccpwhat im arguing here however is that the how and the why werent as idiotic and unsafe as was claimed and it is the details of the issues not allowing for it not the suggestions themselves being unworkablethe above misrepresents what i wrote to such a degree that it isnt possible to make a reply that would put the discussion back on track except to say take a deep breath relax then imagine yourself as being me writing these past few posts as you read them
pardon me for interrupting this wonderful discussion but i just wanted to mention that team bff has published a nice little devblog about some potholes that they have filled
theres a reason i just quoted your post initially rather than his as well a lot of suggestions come from both ccp and the general playerbase which are cool ideas but would totally ruin the game the original titan doomsday is one of those as i see it the csm partially exists to tell both partys when their cool idea is badif the idea of a ship that does fatal or almost fatal damage to any or multiple ships on grid is broken as i strongly believe it is then no incremental improvements are going to fix that for what its worth i really liked the initial announcement of titans when they were alliance level mobile logistics bases but youre right this is far too off topic for this threadtry me ive been in goonfleet since before it was a corp i was a director for 3 years ive joined a fofo chain perhaps twice ive had conversations with friends both allied and hostile in local before during and after fleet engagements more times than that id be interested to hear why the latter should be taken away from people because of the formermy intention was to clarify my post rather than misrepresent yours if you got the wrong impression im sorry ive went back and read my original comment and it wasnt very clearok but at this point this is your idea not trebors the only real link it has to the original proposal is that it attempts to fix lag are you running for csm can i vote for you sure the discussion might have started from trebors post but thats not really grounds for a csm position anyone can throw ideas at the wall in the speakers corner
championed the removal of learning skillsresponsible for the player polling systemspork awardshow can you go wrong with that track record dyou got my vote for whatever it may be worthgood luck in the polls 
i completely agree with you on that latter point but i do not believe that this is the case hereany discussion of longterm fixes to lag have to address some fundamental design constraints that are inherent in the eve architecturethe most obvious of these are the total amount of cpu horsepower available to process combat activities in a single system is limited to the resources of a single core at present no matter how good a job team gridlock does of making individual combat actions more efficient there will always be a maximum number of actions that can be processed and thus pilots supported before the node starts lagging clever fixes such as running individual grids on their own cores are both difficult and only delay the problem the current game mechanics provide a positive incentive to blob  more ships is almost always better thus fleet sizes expand to fit the lag availabletherefore it follows that one possible longterm solution to lag is changes to the gamemechanics that provide positive incentives for combat commanders to divide their forces into smaller groups with independent objectives in other words so that 2 fleets of 250  hopefully doing things on different nodes  are more useful than one fleet of 500 two basic ways to do this are a adjust the fleetsizefleetpower curve so that after a certain point adding extra ships doesnt help you much andor b tweaking sovwarfare so that it requires the simultaneous achievement of multiple objectivesi merely described one possible way to do a as an illustration of the design challenge and to stimulate discussion i made no claims that it was the only way or the best wayi encourage you to challenge the assumptions i have made above and my conclusions but please dont conflate being antiblob with being antibigbattle it is entirely possible to be antiblob while at the same time being probigbattlefrom a player perspective the real problem with a lot of big nullsec battles is that they arent so much 500v500 fights as 1v1 the two fleet commanders square off and most of the other players target primaries press f1 and wait to get alphad yes this is a bit of an oversimplification but i think you get my pointif you agree with that assessment then reread my manifesto from last year and note how the gods eye view limitations i proposed would greatly increase the ability of individual players to take bold actions that might the outcome of a battle i believe this to be a desirable goalwhatever your opinion of the idea itself i do not believe you can reasonably argue that it was not thoughtfully and honestly presentedps amusingly enough one of the changes that team gridlock has implemented  serializing updates  makes it more difficult to implement fogofwar visibility limitations
the highlevel goal of breaking up large fights isnt the point of any of this because peoples concerns about your candidacy isnt your ability to set highlevel goalscsm members must to serve as a firewall against bad ideas getting into the game in addition to highlevel goal setting that means that csm members need to be able to look at a proposed idea with a critical eye think about all of its implications and side effects and then react accordingly if csm members cant do that we end up gamebreaking things like the supercap imbalance the tech imbalance the mindnumbing sov grind worthless faction warfare and lots of other thingsyour inability to vet even your own ideas much less other peoples is the problem trying to distract people from that by derailing this into a conversation about highlevel goals doesnt change that
the trouble with any artificial limit on the number of players in a fight is it inflates the value of skillpoints by a huge amount if i can only put 100 people on a grid before they start to disappear then why should i bring the guy in the rifter at all when i could just take another maelstrom pilot why bring the t1 maelstrom pilot when i could bring a t2 pilot its arguable that this is currently the case with supercaps but i dont see any candidate arguing to keep that and what if i bring the rifter pilots anyway but they end up on grid with the tengus and get slaughtered what about ships that rely on range and transversal to survive such as ecm and logistics which incidentally operate outside the 1v1 of fleet commanders most of the timebringing fewer players than the artificial limit doesnt really work either if the limit is 100 and i bring 50 and my enemy drops 100 on me im still outnumbered its just now my fleet is split down arbitrary and constantly changing bordersmost mmo players are fairly passive goonfleet made a big deal of the directors taking eve seriously so the members dont have to and this extends to fleet commanding people dont like responsibility and very few people handle having it suddenly thrust on them its why dps classes are far more popular than tanks or healers in classic mmos like wow expecting them to start leading a fleet when they get split by artificial grid restrictions is asking too much 99 of the timeby slapping fog of war on large fleet battles youre punishing people for bringing large numbers instead you should be providing motivation for them to be more than one place at once basic carrot vs stick stuff
bump for a good candidate
yea vote for draco
draco draco draco draco
glad we could we think youd make a great member of the csm
finnagainwe have all seen you falling all over yourself for mittani on these forums but who are these other staffers you mention
thank you for the free bump please keep up the support
just got the most amazing offer of a large pirate alliance voting block for only 600 million isk wow i want you guys to know you should go ahead and vote for me and i am sure i will get your isks after i win seriously nice try i love eve for just this very thingof course in the mean time carebears send a message with your voteissler dainzethe voice of reason csm candidate
after readingskimming through your manifesto it dawns on me your intentions is to eradicate piracy from the game or turn low sec into some sort of hisec light versionyou speak of having pirates work for their killsprey which makes me wonder if you even grasp what piracy entails from your manifesto for lack of a better description yet you want ccp to do the hard work for you by getting low sec concord implemented in other words remove the risk from low sec perma camps in low sec are easily avoided or bypassed better still why dont you get those teeth and claws into action and i dont know bust that perma camp anyways enjoy the free bumpbest regardsscheroba
i most definitely do not want to eliminate piracy it is essential to the game what i do want is to make low sec s place that provides more rewards to the types of players that often are the very targets pirates seek and to get the combat to move from gate camps to roving gangs in the systemthe riskreward balance is very broken in low secissler dainzethe voice of reason csm candidate
2 issler
i think he is the most interesting candidate for this jobi vote himand i hope that something finaly will changeexpecially the dying mining the part of the game that i love more than others and its oppressed
when i first started wed all mine crokite and it was good money mining itself has always been boring but you get a couple friends on ts all heavily drunk and mining can become kinda fun in a way im not going to say mining is a great option for most but it is a problem that one of the main pve experiences has been ruined by mission loot refuse and drone region mineral supply there has to be a point in the end even if you hate mining then support mining overhaul because you love hunting miners if you can safely refine your way to a healthy mineral economy then mining has no point behold my first mining ship
did you read my comments on evenews24 check my reply at bottom as well as my initial response for my official campaign view thanks for the votes guys i need all i can get did you see helicity said i was getting her vote hmmmm  that and the recent press from around the web should help out immensely darius iii just because my official campaign video for csm features a monkey raping a goatit doesnt mean i dont take my eve seriouslythe revelation and scope of the leak in addition to the way it has been covered may well prove a pivotal milestone in changing ccps approach to cheating botting and rmt the scope and intensity of the leak and what the data suggest is shocking this is a major embarassment to both ccp and of course iskbankcom and will provide intense backlash from honest players article continues belowarticle
wrong venue or not i want one too
aura for android is excellent and with the new api might even see eve mail support in the future
thank you for your vote mr snow  about the rp benefits of a more realist universe its not so much that i disregard them but i know for a fact that most of these things will not be accepted by ccp for the moment also i have a strong feeling that before adding such changes much simpler yet critical changes could go great goodfor example as far as microtransactions go one things that was recently discussed was the possibility of switching bloodline  race for a plex this is an idea i fully support for a lot of the roleplayers i know picked up the wrong race  bloodline when creating their character due to a newcomers view on the background and couldnt trash their character when they understood their mistake as the sp loss would be too much to bear i myself biomassed my first iteration of gehen made before understanding that he had to be amarrin that same vein but requiring more work would be the implementation of the missing bloodlines im afraid ccp might scream at the wait so we must do new 3d characters templates  part thusi very much agree that devil is in the details but i precisely think that some smaller and easier to fix systems could use some detail work before taking on something as big as the physics engine
hmm you did quite good for me in the vote match thing better than the other guy i might vote for and the other guy is kinda quiet on his important to him roleplay subjectif you get elected i will fill you in on my gripes in relation to rp
i was asked today about my pvp experience and what my stats was pretty average as shown in the following linkbutch leupold killboardkeep on voting  we are almost there
i think the most important issue determining whether you will be elected this campaign is how many technetium moons do you own
if that is your sole determining factor then you will not be voting for me hope you find a candidate that best meets your requirements
38 stark rayner won 100m isk chribba dice
smallfry compared to the 500 or so billion he scammed i cant believe people are actually voting for someone that glorifys ripping others off sheesh
why does everyone have such an issue with scammers surely its the people that get scammed that are the idiots
sweet  cheersscammings an important part of eve i wouldnt want a csm member who didnt understand that
this draw thing is a really good idea thumbs up
seconded just like in the real world
thirded whats the point of bringing someone to the csm who doesnt seem to understand what many people find so great about the game
from that threadi lold
even funnier in light of
a vote for me is a vote for improved balancing and a vote for sanity white tree for csm
if i werent at the pub right now id be voting for you
all i can say is lawl  barqs and old atlas crew
yeah aka kicked for being too gay for them bunch of homophobes
hey dont have a go at me i want you to be in the csm p
in real life countries limit the number of representatives elected by geographic regioncan the majority of the csm can be taken over by the ncgoon blocksimply by putting up a huge number of candidates on the voting match page from the same alliance block with each ncgoon candidate voicing different positions for each issue the odds of a typical eve player finding a goon match is too high will these ncgoons actually stick true to their issue positions or will they bow to the real ncgoon leaders and comply with the wishes of their alliance after they win election
in real life if more people live in one area they deserve a larger representationnow what the nc does have going for them is that most nullsec players have 5 accounts they are voting with where as the awesome mission gameplayers might have one maybe twoif you dont like it subscribe for more accounts
heh this leads to oneparty system who wants ncgoon to establish a oneparty communist csm
this can easily be exploited you can just do what most of them do notice two shots who foolishly did this too late hahaha leave the powerblock create a corp of their own with something like vote 4 mei should have really ran for csm this year looked like alot of fun d i probably wouldnt have got in unless voting for selfcountedoh well we will still have this special momentremember guys a vote for nc is a vote for buffing supercaps buffing number warfare and nerfing pvp

guys guys my disability defines me im special because of my disabilityoh god stop focusing on my disability unless youre being niceweve got avalloc in our alliance he cant walk is deaf and has palsy we poke fun at him constantly and hes fine with it he cant walk and he has more of a spine than you
alright turn down the flames and arguments over that which is not important what is important is the candidates stance on a number of issues insights and qualifications dont vote out of sympathy or hate vote for what you feel is going to make eve a better game for people all people to play
youre referring to the goons in general here i presume im glad to hear it as its certainly a step up in the world
so whats good for the goons is good for everyone else right
with supporters like bomberlocks who needs detractors
actually he shows he does have a brain and hearth that he uses

awareness that longwinded speeches annoy people  awareness of feelings of others and the effects of their actions and behaviors  social and emotional reciprocityselfdiagnosed sperger detectedbut more relevantly that you claim to be involved in second life and a modder has absolutely no bearing on csm csm has an extremely bad track record for pitching ideas to ccp and not for lack of trying but rather because ccp doesnt want to hear it from ccps perspective csm is a sounding board a committee to review the things ccp puts before them and give it the smell test further your concerns about empire piracy and wanting for new ships indicates that you have at best a flimsy grasp of the problems with currently affect the stability of the environment and the health of the game communityit is more important that a candidate have experience with the breadth of the game and the willingness to say no to ccp then that they have any prior knowledge of game modification at allcsm has more in common with jury duty then video game modding
bump
my only hang up with the game is the time it takes to learn skills and the only problem i have with it is the 15 day time it takes 7 to 9 maybe but it kills the game and it seems to put you at a stand still so my question on this is where do all of you stand on that topic or do you not mind the 15 days it takes for one skill please honest answers i would just like to knowi know ur not going to be able to change the game completely and thank you
call me when you have to train gallente titan to 5
there you go it takes foreverfor some of these skills which slows game play some people dont like sitting around for a month for 2 skills or less in some peoples cases
the solution is to earn enough isk to purchase a character with the skills already trained otherwise select a skill and sit back and wait like everyone else
for most t1 items or ships you can fly or use them within 23 weeks t2 is considered specialised and can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to use most subcap ships can be stepped into in under a monthcapital ships are a grind unto themselves requiring 4 months to just sit in my point you can certainly play and do most anything you want with a few weeks of training basic skills most skillsets work across hulls shieldtanking armortanking capacitor you dont even have to log in to train skills just subscribed sure if you want to fly a flashy capital or highskill ship it can take weeks or monthsbut its roughly the same time for everyone you have it easier as a newb now than ever beforepeople who started before 2011 had to train learning skils to speed up training now you get the benefit of those skills automaticallyyou dont grind skills in eve but you have to plan for what you want to do nature of the game and ccp isnt going to change it
we already got ccp to remove the learning skill you can thank the previous csmsi dont think mastering skills kills the game at all however that extra oomph you get out of getting the skills to 5 means something if one could train skills from 4 to 5 in a week tops mastery wouldnt mean muchi understand what you mean and ive gone through the 60 days of learning fleet command 5 but at the end of the day the relative scarcity of pilots with some of those long skills at 5 is what makes them speshel
i play eve for like 2800 days so 45 days aint that much in that perspective
i dont see a problem with longer skills it is always a case of diminishing returns since you get the same bonus from going from level 3 to level 4 as you do from 4 to 5 it is a important part of making it possible for new players to compete with older ones and i would be against changing it

you make me feel positively dirtyi am far better looking than mittani
wowjust wow
not really nope id post a pic of you against a pic of me but youd probably try to petition me over it thankfully i can link a public gis of your character name rather than a direct pic of jade constantine and folks can make up their own minds across every vector by which humans regularly judge one another i am your superior vov
hes saying that goons are the vampires from 30 days of night i think
lookit dat huskieoh and the picture he didnt link
your dog is better looking than you are
breaking news ugly internet spaceship nerd calls out other less ugly nerd for being more ugly than himself

is mittani being a drow elf in that picture
and a role playing bond is formed 
well nc can only do so much naping they begged drf for a nap but sadly that resulted in drf invading them and killing 50 of all nc supercaps in a weeknc wont live forever good news is the other sandbox that ccp are creating make it harder to nap everything
and obvious blatantly unhinged lying like this is why kalles trolling is quite as awful as it is
once again spam bot finnagain zero has called someone a troll despite there being proof reports and threads confirming what i have saidyou know you should maybe check your kb once in a while i know nc typically remove losses but even you cant be stupid enough todo damage control by saying it never happened
you are awful at trolling you are also very obviously lying in order to troll you are really claiming with a straight face that the entire nc possessed no more than 20 titans and 8 supercarriers in the entire nc im not sure who you think youre going to be able to troll with this nonsense but dayum its also be nice to see your cite for the nc trying to nap the drf but then them invading considering that prior to the drf invasion the nc invaded them i think its safe to say that its as true as your claim that half the nc supercapital fleet was annihilated or your lie about supercap losses being removed tell you what i know youre lying and trolling and you know youre lying and trolling but lets pretend we dont know that gee kalle you see like a trustworthy person why dont you provide the names of five pilots the date of their supecap losses and who they lost them to so that i can check evekill andor enemy killboards against nc boards to verify that what youre saying is true
razor just naped aaastainatlasone lau to control them all why argue with me on the forums when theres enough evidence to confirm everything i have writtenlike a dog your aim is to bark at anyone your master feels threatened by shame you are hardly liked within your own coalition
for the people you lot have been smearing and mobbing possibly for you i dont think so
posting in a mittani alt thread
no youre not
confirming that we are posting in a mittani alt thread nice try though boy this guy will do whatever it takes to sieze control of csm
op does sound like mittani sigh some people take this game too seriously
yeah the ops textual style does seem exactly like mine if you compare our post historymind blown
well its certainly vapid enough
look at all these trailing prepositionsjust look at them
cause were damned good at it
is trebor the spergmeister who thinks we should vote for him because hes a spergcaptain
nope but you try hard
i may be wrong but i think trebor was in csm 5 and had already the opportunity to fix those unfortunately nothing was done for the balance of the game all csm 5 did care about was famville pi and faction items icons  im sorry but the real problems of the games shouldnt be used as a pretext to be elected every yearthe fact is that csm 5 didnt do anything for game balance lets have a close look at some work of csm 5 for the game balancing everyone that plays eve online knows one of the plague of the game is botting and mining ridiculous gameplay  income what did actually csm 5 and trebor do about this please have a look by yourself 
botting is sooooo not kawaii it reminds me of my favorite anime insert title here where title character experiences humiliating but humbling event and over the course of a predictable storyline overcomes adversity solves all the problems and ultimately becomes the boyfriend of a largebreasted submissive girl and then they have squeakynoised asianstyle sex and thats what i think about botting but in all seriousness let me tell you how we did it in the days of pascalthe truth is kalle wants trebor in because every vote for him means that many more days and hours mittani has to spend exposed to him its his endgame hes trying to get him to commit suicide
julian assange strikes again if you notice my earlier spam you will see i actually commented on trebors good work well before mittanis jealousy became open transparentmost my votes went to prom  peterpowers but i have enough alts left for treborballz tried so hard to not post on this char now people will know i never had a 180 ban guess that means i wasnt bismaru musical fist derek chu tigers spirit unlucky two after all 
general windypops got my vote  this guy had the most intelligent thoughtout responses to numerous hot issues on the vote match page some of the other candidates responses were  well  do they really play this game
the lost in eve guys posted this to the my eve forum but it seems more appropriate here they have done 4 debatesfeed
shame that they didnt even put the effort in to at least try and contact all candidates havent heard anything about this until now
thanks two stepyes this is logical here i just followed the rules for the podcast posts which is why it was in my eve your post will be received well by those interested though so thanksby the way id like to highlight for those that wonder why the  we didnt want certain candidates on the show that statement insinuates that they werent welcome when thats incorrectwe opened up 16 slots for anyone that was a candidate to have applied to join in the debates these people chose not to apply we would have had them gladly however if they did on the other hand this opened up a chance to hear other people which is always healthyfor those that joined in thank you for doing so you did a good job good luck with the reminder of the elections
ummm there was an open public post here on eveo forums and on shc about it with specific instructions on how to get involved im sorry you didnt see it either would have been nice to hear you we may well change things up for next year but there were challenges with the short election period this time around i wish you good luck for the remainder of the elections in any case
bring back my beloved prenerf falcon please please please

this would be awesome but only so long as trails were left behind i know i sometimes pay attention to where the person is warping to and chase the target down if its instawarp that would be impossible but if they leave a trail behind i know thats a whole nother subject then we can still easily tell where they warped to and chase em down

cosmetic only id rather say no but if it has to go its for cosmetic only and boozem
supported i was getting tired of picking character names i ended up doing a bit of recycling a few years back as a newb trying to find a combo of school and backgrounds i liked and ended up picking this one at random would love to change it even though i am asatruar
name change will only cause confusion and more griefing in the long run so wouldnt be smart to do however if ccp builds in a way to keep track of that and i mean on the way like second life has now for example then you can track everyone no matter what name change they did then it should not be a problemsl way original name keeps visible if wanted settings but admins can see who is who always you can however change once a week for free your namenow of course it doesnt need to be free can change with isk or real money but besides that it is a very stable way to keep track of anyone who changed a name and if needed punish the right person while still have everyone the choice wither to change their name or not and how often
name changes should work like neural remaps or something
this is a great idea so it will never be donehowever it could make ccp some money for better cars so it will be done
a fine idea but i think it should be ingame currency not real money maybe 200m isk if its large enough then it will inflate demand for plexs anyway which should remain the only way to inject isk into the system name changes should take a long time couple weeks require that you be in an npc corporation and require background checks 50m isk to uncover
supported because im tired of being shot first 
excellent idea
1 well might have a point there i however do not see why it should be a direct problem since a lot of ship builds will have to change as well along with that taking power away to support the drones it simply is not really interesting specially if you have the team set just right2 again a point but again not directly the case a lot of players love to toy around with frigs and besides that you still have new players that do simply not have the isk to pay better ships3 that boost can be leveled it shouldnt be that much of a problem4 not directly you can actually write 1 basic code for it and redirect in case you need additional coding for different drones cross linking may seem difficult and hard to do but actually it is not that much of a problem many files actually do that same thingstill good you thinking along of course always helps
this would make things so much better in game no more need for neut reps or other trickerysupported

supported about imballance in pvp siturations if the drones are making i too hard to kill your target kill the drones
dreadnaughts are fine the main reason theyre not used more often is because of supercarriers dps from fighterbombers fix the problem instead of messing up a shipclass thats been mostly fine for a long time
dreads should have a little more tank so they can tank a dd without having a gimp fit i agree with op on this the siege active tank bonus was made before the dd change dd is now more of a fear for dreads than being picked apart by a fleet so the siege bonus should increase the buffer not the active repdreads should do a little more dps they should all be able to do at least half the dps of a scarrier considering all the negatives of using a siege module so either decrease the scarrier dps or increase the dread dps either way seems reasonable to me
except dreads were designed before the rest of the capitals were even finalized in concept they havent had any significant changes since
id be more inclined to nerf fighter bombers maybe 300 or 350 dps per bomber instead of 400not really my area of expertise im afraid
restore variation to frig pvp pls
i agree dunno how to make that thumbs up but if i did i wouldmind you its not like dramiels cant be killed by my armor drake but ive been told thats not for everyone
i think you need to reedit all that so it makes coherent senseon a frigate level all the weapons are fairly well balanced each having there strengths and weaknesses i support the ops proposal although i have a dram and use it occasionally i would prefer a balanced frigate playing field
the only reason i would disagree with this proposal is because i like seeing bad players lose drams theres something satisfying about someone buying a dramiel because they think it will make them a great pvper only to lose it to something moronic like a helios
supercaps are outside the realm of established ship design pattern they wouldnt even fit on that little graph i made on performancecost ratiosbasically any ship that cannot be soloed is outside normal balancingdramiel can be soloed altho its difficult in a frigate but it can be soloed in cruisers fairly easy therefore normal cost balancing is validsupercarrier cannot be soloed even by another supercarrier even by a titan those ships in my opinion are plain badbut look at machariel its one of the best battleships does machariel completely dominate battleship scene do people use machariels for everything from fleet battles to solo roams not really because it costs at least 900 mila mach is a normal ship that can be soloed  even by a cruiser therefore the standard performancecost model is validnow imagine if machariel was sold for 150 million due to massive supply boost do you think that would change the battleship scene with 150 mil machs how often do you think youd see them theyd be everywhere theyd completely dominate all pvp where big ships are needed even in fleet battles with insta popping with 50 losses per fight people would still bring machariels and alliance leaders would replace them for free to fleet op members because costs play such huge role
it will be a lot better to train multiple characters on 1 account indeed it has nothing really to do with ccp getting payed or not we have to pay a lot to stay on actually too much even but that besides the point we still should be able to learn skills on multiple characters i sure would love to change that
as an option heck i would do it for a couple of months
not being able to have the option to train more than 1 characcount is silly even if its an extra 5char thats a bunch of revenue ccp can get from people who cant invest in multiple accountsi support this on the ground of a nominal additional fee or if that isnt seen as a good option reduced training speed for the extra accounts
i was going to say no but you are absolutely correct about this argument so ill support this if we can pay for it with plex
supported if we can pay with plexliang
good ideaid shove a second plex into my account per month if it meant i could train one of the other slots concurrently on the other hand im lazy enough that id probably never sign up a second account and go through the rigamarole of char transfer just to get a lightlytrained alt so more money for ccp from me if they implement this anyhow vov
id definitely make use of it ive been looking for an excuse to make some specialized alts but didnt want to deal with creating new accounts and transferring to consolidate characters it would squeeze an extra easy 200 from me minimumthe question is if it would not just be profitable for ccp i think it would but if it would be a good idea for gameplay would it put too much power in the hands of those with the most  would it become too easy to do more without needing to worry about cooperation
i like the idea of a toggledont like the idea of a request noobship on demand button some wiseacre within days would have a bot program whipped up to slam that button 247 as fast as the server would take requests and print endless trit
supportedi would honestly prefer newbships to be removed  make shuttles the ondemand ship when docking in a pod and give new players a better ship when they start like say the interceptor hulls t1 versionusing shuttles would remove the spam 4 trit problem as well as the extra modules that come with the ships just put the crappiest t1 guns in the new player ships with a couple rounds of ammoalso would like insurance mails to go away
i am aware of that no worries there still makes the railguns pointless to use it shouldnt be too hard to make them just a tiny bit more powerful else a cormerant and a rohk are nothing more then pointless ships well okay for mining or salvaging i guess
whats the problem with active mines when youre out of system we got guys with doomsday weapons that can kill any ship weve ot groups of people that take on single players that dont stand a chance whats wrong with mines that dont kill friendlies its an electronic device perfectly capable of detecting appropriate targetswhats wrong with mines being deployable by a covert ops vessel nothingmines are a great idea call them an equalizer
read the thread and all your questions would have been answered1 active mines in nullsec have a chance of hitting someone while the person who deployed them is in highsec causing a concordokken2 i can see your point in that a friendly maybe cant set off the mine but the damage should be universal you cant have a magical explosion that only hurts the bad guys but the reasoning i stated to make mines detonate from friendlies is so they arent just spammed on gatesthey would have to be used in a more tactical role again gate spamming mines was one of the big reasons they were removed3 nothing wrong with mines being deployed by a cov opsas long as it is not while they are cloaked someone brought it up as a reason to make the destroyers class more usefuland it makes sense cov ops already have bombswhy give them mines too why not make another class of ship more useful instead either waymines should not be deployable by any shipone class only again to reduce the spammage on gates make it a class of ships that is small and easy to kill againdestroyers are perfect for this roleand pleaseif you approve of minesthumb up
it would be a good idea but unfortunately goons will love to use them in high sec to grief new players as usually so i think there needs to be a new concept of them adding for each race 1 mine ship that can serve as sweeper or layer besides that it needs to be made so they can not be used to close to belts structures etc perhaps even detectable so you have at least the indication mines are around warning sign like ww2 submarines have for example
i have 2 cs5 pilot but i say it the problem is the off grid gang boostingneed to change this rules not need anymore offgrid bonus change this rules to risky because unscannable or cmdship at pos is riskfree game playingif you want bonus go there to battlespotyou can survive if you keep distance from battle but the enemy will see you on the grid
the alternative to unprobeable mission running ships is no mission runners to shoot mission runners are still vulnerable at gates and stations you just have to be smarter about catching the guys with the ships specially designed to escape youin the good old days missions space was actually dead and signatures were dampened by a factor of 10 or so these days mission runners are just as probeable as anything else in the system something has to giveoff grid gang boosting means you can have the one command ship with three boosters rather than having to make decisions about which boosters you have fitted to a ship that also has to face enemy fireoffpos boosting means that any time you want to kill them you have to have a spy available to bump them out of the pos bubble bobble games are worse than docking games since theres no 30s countdown until they can bob back into the bubble againim not sure what point you were trying to communicate but the message im receiving is that you want to have the upper hand by having an ace hidden up your sleeve rather than playing with the hand youre dealt and just playing betterthe home field advantage of having a pos in system is that you have a pos in system you can get the enemy to fight you there giving you the benefit of pos offensive systems or you can have a safe spot to withdraw to when you need to recover capacitor and rep your shieldsarmour back up again
bull ive been running missions in low sec and hostile 00 in t1 battleships faction battleships and marauders for years now you do not need to be unprobeable to run missions in low sec or 00 all that really happens there is breaking risk vs reward stop being such a pansyyou can do this anyway pretty sure i have vulture with 3 gang links 200k ehp and 1000 dps tankpos boosting is simply a home field advantage i have no problem with home field advantages and no parsec doesnt have any poses anchored and quite possibly never willon t3 vs command ships command ships are superior in many ways to t3s especially if you are the aggressor being able to provide gang bonuses immediately upon entering system is very nice indeed t3s are simply better at providing bonuses especially if you can get in system before your enemiesfrom the perspective of having gang bonuses used against me i have no problem with off grid gang boosting as long as i can scan the person out and kill them home field advantages pos boosting by either t3 or command ship are perfectly fine i have no problem with them even if i dont take advantage of them unprobeable t3s provide a home field advantage without it actually being your home field it is effectively riskless and thats where i draw the line nerfing the unprobeable part would make t3s dramatically less useful as gang boosters which would decrease the amount of leadership in use and indirectly boost fleet commandsliang
i agree with liang 100 if they are affecting the battle they should be findable and killablea supercoordinated gang can get around this but thats ok  their coordination should have large advantages
the only ships that should be unprobable are cloaked ships
exactly since they cannot do anything
i dont care for unprobable mission runners or unprobable afk people who arent bothering anyonebut i believe that unprobable afk fleet boosting is a valid and serious issue it effects real pvp it participates in pvp passively therefore it should be put at riskeither remove fleet boost from offgrid members or provide some game mechanic to find and shut down the fleet boosterthe simplest solution would be to force each gang link fitted to add 100 sig radius
you are aware that this is a huge nerf to on grid gang boosters maybe if the core problem is being unprobeable they should fix being unprobeable lianged twiddled gang and grid
uh no the simplest solution would be to make a ships sensor strength have nothing to do with the calculations used in probing it down
neutral repping is just ing ed i cant believe it still exists in game
neutral reppingorcas are a major problem for any kind of hisec pvp  i support aggression transfer or not permitting transfership swapping to happen for people who are aggressed
repping my enemy should have same consequences as shooting merepairing someone with aggression should get logistics agressed as well
wont gaining a 60s aggression timer redress the word parts of station gamesother options include that taking any action in a skirmish could lock you out of stations or gates until all actions in that skirmish have stopped for 60 secondsthus if you start shooting someone a skirmish timer starts if they shoot back they join you in the skirmish timer any time a module is activated on a target involved in a skirmish the ship activating the module joins the skirmish timer and resets it to 60 secondsso you undock your war target starts shooting you you shoot back your neutral rep joins the fun  all three of you are now locked out of the station star gates ship maintenance arraysbays fitting services corporate hangars and the like until everyone has stopped activating modules on each other for 60 seconds you and your neutral rep might win the fight but the timer doesnt start counting down until your logistics ship deactivates its remote reps
whatever fix there is you need to make sure nobody can exploit it otherwise you can get someone else neutral rr ship preventing you from docking pretty much forever
yes but the entire game doesnt revolve around station games theres no need for an additional nerf to logistics  such as removing their ability to engineer a safe withdrawl or slowing down any gangs using them because of cap chaining logistics are fine t1 rr cruisers are fine station games are not so fix station games without affecting other day to day uses of logisis your goal here to make deagressing simply impossible because that seems really stupidliang
if your target never leaves station dont wardec them if youre not willing to fight in a manner of their choosing it seems ridiculously moronic for people to expect their wardec targets to change how they fly just because someone wardecs themalso learn how to rrbs fleet if you cant keep an rr chain going long enough for all ships to safely deaggress and dock then youre doing something wrong
you start getting bufud by the opposition and start to deaggress and dock but wait your targets have alts with t1 frigs running small rrs on you to keep you locked out of the station and since those alts are only red to your targets and not to you you cant even blow them updumb idea is dumb and easily exploitablehow do you negate neutral rr griffin kitsune blackbird rook falcon scorpion widow tengu take your pick
id personally use tempestsartycanes and pick up a bunch of free killmailsliang
a dragoons complaining about neutral rr thats richsupporting anyway even though the op is a tool
logistics are fine as they arestation gaming however is pretty stupid repairing someone with an aggression timer should give an aggression timer
i love you so much when incarna hits have my podlings
ccp will not and should not limit actions around hulkageddon now i do have an opinion on wether or not suicide ships get insurance payouts but thats a different story suicide ganking should be allowed as it is todayoverall hulkageddon is a great thing and here is why first off it stimulates player reaction its gets people worked up either as predators or as prey it stimulates the market go out there and buysell indy ships and modules exploit hulkageddon to get rich i cant tell you how many stories i have heard of people doing this use the opportunity to manufacture the gank ships dessies or tier 1 bss hell even start to buy up and resell high sec mins as the high sec miners will not be producing as much minerals the opportunities really are vastthe thing you have to remember is that hulkageddon as an event is self controlling if they do it more than once or twice a year the industrialists will get smart and find ways to evade it as it is now there are enough industrialists that are lax enough that there are still enough available targets to make this event work to your point you dont want a 3 month long hulkageddon that likely wont happen as they will run out of targets in just a week or 2 as people start to figure out whats going onbasiclaly i think ccp should stay as they are and allow the eve community to adapt as they see fit again i still dont agree with insurance payouts for suicide ships but thats a whole other conversation
there is one thing that ccp did that if they actually cared about miners and indies wouldnt have done delaying concordnot sure how many people noticed but concord was delayed by an extra 10 seconds beyond their usual response time for hulkaggedon 4i am not opposed to ganking however its getting too easy for people to do but since ccp loves their pirates nothing will change until carebears stop subbing which shows how poorly ccp listens to their customer base if they cared they would you know actually do something about half the stuff that happens in game that shouldnt
tears about tears someone needs a huganyhoo hulkageddon is here to stay your post wasnt a slight dislike it was a proposal to start applying arbitrary rules to a game we all love so much and if for some reason you get enough support that it comes to fruition it would make eve suck boom
i did not intent to even react to this but oh wellhow else you want to explain why they never get punished and how else you want to explain bogus rules and the lack of those that are needed big companies send out several people to run for csm making it less fun for others and more fun for them the less rules for them to have around the more they are allowed to do griefing is basically made legal thanks to this and no one seems to noticei did not say ban killboards i only want to see things like hulkageddon having some rules like do not get in 08 to 10 space for killing it doesnt cripple the entire economy and for the capsuleers themselfs it might be good to have areas they are actually save so they can work on their plex or at least gain isk for other reasons i think further then just banning something like you sayi however do not mind people attacking afk miners and bots go right ahead either work for your isk or scram for bots i love to see that getting banned and if the owner makes a new one just ban the main account as well end of problem
if ccp cared theyd do more to police mining bots
most of the skill training required to be good at flying is more related to nonspaceship command related skills that is engineering navigation gunnery industry and whatever else training for minmatar cruiser is a matter of days heck i picked up orca transports and freighters all within the last month and a half on one toon on another i dropped training guns for a bit and im picking up minmatar cruiser v i only have 1212 days left on that for which ill net a new race of hacs t3s and various other craft that toon has only 15 million sp and is tech ii armor and shield tank and tech ii heavy missiles and small and medium projectiles even got sentry drones at tech ii in there point is it does not take too long a week for each frigate a month for each cruiser and some 45 days for each battleship more or less given the amount and variation of skills you can train in eve thats hardly too much time to waste for the sake of access to a new range of shipstake a look at the ships each follows a different design philosophy so to its engineered along a different path its not a volkswagon jetta that you can get in and just drive its a complex spacefaring machine in which you are the entirety of the crew ask how long it takes nasa to train their pilots or the airforce how long it takes to train for an f35 were not talking bicycles and pickup trucks

unfortunately there are several other modules in the same position where the tech 2 variant is subpar compared to the meta 4 in various ways supporting the improvement of the tech 2 here though
all the meta 4 ew modules have the same base stats as the t2 but with lower fittings and cap use the same applies to meta 4 weapons the only reason to use t2 is because the specialisation skills give a bonus but that bonus comes from the skill not the itemand t2 ammo ofcmeta 4 armour plate give the same ehp as t2 but for a lower mass penalty and less fittinghigher meta doesnt automatically mean more powerful look at the domination shield hardeners for example theyre what meta 8 but they give the same resist bonus as the meta 1 named varient
there are even some modules there the t2 is worse than best named and more expensive
i have to agree offline towers are just litter adding a game mechanic that allows them to be salvaged just adds another element to the sandbox that is eve having them just disintegrate after awhile is an alternative but not one that adds any real dimensions to the game for all im concerned they could be wrecked and unusable as salvage simply toss them in the refinery and get what you can out of it with the only requirement being a level or two in the scrap metal reprocessing skill why not add a structural salvaging skill too one that requires anchoring to 5 it could improve the value of your salvageits not game breaking but shortsightedness is
i think the colors and fonts when possible needs to be stashed on the user pc by downloading the latest patch this way it should solve that problem for most part although you are right about the engine it shouldnt get fixed it is not broken for reducing text well perhaps it might be a better thing to change the bio entirelyperhaps we all should be allowed to make a wiki page instead with our profile then we can indeed decrease the bio in size of course change a little so there is a direct link to that persons profile this all together should stop people using the full sign length with all kinds of colors all together sure will be a lot less laggy for sure
i just hope world of darkness is not designed at all like eve on the technical level
im not going to dig out the relevant patch notes for you but if you go back far enough youll find the patch containing the bio length nerf i agree that this is something that one would not immediately expect to be a major source of lag but that was the explanation given at the time possibly in the thread accompanying the patch notes
well i was bored
meh i used to care about this but then i created a evelopedia page for my char and placed a link to it in my bio
personally id like a matchcom type bio i want to know the gender and romantic interests of the people im shooting
ccp have already stated on numerous occasions that they are reusing a large part of the core eve code for other games presumably including wod
all this does is make it easier for gankers to enjoy all the benefits making lowsec pirates the party to receive the greatest benefit from this pointless
i dont think you know what youre talking about your post makes very little sensethe ops post on the other hand makes a lot of sense i was about to mention the podding yourself thing but op seems to have caught that as well it would make sense that being podded would restart the jc counter in any event

htc hd2 open eve gate super easy op is win 65us tmobile version browser is stock opera
well basically impossible since the smart phones are to weak still but i know for sure there might be some other things that can be done flying around in your ship will likely be a no go for now so dont aspect wonders you most likely will be able to look in your wallet corp wallet look at your orders contracts such things sending mails may well be possible and working on your skills is likelybut besides that i fear not much more can be done without destroying the game itself but there can deffo be something done in this
i do support an app or a mobile friendly version of eve gate whichever is most efficientkumi mobile eve is def not realistic but i dont think anyone here is suggesting that

take off the coolaid shades daddyo 
this trolling tactic is not really so smart but it is predictable lying in order to troll and then hopping up on the cross and complain about being accused of trolling is blah you are naturally lying that ive called every or even most for that matter nonnc people as trolls youre using that lie to troll that is why naturally ive pointed out that youre a troll not because youre not in the nc you mean that hes an obvious troll making absurd broadbrush accusations about people based merely on the alliances theyre in while trolling about an argument that hes advanced dishonestly only to troll people that he has no intention at all of backing up since its only a troll i can understand your opinion but i don think being trolled by jade is really anybodys place oh and speaking of how jade is trolling and will not because he can not present an argument honestly yet again as hes repeatedly been ignoringeverybody reading along knows full well why jade can not answer such reasonable and clear criticisms of his argument and has to respond with ad hominem trolling
whatever is going on seems to have seriously dislodged your cool anyways
it seems like csm discussions do bring the worst in some peopledissapointing as always
that they do they always do
you know jade has lost when his post isnt even scrolling the page
jade speaking of how youre trolling because youre trying to annoy goons and anybody who gets in the way of your weird obsession with them its okay pretty much anybody whose neurons are on speaking terms knows exactly why you wont answer such simple straight forward challenges of your argument and what it means that your argument was neither made nor is being defended honestly politics doesnt bring the worst out in people only it seems in folks who cant support their opinions honestly and would rather troll so yet again you feel like stopping trolling
i hardly think sidestepping the nonsensical doublespeak of your tenuous grasp of junior rhetoric counts as anything other than a completely understandable reaction to a somewhat frantic streetcorner frother trying desperately to make eye contact at this point

more ad hominem trolling rather than responding to clear and concise logical criticisms how surprising so do you honestly not understand what logical fallacies are or are you trolling some more do i ever need to ask naturally if you werent trolling it would be trivially easy to show how i was wrong ya know just like i did for your fallacyriven trolling argument again the reason why you cant respond is clear ill just point out again that youre trolling now and you were trolling when you advanced your arugment since you never had any intent in defending it the logical and factual challenges to your trolling by the way are its okay jade anybody reading along who has a functional brain at least knows why youre unable to answer the very simple challenges put to youps the person who is more like a street corner frother do you think thats a the person making a logical argument and asking someone to respond to it b or the person continually freaking out with ad hominem trolling which is more like a streetcorner raving preacher someone who says a evolution is a fact because of or b your cool is seriously dislodged youre frothing you think youre slaying dragons youre like an organ grinders monkey its not an ad hominem fallacy if i use it on you its quite the modern tragedy hint its b

jade can totally show that the cogent specific explicit and well reasoned claims of fallacious logic in his argument are false and he totally will do that and hey look over there
you have more exploits to share no wait no you keep them to yourselves for months my bad
i have addressed the exploit issue several time in this thread and on my blog ccp allowed me to run for csm which they would not have done if they had found me guilty of exploiting if you have some serious questions about my platform or the issues i would like ccp to concentrate on please feel free to ask
bump you owe me a vote jonathon
im not actually part of this at any rate id like to think that those who really care who to vote for actually do some reading themselves than have some numbers thrown at them
i would like to thank dierdra for the service she offered to the community as a whole as far as i can see no one else provided this service no one else was willing to commit the effort to creating such a site and no one felt that the improvements they feel are necessary to make the site useful warranted the effort to make those changes this site is the best site of its type for this electionas a voter use this site or not i dont care  just voteas a candidate  i cannot imagine running a campaign and not availing myself of all opportunities to get my positions out therethanks again dierdra i hope that such a service will be around for the next csmkind regardsknug lidi
you may have heard in pUFFFDturs last interview that a csm term of one year may actually be too long too intense burn out but that he will see how the new csm will do firstthat would make it even more intense too much for the active csm membersa bad fair chance
i want to see 50k votes
while campaigning time and csm term are not too long in my mind i agree that we should get more time between the publication of the candidates list and actual voting startthis would give more time to develop campaign messages and answer to questions before the first votes are cast also itd be interesting to see less biased everelated media
i find it odd in this game of internet spaceships in this age of digital voting that real world municipal governments can be elected from millions of folks and at higher participation rates in a single day and yet the csm needs to have a much longer voting periodi suspect that many in eve have more involvement with what the csm does than what their municipal politicians do for themshorten the vote period either you are interested or you are not 05 of the electorate per day is not a useful extensioncmon people vote already 
prom4csm good luck m8 b
got 1 of my 2 votes i am a huge supporter of csm members who know how to fly
i was invited to speak with the fine people at newedenradiocom who held townhall style interviews with a bunch of candidates go check them out
ccp isnt actually that big
its a buzzword as part of the scrum process not stakeholder in a political sense i distrust managementdevelopment fads just like i distrust corporate slogans like excellence whether a stakeholder in scrum actually matters or not is entirely dependent upon the circumstances and whim of the devsit has power in the sense that most of the eve population who hears of the csm qua stakeholder will think that means in the political sense rather than in the software development system sense
thanks for letting me know that these votes are useless i knew i didnt care before now i know ill never vote for video game politics
i have to give you props for responding to my serious questions a lot of people would read halfway through the posts and say to themselves sperge and not reply to the important questions in there so assuming the csm has stakeholder status in the scrum sense do you think that ccp doesnt actually put items brought by the csm on their production queue or do you think they just reprioritize csm ideas to the bottom every time they come up or whatthe reason i ask this is because part of your platform seems to be focused on a percieved lack of results this lack of results seemingly would be caused by one of the above if they are true scrum stakeholders we would at some point start seeing the ideas csm brought to the table come to the game my view is that ccp has a large list and csm ideas take a while to get to the top i feel it is unrealistic to expect csm ideas to see a fast turnaround regardless of who is in charge of csm simply because the system is what it isi guess i just think its difficult to argue about the inneffectiveness of the csm when they have stakeholder status
the thing is why have the csm at all at that pointif ccp was just looking for stuff to fixadd to queue they already had several forums to glance at to get feedback granted much of it is noise but paying people to come to iceland devoting energy and effort to setting up the elections and system is a bit much for a fix request aggregatorif on the other hand the csm is intended to get a feel for things that should be prority fixesthings that the community feels the sting of acutelythen it should ideally have its accepted issues bumped up in priority if they are languishing at the bottom ccp is subverting the entire point of the council deliberately or inadvertantly and this needs to be adjusted or the csm should be dissolved as a conceptof course tempering this is that not everything that the csm advances is of equal importance and there are dev projects that cant be bumped down if the problem has been that the csm reps have had poor messaging and havent emphasized the full impact of the advanced ideas or impact of not fixingimplementing the ideas then this is entirely the fault of the previous councilschairs
i particularly eyerolled at your lack of understanding of how leadership works in voluntary human organizations or in nullsec in specific but rather than ranting back i figured id just cut to the new question incidentally if you assume that leadership in a game only exists in the game itself theres a lot of entrepreneurs and other rlsuccessful folk at the top of the nullsec hierarchies you should meet running an alliance means managing more people than most small businesses ever do and finding ways to motivate them to action without wagesalary if you think that merely because eve is a game that motivation would be easy you havent spent much time in nullsec which is mostly a series of hurdles covered in broken glass which you have to jump over while not wearing a cup good leaders can construct an engaging narrative in hopes of obscuring the broken boring gameplay if the motivation was intrinsic ie whee fun game i love this  to eve the average nc fleet would have between 200015k humans rather than a few hundred personally i have a very keen interest in seeing the game become more fun because after years and years and years of essentially cajoling and manipulating thousands of people into playing this lagfilled piece of crap most of the nullsec leadership are tired of it and could use a little help from the game client itself power is a fluid thing and not strictly topdown or bottomup the best descriptions of how power works in practice come from foucault in my experience without getting into heavy poststructuralist lala land lets just say that the stakeholder title  both in what it means in scrum and how its perceived by the playerbase presents opportunities to mold the flow of things if used correctly but it does not contain intrinsic power and that title can be ignored at ccps whim there are times when csm5 captured power and influenced the game perhaps for the first time in the history of the csm there are times where they then lost this power by overreaching and alienating their ccp interlocutors i dont think theres a unified single way in which the csm works because fundamentally the csm is a nexus of views attempting to alter the views and priorities of their ccp interlocutors either through raw persuasion pseudolegislative procedure or more intense tactics through the media anyway its a subtle thing and i dont think that folks will get that the usual way people think of power is that it is something that is taken and then used at least in the narrative sense so they assume that the csm just needs to get more power and that once it has the power it can then be used willynilly to ram through proposals
actually stakeholder in a scrumagile development process are the parties for which the project will ultimately be destined for the stakeholders in an agile development process are the customers that the product is being developed for i guess you could call the csm a customer but the customer is actually ccp managment the ccp management are the ones using the codebase to provide a service to their customers the csm members are not managers of the development process i dont know how long the sprints that ccp are using are for however i am sure theythe csm are not used in every sprint review calling them stakeholders could be a technically a valid label unfortunately i think the csm is only a minor or tertiary stakeholder in the sense of how the development process of the agile methodology works i highly doubt they are used in every sprint review process i think a more accurate label for the csm is that they are more of a focus group of the target audience for eve they give feedback to ccp managementscrum leaders they get to see what is coming down the pipe and it is ultimately up to ccp to listen to their target audience in the issues they bring upeverything i have read and researched here in regards to tracking the backlog of featuresrequestsbugs really is drastically outside the responsibility of the csm to do the csm is there to bring up issues that are currently applicable to the situation managing the observations and requests for ccp really just makes them do somewhat menial project management tasks for the development team in addition to being a sounding board for ideas and complaints lowno paid market researchersassociate project managers just free trip to sulfurville being the paymentbut meh its all the same internet spaceships are srs business
the reason is have a problem with space leadership skills isnt that it requires no skills i wholeheartedly agree that it does but that it requires the wrong skills for the same reason i wouldnt want a pro football coach leading a group of scientists i wouldnt want a space leader to be awhatever the hell a csm leader isthe personalities of those being led and the end goals of the group define the leadership needed the internet is renowned for being a place where peoples personalities are different from reality people sperge and troll and do all sorts of things they would never do irl this requires a very different type of leadership than a group of people sitting through an 8 hour meetingthe differences of leadership styles necessitated by the populations personality are very important just think of the different leadership styles you might find in pl or goons vs an it or aaa a leader in one group would be deposed within a week in the other or the captain of the black pearl vs the captain of the hms rimjobive worked in a lot of different settings hippie coops and oil companies and ive seen leaders whose styles would have worked in one place flounder horribly in another all that said your ability to engage with me when i switched from sperging internet type to more serious poster does imply crossfunctional leadership skillsnow as for the stakeholder stuff the impression i am getting is that your plan for enforcing or strengthening the csm effects will anchor around a subtle hand approach am i right in that if so thank god while the previous csm may have been effective the blanket impression i had involved a lot of really butthurt handraisers who had no idea of the difference between right and right enough and were totally incapable of picking their battles when i mentioned the hippiecoop before this was exactly the kind of thing they would do everyone had to have an opinion on everything and no percieved slight was too small to loose your  overthis resulted in 5 hour meetings that should have taken 20 minutes and results far weaker than they should have beenwhile i agree that ccp should have better communication with the csm crying about it in podcasts and forums is the wrong way to fix itkind of reminds me of an old boss i had if it wasnt his idea then it wouldnt happen so it became a job of convincing him that it was his idea which is difficult and highly unrewarding in many ways but it worksok if thats what you mean then my attitude may take a 180 from your op i was readin it as another we will stamp our feet and get what we want candidacy
even if the csm remains at the place its in having mittens on the csm will make it a lot more fun so theres nothing to lose by voting for himi support mittani and i hope he gets the chair
le bump
i voted for him and he has a great blog check it out
great interview on lost in eve ripard  smart specific and informed you want ccp to implement the game i want to play  and by insisting that ccp make good on all that iteration development they been promising us it dont get any fairer than thatgood luck you have my vote
appears that people who read the candidates blogs and listen to their interviews support rippard most his votes come from those who have actually looked into the csms beyond there short write uptbh the best candidate running and worthy of every vote he gets he is proving he is the man for the job rather than depending on some forum of alliance group to vote him in based upon his name or reputationgo rip
he got my vote not just because he is a corp mate good luck ripard
so your suggestion to solve lag is to make the servers perform even more calculationsexactly how is it that the only see the closest n ships would solve lag why where clientside or serverside how will this make combat more tacticalyou keep going on about ideas like this flesh it out some more lets see how good your technical understanding of how things work really is
to put it to the extreme if the dd instakilled subsc ships of a limited number and then selfdestructs the titan after 10 minutes would the dd still be broken in terms of being overpoweredits difficult to claim that to be the case so you cant categorically say fatal damage to multiple ships on grid to be broken or what if it cost 5 trillion isk to fuel the ddwhile ive always been in alliances with strict local chat rules i wonder why if i wasnt you want to keep a system that makes it impossible to have reasonable conversations with allies and hostiles in localthis is a discussion regarding the merits of the proposal at the time it was made by trebor eg was it braindead or notwhat i gave was an analysis of the idea and pointed to the reasons why it was if one has limited information not braindead as the previous goon claimed the last year the csm has managed to make ccp release more information on the real causes of lag so hopefully future proposals will be closer to what is really neededand no you cant vote for me cause im too lazy to do the kind of hard work trebor puts into being a csm delegate but if you want to vote for me i strongly recommend sending your vote to trebor instead
i hope youre laughing with me 3
i think the term artificial limit has some connotations such as hardness that are a bit misleading i prefer to think of the solution as involving an flexible organic fleetsize cap and i obviously agree that it should be carrotbasedyour objections to the fogofwar concept are interesting but i think you may be underestimating one element of the idea which is that it increases the value of maneuver on the battlefield for example a tight blob of ships will mostly see blues whereas multiple small squads will mostly see reds  in effect a pack of hyenas vs a lion while this would introduce big changes in fleet doctrine i am not convinced it will significantly boost the value of skillpoints and i would argue that it could boost the survivability of logistics which i like to fly for exactly the reason you note because logistics attached to smaller squads would only be targetable by part of the opposing blobbut in any case the proposal was a deliberately simplified example designed to illustrate the larger concept of organic blob reduction and since i dont push my personal ideas on ccp as part of my csm duties as long as the issue gets addressed in some way im happy and you will note that i will push ccp hard to have any idea they come up with tigerteamed by player experts such as yourself no doubt to help expose any flaws before they hit sisii found your observation about player passivity of value while this is definitely not my playstyle i agree that a change that forces leadership roles on too many people in a large fleet would have negative consequences on the other hand something that encourages people to step up  yet another carrot  is worthy of considerationfinally regarding providing motivation for people to be in more than one place at a time this is option b in my previous post and we agree on it if technical fixes by team gridlock are shortterm lag fixes this would be the mediumterm fix and organic fleet size limits would be the longterm approachyou may by the way want to get in touch with meissa anunthiel about the multipleobjectives approach as he is much in favor of itps if you are going to fanfest look me up i find these discussions flow even better f2f
you had my vote at gemstonebest of luck
im still interested in hearing just how this is going to fix or even improve lag as you claim on your csm pageas to gameplaywise your explanation of how you foresee this to work does not win me over in any way in fact it makes me think of when were looking at a ed up grid where 95 of the fleet suddenly disappears into a different grid leaving a few stragglers without logis to get ed up the ass by the other fleet its jarring its illogical and just  no not unless theres some magical way youre thinking of making this work which i havent read yetadditionally if you really think that fleet fights only has to be about dirtbag is primary dirtbag is primary then you havent flown with some of the better fcs in the game nor have you been in multifleet assaults on systems
no wall of text i am disappointed
is this where i promise to rant about railguns or amarr getting explosive crystals  jk yes theres a ton of balance issues that should be getting continual care and iteration id very much like to see this kind of thing attended to much more often than every few years personally id love to have a reason to fly the megathron in a fleet again i appreciate your appreciation of this do you have a mohawk in rl will i see it at fanfest in a couple weeksteam awesome is more than one person its kind of like the borg just with less clear purpose do not tempt virt are you nuts folks im doing some unexpected traveling so my internet is sketchy right now if i have missed any comments or questions i will do my best to get to them as i can or this weekend thank you very much to everyone who continues to get the word out for both my campaign and the csm in general 50k votes would be fantastic
dont you know that one picture is worth a thousand words now add the 24 in the poster thats 1024  210 and curiously 2 is the average number of sentences in a virtpost that are actually written in english and 10 is the average number of characters in a virtwordi find the poster to be numerologically significant i am sure there are other such messages cleverly encoded in virts other campaign posters for virtologists to discover
when have i ever done a wall of text as for numerology there is merely similarity in inspiration of design 42
mad cackle  virtologistshi seleene just listened yesterday finally to your eve uni guest appearance really enjoyed it
10
1 bump for what i hope will be a voice for the players
i was planning of giving both my votes to trebor but i have to agree that balanced voting is better so its 1 for him and 1 for you
me and my 10 spy accounts have voted with youpower to the spies
no powerblocks just solid support for the little corp the solo player the miners traders and industrialists of evelet me help make low sec what it used to bevote issler dainze for csm
2 votesi dont think there is enough incentive to explore lowsec the rewards offered dont seem like enough to justify potentially losing my stuff
i agree with your views so you have my vote
whats your position on microtransactions edit  ah the hell with it you got my voteme facepalms for voting for a goon
i wonder if im not shooting my own foot in there but votematch isnt extremely reliable imho i had to answer those questions and create a profile because not doing so would only means less visibility as a candidate but i share the largelyexpressed opinion that questions are poorly worded which resulted in a rather large biasthis led me to further explain almost every answer i strongly recommend all players using votematch to take the time to read their candidates comments on those questionsone thing is sure thus if rp is your main concern for csm or at least something you want the csm to consider i further invite you to offer me your vote im positive i am the candidate taking this aspect of the game the most seriously the representation of roleplayers at the csm will be limited at best if im not elected
i was just directed towards myrhial arkenaths blog a fellow roleplayer who offered me one of the two votes she had and explains whythank you for your vote myrhial and the very good analysis of my campaign and what i offer i pretty much agree to what is said there and her other vote goes to a candidate that i would have considered voting for too if i wasnt running myselfbut i wont tell you who youve got to read that by yourself on a side note it seems that im generally more convincing to the people i had a chance to speak with in realtime and can debate quite well  which seems to be a good thing for a potential csm representative although a lot of the votes have been casted already if you are curious about my campaign im still available for a chat now and then no matter if youre just one guy who want to make sure of something or a big alliance diplomat who would like to organize an audio interview on his own ventmumble server so far i had much pleasure answering to those interviewsso feel free to drop a question here or send me an evemail to see how we can talk about things 
well i did read your comments on votematch and even the issues we didnt agree oni had no opinion about made me feel better about you than the actual percentage that was giveni wonder were you one of the people on the new eden radio interview if so do you remember how far into the interview you came up
sadly no i was contacted by dj drizzcat about the interview by ner but there was a limited number of seats available sounds quite logical if you want to give every guest enough time and by the time i knew if id be available at that hour my answer came in too lateid be happy to participate to another one thus by ner or any other media either through text or audio keeping in mind that my poor mic gives crappy results with anything else than mumble apparently
heya guysi will be away for work military for the rest of the voting period thanks for all the support and keep voting good luck to all the candidatesbutch
krutoj can we get an extra bonus for supers that have a full set of deadspace hardeners for example if you have all four core xtype hardeners you get a bonus amount of resist if you get what i mean would be then a incentive to buy the same type for supercapitals
the main reason that people have for voting for me is because im part of a group of players that truly make eve what it is today we actively try to make it hostile place it was is and alway will be even in highsec the faster you realise this the betterhowever seeing that we mostly live in highsec means that we have to think completely out of the box most of the time to even get any kills we cant just undock form up a gang and go roaming around like in low or nullsec ninjas are some of the most creative minds out therehowever doing this requires an extensive knowledge of almost all game mechanics so that we can be effectivevoting for me means that i can apply that knowledge to the betterment of eve online not just in our niche but everywhere
im interested in this as well
eve tribune interview is up here
seriously i wasnt thiking to vote as we see in the past probably they all will run for big alliances interests how they can destroy abandoned outposts how they change jump bridges soveignties etcif there is any candiate who is one of uswho will protect rights of highsec players not big aliances who will try to make eve more newbie friendly not the arena of some old hardcores egothen im ready to vote and call my friends for vote
im not a representative of big alliancesim unbiased when it comes to living region check the quotes in my candidacy threadthat doesnt mean i want to nerf 00 to oblivion or want to quadruple the revenue of level 34 missions my objective is to achieve balance and help create a universe that has potential for everyone willing be they part of a large or small group of players one that has engaging gameplay and fun no matter where they live
i am very neutral in my comments although naturally i hate rmt  botting so i tend to criticise mittani  nc i will comment on the following csmmittani  wants to save jump bridges remove pvp from 00 and prevent number warfare from getting nerfed 100 focused on preserving ncs nap train sadly expect him to already be in as well his flying monkeys have already probably spam voted him oblivious to what he actually wants todovile rat  i cant really criticise vile rat too much tbh unlike mittani vile rat actually has alot of decent ideas that somewhat seems a little neutral but chances are his csm ambition is much like mittanisother nc minions  inconsistent brown nosers not even worth the time to debate i suppose it is suicidal going after the leader in the animal kingdom but this isnt rl so heh why notseleene  ok ideas but can you really ignore the fact that he was on the team that made motherships from  and unused to overused and overpoweredkrutoj  decent guy but hardly made an effort in the campaigning besides with so much bad press on drf botting  rmt i dont think it was smart to comment on how he was going to fix botting especially when it is encouraged and ignored in the eastprom  one of the few csm that actually has a clue about pvp the only one to mention the command ship issues and actually has the best ship change ideas an ideal choice if you want pvp changes that make sensetrebor  a wide range of neutral ideas was in csm5 and did a great job probably one of the few csm that want to make eve better for everyone imo you should vote for him if you want ideas free from big alliance agendasthere are some other good csm candidates but it depends on what you want changing or focused on for example if you work heavily with third party apps or dev tools then you will probably want to vote for peterpowers or if you want 00 to have more action less naping and more risk since 00 is safer than hisec atm then i guess elise would be a good choicetldr dont vote for anyone in nc they already have announced they want to ruin 00 more so than they have already if you want a neutral csm then vote for trebor he has proven to be useful helpful and actually wants to help ccp make eve better
while im part of a big alliance my allegience is first and foremost to the game no single part of eve exists in isolation whether empire nullsec whs industry pvp whatever eve has its appeals to a wide variety of people and play styles which is one of its great strengthsso im not for protecting anybodys rights as such i am for protecting the integrity of the gameplay experience for everybody
pffffssshhhtt  i just spat out my drink all over my screen and stopped reading right there
not in an alliance but i am nullsecso best of both
there are a number of good non 00 candidatesi suggest you look at the vote match site and see which candidate best matches your eve directions and then have a chat with themor you can just vote for me
while i appreciate kalles kind words i would be remiss if i did not point out that they also apply to quite a few candidates such as meissa anunthiel seleene ripard teg jonathon silence and roc weiler i recommend you check out their campaign platforms and threads and mine of course before making your final decision
this flag is waved by folks who just seem to want to look for problems with my campaign overall and eve in general if you want a bit more background on this ive covered that in this blog post a few words on supercap rage i dont deny things are ed atm but the real issue is that these kind of balance changes should be receiving much more attention than just looking at them every few yearsas for the rest im in a 00 alliance at the moment but our alliance ticker is fail and i heard that we just let bobby atlas join one of the corps 3 bobbyon a more serious note as trebor said there are quite a few nullsec candidates who have a lot more on their mind than just preserving the status quo if you would like to know why i am running for csm or what i did when i worked at ccp you can click the links feel free to explore my blog or my campaign thread as well and youll quickly see that i dont favor any one particular style of gameplay over any otherin particular you mentioned being able to destroy abandoned outposts you should probably read my blog post about that linkagethe focus of eves iteration should be on ensuring that all elements of the game continue to evolve as equally as possible because its all connected on some level
i think most of the good candidates are going to view all playstyles equal no matter the regionof course not all candidates are goodhisec mission runner and 00 anomaly farmer are two different kinds of people just like hisec suicide ganker and 00 fleet warfare expert are but we need all of themi believe eve is a game where there is enjoyment for everyone and will try to make it as balanced as i can if electedif you need extra proof i am not part of any alliance atm and dont plan to enter any sov holding alliance in the near future
i have posted on many occasions that while im part of a large 00 alliance i am not a 00 only advocate im using my 00 experience to understand all livable areas better and help bring an understanding of all areas of game playadditionally there are a few nc based candidates that are not simply nc monkeys running to control seats please dont generalize us al into that bucket
rippard has spent a lot of time in empireuse to run lvl 4s w himhe knows the empire side of the game very well and is running on behalf of a large alliance block he has also been tasked by the old csms not running witht he faction warfare revitalization and other empire issues
mei have a blog detailing missioning and hisec activitiesi care about the new player experience due to my years as a teacheri currently am not in an alliance and the one i was in was so hisec carebearish we would sometimes try to save the better rockson the other handi have flown with the bastards sat in gate camps as part of ouch and written about the past two sessions of csm 4 and 5i do know the other sides of the coinbut i have no ties to null sec alliances     no agenda to grind save that which the electorate will give mememike azariahm
i am one that is here for all capsuleers not specifically having my own corp and alliance in mind would be nice to have a little reward coming to my corp but it isnt my goal my goal is to improve eve online for everyone in general may it be newby high sec roamer low sec pilots pirates or well yes pains me to say but even goons in a way i want to focus on eve itself instead of personal agendas like most have improving the game will be good for everyone in the long runyes i am mostly for high sec here and yes i want to add additional tutorials to explain several aspects of pvp what goons do scamming issues etc so that new pilots also know about this and less of such problems will occur the goons made eve so bad that hardly anyone trusts the other not even own corp members unless rl friends i guess
i think i am the candidate you are looking forim an empire player never really been to 00 except to get podkilled in a megablob campgate oncei am not part of an alliance im ceo of my own 10 members corp and i play with my friends in other empire corpssmall alliances 100 playersi want to represent empire players i feel like 5 years old 00 players cant understand empire players any more and thats why im runningin game i am an antipirate lowsec pvper teaching pvp to young players everyday and helping my industrial friends to fight against pirates and hisec griefersit doesnt mean i only know that kind of game though i play with industrials miners missionners explorers every single day and pirates are my fooood so i want them to be happy in lowsec too im also interested in 00 but not the napfestpowerbloc 00 we have right now i think my external views on 00 might help the csm somehow because im not used to 00 as it is now and i have no personal advantages to protect i will only try to improve 00 as a whole especially for smaller entities and small gangsfeel free to contact me ingame convo or evemailmy original thread 
as youll see from my website and how stroppy ncgoontest posters get around me my primary focus is to prevent the game becoming a 00 alliance love in  join the cause brother
i think i am exactly the candidate you are looking for i have consistently supported getting ccp to pay more attention to the eve experience of players not in big alliances or not focused on hard core 00 play i hope youll take a moment and look at my campaign web page i think you might find im someone you could feel good about voting forissler dainze csm platformissler dainzethe voice of reason csm candidate
this guysays he wants to oppose the major alliances makes some pretty solid arguements about what he sees happening but does little to mention what he wants with the job  thats one side however the rebel rebelling against the rebelious is pretty much my cup of tea  im just wondering tho does he check out i mean goons have had a long career of scamming and ing over basicly any1 they could so is the guy who he says he is any1 knowxps and ye  paranoia but u know itd be like em to do it
i dont mean to troll but in my opinion you should probably vote for a candidate based upon what he promotes not who he opposesthat doesnt necessarily means me although would be the right choice ofc but at least not someone with a campaign which seems to revolves mostly around omg the nc wants all the csm seats 11one
a vote for windypops is a vote for paranoia and fearmongering eve players are better than this
white tree  really enjoying all the attention youre giving me im flattered that given the thousands of players who have been told to vote for you from you alliance you see me as such a threat im a vote for paranoia and fearmongering you say i thought it was mitanni whose threads titles theyre lying to youas to the op thanks for your interest i do see the biggest single threat facing this game as the near total monopoly that one group of allied players are trying to establish however over the last weeks ive also been outlining my key priorities as stamping out bots championing the smaller alliances reinvigorating empire warfare  a focus on rebuilding eve as a shared community  community tools events programme gm debates and so forthive discussed these elsewhere but starting tomorrow ill focus on each one in detail in a blog on my site feel free to contact me directly if you would like to discuss

i can confirm that i have known of him for a considerable time prior to that my knowledge of him was limited to me reading some of his forum posts that are now seen as revolutionary groundbreaking and are viewed with awe by manyi can vouch for his high moral fibre his personal avatar and his ingame picturei felt like you that this was one of the few candidates that made sense  vote now vote hard and vote for windy dont let the fools and trolls distract you only windy is winning 
an irritation is not a threat
thank god ive been meaning to go to my doctor for weeks now about that itch
i appreciate the votes even if i do not agree with the last bit of your post but assuming you are right and we all are monsters acting only in our own best interests it behooves you to find someone whose interests are most likely to match your own avoid voting for someone with a very   set   agenda and purpose as they are most likely to diverge from the common path once they get what they want or are balkednot that i am pointing the finger at any single opponentm
i voted for mike because he seems one of the few capable of approaching problems in a reasonable way that actually works to solve it he has innovative solutions that enhance the game rather than crudely removing certain aspects he is realistic and not out to just fix one or two hotbutton issues but wants to work to improve all the little things as wellalso he doesnt try to win votes by spamming a funny pictures gallery like some other people might in short i am a heron vote mike azariah for csm or i will come into your kitchen tonight and mess up your pots and pans
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesa little propaganda
i suggest another point of view for this problem small gang warfare is done by small independent entities while we know that everybody loves going around with their 5 friends when  hits the fan you will want to call all your friends thus putting an end to small gang warfare unless you have no friends the problem is that weak independent entities cant survive the contact with bigger forces but why survivability of the logistical backbone of a group of pilots is bound with their performance in fleetcapital battles the game needs logistical structures other than poses and outposts that can assure survivability to their owner through hard work and smart playing avoiding direct confrontation with a more powerful force this will guarantee survival to small entities and small gang warfare everywhere smugglers and guerrillas do exist in real world but they rely on structures and tactics that have almost no correspondence in eve

i agree that ccp has neglected small gang and solo pvp i wont answer the questions directly but i believe if we can get ccp to revamp low sec that low sec could be the place to bring back real small gang or solo pvpissler dainze
does ccp fly the ships in engagements do they call for ship typeshonestly no it is usthe playerbase that has neglected small gang pvpnow this may be a result of our changing priorities within the game we ourselves atribute our demands according to what we deem necessary to acheive we ourselves have played long hard and grown more economically viable and skillfull at the same time with our increase in wealth and skill we are able to fly bigger better stronger as a result we doalliances and fcs could work out small gang pvp if they so chose ultimately very few do the powerblocs need muscle to retain build and grow as a result it becomes subject to the fish syndrome  you know big fish eat little fish etci truely bleieve we need to stop asking ccp to change the game purely because of our own shortcomings if you want small gang  make samll gangs
i would like to take this opportunity that we are all players involved in a game who a candidate usually shoots at matters far less than who they are how well they know the game and what rl experience they can bring to the csm tableall i ask is that players look past the us vs them political frenzy and look at who the candidates are and which one will best represent all playersof course my totally unbiased opinion is that the best candidate is me

if that is not a euphemism then no
if i understand this thread correctly it was whaaaaa i dont have as many friends as mittens and vuk then a bunch of people comparing others to political entities that have no similarities to the actual players vuks nothing like a north korean dictator mittens like a nut job pseudoreligious conservative bobblehead nahas far as a leader ive always envisioned mittens as the goalie mask dude in roadwarrior or tina turner in thunderdome in charge because they cant really find anyone with as much sense or vision so the mob obeysto a point as far as ive witnessed no one controls the goons the mob is just steered as long as the mob finds the targets entertaining they play alongfor vuk hes more along the lines of scarface or a hands on mobster bribes are made people are paid but he gets his own hands dirty too he makes good on pacts and deals and to my knowledge hes never backstabbed a friend as for the kim jong il haremwhat happens in 4s stays in 4s
how would this be workable whats to stop each designated csm candidate setting up nonaffiliated alts that cant be linked to an account in a clusternc corporation after all ive been instructed to vote for a specific individual vile rat best rat  it makes absolutely no difference to me as to which corporation that character is in
sucks to be you
the best way to have a fair impartial csm is to make it a lottery instead of voting
even though i have my likes and dislikes towards certain candidacies i have to strongly disagree with the opyou cant compare the csm to a nations government this alone due to the fact whereas a government is elected not only to represent but also to lead and decide the course of action the csm is merely a tool to help ccp to get player issues served more clearly and act as a soundboardnext to that excluding people or powerblocks from the csm elections purely because they come from such blocks is the same as opening votings only to those whom you might like or dislikeif you feel strongly for a certain candidate you help his of her campaign if you feel strongly adverse to a candidate you present your concerns and let people decideccp opens the csm seats for anyone who qualifies and puts in an application for it but comparing an internet game with real life is just plain ed because in real life if i would get slammed hard for certain actions or inactions i do ingameand also how politics run where you are from might differ from where i am from here its that people have to have a certain bottom limit of people who support you if you reach that then you can also run your candidacynext to that even if the majority of the csm would be taken by the nc and its brosefs do you really think ccp will do gameimplementations to benefit that group without it benefitting the rest of eve aswelyou could give the csm and ccp a bit more credit than that
fyp
actually it was a tip of a friend not to make it too long so changed my original post in something a lot less long wasnt posted until then eitherthe work as modder and in other games makes me more a think along in their term kinda person meaning i know more about the work that they do in other words making sure that at least someone things further then a regular gamer i see potential where others only see something failing i see something more in something less a quick idea i can work out very rapidlypiracy itself is not the biggest problem i am more concerned about goons like you a pirate has at least some concern and pride towards hisher fellow capsuleers a goon does not a pirate does not attack in high sec without good reason a goon does a pirate does not prey on new or weaker players a goon doeswanting new ships is not the only thing read again and it it not what i want it is what the capsuleers want many want to see more ships appear specifically t3 ships for most however i want to try to get more ships in general besides ships i want to see that new fitting objects will become available like t3 stuff which could increase the fun of playing for everyone event for you goonsi am sure you didnt notice its very hard to miss uhum i say no to goons already and clearly i have the guts to do so so why wouldnt i be ablet o say no to ccp when needed kinda not a smart remark dont ya think think you should go back to your ship and stop trying you are obviously not into reading nor to see the advantages not that it is different with any goon havnt seen a single one that actually did know a thing or two that showed any intelligence edityes as you can see i am well capable of showing my teeth and using them
what are your thoughts on aspergers being merged with the autism spectrum in dsm5this is relevant because it reflects on your ability to interpret expert decisions and defer to authority
you dont get goonswarm do yousome of our enemies do but you do notbrisco smiley random bob alt circa 2007 dy morphin of bca a day after we evicted them
is there anyone that does have something useful to say related to the topic and no that does not include talking about my autism its not point of the topic 
you brought it upnobody discussed roosevelts polio induced paralysis but that was because he didnt wear it like a ing badge to get elected
i didnt wear a badge to get insulted either and still you goons do it see the irony
no i dontprivatizing the gain socializing the lossyoure all more then willing to accept any praise or pity but no criticism or contempt you do not have the stomach or patience to be heckled something which every member of goonswarm the dc the nc and to be entirely honest a good portion of nullsec accept as part of the game to put it plainly on most online social communities with a b culture you would be heckled to ragequit for claiming to be an aspy because claiming to be an aspy is the last hope of a desperately antisocial person attempting to rationalize why they cant get any friends without having scrutinize their own actions and interactions
does bringing up topics and then telling people not to talk about them work for you as a communications strategybeing on the csm involves a lot of communication with important internet spaceship people no less so this is a more important question than you might think
talking about something is something different then burning someone to the ground for it but i guess no goon thoughed about that so you guys are actually trolling and actually on the edge of discrimination
i couldnt care less about your medical condition you got my vote because your views seem to match my owneveryone knows the ui is a joke so i think all members of the csm need to push for changes in that particular areai really want to see some changes made to the war dec system it is currently unfair to the people who did not instigate the war especially when the aggressors are all alts and only log on once their neutrals have your location you should try living in wh space for a while so you can identify some issues and think of what additions could be madeps perhaps you should remove the bit about your medical status as every idiot in eve seems to be concentration on nothing but that
just as a follow up to my comments regarding high sec war decsthe cost of a war should increase each week for the aggressor anyone who wishes to drop from the aggressing corp should have to wait 24 hour regardless if they have roles or notif a neutral remote repairer assists corp a while they are engaged in a fight with corp b corp b should have kill rights on that person for 48 hour
thank you for your vote and concern however i refuse those same idiots to winthe ui can indeed improve its currently not what it should be although it is not my main spear point for now but yes when i get chosen i will look into this and start up a topic specifically about this and what you as user have for ideas it might be the best way to come to a nice solutionthe wardec system is high in my list to be changed currently the aggressor has to much advantage indeed but lets get in the csm first
one thing i forgot im frenchwhy is it relevant  even if i like english it means i have litteraly lots of friends in real life who dont want to play eve because they feel their english is not good enough and thats really really sad they could be great players in this gameright now german and russian clients exist but ccp is reluctant to introduce new langages because eve is not made to be translated textboxes sometimes have a fixed sized and so on eve client would need a big revamp to be easily translatedif im elected in csm ill make sure this particular topic is not forgoten by ccp and i think it should be part of a bigger ui modification  kill two birds with one stone 
peter is a good guy and i would deffinitely think he can do some good for the csmgot my vote  loki

while every voice must be heard and i respect your opinions as a fellow csm candidate i have a feeling from your platform that your 8 months of playing in eve were not sufficient for you to get the general idea of what eve is about perhaps spent too much of those months in hisec most of your choices are advocating for increased safety in eve which would pretty much kill the game eve is a cold harsh place and we must keep that dark atmosphere in place for it to be interesting every player and character has his place no matter if theyre killing asteroids or other ships while the hisec pirate may seem an unfriendly fellow to the unexperienced player he is too a gentle fluffy creature with a fragile ecosystemif you are the kind of people who are good at carrying others opinions and have strong commitment to make eve a better place id recommend that you start by joining other groups of players and explore different playstyles before running again for csm for now please drop dont break the game
yup it is long and there are longer skills to come but that is what comes with the commitment to the game it is a time grind as opposed to a kill x number of rats i would not change it and i am especially against anything in rmt that will alter the timeline or allow you to buy your way to the top aside from the approved character transferm
every mmo has its means of progression eve has a twopronged approach  skills and resources skills are gained over time resources iskshipsetc are mostly gained by player prowess personally i like this system because you dont need to have played for a long time to be able to get access to plenty of resources so long as you engage your brain also you shouldnt be able to lose things that cost more than you would be likely to replace t2capitals until you have been able to reach a point where you can relatively easily replace thempersonally im training jdc5 right now and its taking a long time 31 days total but ive trained a pile of shorter skills previously so i can do plenty of things well while im waiting for that next step
the amount of time it takes to train skills doesnt concern me too muchthe reason being is because you can be very effective with low skillpointsfor example when i had a lowly 10mil in skillpoints i was successfully solo pvping in frigatesand by successful i mean i was handily killing some battlecruisers cruisers all interceptors and eating 00 hulks with relative easeall in a t1 frigatethose skillpoints only matter in terms of where you are putting themif you start a new character and youre putting all your points into corporation management first youre not going to be great for pvp right out of the gatethe same goes for any professionyou dont need the best of the best to be successfulhonestly the only delay i see with the skill tree is getting into t2 variant ships thats permissible because as stated before theyre supposed to be specializedthe best thing i can suggest is take a look at the certificate system that ccp implementedit will help you decide whats worth training and in addition most ships have recommended certificateson top of that download evemon and try making a skill plan to followeve is a long term game it makes sense to have long term skills
wish i could change that indeed even a few days less could be handy but yeah ccp will likely not change that since its basically how they get their income the longer we have to wait for skills the more they get payed may it be in time cards or plex it sure is a problem for many it takes way to long to get skills sometimes i work on a hulk for a month so far and i still have about 14 to 16 days left just takes to long
having managed a bunch of pilots doing carrier 5 all cruisers to 5 on many toons and many bs 5 on many toons to many to list the reality is the length is good it creates a high level of entry on high level ships i do not feel there is any issue as frustrating as it can be it makes senselook at it this way just in terms of a single new pilot it will take you a few months to get into a hac as such it will take you that few months before you can learn how to fly use afford that hac same with a carrier i cant tell you how many 2 week old noobs are after a thanatos or a nyx having no clue whats it takes to actually buy use or move one if you could use one in 3 months instead of 6 well the pvper in me is all for the awesome noob tears but overall for the player its not a good experiencebasically i do not thing shortening the training time is in anyone best interest
one of the main reasons for the skillqueues being so long is that eve online is a rather complex mmo as is if you were to just give everyone the ability to jump in whatever ship they wanted theyd fail horribly and die in a firethe slow buildup of skills pretty much forces people to fly around and get used to eve before they can jump into the really expensive toys it might seem to be a bit boring but it enables people to gain the necessary experience most of the time needed to actually fly wellalso personally i consider every high level ship i can fly to be a badge of honour a testament to the time ive spent playing the game and of the effort ive put into itso basically the removal of learning skills was an excellent choice but the skills themselves shouldnt really be adjusted
eve is a game that rewards long term commitment i wouldnt have it any other way
ill pretty much give you the same answer as the other candidates herewhile training some skills can take weeks or months it of course seems tedious but thats an important part of the game contrary to wow you cant reach level 70 and thats just fine that way i would certainly not change that if i could having rare skills at a high level is what makes your character different from the others its all about being a specialist and teaming with other who have compatible skillsets
to be fair mittens does have a damned cute puppy
omfg please tell me you didnt just do that wow you take insecurity to a whole new level seriously wtf jc harmlessly replies to a comment i make and you get all anal and spam rl picsnext up we have the swimsuit debate saying that no matter what happens my boat will always be better than yours assuming you got yours hohohoho

this isnt what spam means
since we are asking the hard questions vile rat how does it feel to be the mittanis 
it seems i made some one show his true feelings its obvious you trying to feel better by making others feel worse trust me sooner or later you will get banned for it enjoy your day
well look at that you didnt actually quote any of my text go figure i will sell you verbs for 50 million isk each ill put that on my todo list somewhere beneath helping that charming nigerian fellow get back his massive inheritance that the authorities have cruelly denied him
yeah why vote for a goon when there is white tree an excellent choice
no you dont you speak without being concerned with thoughtwindjammer
ooooh burn
lightweight thats all it takes to burn you
perhaps but doesnt it seem suspicious to you that someone with the moral compass of mits needs to have a cute puppywindjammer
imma scared
my moral compass works brilliantly i just happen to be a sadist nothing wrong with that
i agree though ive given some thought as to the welfare of the cute puppywindjammer
what a surprise not one single name of a single super pilot who had their loss removed because you were lying in order to troll another lie aaa not blue atlasdot not blue not even going to bother checking all the alliances in stainwagon funny then that you cant cite any of it at all i wonder maybe its because youre making it up
finn maybe you should log in game
more trolling and go figure not one single cite you can start with five nc supercap pilots who had their losses deleted as you lied of course you wont cite that since you were trolling your trollline at this point is its not the provable fact that i was lying in order to troll its the mere fact that im disagreeing that has you unfairly label me as a trolland as ive already checked you are ing awful at trolling i can confirm that you were lying and both atlasdot and aaa are not blue this is because youre trolling why you are given to lying so obviously in order to troll is beyond me a better troll would be something like rzr doesnt have a nap with aaa and stainwagon but they have a secret nip and will leave their space alone in perpetuity at least thats a lie thats hard to disprove but any razor pilot can log in check our standings and see that youre lying why youre lying is anybodys guess from thinking that the nc has no more than 20 titans and 8 motherships to the rest its really not rational
a lot will try yeah and i fear a lot trow in bots to do mass votes for those that are on their side which makes this all unfortuantely a race we can not win cheating is not allowed but neither enforced
bots you know theres only one vote allowed per subbednontrial account right so you cant autovote or rig anythingyou want to be on the csm to help guide gameplay changes but you dont even know how the voting process works thatsscary
you can please ignore everyonei think this is just a case of having excellent candidates and nothing to do with your seizing of power in north korea mr jong lau
you clearly dont know much about hacking cracking or however they wanna call it these days enough people are smart enough to do bad things but good things well no they clearly never heared of it
thanks for presuming a lack of dastardly knowledge on my part ah so your master theory is not some sort of automated vote scheme but a hijacking hacker thingallow me to take that a step further if someone gained your account information they could not only cause you to vote the way they wanted if you havent already voted anyway but could drain every one of your characters dry of assets maybe do some rmt and biomass the characters afterwards but lets assume the nefarious hackers behind this arent too ambitious and just want the free trip to iceland to smell the sulpher and get locked in a room with other mmo nerds all dayit seems likely that at some point this hijacking will be discoveredbe it through log audits unusual ip access to accounts if you live in germany and a single us ip accesses your account once thats kind of a red flag fyi or some other irregularityif youre going to do this youre not going to do this for just a few dozen votes but a few hundred and then the beneficiary of the hacked votes will willingly go to iceland to spend a day locked in a room with ccp sreegs who will probably have some choice words to relate about account security which may not go smoothly since i can vouch that the man is a ragefueled beast prone to terrible outbursts you should hear what he does to catsor youre trying to gin up some 1337 hacker bogeyman in a paranoid delusion to justify your rabid martyr complexor maybe i know more about tech stuff than i let on click here to have your account hijacked to vote for goonscmon you want to click it
you are absolutely correct in choosing white tree as your elected representative at least you have a
cool idea  definitely like the graphics update idea also really like the idea of noacceleration warp speedi agree warp speeds would need to be lowered to compensate average ship travel speed and session timers may need to be lowered for the now superfast warping intieschanges to the align mechanicim not so sure about i dont dislike the idea but there are some valid concerns and it needs further thoughtwhy not make being aligned at speed help your warp drive spin up faster diverting built up power from your engines to the warp core  visually slowing you down to a stopi imagine it like there being an extra 10 of the speed bar thats red and normally empty the bar fills up from the right and when it meets the speed level which fills from the left your bar goes fullred and you immediately hit your maximum warp speed with a flashy warp effectthis extra bar segment would take 1s to fill for all but the slowest ships and it would remove instawarp from aligned ships but allow for the rapid disengage that people worry about nerfing here
not sure i like this idea some good some bad to itbut i think people who picked ed names should have to live with them  it wasnt all that funny when you picked it andwell now its a weight around your neck
i will let this thread say it all
i support this naturally
give dronez a chance ccp
agreed but also give drones implants to control meatbags
i love my little drones and like any other weapon system they need proper affection when theyre starting as a young hobgoblin i and growing up with their dreams of one day being an ogre ii implants connecting you with them show you care
i agree drones are after all my prefered weapon system despite the fact that we dont get implants low slot damage enhancers or damage rigs aside from sentryi think it only makes sense to balence them as the other weapons are with the same sort of mods and implants for them
and that would be spot on innocent people arent going to have their sec status go down in the first place
very much supported

the only changes i believe should be made is that the siege timer needs to be halved and the range while in siege needs to be doubled or tripledthe timer should of been changed years ago its stupid to keep it at 10 minutesthe range is due to the followingmost dreads have the issue that they are a in combat too long and b cant hit their targets while doing the damage they need to be doingthe current gun arrangements for a dread are about the following close range  close range ammo  up to 5000 dps but only 2030 km range close range  long range ammo  up to 2500 dps but only 5080 km range long range  close range ammo  up to 2000 dps but only 70150 km range long range  long range ammo  up to 1000 dps but only 200240 km range1000dps is pitiful for the range you need which is why dreads are not usedbattleships can do half this damage at the same range yet dont cost as much dont require the same skills and can be moved about easily around the battlefieldthe other issue is that the secondary targets of dread which are super and capital ships can easily move outside the dreads closer ranges within its siege cyclethe slowest super caps move at 60ms base which is without any skills and very unlikelybut even at this speed the target can move 36km away in the 10 minutes of your cycle and the more likely speed of 7590ms ignoring people who have mwd and speed implantsmods on their super caps will end up 4554km away from you which pretty much nullifies most close range guns from all common logicthen their is the small issue that 99 of the time you do not warp in on the target at 0 and most groups of capital ships bump sods law dictates that you bump away from the targetso you end up with a ship that is useless with half its guns and are forced to use long range ammo which means its likely better that you just use battleships
its too fast and shouldnt have a drone bay at all
if you take away its drone bay and speed it becomes a firetail
dramiel is the only frig i have in station right now and its been that way for a whilesupportedgj podcat on an excellent breakdown of why
always thought it odd that you cant train up an alt on the same account at the same timeadd some limitations to avoid massive biomassing after events like the geddon something like an increasing timer depending on total sec status loss over a set amount of time say 14 days dont have the numbers but its an amount that should be felt up to a point where bioing your alt would take 23 months rplore since youre an outlaw you cant biomass through the direct official channels  working around the scrutiny of the biomassing apparatus requires time and the lower your sec rating is the longer it will take the evade that scrutinyevery 3 months this timer woud be flushed for all characters
wouldnt it make more sense business wise to ask for character transfers to be payable with plex instead
what happens when youre in highsec and that happens
both of your issues have already been resolved in the thread please read if you want to know how
it is a nerf but how is it a huge nerf those arent fighting ships theyd still be at safe spots only difference now is that the pilot would be paying attention and aligned for warp out in combat its either scrambled and dead or not scrambled and warping to safe spot
buy interceptorwarp between celestial objects till your within 1020000km mwd towards target using directional scannerits not that hard 
i have a network of safes along my usual roaming routes that cannot be reached by warping between celestials such spots are not at all hard to obtain
you seem to have missed part of my post it would in fact be a massive nerf to on grid gang boostersliang
comments no im not lying you are being dense and my position hasnt changed even a little bit you can gang boost from a safe spot even if you arent unprobeable its more risky but thats ok command ships are flat better than t3s if you are jumping into the enemy t3s are flat better than command ships if you have time to get in position before the fight gang boosting t3s were not designed to be on the field of battle and are pretty damn useless if thats where you force them to behome field advantage is many things this is simply one of themliang
if there is a requirement for having booster ongrid then i agree that 100 sig would be unnecessary nerf however since nobody forces you to stay on grid now to provide the boosts the extra sig is just a small nuisance
ive gone through a pretty large amount of effort to point out the times when you really want your gang boosting to happen on grid and specifically be done by command ships a 100 sig radius would be a huge nerf to that kind of gameplay  which you argue isnt even overpowered furthermore it also isnt a requirement to gang boost from off grid face it the problem real problem is a ship being unprobeable so fix that instead of needlessly nerfing command ships liang
you need to learn too eve how to workingunscannable when the signature radiussensor strength  108check it and you will see a miracle on your scannerexactly you wont see 100 scanner results never
you seem to have missed something in his post liang
well that would be the end for outlaw logistics in lowsec as they never ever will be able to jump as they will refresh each others agression timer indefinitely with the chain and if they drop the chain the sentries will make sure nothing but dust will jump across after 60 seconds
is that supposed to be a bad thing
spoken like a true idiotthe idea is to prevent exploitation of a faulty game mechanic you just stated that you should have the ability to agress someone then use a logi to rep you so you can stop shooting them and deagress if you get in trouble so you now have a 12k dps tanks and you can sit pretty while a neutral keeps you alive in the fight the other guy might as wll just give up and go home there is supposed to be risk in pvp not every possible advantage for the guy who wants to do iti had a fight the other day all my pvp seems to go this way where i took on 10 guys outside a station just me in a hurricane vs 4 combat ships and logis and a probe scanning my fit i new what i was getting into when i flipped the can but thats some lousy pvp with 10 against 1i admit i still had fun but thats probably because i didnt give a crap almost nobody ever has the balls to take me one on one unless they know they have a guaranteed win in a better ship say command ship vs frigate or maybe a hac vs a cruiser eve isnt just about pvp but its a good part of it theres a number of people as usual whod like that to be all it has to offerbut then theyd be broke or the best and everybody would quit youd have a thousand people left on the server playing wargames all over empire and nullthe more you choose pvp the less game there is going to be less people less content less interestmake them accountable if you pvp youre a target
then youve clearly missed the point logistics has counters if you let them go about their business and rep people unhindered then yes you deserve to get your ship blown uptry ewar try neuting try just about anything other than shooting the things theyve got a 70m signature radius t2 resists and are built to do nothing but repair damage is it really that surprising that shooting them isnt the best ideaand if they dock up congratulations you can shoot your target again unhindered by those evil neutralreppersoh and incidentally its not neutral reps youre complaining about now i can do exactly what you described with a wardecd logistic ship too
sure there are counters as with most things but i fear you are the one missing the pointexampleyou have a nice wardec against an equally deranged foe and good times are assuredonce fighting starts all nice and even like a bunch of neutrals start flashing as they repair the enemy you can divert fire to dockjump them  you lose dps race you can choose to ignore them  you lose dps race you can bring da blob  youll never get a fightit is loselose for the side not abusing itmechanics as they are actually encourage the use of neutral rr in high and lowsec i am quite frankly surprised that there are not a multitude of groups offering neutral rr services for wardecees  completely noncommittal and 100 safedont even get me started on undock carriers those are even worse but thankfully rare in civilized spaceex dockable rr pretty much obsoletes the entire disable station services side of null attrition warfare
i personally favour a nuclear option to curtail neutral remote repping have any character who remote repssensor boostscap transfers another character inherit their aggression and suffer the full consequences of it that would firstly include the standard jumpaggro timer but also impose additional penaltiestake the following example you have ships a b and c c being a neutral remote reppera and b are at war have canflipped or are otherwise engaged remote repper c then reps b as b is engaged with a the remote repper should suffer the consequences of attacking a and anybody else who b has attacked in the last 60 seconds as if they themselves had attacked them as such unless c could legitimately attack a ie a is red to him c should suffer the consequences of an unprovoked attack mainly getting concorded in highsec or going gcc in lowsecthis would effectively limit remoterepping to nonneutrals in highsec while making their use in lowsec less attractive while people would still be free to remoterep it would be neccessary to have your remotereppers incorp or wardec the enemy with them separately this would force people to effectively play with their hand of cards visible and allow their oponents to properly scout the available logistics to to reduce abuse and mistakes a do you really want to do that type popup could be shown if a player is about to rep a dangerous target as well as interrupting the rep cycle if your target aggresses on another oponentstationessentially the ingame rationale for this would be that concord should take a rather dim view of neutral parties interrupting a sanctioned war and should respond appropriately
i guess its not enough that using a logistics in low sec means youre going to be taking sentry fire 100 of the time youre undocked and if youre in the fw taking a faction standings hit to your own faction every time you rep someone maybe we can just have concord spawn and blow you up every time you activate a remote repair module or maybe we can just give logistics ships jump drives because thats the only way youll ever get a pair of guardians through a gate no he didnt miss the point you are see the problems that youre pointing out are all strictly related to stations  not gates all the action that happens on gates is pretty well balanced and has a multitude of well known and well used counters so fix the problem stations not neutral or hostile or whatever rrliang
and how would you propose such a solution would look no actions possible within docking range perhapsthe null blobs would be very cross if you took away a reason to flaunt their leet camping skills doesnt matter if you take stations out of the equation though they just serve to make the problem of neutral activity stand out they can come at range and still be relatively safe depending on engagement type all that does is add damps as counter which again impacts fight outcome neutral rr on highlow gates allows complete immunity concord protects the neutral you have to shoot the rr to make them jump thus losing dps race and you need more dudes to intercept on other side which only works if unscouted as excessive numbers tend to discourage fightsit remains loselose no matter where you run into neutrals assisting one side only way to insulate one from it is to use it oneself which is why it must go
im game for any number of solutions which nerf station games instead of needlessly nerfing logisticsthis is you complaining that someone is fighting you someone call the waaaahmbulanceim pretty sure they still have playercorp aggression for assisting during the war dec i dont believe this is controlled by system even if it isnt thats a really terrible reason to nerf an otherwise balanced and working ship classpractically speaking this is a non issue because you need people either already on the other side or ready to jump through read not aggressed to catch anyone who deagressesliang
i approve of it being nerfed in what way im not sure yet
neutral only flashes to whomever is directly affected by his actions so if and only if you have shot at the target being repped at the time he is repped  perhaps you should read up on the topic before commenting further if you only ever ride with a blob where you can have people everywhere and have a good chunk not pulling their weight just in case they have to jump sure it is a nonissue  have a nice day moron enjoy circlejerking yourself from here on out
so what youre saying is that if youre shooting someone on a high sec gate and and he brings in a bunch of neutral rr and reps himself up that they become flagged to you even if they jump into the next systemwow that sounds exactly like what i said would happen and something that isnt broken i fly in extremely small gangs  from 16 people my opponents fly in small gangs of 10150 yes we totally blob that is exactly what you are complaining aboutmoronliang
what this thread needs is a counter proposalif a logistic ship reps someone with a timer of any sort they inherit the timer in question they do not get a fresh timer they instead receive whatever time is left on the party in questionexample arty tempest blasts someone on a gate thinking he can survive the 30 seconds to redock after it blows up he cant and calls for reps with 10 seconds left both the tempest and the logistic can jump 10 seconds laterif any other logistics ships are currently aiding that logistics they will probably inherit the timer too they wont be able to jump until 10 seconds have passed but at least the whole gang wont be stuck on the gate indefinitely because the guardians need to keep their cap upthere now logis cant rep and immediately dock up after you shoot them  they just have to survive for 30 seconds however unlike in your proposal we can actually cease our offensive actions  that is repping people that are still actively firing on you without committing suicide cutting our mutual capacitor chain
i support fixing of neutral remote repair this is the primary focus of my campaign as it is a matter of balancing high secsupport manalapan here
exactly the system works as it is in the context of eve which is the only relevance needed also realworld pilot training and type certification is more complex than op thinks it is not supported
stopped reading here but im guessing you want ccp to change everything for you because you are impatient
no other game allows 10 minute lag if youre lucky a couple of hours worst case limit the people that can enter a system to something you can handle like 300400
a major problem i have with the test server is its alignment with the main server for the people who arnt hard core sisi users you always find your sp somewhere between 1001000000 sp behind its a pain in the a and very annoying when that happens to me the test server is unattractive and i wont touch it until the next mirror which i always seem to miss because i have a lifeproposial 1 all characters get 2mil sp when test server is mirroredproposial 2 all characters get 10 5 2 allowacated skillpoints when mirrored orproposial 3 all skills to 5 or at least a level higher2 example if i have 20mil sp on main server i get 2mil sp allowacated sp when the test server mirrors the reason this is reasonable is because only high sp characters will get the benifit sticking people to their normal character and not dozens of under 1mil sp toonsvote for onemy vote is for 2 because its reasonable
no support or critisism
not if you wait only 20min
i would prefer a red small inner border 1px around the square dots which are waypointsplease no flashing or blinking stuff
the color blind amongst us thank you for your suggestion liang
seriously do even five seconds of research before you propose something that has been on this board literally halfadozen times before and has already been doneand for that matter its a stupid idea japan is an industrialized nation that was prepared for the event in question haiti was not
wrong malcanis  there are many modules where t2 is better than m4 m4 being superior is the exception rather than the rulei do not support this change though its a little odd but its not an issuem4 always has lower fitting reqs but t2 often has better effectiveness
it doesnt here which is sort of the problem the t2 module has all of the drawbacks and 0 benefits
wrong it shouldntif you look hard enough youd probably find a dev post saying that
i didnt say m4 is always better than t2 just that all the m4 ew modules are
ok so it seems everyone wants the old cyno effectand i think its a great ideathis also i think make preformance better this is howlooked hectic and i think thats why the changed it but what if you only had oneof these and the ships would come out of it im no programmer or game designer so this is just an ideathe cyno becomes the tunnel old effect and all the ships come from that 1 tunnel this also decreases cpu usage and makes it look kinda epic in my opinionflame awaythe old effectplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesedit stupidity took over
ive noticed that the best areas hisec ice belt systems always are fully occupied the rest of space is very very very really extremly ginourmous and theres enough space for anyone who wants a pos to put one upconsidering that you get mail telling you the pos is running low i feel that salvage should be permissible the instant the thing goes offline
myself and others have ineffective bookmarks 200400km on gird around some gates they can be warped to as long as you are off grid but if you are on said gates at zero meters myself and others have found it impossible to warp to to them even if the bookmarks are well beyond 150 kilometers from whatever position you may be at you cannot warp to them this happens with newly created bookmarks alsotactical bookmarks on gate grids are an essential part of pvp in this game fixing this and other bugs related to basic game play should be the focus of the csm before the addition of any new mechanicsfeatures please remember there are a whole host of issues that should be resolved first thanks kahanu
this really needs fixing combat is not the moment to find out you cannot warp to a otherwise correct bookmark
fantastic ideas as a pvp enthusiast i endorse this product fix tacticals amen
ive encountered this myself amongst other things that just seem to be caused by sloppy codingsupported
why in assembly hall thoughsounds like it is more appropriate in issues and a bugreport you have bug reported it right
thats fine as long as they change the important parts to something more robust and less serial
i approve

hes literally the glenn beck of eveohey let me answer your question with another question thats got nothing to do with the subject nobama lol
op csm doesnt lead  youre not voting for a ing government case closed
there is a saying when you throw a rock into a pack of dogs the one that got hit is the one that yelps i see lots of yelping lol good job jade  good points too
jade alt spotted
i 3 jade
you know i genuinely thought the human race had evolved beyond the point at which it was possible to be trolled by jade constantine but i guess that dude who runs eve tribune proved me wrong incredible work jade  youve still got it babe
i have just finished reading this
indulge us what is that goal
yeah honestly i hate dishonestunethical practices like i dont know spamming csm forum with barely disguised vote for me threads how many is it now
you really are a ing moron 
vote for me god knows i post enough so ive got at least some recognition in regards to my plans though i think glaring meanly at mittens  co the entire time and calling every idea they have stupid merely to be an obstructionist just about covers it oh the free trip to iceland would be p cool as well k thx bye vote4me plz i drive a turbo diesel estate sportscar
sorry i have a short attention span tbh i would have but you asked just a little too late  maybe next yearwhilst i appreciate your political viewpoint is an entitlement you hold dear i find your debate somewhat lacking thank god windyplop has at least outsentenced youindeed nothing at all like overinflating posts to 12 15 or even 19 pages for that very reason huh
i would except i have already cast all of mine 
highest match was 50 lowest was 35 but when i actually read what the lowest matched said vs the highest match it was a more accurate reflection of what the csm can and would likely do anyways it was nice to have a place to find peoples platforms all condensed together vote cast and thank you all for your commitment to the game and its improvement
thanks for creating this useful siteafter reading some of the comments on the issues made by the candidates i kept thinking the following   is that person serious about that issues or are they joking  will the devs be listening to that persons and think they really represent the average playeri may be pointing out the obvious but some manifestos seem to be the work of trolls or some type of meta gamer it is nice that ccp do this type of focus group market research but i dont see anyone who i want to vote for but a few who i hope dont get elected
hi therejust letting you know that i found this site most valuable for my making my decisionnice work
eve is not like real life where time passes equally for everyone some people play all day every day while others play a few hours a week say on weekendsthus a longer voting period is needed to give everyone an equal chance to vote reducing the voting period would favor organized ingame groups that can quickly get out their vote in a disciplined mannerthe current 2week voting period is convenient for those players who just want to set aside an hour or two to do the research make their choices and votereally what we have here is a 3 week campaign with voting open during the last 2 weeks i dont think that is excessive and it was cut down from 4 weeks 22 in the previous election
campaigning is a 7 days a week job and i do have a lifetreb you probably like the campaigning stuff in extension of your passion of being csmi personally like to spend less time in campaigning as i really dislike itcampaigning is about politics while the csm itself is actually a taskforcepolitics is about lawmaking we dont make the laws ccp doesif ccp can make voting possible through evegate then theres no more need for a 2 week period 10 days will do where 2 weekends includes
a reduction to 10 days as you suggest is certainly worth considering but i wonder if perhaps it might favor incumbents by giving new candidates less time in which to interact with the voters and become defined in their mindsone thing that might be done in the aftermath of the election would be to survey all of the candidates about their experiences and get their opinions on how the campaign process might be improved i would certainly support thisfinally i understand your concerns about the time it takes to campaign but keep in mind  you are running for a volunteer job that if you are elected is going to soak up at least 12 hours a day of your time probably more the campaign is just a taste of what is ahead for the lucky winners
shortening the voting period when the turnout is barely 1015 is a horrible ideeathat 05 each day is actually around 2000 people or 10ish extra vote casts which is likely enough to get one person into the csmif youre so busy in real life you cant wait for 1 more week and likely another 10000 extra votes maybe you shouldnt have signed up for the csm in the first place
people have reported than some names have been removed for the choice and it seems its true for at least one what does that means 
1you are jumping into conclusions too fast as voting started  march 11thlets see how many votes there will be casted after sunday the 20th day 102csm requires around 16hrs a week while campaigning will cost you every minute of the day possible
an election with 50k votes involved is a serious commitment you shouldnt try to run yourself anymore than a local elected official does you need volunteers staffers and a war room ideally its the serious footslogging in the last week where your gotv efforts and organization pull you ahead of the pack who are trying to run solo and burning to a crisp
i plead for a different way of elections for next yeari like to see a new setup4 csm candidates get into csm by players votes3 csm candidates will get into csm by jury ccp based on any criteria that the jury may have2 csm members of the current running csm can get pushed forward by the other councillors internal vote for continuation purposes rule the csm members that made use of this option cannot make use of this option twice in a row more guarantee on quality of csm less chance on csm blocks improved continuation not everyone with the best skills and plans are capable running campaign as it should or lack campaigning skillspick by jury will be fair for this group of candidates
excellent reply there mittens i wish youd come across like this from the beginning instead of the whole antitrebor drama i would seriously have considered giving you one of my votes if your campaign had been more along these lines
now thats what i call shoveling the bull a kind of anti ccpcsm rant that will appeal to the very suckers the man speaks of
yeah i have to agree to a bit iff he does think that the csm requires the subtle hand approach used when you are not in a position of power but have an eartrue the negative approach used ensured a number of the votes he got but he easily could have gotten them without it and the cost of such approach is that it alienates people he will need to work with assuming with high probability that trebor is coming back the first rule of thumb for the kind of subtle hand manuevering that he is describing is that you can not under any circumstances put people you are manipulating into the defensive its kind of like the star wars thing the tighter you close your fist the more star systems will yada yada im not wearing a brait could be that when all is said and done he will be able to smooth things over with said people when he gets face to face but if the statements made here about trebor or the others being high function autistic types or standard do well onlines but cant function face to face folks then theres pretty much no chance of thatignoring the other csm members and just looking at ccp youve effectively already put them on the defensive in as much as they even care which also goes against the subtle hand approach to do this right you have to start smooth from day one which isnt done with a thread titled theyre all lying to youedit the key is moral high ground as it implies that you arent trying to manipulate but that you have everyones best interests at heart and just want to helpof course i could have completely misunderstood what he meant in his replyedit2 i should add that the concept of alienating and moral high ground only matter with regards to the people you have to work with alienating voters doesnt matter in the slightest
youre a sad delusional little geek
one does not run a political campaign on poststructuralism if one actually has any desire to win
god do i hate broad pedantic philosophies that require a 3 volume series to define and use the intangibility of their position as a defense mechanismheres some advice get past the freshman philosophy they taught you in law school and knuckle down into some tangible reading like popper or some kitcher the latter being particularly relevant to the csm the former just being a badass and relevant to everythingok sperge done withi generally agree with the stance against binary opposition that poststructuralism holds dear and i also appreciate how that doesnt make for a good campaign however you could have chosen some straw man you wouldnt have had to deal with face to face instead of someone youll now have to subduethats part of what makes the csm so strange its not a democraticrepublic group where you can make coalitions and get stuff passed its almost more of a consensus operation from where i stand you have already hamstrung yourself a bit by fomenting dissent in the soontobe ranksor am i misreading this
why do i suddenly feel like im in the middle of a reading for good will hunting 2
sorry for the lack of a lengthy reply yesterday but basically 1 half of elections involve riling up your own base to give a  enough to actually vote they are not intellectual exercises where the best candidate wins the best campaigner wins which is one of the major flaws of representative democracy you think that my people pointing out trebors ridiculous views is a net detriment i disagree 2 you are misreading the situation because i have privileged information  well not really i have read the many public statements that the other csms have made about trebors personality many worse things have publicly been said about him as a person ive only expressed vague distaste for his dumb uninformed ideas themselves and the ruinous impact they could have on the game his consensus ideas are unobjectionable like most consensus views despite the relative brutality of mazz and helens comments he is quite obviously not the sort of person to hold a grudge and so the fact that my people are using his own posts to critique his platform is hardly the kind of set up for a grudgefest that you and similar commentators seem to think it will be in fact if you think about it sensibly for a moment or two he should send me flowers and chocolates because i have rather explicitly guaranteed that he gets a seat on the csm rather than being lost amid the shuffle of the bloc candidates my motives are pure like the driven snow tldr if it seems like my actions are nonsensical its because youre missing pieces
i actually want to vote for you and get you the chair position the crash and burn that is likely to ensue as a result of the attitude you present would be priceless personal opinion aside in the spirit of fairness and democracy i wish you luck
vote for me for spite vote for me for love at the end of the day all that matters is your vote for me heh
bump
nuff said
no time tonight for detailed replies but in the interest of bump managementah another alumni of the council of light eh
what im seeing here currently and historically are a variety of very good ideas blended in with a variety of very bad ideasthe bad ideas seem to be most focused around null sec warfare and the like generally superficial things that wont get off the drawing room floorthe good ideas on the other hand are much broader and consequential and have hit the game or have a decent chance of doing soweighting those two i would say that youre a solid candidate still though all my votes are going to prom just sayingedit also gemstone wtf that brings me back damn
nice to see such a huge response and voter turnout treb keep up the hard work5 for you
im very sorry to chase you for that but i was wondering if any response has been given thank you
as i pointed out in the discussion with yeep the point was not whether a particular and deliberately simplified example  made in my manifesto for the previous csm election  was the fix for lag what was important was the larger issue being illustratedit should be obvious to everyone that if the number of players on a node is kept well below the capacity of the node then lag will tend to go away the problem with eve is that the gamemechanics do not reward that behavior they do quite the oppositei am quite happy that you have found enjoyment in large fleet fights others have been less fortunate but i am sure that we can agree that the search for gamemechanics that would address the limitations of the eve architecture and make large battles more fun is a worthy one deserving of broad supportwhen i ran for csm last year i had no expectation of actually getting elected i ran because i was concerned about several key aspects of the game that would if not addressed eventually cause me to quit playing eve  the first game in over a decade i thought was worth a damn so my campaign platform was really a way of starting a discussion that i felt was importantif youve read my first confessions of a noob starship politician blog post youll know that i was absolutely shocked that i got elected and that in what is now a delicious irony it occurred to me that the goons had voted me in to grief me however this time around having learned through hard work what the csm and ccp can and cannot do i am running because i believe i will be even more effective in csm 6 than i was in csm 5i know that you dont share that opinion but hopefully this discussion has given other readers of the thread some insights that will help them make an informed decision in the voting booth
count me in
this thread is the largest thread since ankhsametampekeh
confirming that if windypoops had not employed me as his campaign manager i would have voted for you
vote and bump for a well experienced and respected candidate
3 votes and a friendly bump for my csm candidate of choice
2 votes for seleenethe number one concern that i have for eve is that ccp does not iterate on pastout dated content this means more than simply adding a few more missions it means actually altering and improving the game play of these mechanics the
2 votesthe stand out candidate for me in what has been a somewhat poor campaign by many of the leading contendersi guess we will see in due course if they were votes well placed
confirming im not trollingalso obligatory daily bump
just joined isslers corp its been great so far issler knows exactly what the little guys need in this game1 for issler
i support isslers bid i have known issler since i first started playing 5 months ago and i can say that she truly does care about players in eve from the newest noob to the oldtimers i agree with many of her beliefs and i believe that you should be able to play eve the way you want to also having a veteran of csm returning is a good idea too with her previous experience she can accomplish more and help represent the interests of all players of eve
huge thanks to folks that have contacted me directly to offer their supportminers industrialist folks that want low sec fixed solo and pve pilots i promise to drive your views into the csm process if electedissler dainzethe voice of reason csm candidate
microtransactions well we have little to go on regarding ccps platform re microtransactions aside from blogs like this oneccp zulus blog about microtransactinosi have a couple problems with thisfirst we have the statement its important to clarify that virtual goods sales isnt an arbitrary  or particularly greedy  decision which is backed up by a bunch of words that seem to indicate that their reasoning that it isnt greedy is that everybody else is doing it which i dont accept as a reasonable response eve has more subscribers than at any point in its history and that income has served ccp well towards being resourced to bring a good product to the table is that income suddenly inadequate to deny minor changes to the game that enhance your ability to personalize your experience to any but those who want to spend extra rl cash i feel is short changing your customer base and opening the door to subtly introducing a wide range of for fee options that make the game less immersive to those of us who only pay for a monthly subscription microtransactions are considered a reasonable income flow for games whos core content is otherwise free but in this instance it seems like a blatant bout of greed that could open up a rather slippery slope towards a game where you pay to play but if you really wanna play you gotta pay even moreso no not a fan of microtransactions in eve just release the damn content for everybody and stop trying to nickle and dime your userbase you arent an airline stop charging for peanuts
im voting for you because of your focus on the story of eve i run a lot of missions i think that ccp should use the incarna character models to enhance the missions with some cool cutscenes similar to what you see in mass effect 2 and dragon age 2 how much more fun would it be to rescue the damsel if when you drop her off at the station you get see her run weeping into the arms of your agent or in vengeance wouldnt it be cool if while warping to the final room to confront rachen mysuna you could watch her striding to the command deck of her pirate battleship and give the order to power up the weapons systems the story of eve is not just the social interactions we should have compelling single player stories too

with the stacking penalties it would make no difference in fact you might as well just have a warfare link passive defense just as well but it would have more point as its passed down the fleet also making supers overpowered and harder to kill is a dual edged sword with one side being their strength and the other loggofski aeon as it is already hard to kill unless you neutralize it
link fail and yes that is exactly why i loldalso mostly useless bump manalapan for csm
i also wouldnt want a csm member who at the first sign of hardship simply gives up and runs for the hills taking all your stuff along with himseriously you can claim scamming is an important part of eve  i dont think anyone is disputing that but supporting someone that glorifys ripping people off and claims that it was all because he was too arse lazy to actually do anything about it when things went west traits i really dont think are leadership material i guess you have a different opinion but i prefer to support leaders that wont quit and look after themselves at the first sign of trouble but will rather support their constituents
fyi you are not looking to csm members for leadership they are there to mediate with the players and pass on solid idears and the opinions of the greater eve comunityto not trust a person because of there actions inside a game is  to say the least childish and an ill concived opinion of someones charictori personaly enjoy killing noobs in eve this dus not mean that i petrolbomb school busses in real life that would just be wrongas far as legitimacy and this candidates ability to deliver the wants of the greater eve comunity i can see no better person to be voted in to the top 9he listens to peoples idears and where warrenting modifyes his veue on various subjects he is always fast to admit his mistakes his failed bank and if he can rectify it he duzso please refrain from posting personal derogitory opinions about a persons rl charictor purly based on there in game alteregoavatarmanalapan for csm2011reguards dd
i am aware that i have missed a couple drawings my brother is in town so that was a small distraction i have gone ahead and done the draw for today but not selected any prizes yetwinners21 iron straw51 naughtygrim48 trinneth44 el daniels40 huntin4cloud9i will do prizes later tonight as well as another drawingi appreciate everyones added support it is important that you tell your friends to vote for csm so we can make sure everyone gets a say in the future of eve point them to manalapan for balancing eve and tell them to post here to get into the daily drawings
basically they have a very short jumprange very high fuel consumption for said range and i know that there are ways around this by using a supply truck but stillfurthermore their stats are just completely nerfed no tii resists acceptable seeing that no other cloakies have that aside from tiiis but more importantly their lock rangethe black ops skill bonus is also very situational what use is a 5 per level agility bonus on a battleshipfurthermore they cant use a covops cloak something that to me at least is rather weird seeing that they belong to the family of covops cloak capable shipsi hope that answers your question vp
i bolded the important part while i can respect arden and other csm candidates to avoid the trolling by goons good strategy really i do admit that black has a great pointif arden wishes to play his version in this sandbox then that is cool but who can really respect someone to be in a leadership position when all you do is bully the ignorant and less skilled csm is very important position and i just have a tough time imagining arden being skilled enough to take on a important position what you do ingame transcends real life in many ways its not just your character who enjoys spoiling the fun for other players but its you the person how can we respect the personwhat separates you from guys like ripard selene or serious internet politican i like their positions
i definitely an not a puppet of 00 alliances if you look at my campaign i am focused on things to fix high sec
i think many of you guys are just missing the point as a csm member you have to represent the eve community you are not going to get to make changes for your cause you are going to work with ccp to provide feedback on issues and ideas based on your understanding of game play and the overall communitya candidate that doesnt understand 00 cant possible understand the implication of hisher recommendation on overall game play and in reverse and 00 only candidate cant represent empire players a candidate that is advocating for 1 specific thing or another is not going to serve the best interest of the community overall you may advocate to fix guns that suck for missioning but do you understand how that will affect pvp you may recommend a change for high sec mining do you have any idea what that will do for wh or 00 mining you may want to add jump drives to orcas or hulks with 4 lasers or make megathron uber l33t with rails but can you understand the affects those changes will have on every other area where that 1 change could be usedmyself and a few others actually actively play in both empire and 00 in both pvp and industrialpve roles you should really think about a candidate that will represent and understand as much as possible
agreed i think that omment you just made applies to a lot of candidates 00 and non00 alikethe vast majority of a term is spent discussing things that are not ones pet issues as such it is extremely important to have people who have the required knowledge and interest in all areas of the game not to be dead weight in 80 of the conversations as has happened regularly
i disagree  jack of all trades master of nonei would rather have a csm with specialized players who can champion for some specific cause relevant to their own playstyle and convince or not other nonspecialized csm members solely on the quality of their speech and their ideasrather thana csm full of 00 citizens most of them in powerblocs most of them thinking 00 is the only endgame some of them also playing in empire sometimes for trade and production only  with no one really playing with empire dwellers on a daily basiswith this kind of csm 00 decisions would be taken only to please powerblocs lobbies and empire matters just wont be discussed because it is not their interest or worse they will be discussed to nerf lvl4 and other things to bring more people to 00what kind of csm do you want vote for me
wow lots of people trying to steal my message huh
do you honestly think you are the only one who thought of that spontaneously 
first off i have nothing against any single game play style but  as a high sec player only do you really think you can fairly represent low sec 00 or wh life sure you may represent high sec very well but you are uneducated or inexperienced and there for useless on other matters look for a candidate that understands as many areas as possibleyes my main char spends life in 00 and low sec and i use this char almsot every night during the day i work very closely with friends that live in high sec and worm holes that ice mine ore mine manufacture researchinvent and mission run let me repeat this i work with them daily i am not a 00  that hears about high sec i deal with both on a regular basisspecialization and special interested are great and they have their place but there are only a couple open csm seats do you really want that seat taken by a special interest person that doesnt represent the community as a whole yes in some case thats you high sec candidates and others is those 00 powerbloc candidates that are only running to represent 00 interests im just saying im not either of those special interest people
um draco are you honestly suggesting that the csm will have no 00 specialists in it the whole thing has been one massive stitch up between your nc alliance test and goons there will be a minimum of 6 of you on the csm
where in the world did i say that please do not imply or infer intent if you actually pay attention you will see that im advocating against special interest groups 00 or any other again please read firstand others is those 00 powerbloc candidates that are only running to represent 00 interestsim not saying they arent here im saying im not one of them and voters should not vote for special interest candidates im saying it shouldnt not that it wont
so how do you feel about the attempt your alliance and others have made to make the csm a 00 only club will you be speaking out against them if youre elected to the csm
empire player only in fact i spend most of my active play time in low seci know my own limitations i fear many other candidates dont  they have the been there done that thus i know everything syndrome and i know i can not represent 00 players well because i dont know how 00 really work since ive never lived therebut what i can promise is i will listen to them anyway wether they are from powerblocs small alliancesand more importantly my votes as a csm member on subjects i dont know will be driven by logic and i can assure you i am a logical and thoughtful person and the wish to make the game better as a whole given what players wants according to forums and discussionsi believe this is a lot better than decisions taken by players who have many assets that might be impacted for instancevoters will decide but i feel like empire voters might want someone who have no link to 00 who could balance the csm more than a real empire player when lots of seats will be taken by powerblocs and other 00 players besides these players already know 00 no need to have a jack of all trades choose an empire champion instead 
my alliance has only 1 candidate running me however i strongly oppose any formal attempt to have nc or any other solely 00 players fill csm seats if they are only representing their own 00 interests the one thing to remember is that 00 makes up a very large number of very serious players so its only natural to expect them to have a high representation in the list of candidates and in turn since nc is a very large 00 group that by default means there will be a large number of them its not a direct reference of conspiracy and with the exception of goons pretty much no nc alliance has more than 1 player runningbut yes back to your original question i do formally oppose a csm made up of special interest 00 or any other members which may be why im not a canidate that is formally endorsed by nc or maybe they just dont like me
so given that you yourself acknowledge that 00 megaalliance players like you and your mates will already be overwhelmingly represented already why do we need more of you why are you trying to claim that its imbalanced in some way to have one or maybe 2 empire specialists out of 9 seats on the csm
alsyth your comments are base on philosophy and i do not feel this is a good place for a philosophical debate while i do not directly oppose what you have said i do feel there is some flaw to that logicthe one piece that i think is relevant is that while you may be logical and open without understand how its actually works you wont understand the way the conniving devious and power hungry players will exploit exacerbate or twist the results of a decision that was made based on special interest decisionim not trying to say you wont make good decisions im sure you will but you may not be able to understand the consequences of those decisionsthis is not a personal attack i would love to have high sec representation in the csm i would just personally prefer it be someone that knows more than only high sec
if those empire specialists understand 00 wh low sec and can understand the consequences their decisions will have in respect to all those other areas i do not oppose there role in csmto say again what i oppose is any person that wants to sit on csm to represent their interest without knowledge or regard for the rest of the eve community
so who exactly is doing that apart from your own cluster of alliances who have organised block voting to ensure that they and their pals are all voted in
alsyth stated he does not have the knowledge to understand the rest of the community and i know there are 00 candidates that are only running because of the jb crap im sure there are others but im interested more in my campaign and honestly i couldnt tell you everyones ultimate intent nor do i care whats important is that the players voting understand the results and vote for what they want if voters want all high sec special interest people with no understanding of anything else or all 00 special interests that just want to protect their jb networks then so be it or any various combinationand as always i want to state again im not part of a conspiracy i am not endorsed by nc i was actually told not to run by certain nc leaders im running because i want to represent the eve community and i will do my best while i understand you think or know that others are trying to consume csm dont assume everyone is just dont do itif you have issues with others doing that address it with them not me i cant control what they do
are you serious why would your leaders tell you not to run
i do not feel airing nc dirty laundry is relevant to my campaign im only stating the fact that i was not officially endorsed by the nc as a whole
splitting the preagreed block vote didnt go down well i take it nice friends you have there
wow seriously  i think you didnt understand me im running for csm6 mainly because i dont want 00 powerblocs players to use their seats in the csm to misguide ccp into decision that will help their powerbloc interest i want to be the voice that screams the truth when they try to do that and dont think anyone will be able to fool me i might not live in 00 but it doesnt mean im clueless about its game mechanicsagain i know a lot about lowsec tooyou might be able to represent hisec players preoccupations truebut you represent powerblocs too and empire player dont want a powerbloc csm your empire experience wont change the fact that you have personal interest to gainlose from 00 decisionsi didnt say thati know my limitations and i cant speak for the 00 community now thats all i can perfectly understand any 00 player who comes and speak with me share their concern etc i just dont live with them on a daily basis and wont pretend to know their playstylei have no doubt i will make 00 out of powerbloc voices heard in csm if im elected along with some other csm members meissa  empire is not my only interest in eve but it needs to be represented in csm and nonpowerbloc community needs it too i can represent both being impartial because i have no personal priviledges to defendagain you might be able to represent empire but you still are a powerbloc member with a 00 sov and jumbridges to defend you just cant represent outofpowerblocs players
did you opt out ive tried to find your name on the list but its not there neither that of your character nor your real name admittedly its late here no really its so late its already early again so maybe i just dont get it the list seems have less than 57 entries too
he blew me up once i clearly still harbour resentment hes the work of the devilwhat does it matter anywayits a free trip to iceland and little morehave fun d
i already used up all my currently subbed accounts votes however theres a thread on md advising that kalrand no longer shows up in the running for csmcan anybody confirm this and if so can ccp please explainthanksif kalrand has been removed i would like to recast my votes for a candidate that is still eligible  after all some of the csm candidates platforms are so far out of rational that i will vote for people i dont like in hopes of keeping those i think want to ruin the game out of the csm
i trust i can rely on your vote
kalrand does not shows on the candidate page for me
i dont know about karland being removed if when or why so if you intended to vote for him i suggest you wait a bit and see if its a glitchif its not may i suggest you look at my candidacy im known to be sensible rational even tempered and fairly intelligent theres several recommendations from previous csm members with whom ive worked you might want to look at toocheers
actually id probably vote for tyrannushis opinion on removing insurance for suicide ganking is a little  but at least he doesnt want to nerf t2 bpos i dont own any but i still think you have to be a pretty special kid to think that t2 bpos have a negative impact on the game his other opinions also match up fairly well to my own
confirming hes no longer listed and i dont got my votes back yet petition inbound also confirming that noone yet posting in this thread will get my alternate vote unless they deposit large sums of isk assuming votes are returned
as i believe was stated elsewhere ccp can track which accounts voted and which candidates received votes but there is no data stored or tracked about who voted for which candidate therefore i doubt youll get your votes back because there is in fact no way to verify who you voted for only that you voted
in that case i want my votes back too
mynxee surely you know more than youre saying what did that dillhole do to get kicked off the candidates list
1 want to nerf jumpbridges severely or completely and2 open up moonmining in wormholes yeah baby make it happen 
1 yes sort of im all in favor of decreasing the ability of large groups of moving fast and far in my opinion they have to pick one or the other but that change has to be accompanied by others because otherwise the lives of 00 dwellers will become a nightmare especially in those regions that are not close to empire2 no sorry theres already much wealth to be gained in wormholes theres no need to add more and definitely not a mostly passive source
1 yesbut why not give the big 00 alliances the ability to build genuine stargates  for a huge cost very long construction etcbetter than jumbridges in my opinion as it would allow opponents to use them it would help reducing capfleet projections a little but wont make 00 a huge pain for conventional fleets and logistics like getting rid of jumpbridges wouldthink of your alliance logo on a stargate for eternity with some ability to custumize its look and when 00 is extended hope it will happen someday   players could have to build all the stargates etcjust an idea though think of it ccp 2 nojust like meissa said
yes and yeswe have had a shortage of moons for far too long what id add to keep it interesting is that moons in whs mine out and similar minerals on other moons spawn so moon mining becomes more dynamicissler dainze
1 nerf slightly maybe do you actually live in 00 and use jbs2 not opposed to it but also dont directly support it unless it was done in a way that doesnt send the reaction market into a downward spiral the options of dynamic materials and depletion rates might be a workable solution
hello there to answer these ideas 1  there is no point debating this jump bridges will be removed  nerfed drastically it has been decided already and no csm member will change that2  wspace has already plenty of resources moon mining in them would be logical and thus something to look into yet im afraid itd unbalance the game too much if something like this is to be done it has to be thoroughly studied before taking any decision
you get my vote mike if anyone hasnt listened to the lostinevenet csm debate podcasts i urge you to do so solid display in a debate and good logic and attitude i wont pretend i agree with you 100 but one of the pick of the crop good luck mike
trying to put words in my mouth about what my opinion isthat isnt my opinion thats your imagination talking
i have generally been critical of the overly agressive tone that csm5 took and dont believe that it the tone accomplished as much as some people believe however i dont think this letter has that same problem a better way of caging it might have been as a farewell deathbed request kind of thing but in general not badas for the whole incarna thing i dunno i just dont see what the big deal is ok if its forced thats a problem but i seriously doub it will be think about trading for instance the current skill mechanics dont even require you to be in a station to trade same goes for research the idea of having to switch to a different interface to quick fit is ridiculous and would cause so many problems now maybe for some things likei dunnoi actually cant think of a current mechanic that wouldnt be hurt by forcing it to be done through a different interfaceso while i agree that they shouldnt force it i dont see for a second how they could without completely breaking the game and im not talking about the whiny pifwjump bridges whatever are brokenbreaking the game wahhhh i mean it would irrevocably destroy the gameanyways if all they want is to use it as a method of stress testing it they just need to add the ability to punch andor teabag someone and then 90 of the player base will spend their docked time doing thatas for complaints about it being a tool for another game andor a waste of dev time etc thats just shortsighted wod may end up being one of the best things to happen to eve if it is succesful then ccp a relatively small private development firm is looking at arguably doubling its revenue stream if you dont think thats a positive for eve you are mistaken savings on shared overhead alone will free up so many resources dev team for forums only need one human resources only need one rotten shark cook only need onethis is a good thing more money means more options for things like upgrading the serversoh but we havent been getting good updates recentlyseriously yeah you have wormholes awesome incursions pretty neat tyrannis ok tyrannis had problems but it also involved arguably the largest number of changes to the economy and industry of eve in any expansion ever the fact that the markets didnt completely explode is a testament to the quality i still have no clue how they did that the math behind it is absolutely phd level staggering i have problems controlling 3 variable systems and getting what i want edit and the end results to the economy were exceptionally good removing the mineral floor created by insurance fraud was awesome and each time the eve market is pushed towards 0 npc market orders i get a little lump in my throat as i raise a glass to some amazing designersbut everyone has this short sighted what have you done for me lately attitude where they only see what affects them and if they dont like it they will jump on the whaaambulance and threaten to quit there is no design change too small to incur the time to quit attitude its the same thing gamers always do just look at l4d2 the amazing thing is that gamers often have so little self awareness that they cry wolf every week or two and dont realize that people stopped listening years ago which sucks when there really is a wolfsome companies bend over backwards for this nonsense one of them is blizzard ironically their incessant pandering only results in the terrible mess of a product they now have i for one am glad that ccp holds itself to higher standards
ccp has been neglecting a lot of playstyles i wouldnt say small gang pvp is any worse than most in this departmenti would point you to wormholes as an example of where we actually see small gang pvp we rarely have fleets of more than 15 people and we get all sorts of fights and a lot of fun i think wspace is a great example of where ccp got small gang pvp right and hopefully it can show them a way to spread this playstyle to more folks it sounds to me like what you are really asking for is for ccp to do more for faction warfare which certainly needs attention as well i havent done any fw at all so i am not really in a position to say what exactly needs to be done but there have been a bunch of great suggestions all over the forums

this should apply to anyone who starts a conflictif youre looking for trouble by shooting a neutral or by stealing your insurance is void
that is a terrible idea this is a pvp game remember why should pvp players get there insurance voidedi will only support the complete removal or no removal as any change to insurance will have little to no effect on suicide ganking as they will just use cheaper shipsthe only way to actually stop suicide ganking is to stop the idiots who think that flying around with billions of isk in their untanked hauler like this guy idiots
id assume hes referring only to highsec which triggers concord not lowsec and of course concord voiding insurance will have a big effect suicide ganking means 11k volley bs gankboats as the number of thrashers required to gank a carebear bs is unrealistic to coordinate concord voiding insurance would raise threshold of the mission runners value from 50mil to 500mil before gank assuming lucky drop rate of course it wouldnt save this guy

i love this it made me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside
sounds good
that is true however my point still remains that low sec will become more infested with null sec power blocks and that will lead to a rise in hot drops and large fleet warfare in low sec i dont think that would be a good thing
hey targets are targets let them role with it it might turn out to be a lot of fun
just fyi youre in rageaint no one scared of you bub
im kind of on the fence with this one i think something needs to be done but i dont think the proposal is the best ideafof go for the closest target this is how you select what you want to hit orbit it closelythe problem comes when you cant do that and end up being orbited yourself nothing dies because everything is getting hitperhaps just having fof lock to a single target while the launcher is active
should have been implemented long agoas for balance when you use rep drones even though you might increase your tank considerably you loose most dps so id say this feature is selfbalancing its also nice way to buy some precious time when you are in a nasty situation hoping to last long enough for the help to arrive
i for one dont support this because already overpowered ships will just get even more overpowered then they all ready are plus it will reduce the need for tank modules on ships all in all it will just make the game broken
i could be wrong but i think its the same as choosing between a heat sink and an armor rep youll have to choose between better dps and better tank you wont be able to have both any more than you can fit two modules in the same slot imho things might be a little more complicated but they might as well be far simpler either way i admit this would bring a rather big change to most of the ships but i think its a bit extreme to say it will make the game broken it just adds to the flexibility which cant be all that bad more like a breath of fresh air
first off i support this i can see were some ships with many drones would get a boost but drone boats mostly get a bonus to damage mining amount and hp i do agree that its most likely balance problem would be with the logi ships which do get a drone rep bonus the dps you give up for reps is not equal as is you would always be better with locallogi reps than your own drones on to the need for player 2 one of the things i think rep drones on selfrdswould be awesome for is the hero tank till back up arrives and in that sense your still using and relining on player 2 i also dont think most hard core pve peeps will use the rds as the key to pve is efficiency and the added time becouse of dps loss would be what make the extra tank needed in the first place i was also was confused one i found i couldnt rds as it stands now with current mechanics you cant hand off ecm drones to another playeri dont know if you can with logi drones which to me also dose not make sense as drones are now they will need an over haul to work with rds i also agree that rep drones and only rep drones should do thisself webbingself newting so you can nos is right out my thoughts

well either youre looking for an easy character bazarre isk maker or youre honestly interested in doing this for training an alt either way your willingness to pay for it sort of makes it a moot point which reason you have id probably do both as itd be withing the eula and a reasonable use of empty character slotsim not sure id want to pay full second account price for the sake of training an extra character on the same account paying an additional cost for the ability to do that training is still something i would consider and gladly but i think it fair to say i would prefer a reduced cost for the second character on the account and a further reduction in cost for the third character on the account admittedly i almost never use more than one account at any given time no matter what im doing primary exception would be transferring isk from one account to another or doing some king of administration or corp management like dutiesi know people who run 6 accounts at a time and fairly regularly overall at that running missions or ops or pvping with more than one account is a bit more alttab than i like if i had 3 monitors might be different certainly easier 1495 for 1 character standard account2895 for 2 characters upgraded account3995 for 3 characters lol accounti cant imagine paying more than 40 a month for one accountsupported with reservations
its a great ideathis way you pay for training only without having to pay for 2 transfers every time you want to train a few more skills on an alt
there should be a charge per character in the corp the charge should increase the older the character is so noob corps arent unfairly penalized but increase enough so that a dead corp cannot sit holding its name for eternity simply by putting a couple million isk in the corp accountreferencing this thread suggested by boliano
flat charge per month
supported this would help alot
how would this improve the game inactive corps are like inactive characters leave them alone they also serve the vital function of screening and camouflaging noob corps from decs
i do not agreewhile i understand the problem you try to address the implications of this idea make it a really bad approach imo unless you are trying to achieve something else as wellwhy should i pay for my corporation just because some idiot was to lazy to close hiscreating an inactivity timer for corporations sounds to me like a much more focused solution to your problem and i would support that or a symbolic flat charge 1m that has to be payed in person by the ceo to reserve the name for 6 months prof of activity every ceo should be allowed to hold a max of 2 proofs of activity at any given timebut charging corps based on numbers and age is a total overkill for such an issue
hes got a point noobs have it hard enough with us griefers in the game and low member count inactive corps are useful for small groups of indies avoiding the normal wardeck corpsif a corp is truely inactive use a true login timer or something non isk related to get the job done dont punish low member count corps with unnecessary taxes just because you assume their dead also if corp wallet is full of isk even a moderate fee would take forever to get through to the point its disbanded
the issue is important but i cant agree with op solution 5mmonth or so flat fee about half the cost of a corp war decing someone for a month to keep the doors open if your corp isnt worth 150kday to keep open its not that important to you open up room for someone who will do something with the name

anyone who is serious about making eve more balanced will tend to agree that the drake is over powered after comparing it to other bc in the game i have come up with a simple way to balance it with the rest of the tech one bc my idea is to simply drop or remove one of its many to many mid slots and drop is cpu by 5 the reduction of the mid slots will limit the shieldtackle mods that can be put on the ship and dropping the cpu along with this insures the cpu to mid slot ratio remains the same as it currently isok let the flame rage begin
thats a terrible idea and most people i have talked to say that battlecruisers at least on a tier 2 level are one of the most balanced sets of ships in the gamethe drake to do a proper tech 2 heavy missile fit with a web and point requires an implant so i dont see how lowering cpu will help taking away a mid slot is also a fairly stupid ideathe drake is not overpowered it still dies regularly in a small gang or solo situation
the drake is the best bc but that doesnt mean you should all but remove it from the game outrightliang
its the only caldari ship that is worth pvping in and is the only real ship u can solo in for the caldari
the drake is not overpowered the only reason there are so many used is because it is good at pve and good enough at pvp every noob and their dog have trained to fly drakes if an fc asked for any uniform fleet of ships they would be unlikely to get them because not everyone has trained every ship drakes however are common ratting ships so many people have them trainedif you want to see fewer drakes make other pvp ships more effective at pve
the drake itself is fine it just scales insanely well compared to alternativesmain reason for the huge difference is in engagement ranges while other bcs can get respectable ranges they have to forego anything resembling tank in the processsolution reduce heavy missile range by 25 does not impact pve to any large extent allows for current ranges at a cost rigs thus reducing tank does not impact caracal line unduly due to inherent locking range limits and massive range bonuses brings drake fleet performance inline with the alternatives
this is a  whine fill in blank nerf you buff me you are drakeoh noes caldari has mids and cpu boohoo
also get rid of falcons more than 1 person in fleet etc etc
nobody mentioned nerfing logis or remote repair modulesas for aggression as it stands the last time i actively recall watching someone remote repping a target in highsec it was outside the station in a system 2 jumps from dodixie the target i and another were fighting was being repped by a exequor some 70km off the only reason he was flashing to me was because he had me targeted little blinky yellow targeting icon which is why i noticed him it was after that i noticed the graphical effect of his cap rep and realized he was assisting the target and boosting his capacitor in no way was i or my friend able to actively target or eliminate this individual he was a neutral in highsec aside from bumping him with 34 small mwd cruisers to get him out of range he was completely immune to any direct action unless someone had it in them to suicide gank him he was effectively untouchableewar cant be used on a neutral in highsec concord will fry you for trying any nos neut ecm or the like is considered a direct aggressive action just like shooting him with your guns this is the problem lowsec is a different story of course but only marginally so at best youll still take a security hit at the very least for any direct action in null hes primary because it doesnt matter hes also an easy kill generally provided the circumstance permits and hes in rangei dont think the rr should be nerfed i think the neutral should be made accountable heshe has too much immunity that doesnt mean they should have extended aggression timers or even be party to kill rights as the op suggested they should immediately gain an aggression timer as normal they have entered battle and committed themselves and should be treated as any other in that regard then it becomes a decision with consequences not an action for which they cannot be held accountablethats pvp risk and reward  risk and loss
1 fix and change ccp this neutral repping methods

giving aggression timers for remote repair is a nerf because it dramatically reduces eliminates the ability of logistics ships to deagress furthermore logistics ships are completely balanced in todays environment with todays aggression mechanicsthe problem being complained about is station games of all varieties so fix station gamesliang
oh dear i know its hard for crustaceans like yourself to actually grow a backbone but please do try
i dont really have a problem with how dumb drones are although smarter drones would be nice but i do hate how limited our control istherefore i would at least like to be able to decide which group of drones i want to launch using shortcuts very useful when you have 30 drones in bay and can only use 5 it would be nice if we could assign a full set of shortcuts for each group of drones for all commands but the launch group x shortcut would be a great step in the right direction

i like how now the client fixed window mode recognizes multiple monitors and will stretch for it however even with the slider to the right and the move interface box checked there are still some important things that are inside the split between the two monitorsfor examplelogin screencharacter creation screensome boxes default to appearing in the middle some cannot be movedplease fix
ok i know this looks like a wall of text that the devs wont read it and that i will get flamed nonetheless i think this is quite the way i would like eve to beenglish is not my first language but i think it is fairly understandable dsovwarswhat is wrong right now the 2 only really important things in 00 sovwarfare are numbers and super caps this is not fun anymore the tactic is reduced to bringing the bigger fleet before your enemy can do the same so you load the grid first and your opponent dies in lag uemon and 020 are good examples for that super caps have no real enemy besides more super caps that would counter them plus they are more flexible than a battleship and can travel faster the enemy has troubles to see where they actually went or where they came from the trend goes towards huuuuge power blocks with few big conflicts with even bigger blobs  smaller alliances have no choice but to join one of the power blocks or to become their pets UF0E0 no own politics less smaller fights black ops are too expensive and almost useless
how to fix this remove all jbs and jump drives from all ships and leave covert cynos as they are and remove the normal cyno all ships that cant use covert cynos will have to travel through gates and all capital ships will become quite vulnerable when they travel alone or when theyr support fleet is destroyed make sov warfare more capture the flag style like without long timers which allow you to gather a huge fleet at the right time and lag you enemy out or to exploit your timezone advantage  introduce new constellation infrastructure modsfacilities to 00 that can be captured and give you enormous advantages o gate jammer against capso local delay for the enemyo warp speed enhancer maybe only for caps and super capso industrial stuff that decreases the minerals you need to build stuff and so on and sov fees all this mods will project the respective effect to all systems in the constellation with an infrastructure hub their locations will be spread across the constellation they can be captured to do so you need to destroy an enemy module anchored next to it first with a lot of hitpoints which deactivates the respective effect eg gate jamming then you need to anchor your own module and to activate it in order to make them work for you however there should be a timer of 12h this time is needed to activate your module if the enemy manages to destroy and replace it before he 12h have passed the timer is reverted that is if you manage to protect your module for 2h their module will need 2h to become active this is needed in order to prevent the exploit of time zones  the gate jammer will allow you to block your gates for enemy capitals and supercaps based on standings subcapitals can still roam through enemy territory  covert ops ships need to become cheaper at least the black ops and get some new special abilities o the first would be a local jammer which delays the local for lets say 5 minutes and removes the enemy jamming effect you need to decloak for that and you can be scanned out and killedo the second would be the ability to unlock gates for a limited number of capitals in your fleet13 again you need to stay at the gate in enemy territory for that and you can be killed easily additionally there should be a sov structure that can be anchored at the gate and removes the gate jamming effect completely as long as it stays alive  the sov fees should increase exponentially  you can put 1000 players on your blues list for free the rest costs extra
expected effect the attacker would have the advantage of surprise and preparation while having the disadvantage of not having suppliesnew ships and stuff in place and the threat that his fleet will be trapped in the enemy system pretty much like in the real world clearly the attacker will try to capture the buildings that limit his ability to deploy his forces and allows the enemy to deploy his fleets faster warp speed enhacer  the bigger the territory of an alliance the more difficult it would it be for them to get pilots from all regions in one fleetno jbs UF0E0 force projection notice the alliances will have spread their forces in order to protect the flags that is the new sov structures plus important systems because there are no timers and covert ops fleets can still hot drop these structures  additionally they will also have to protect their supply lines eg freighter convoys from and to high sec skill and strategy become very important you could for example try to capture the warp speed enhancer and the gate with your cover fleets first so that the defender will have huge problems to gather his fleet in time at the same time your own systems will be vulnerable against similar attacks because you cant simply jump your fleet back within minutes it will also be important to have the right players who will be willing to stop carebearing in order to form a counterfleet uncoordinated fail alliances will not be able to hold their space against a well coordinated fleet even if they have 3x the numbers because they will not be able to form a fleet in time  hot dropping of carebearsfreighterssupply convoys will still be possible o with covert cynoso by using the delayed local ability of covert ops it becomes very expensive to hold huge territories due to new fee system or to have long blue lists
economywhat is wrong i always had problems to understand why concord pays bounties in 00 sec there is not a single concord ship in 00 space ratting in 00 space is quite safe as long as you are not brain afk it is actually more dangerous to rat in a multibillion ship in highsec than in 00 sec where you know who your enemy is the logistics are more dangerous in highsec suicide ganks than in 00 jf jb the only industry 00 space has is the supercapindustryhow to fix this remove bounties from 00 rats make the 00 economy more like wspace let rats drop special factionspecific loot instead and make it 00 exclusive that is the 00 sanshas would be the only rats that drop armor plates angels aluminium bars and so on every rat would also drop an insignia depending on its size and hitpointdps this insignias can then either be sold for a fixed price like sleeper stuff to npcs in highsec or exchanged for loyality points in certain shops faction and officer spawns stay as they are and have a chance to drop factionofficerdead space loot remove pirate faction shops create some conquerable outposts in 00 that allow you to produce a limited amount of pirate faction ships per day 12 outposts for bs 12 for frigs and so on  faction ammunition let this ships require certain resources which are only available in certain 00 regions far away from these outposts redistribute the resources the way that every region has 1 unique commodity resource and one speciality resource that is only available in this region  redistribute asteroids veldspar should be available everywhere all other ores should be only available in certain regions respectively and contain unique resources eg morphite only in arkonor isogene only in bistot redistribute moon goo pretty much the same way so that pretty much every region has its technitium because it is unique to this region add a new sov structure that further decreases the production costs of t2 stuff and ship hulls from bs onexpected effect the t2 production will move from high sec to 00 and high sec will be the major market that will be supplied from 00 sec logistics will become very important and vulnerable since 00 alliances will critically depend on imports and exports pirates will get more targets in low sec exportsimports from 00 sec carebearsproducers will have a much stronger incentive to move to 00 because of production bonuses  higher income from ratting due to exclusive availability of scarce ressources and lower income from high sec missions due to removal of precious salvage trade embargos will become a mighty weapon and high sec pvp alliances will get more fun by camping 00high gates  every region will have its own unique resources which means that whoever controls this regions will have the ability to use this resources as a weapon by not selling them and preventing everybody from building certain shipsmodules  example you hold the outpost that can build machariels somewhere in the south your enemy however holds the few only moons that have the unique resource you need to build them you can either cooperate with them sell the ships and split the money or they could sell you the resources for very high prices and your alliance would fly this ships exclusively giving you advantages in pvp while being very expensive alternatively you could try to somehow conquer these moons or they try to conquer your facilities or they refuse to sell you the resources and no one flies machariels even if you own both the resources and the facilities you face the choice to sell 1 or 2 of machariels every day on a auction for very high prices or to sell the most of them for lower prices or fly them exclusively but disclaim the income you could generate from them  you see this would add a lot of drama opportunities strategies and conflicts to the game

no to number 1 and 3 yes to number 2first 1moving caps let alone super caps is a tedious process that would be further complicated by having to have a cap there to cyno and dont quote me on this but if anyone knows speak up i have been told a massive ship like a titan would be a guaranteed bump if lit from a carrier i would suggest a battleship be used in place of a carrier if this change were to be supported also having a carrier stuck for 10 minutes is a very very bad idea as they pale so much in comparsion to supercapsfor number 3 i dont see how a windup time for utilizing the jump too would solve anything other than make caps more hairloss inducing than they already are carriers and dreads are by far some of the slowest ships in the game my archon takes 30 seconds atleast to align or move in a direction having a 2 minute charge to jump when needed too would kill current hotdropping mechanics but also make them even more vulnerable to tackle than they already are the only way i could see 3 working is if carriers and dreads drives were to be like titansmoms in that only dictors could tackle them2 i like this idea it would make hotdropping capital blobs onto hapless victims slightly more strategic as multiple cynos would be needed to get an entire fleet through scaling up with the size of vessels use so one cyno could get a full blops fleet through but several cynos would be needed for moms also there are significant balance concerns to think about when toying with this idea such as homefield adv vs loading grid and cyno cycle time if the mass limit is broken should said cyno ship be free or still stuck for remainder of cycle or should it be freed only to light another cyno 2 seconds later is there technical limitations on such a mechanic i think these are all questions that need to be asked but i would agree 2 needs some work and more thought but i would enjoy seeing something like that
yescompletely break the game entirely so that large scale pvp and sov battles are impossible
worst suggestion ever please stop posting
he does have a point tbh as uneve as it is there are very real limits as to what the servers and that computer youre using right now can handle the game should be designed to work within those limits and currently it doesnt really do that the cause of lag is blobbing up blobbing up is encouraged because there is no down side to blobbing there are no significant aoe weapons or los issues blobbing leads to lag ccp improves code to reduce lag thus allowing people to blob even more its a vicious cycle and tbh i think it needs to endhard restrictions like the one he proposed arent a very good option as said they fly in the face of the whole point of eve what should be done instead is to make forming epic blobs less appealing namely a bunch of aoe weapons and ideally adding los to weapons
aoe weapons and los will only add up to laggive people reason to split their focus
no it wont because ppl will be dead and poddedbring back the aoe torps
how about bringing mines back just twick it so you cant place more then  insert reasonable number within a certain distance maybe that will make blobs die in flames
awesome every time i want to save a station or a pos ill just bring 300400 friends and succeed every time by locking the hostiles out this will promote goodfites
i would be very interested in this i never seem to be able to make it out to mass testing so my character is always behind sp on the test server i would really like to be able to try out a tengu on the test server but i am forced to wait for a couple more mirrors before i can do thati support any of the options but i think there should be a flat amount for anyone under a certain amount and a percentage after that placing the split around where the ge results in 2m sp would be ideal why this way so that newer players can instatrain just as many skills as the older players older players likely already have frigs and maybe cruiserbattleships 5 trained so 2m sp is of no real benefit to them but lower sp characters can instatrain into a battlecruiser while they are still flying in frigscruisersedit  thumbs up 
not supported and i play sisi more than tqmirrors that are applied were generally taken 34 days earlier so its not that much sp you miss out on if you have a skill queue thatll last that long alternatively just plug in some 5s and train while you play on tq youll catch up eventuallyif youre too impatient for that do the mass tests
as i sometimes miss new mirrors and that means i can get like 1 week or more behind i think its a nice idea5 sp is somehow enough in my opinion although there might be something like a minimum andor maximum amount rewarded to balance if needed
but with a switch to turn this on or off when wantedi was thinking about putting that in but it would seem like a dumb idea but now i think i should have put it in there
this  terrible idea cheap 1 hit kills just because you rolled a 20 are dumb and theres already a coded critical hit mechanic for 300 damage called a wrecking shot this  bad idea there should be a mechanic for capturingboardingproper piracy but this is not itfor the first lucky shot i should have put when your shields are down and your armor is decreasing at a high rate ive should have been more detailedthe second one your idea sounds better then mine i have to admit i should post that in another topicbut i respect your opinion in the end
please delete me

perhaps not red or green especially since those are color blind unfriendlyboth sec status designations how about a brighter blue or white something that stands out from the square and space equallyi am not really in favor of blinking due to the fact that most people have blink on in their overview for wtsfw enemies and i see that confusing a large number of peopleanother option  changing the shape of the waypoint system marker to say a circle or triangle or some kind of animation not blinkflash like a radar sweep to make it noticeable at a glance
you do realise that thousands of people have died right that millions are homeless that no amount of preparation could stop this from being a devastating event even with industrialisation ffsyes plex for japan is already underway and im so glad that ccp are making these decisions and not you
imagine a star system between lowsec and 00 in which bubbles arent allowed but there are no sentry guns and no loss of sec status personally id probably spend a lot of time engaging anything and everything in cheap gank cruisers and t2 frigs i realize this would be a pretty large change to implement both in ability narrative so look at it more as an idea for future expansionsessentially im proposing to remove the sentry guns from 01 systems and nullify the sec hitglobal criminal countdown for engaging neutrals of course this may involve moving the map around for optimal fun and fairness to the status quo however it would enable friglovers and skirmishers to engage anything and everything without needing a specialized or suicidal scout to check for bubbles moreover if these systems are strategically placed they could become a point of interaction for small pirate groups large pirate groups and larger alliancessuggestionconstructive criticism welcome

i dont get why vile rat and jade are arguing so much why dont you just shut up jade and let the man talk about how he thinks he could improve eve online instead of you ruining his threadare you just mad that you arent on the csm this time around no one needs your giant massive posts
eve actually needs a bank and we actually need a way to transfer money clear across the eve universe to another player that broken trust sets us all back a few years in being able to use any bank that anyone sets up and that said krutoj that xdeathx squadron legion of xxdeathxx looks kinda suspect to be talking about starting a bank i dont mean any disrespect im just saying  maybe a little thought should be given to what others may see in a name even but if youre serious i can use a bank    that can be trusted but the point is why would we send a message forward like thievery is ok when it hurts us so bad when it is blatantly done in game like that thanks for the info he wont get my vote vote for issler dainze shes a good person for real
gah fix the poscorp security nightmare already 1 voteim not too sure about having random large volume wormholes opening up into our wspace system though people that want to mess around with dreads and carriers can choose to live in c5c6 those that dont live in c4 and below personally suits me just fine regardsya
thanks for your support i like that there are limits on where you can move capitals i wouldnt want them to change that i would just like to see some wormholes that last longer than 1624 hours and some that have higher total mass allowed than 3 billion kg keep the same maximum ship mass but just some more variety
a lot of talk here about trust and reputation as if they were being elected into becoming a director of game design they are being elected as representatives of the players a voice of our wishes and concerns all the talk here about one alliance seeking to gain an advantage in the game is crap typical political mudslingingtwo step expressed ideas on many topics epically botting match my own and thus he has my x3 votesgood luck to you two stepps yeah i know about the exploit thingy its an issue done and over now it serves as a great example of those willing to break rules and those not consequences for getting caught and the need for an even playing field all around the statusquo isnt healthy for the game he clearly brings a knowledgeable perspective to the table and his stated stance is one i strongly agree with
how does this distinguish you from some of the other candidates who have been saying the same thing for ages and who werent involved in activities that ccp felt warranted their attention
thanks for your supportfirstly the quote you chose really needs its context i was talking about ccp committing to make small tweaks of the new content they do release i and many other folks running also would like to see ccp go back to previously released content some released 5 years ago and fix that as well i dont see the two things as the same issue what i was talking about is more of a scheduling issue for the was ccp does thingssecondly as i have been saying over and over and over and over again ccp allowed me to run for csm this means they dont consider me personally guilty of a serious eula violation i dont see how the stuff that happened 6 months ago will change in any way the amount of influence i would have in csm discussions either with other csm reps or with ccp what was done is done mistakes were made let it go
so youre saying youre a premature elector
just a roleplayingresponse to make people realize the traffic problem in jitaships have been crashing into eachother constantly especially near stargates and in asteroid belts as well as around stations and this has been a problem to hundreds if not thousands of people and various signals have been disrupting peoples minds from transferring to their clones or causing them to be sent to another persons clone or even another persons living body because of this concord has started a program to reduce traffic in jita please donate to support it thank you for reading this report  concord militia patrol
jita became the market hub because the superhighway gates to yulai were removedthere will always be one central hub it can be jita it can be somewhere else but the market demands it
 thistrade hubs will exist its part of the market dynamic cripple jita and the hub and problems will just move
first of all great job thankssecond theres one question i would have added should old players be allowed in npc corps
this is an appeal to sentiment it does not logically follow that your proposal will have any impact on the quality of a body of people which is arbitrary scalar which varies based on perspectiveunlike your previous point which was merely fallacious and naive this time youre simply dead wrong and exhibit a sad almost hilarious ineptitude at hard mathif the blocs control the majority of the seats to begin with then the csm will pick members of the bloc to continue into the next csm then the bloc electorate only needs to outnumber the rest of eve with four election seats instead of nine the smaller the number of seats up for grabs gets the stronger the bloc advantage becomes the nc has tens of thousands of accounts all or most of whom are highly invested in the outcome of the election the drf has the samethis one barely even merits remark you say something will be improved but fail to exhibit why that is important or what impact it will have on the bodys ability to perform its functionfar from accomplishing your unstated goal of unseating the blocs for all time if your plan was put into effect you would be handing us six seats with ccp picking the last three good jobthe blocs cannot completely muscle out empire in a nine seat election but in a four seat election the advantages of organized campaigns and organized vote allocation is too much for the random empire pubbie to compete with
with respect to changes in the voting procedure it might be interesting to consider some sort of alternatevote system that lets people vote for more than one candidate there are many such systems this would permit people to support candidates whom they liked but would not otherwise vote for because they think they cant get electedhowever before such a system is implemented it should be extensively debated to ensure that it would be difficult to game by large voting blocs and it should be noted that whatever its flaws the current system does have the virtue of simplicity
mmmmmm no no debate is necessary i can shoot that one down toowhat you empire pubbies dont seem to get is that there are more motivated voters in blocs then there are outside if you multiply everyones votes you multiply the number of votes for blocs i was forced to choose between one or two of the three vile mittens or tree if i had multiple votes to play with beyond just buying more accounts i wouldnt have to choose as i pointed out and as the results will show there are simply more voters on the bloc side multiply our ballots and the effect of coordinated campaigning becomes even more powerful reduce the number of seats and the same thing happensget it through your thick and remarkably shiny forehead the current system is the most fair system to assure we dont sweep you completely
the problem of the low percentage of voters is also caused by the almost hidden nature of the elections if you dont pay attention to the news or forums chances are you are unaware of there being such a thing as elections at all at minimum there should be large posters across ur screen when loggin in during election time and the csm page on the eveo website imagine yourself a noob curious about the csm and visit the csm section of this page right now i doubt you will be a lot wiser after visiting the most recent meeting minutes are from almost a year ago if there wasnt an election going on right now any uninformed visitor to the csm section of this website would think it was dead if you want the masses to be interested all this has to change
your notes have been taken treb my vote model seems the right thing to dothis isnt about choosing a government this is about getting a task force togethereven in many tv shows you have a hybrid way to pick people1 televoting and 2 jurywhere the people televote for any reason on candidates charisma talent looks popularity while a professional jury picks out candidates based on a professional point of viewif you dont like the idea that ccp handpicks 3 candidates then an alternative way can be that they will cast a number of votes on 3 candidates based on a percentage of the total votesalso dont forget that the alternate csms will still be the ones based on vote counts
dirk there have been csm vote posters on the login screen and on the eve o website since the polls opened as well ccp sent out a csm newsletter with links to all the information youre suggesting csm5 and ccp discussed ideas for this stuff well in advance of the csm6 elections and ccp deserves a lot of credit for the increased exposure theyve given the csm6 elections also youre wrong about the minutes from june being the last onesor the last publication offered by the csm there is a sticky post in jita park which has a link to a wiki page that lists all of the public communications and activities that csm5 has done including minutes official blogs working meetings and other stuff csm minutes and blogs get the same kind of exposure on eve o that dev blogs do if people arent paying attention its not like you can reach through the interwebs to smack them in the forehead with a brick to make them do so
one poster is not going to grab attention if i dont look at it the first time for whatever reason sometimes ppl are in a hurry for instance its gone during election time you need to make a lot of noise just like in rl its virtually impossible to not know there is an election going where i live in eve its very possible let me give you an example 3 or 4 days ago a m8 asked when the polls closed i thought that would be easy to find much to my dismay i ended up heaving to search the news archives things link that should be permanently in sight when i go the the csm tag on the left on this very page i expect information like that to be available immediatly and this is just one example as for the meeting minutes i know they are being published and where to look more or less but even then i had trbl finding the most recent minutes plenty of times and on the csm menu on this site the one at the left of your screen again the most recent minutes are from the ccpcsm meeting somewhere in 2010
oh please please please let this eventually come to pass
no kiddingdirk i agree the poll closing datetime should be prominently featured on the ads if it is not but the last few times i logged in there was an ad on the login screen so i think it is persistent unless bumped by something with more immediate relevanceand fwiw i agree with you the csm pages on the eve o site are not at all useful with regard to content or organizationparticularly outside elections however csm5 addressed this with ccp both at the june summit and elsewhere to no avail if nothing else the main link should point to a csm portal page on the evelopedia such a page has been discussed with yarr no infoz on any progress of late
i believe trebor might be talking about an alternate vote system or preferential voting system  which is something different than simply multiplying the votes per personan alternate vote system might work as thisits also known as the single transferable vote you select a first priority candidate and a second priority candidate in effect simplified if your first priority candidate gets enough votes to get elected then thats great if not your single vote is transferred to your second priority candidate who might then have a chance of getting electedin fact an alternate vote system makes very good sense in an election such as this were there are no registered parties or lists to vote for it is in its essence a system to minimize the loss of votessuch a system will greatly benefit the players outside the organised blocks since it becomes much safer to vote for a less popular candidate without risking to loose your vote
fyitrebor was responding to my suggestion for a different vote systemhe forgot however to quote the source me
my dear pirokobo if you can possibly distract yourself from your obsessed contemplation of my remarkably shiny yet formidably attractive forehead i buff it daily with zogs original sex wax you may wish to educate yourself on voting systems before making such statementswhile it is mathematically provable that there is no voting system that is immune to pathological results there are election systems that generate results that more closely represent the actual will of the electorate than single vote systems these typically do not provide voters with extra votes but transfer their votes from preferred but losing candidates to second or third choices the overall effect is to encourage people to vote more honestly because they prevent wasted votessuch systems also handle the issue of candidates who are forced to drop of out the election as kalrand did this timewhile i appreciate your obvious concern for the voting rights of the great unwashed masses of highsec the situation in eve is not really that much different from that in the real world where you have highly organized political parties the alliances and a significant number of independent voterssuveitar yes that class of voting systems was what i was referring toextreme i do not believe your suggestion will achieve what you think it will and would oppose it on grounds of equity
i feel that most of the alternative voting schemes would actually make large blocks more powerful and more likely to get elected for example it seems likely to me that someone like mittani will get more votes than strictly needed to get elected and in most systems his extra votes would move down to their 2nd place choice which would likely be another member of his 00 coalition as it is now large entities need to be careful not to give one of their candidate too many votes and the others too few and alternative voting systems would remove thatmy personal reforms would be the following1 require some number of signatures to make the ballot this should reduce the number of nonserious candidates something like one or two hundred signatures would work well2 i would lengthen the time before voting starts but after the valid candidates are announced there are some great people out there like lost in eve that did some wonderful debates and they didnt have a chance to get those done before voting had started3 shorten the length of time after voting closes when the winners are announced it seems crazy that it takes week after voting for ccp to run a sql query real life elections are counted quite a bit fasterbasically fewer but higher quality candidates would give folks a much better chance of being able to look at everyone
and fyi i was quoting trebor instead of you because his suggestion is far superior to the one you made imho no offense intended but your system is badly conceived
just tried it and on log on there is only a news item on the right but those tend to get buried quickly and from my experience most ppl dont read the news anyway well i guess csm6 has their work cut out for them put the pressure on ccp to finally give the csm the exposure it deservesbut ccp does not seem to be very talented at website design in general
at least you quoted at least its good thing that there is public discussion about this topic now
bah just tried logging in and now the ad is no longer there should be persistent regardless of whatever else is displayed maybe even in a special location in one corner or something but yeahits only the last few days of the election right sigh
you got both of my votes best of luck
according to evetribune i am everyones favorite dark horse
working hard to keep our glorious game fun u have my vote
no prob i am actually really enjoying this conversation plus i have the luxury of a voter and get to ask without answeringfirst yeahyoure right and i hate that so damned much i consistently delude myself in a hope that one day rep democracy could actually work in any other way than that at least youre willing to admit it most politicians refuse to ever acknowledge this because in the end it amounts to insulting large parts of their electorates still have to stand by disliking you in space for this reason but you seem like a capable candidate and someone i would have a beer with reminds me of a good pal i play settlers with he hates that i can win by using cheesy manipulative tactics to enlist the 3rd player to ensure my victory instead of winning through proper play looking back over a lot of the posts i do see that you arent directly attacking attacking him that much you however seem to be ignoring the fact that this is the internet and therefore i have an inalienable right to jump to conclusions using only research that supports my hypothesis dont take that away from meanyways trebors a weird dude the ideas he brings out that are about semisuperficial game mechanics are absolutely terrible i say semi superficial not to say that they wouldnt have massive negative effects but because they were small direct game mechanic changes however the ideas he has that deal with more meta aspects of the gamecsm like the prioritization crowd sourcing or low hanging fruit are quality have no idea how well its implementedcontrolling someone like that would be damned tricky though because you would have to be constantly telling them that they are too dumb to tie their own shoes while at the same time trying to keep them motivated for thinking about more abstract problems im pretty sure this is exactly how engineers deal with scientistsi was thinking about the necessity of consensus building some more and had another thought on it just a whim of a thought really and may not be relevantlets say for the sake of argument that you do sit down and there is butthurts coming from one side of the csm aisle at first i thought that this may be a problem however the more i think about it the more i wonder if its not an advantage if you think of ccp as your boss due to the power dynamic then having a fellow csm member that cant hide their butthurts actually improves your standing in ccps eyes this is tricky because you have to really manipulate the  out of someone to make them act like a useless prick without looking like a prick yourselfbut you can do it bringing back the previous example of a boss i used to have that i had to subtle hand convince i was also simultaneously doing the above to someone i wanted out of my group does make you feel a bit dirty thoughedit in a way its like building a straw man into your group so that you can look better in contrastps still not getting my vote but thats really only because youre assured a seat and i think prometheus absolutely needs a seat at that table and you thought i would join the marketbloc and vote for kalrand pfff as if
wows ui modding scene has a long history of adding features which become essential to compete either in pvp or pve while blizzard does integrate the best ones into the game there is always a fairly large time delay how do you feel about this disparity between haves and have nots existing in a game where the consequences of pvp can last years instead of minutes
i seem to recall that csm5 briefly discussed ui modding at the june summit and that ccps response was a solid no i dont see it mentioned in the minutes but likely their response was due to the way in which the ui iswas coded at that time refactoring of that code was only just getting started as more and more of the ui code is refactored ui modding may eventually become viable
i also brought up moddable ui during the october summit but outside of the meetings with some random devs and they said with the state that the ui code was in it would take quite considerable time until this would be possible apparently its a common occurance for programmers to leave ccp without documenting anything theyd coded cough billboards cough agents weeeewe can only dream
thank you everyone for your support these two comments in particular mean a lot to me only a few days voting to go tell your friends tell your family activate an old account for your pets and get them to vote for me
i have my own opinion and let me share it with youfor its professional and game experience i would ask seleene to point the important folders set out and list each and every relevant point and ask hes own conclusions for its professional and game experience i would send rip right to the front face to face with ccp hes communication abilities are with no possible doubt in my opinion a major strength for the next csm
agreed ripard does have the ability to express himself wellhe always come across we informed and usually provides a great deal of insite i really enjoy his blog
i didnt say that you said it would be the fix for lag but a fix for lag im pointing to that idea because it will not fix lag in any way if anything i expect itd probably make it worsefirst of all which node players are on isnt defined by which local they show up in but which solar system theyre in limited visibility wont help here in fact i suspect itd make it worse by either involving more calculations serverside bad for lag or clientside calculations ohai the clientside has way more information than the official client is showing im sure nobodyll ever exploit that both of which are a bad ideasecondly we currently have grids that are i believe defined by the servers during downtime how the server puts you in a grid or another i dont rightly know seleene would probably be the closest guy to answer that since hes worked there but i would assume it uses coordinates to determine this and your idea makes me think back to the times ive lost a ship because the majority of the fleet went offgrid and i was left there with no or few logistics and a large and angry enemy fleet that wasnt fun and ive yet to see anyone sell this kind of idea to methirdly if youre going to look at a singular way to fix lag then what you would look at would be ways to structure the way eve handles playerssolar systems so it would spread the load over multiple cpus or even nodes anything else is basically just putting on a bandaidi was never a part of 00 when poses claimed sov but after having been part of the delve defence until we ran out of money v having been part of the peaceful handover of deklein from tcf to goons and been part of the war to take over cloud ringouter ringfountain ill emphatically say that the old sov system sounded better by far i also keep seeing tons of old vets say the exact same thingits extremely static and nongranular its hard to  up the timing unless youre sons of tangra v its almost impossible to do a quick and easy handover to a friendly ally and its basically just way too easy to defend at worst you can be under attack in up to 6 different systems and still keep all of them by piling all your fleet basically supercarriers and titans into one system a day and just keep circling and worse than that it is still holding sov over 54 systems and 27 outposts and theyve effectively been dead for a full month nowadd to that the fact that a full days worth of manufacturing capacity can make 6 minutes worth of ammo for a full maelstrom fleet or 2 days worth of ratting ammo missiles mainly pr day and 00 starts to look more and more like a place to rat and mine abch ore and 00 end up looking like a place to claim for epeen and officer spawn not to actually live in that should ideally also change to incentivize more people to move from empire and into 00 i certainly wouldnt mind if empire manufacturing etc got nerfed not killed just nerfed a bit to give people an incentive to look for 00 space
i see your proposals regarding limiting fleet numbers as a dangerous precedent to turn eve from a sandbox into kindergarten playground  this is a wonderful universe come play in the sandbox cool let me bring my 3 shovels sorry only one shovel allowedthe thing probably the one thing about eve that has remained fairly consistent is that anything goes you do not find that anywhere else if we are now going to seriously consider paths which fit the player experience around artificial constraints based on technological limits rather than finding ways of lifting the technical liits to improve the player experience then i see eve turning very quickly from a sandbox mmo into just another mmo heres hoping i dont log in one day to see agents in incarna with a big  above their heads
unreasonably hounding your representatives is one of the pleasures of democracy you should not apologize for it the current status is that i asked two questions got a single reply and i and several other csms have asked for a clarification as of yet there has not been onegiven that fanfest is on the horizon and i think there will be a ui session there i would cut the devs a bit of slack until after everyone recovers from their party at the top of the world hangovers
5 more votes for you from myself and some corp mates thanks for all the hard work you mynxee and a few others did during this csm
zim while this thread isnt the best place for a technical discussion wonderful though they are i will take the time for a brief reply if you have further questions please contact me directly or look me up at fanfest if you are goingthat said i believe you are misunderstanding both the proposal i was making and certain facts about how eve works regarding your concerns1 you are concerned that it would mean ships would jump between grids this is not the case  or at least it would not happen more often than it currently does due to gridfu the server would simply be giving the clients partial information about the grid a player is currently onnote for practical information on grids i highly recommend the excellent goonswarm gridfu manual it explains why bizarre falling off the grid events occuralso keep in mind that my proposal was made well before team gridlock introduced serialized data updates see the drakes of destiny devblogs part 1 and part 2 this optimization makes serverbased fogofwar at least the version i described much more difficult to implement2 you are concerned about the cost of determining each players view of the grid this is a valid concern but too narrowly focused assume that a node can handle 2000 players and introducing fogofwar or any other method for organically limiting fleet sizes reduces its capacity to 1800 players if however the changes result in large fleet combats rarely exceeding say 1200 players then its still a win3 your concerns about clientbased fogofwar are valid though there are probably some ways to minimize the utility of client hacks however i never proposed doing this except as a quick method to check on sisi if the idea generated interesting and challenging fleet fights4 the use of stackless python to implement eve make it impossible at present to distribute a node process over multiple threads or multiple servers systems are currently statically allocated to nodes during downtime and grids are dynamically allocated as requiredwith respect to the second part of your post sov mechanics i believe we are in broad agreement and that our opinions are in the mainstream i would personally like to see an increase in nullsec manufacturing infrastructure to help wean nullsec off the jita teat and i would like to see the issue of supercap forceprojection halfway across the universe and back home for tea addressed in a way that doesnt nerf grocery logistics as a sideeffect however i dont think improving nullsec manufacturing necessarily requires a nerf to highsecand as ive said before i really think big changes like sov should be subjected to player tigerteaming before implementation because everything is so interrelated and unintended consequences abound and my personal opinions as a player are not relevant to my role as a csm when ccp asks for the csms opinion about their cunning plans its all about asking hard questions about their ideas not pushing our own

so i just received an interesting question by evemail ill post and answer it here so everyone can react if they want tofirst of all thank you for your vote i definitely have hope to grab a seat at the csm while being one of the underdogs of this election i believe from the various reactions i get both here ingame and on other forums that i could very well end up with enough votes to become either a csm representative or alternatehell at some point i even had plans about what id do if i got chair they are still valid but i guess we can safely agree that this is a most unlikely event and the top 3 or 4 seats are pretty much secured alreadyabout my plans if i get elected well first its to do my job as a csm member based on the various protocols that already exist what ccp wants us to do first and the experience of previous csms ill get a reasonably packed schedule just like any other csm memberthis implies attending meetings participating in the writing of reports hanging out in some channels and forums to be sure to hear the voices of playersccp will provide us with a list of elements they would like our feedback on and i will also debate with other members what are the points we could bring to themall these are the basic duties of any csm member and im sure all the serious candidates are already planning to do just the sameat this point id like to stress something if im not elected as a csm representative but got enough votes to become an alternate i will do just the same attend all meetings im invited to participate listen to the players and offer them feedback being an alternate will mean that i wont have a say in a lot of things but i wont let the people who voted for me down as an alternate id still plan to help the csm through informal means if needed and i will certainly not step down from such a position additionally we often saw csm representatives resign to express a disagreement or because they realized that the csm was not what they expected it to be in the case i was deemed as an alternate a suitable replacement id happily accept this promotionwhile we speak about player feedback and communication  if elected i also intend to represent the csm at various events i have already worked with ccp to showcase eve in festivals or conventions in the past and i will continue to do that if im elected a csm member i will continue to go there to convince potential new players that eve is damn cool but also plan some time to speak and debate with the eve players showing upfinally on the matter of the issues i will raise  one has to understand the way the csm works and how it cannot be used as a lobbyist group meant to pressure changes on ccp that will just not work however we can produce reports and material and submit them to ccp with no guarantee at all about the amount of attention that will be brought to it i can see from the platforms of other candidates that many of the important subjects are covered already i will of course offer my participation and carry the players voices about all these important mattersadditionally some more specific changes perhaps critical to a much smaller audience issues have so far not been raised i also have plans ideas which are a bit long for that post  forum that i intend to push forward because no other csm candidate will do it most of those are concerning roleplay and issues where realism and atmosphere are way off such as bloodlines pirate faction standings i do not center my campaign on those thus id ultimately be elected to serve the players
attention spans are short you must learn to make your point with less words
in csm 5 the only real difference between a main and alternate delegate was that only main delegates can raise a proposal at a csm meetingwith regard to meetings whether online or in iceland the rule was simple the top 9 available people did the jobalternates were encouraged to participate in the internal discussions on an equal basis though i think it took a while before they realized this mynxee was a strong proponent of this as was iit just makes good sense 15 heads are better than 9 and if an alternate has to step in and get on the plane to iceland it is better that they be fully up to speedhopefully csm6 will continue this policy and make it even more clear to the alternates that they are not only encouraged to participate they are expected to participateps you owe me a vote for the bump gehen
i support manalapanaff posted on wrong characterreal character is elizabeth azora
csm5 is ending with a bang given this and the open letter re incarna drama discuss
i wondered what little dramalama ding dong your little block of friends would have planned for this period in the election guess we now know  how kind of your good buddy to resign just as hes about to stop being a member of the csm and give you the scoopnice stunt mittens all theatrics though
wise words from a person in this game that i respect dearly you have nothing to apologize for you gave your time and spirit to this game and tried to change the minds of a game company that is losing focus on what really matters there is only so much one man can do and we thank you for your efforts
respect vuk for your dedication and see you around mate ps sophia lau best lau
indeed good of him to fall on his sword to give the nc  goons campaign a boost
stop whining windypops
all we had to do was make that logged out ragnarok not disappear for eight hours and let ccp gms do the restall too easy
more bitter lemon or windy hard to tell will someone volunteer to bite windy and find out
maybe its just me but i only talked to gms 2x in 2 years how often are you petitioning that this is a big dealthey handled both my errors so they where corrected for my next play session they didnt give me any free isk thoughi also dont see how mittans is a better option for this more theatrics over minior preseieved slights as big newsmeh
at this rate you will be posting in limegreen in no time
i wouldnt put this in the category of drama nor the incarna open letter i would certainly put it in a category of there being several challenges here but that is something differentthis is a matter on its own even if it is part of the general sensitivity of the topic of cs the 00 issue aside of the unfortunate troll topic of bridges outside of context in the minutes leading to the whole shouting and fear mongering of omg my bridges is an important one but less so in the light of the troll situation and much more so in light of ccp greyscales mentions of aiming for macro scale events  that is going to need careful exchange and translation of viewpoints and metricsthe incarna open letter im sorry considering ccps company values and the tasking by ccps ceo hilmar i fail to see any drama on the contrary it falls perfectly within the scope of constructive pressure management following weeks of collaboration as we saw on shc blogs and other places and before that the tediousness of communication between ccp ccp and csm on the road of incarna we will see what follows in the mean time it is  in spite of immediate appearances  to see ccp take a road of caution in the introduction of incarna yes beta for etc etcbut yes this is eve politics is fun that being said it is a shame to see vuk go i hope the presentation is still made would be a shame
perhaps if mittani hadnt spent quite so much time in this campaign boasting about his ability to connive and construct drama i might take this latest scoop a little more seriously as it is i think its a pretty shallow transparent little stunt soon to be excsm member storms off a few days before hed no longer be on the csm anywayyoud have to be pretty simple minded not to see through this choreographed announcement for what it isnext weeks will be better though im sure and weve got a whole year of these little faux exposes from mittens to look forward to
well aside from windys new conspiracy theory this is a somewhat interesting bit but gmdev incompetence is a big big deal that were dealing with a corporation that was surprised to learn that there was significant module lag in fleet fights is a bad thing that the most expensive ships in the game which require alliancewide support for their production and use can be destroyed not through pilot error but by blatantly broken game mechanics where ships stay in system for hours after their pilots log off thats simply unacceptable we deserve a game whose basic features work
whos vuk lau
is this about the idiotic its not your fault that you lost your insert supercapital its the games fault were still not going to reimburse you reimbursement policy because thats a seriously dumbass policy and it is literally the dumbest way to treat longtime players who work their asses off or in my case scam a lot of dudes to get a supercapital only to see it wiped out  not because they did anything wrong  but because they desynched after jumping into a system which can easily happen even if the system isnt lagged its also the laziest possible way to deal with the problemso if this is what youre mad about vuk im right behind you if its something else then im probably still right behind you on it
hes one of mittanis friends who has suddenly decided that its wrong that people lose supercaps when logged off at exactly the same time that some of his friends erm lost supercaps when logged off when mittens and co did it to it  bob they thought it was fair game suddenly apparently its unacceptable just before an election
i would be seriously concerned with any goonie right behind me at any time about anything
and rightfully so
its okay i only engage in homorapism on the weekends oh wait its friday carry on then
honest question isnt being manipulative a good thing when you get down to it even more so arent your little posts here even more obviously manipulative you are attempting to prey of peoples fear of mind control to implant the suggestions you feel to be right and you arent even being subtle about it at least mittens there put there effort into his propaganda to give an impression other than idiot who is bitter because he finally realized that he sucks at the spin game
you have got to be kidding me mittens goons and the nc used that means of killing caps countless times against their enemies when you were at war with usand only now when your friends are involved and you use csm privelege to try to force decisions on petitions you and vuk suddenly decide its intolerable vuk storms off giving you the exclusive drama bomb if this is the kind of neutrality and balance we can expect when you guys have most of the seats on the csm then its a pretty clear indication of how you lot intend to blackmail and manipulate the csm to your personal advantageguess you let your mask slip huh mittaniedited for spelling
btw i resigned before i lost the titan and before i even imagined i would lost it also if i wanted to manipulate with my resignation i would do it to promote killer2
was it too hard to hire an auditor to watch employee conduct in the game and prevent scandals like spawning t2 bpos ccp took the cheap short term solution by banning its employees from playing the game
dude he never wore a mask sure hes tried to play lolpolitics but hes always been clear on just advocating his own interests and people would be stupid to trust him look at it this way his enemies got killed by time and grind itself so now hes got to make his own aurora 20 seriously what do you expect even in scrum some pigs and chickens are less equal than most
plenty of fights in the game are won by being the first to convince gms a technique is an exploit maybe you should quit whining and start petitioning more
what were we going to do not kill hostile ships because they might be desynched andor lagged out what kind of dumbass ehonour crap is that i lost a supercarrier to an it fleet because of this but i sure as hell didnt blame the it fleet for shooting me up seriously you take the kills that are presented to you even if ccp had a sane and sensible reimbursement policy and you knew that the titan you are about to kill will just get reimbursed shoot the damned thing anyway a kill is a kill is a kill anyone who tries to scream hypocrite over this is a numskulledit actually you make a good point even if only by accident now that we all know that ccp will refuse to reimburse losses caused by this players have every incentive to exploit eves buggy cyno and supercarrier bumping mechanics to destroy their enemies without them even having a chance to fight back its just another example to support the theory that ccp is completely unable of thinking through the consequences of their decisions
wow mittani bit of an own goal this thread huh
for the record i was with vuk on that one and 90 of the conversation about this issue was him and meso i dont agree with the no support from the csm bitthere has been an increase in overall gm quality since that meeting in csm 3 in no small part due to that discussionand while weve all had our share of facepalm since anecdote is not the singular of data which despite continuous request we have yet to receive from ccp wink wink nudge nudgethat being said i regret vuks decision in the 3 terms i was lucky to work with him hes been a great asset the vast majority of the time ie when he could keep his temper his check something understandably difficult this last term pthis last bit of csm has been extremely tiresome and frustrating for many delegates and tempers flaredvuk indeed kept pushing for improvements in 00 lag fixes gm improvements and was even a proponent of positive changes in areas that concerned his gameplay less directly its safe to say he didnt fail his voters
this thread has nothing to do with my csm run which is pretty much already won regardless of the chair fightyou can whine about me and conspiracies all you want though ill just enjoy your impotent rage
fun to see the mittani backpeddling pathetic to see the goon  nc guy ragequitting because he couldnt use his csm position to get his ship backthis is precisely why we need fewer 00 alliance reps on the csm the fact that vuk lau even admits to corruptly trying to influence the outcome of a petition is seriously scary
spotted gm alt cp generic troll without even reading the op
nah not gm alt just generic troll
i dont even see how vuk resigning is supposed to help my candidacy this is like arguing with jesus freaks about if im going to hell or not
mittens watcha gonna do if ccp decides to play the deaf card
hurf blurf grandstanding on tentonhammer while yapping to buddiesjust like a regular capsuleer with a blog reallyor he could try to get to work with the rest of csm and the good parts of ccp constructively consistantly transparantly like meissa mynxee trebor dierdra teadaze etc in csm 5
im just going to post this link to show what i would do after i heard this news because im lacking a real one
heh hehcalls to mind for some reason the time when pcgamers usual eve reporter passed to another person the responsibility for a csm5 interview that didnt reflect so well on ccp because he didnt want to ruin chances of getting scoops from ccp about new features and stuff the interview was never published regardless
i feel kind of bad now mittens sorry for ruining your big drama more time to work on next weeks though ehremember people theyre lying to you mittens said so and he knows a lot about manipulation hes saving us from those evil lies
i plead for a different way of elections for next yeari like to see a new setup4 csm candidates get into csm by players votes3 csm candidates will get into csm by jury ccp based on any criteria that the jury may have2 csm members of the current running csm can get pushed forward by the other councillors internal vote for continuation purposes rule the csm members that made use of this option cannot make use of this option twice in a row more guarantee on quality of csm less chance on csm blocks improved continuation not everyone with the best skills and plans are capable running campaign as it should or lack campaigning skillspick by jury will be fair for this group of candidates
so in other words take away the majority of the chairs from the electorate because the electorate outnumbers youthere shall be no house of lords here
it makes perfect sense for the council that ccp created in response to proven ccp corruption have members on it appointed by ccp
while it is true that i have a rather specific playstyle that doesnt mean that everything i would do in csm is based on that rather the contrary in fact the main reason youd have to vote for me is that im used to thinking outside of the box knowing all the game mechanics etci can use this knowledge to help improve the game for everyone
theres still time to vote  go vote now
got my vote imigo good luck out there and lets take down those macros
heres the rules to this discussion please follow them if you dont you will defeat the purpose of this debate 1 please provide all feedback and examples without referencing nc or drf any reference to either group or how they use said mechanic will be ignored2 if you are providing feedback for something you understand in concept but not in practice thats ok just please just note it for example if you think titan bridges are unbalanced but have never used or depended on one just note that input is important but so is source3 please stick to facts this is about game mechanics not metagaming conspiracy theories or tears because powerblocs are powerblocs and those that arent arent4 seriously lets not get into powerbloc debate i would like to start that debate but i want to do so in another thread just try and hold back kthxwhy ruleslook i totally understand that people have problems with large powerbloc groups like nc and drf but if your problem is with the mechanics you should be able to hold a valid debate while excluding 1 or 2 users of said mechanic meaning is your problem with the mechanic or is it really with the powerblocbridges lets talk about how titan and jump bridges are ways to bring them into balanceshould we talk about just nerfing in case you think they should stay just lets look at how many ships can use them at one time fuel requirements or mechanics in which they are usedshould we talk about getting rid of them all together now seriously please dont comment here if you have never relied on bridges without stating so personally im not opposed to a rebalance of bridges however i do oppose removalforce projection i guess my issue with bridges and force projection is that an alliance or group that can project 200 pilots will do so regardless of bridges for those that have moved large groups of people most of the time large fleets like this only use a few key bridges if any at all which almost always requires fuelers ready due to the number of ships i really think if you remove bridges large alliances will still project their forces when its really needed they will just have to start earlier when moving for titan bridges most probably all even partially stable 00 alliances have a titan or 20 so its relatively equally in terms of their use as a portal but im interested in ideas on potentially rebalancing these as wellsmall scale pvp as a pilot who has frequently been in small scale pvp 30 man fleets in both friendly and in enemy space i personally do not see how jump bridges prohibit small scale pvp my fleet can still go in to enemy space and have many gfs you say its cause the defender can blob you fast they will still blob you without jump bridges it will just be slower the point is for pvp fighting not pvp running if your 10 man cruiser fleet comes up against a 50 man bs fleet your fc commands to flee you would do so regardless of how they got to you additionally it actually takes away a camping point for pvp to occur and it takes away strategic assets that are a common instigator for small and largescale pvpin closingi will really try hard to weed through the trolls and tears to have a valid debate and im quite open minded to new views and ideas so no attacksplease understand that while i am in nc i am not opposed to rebalancing bridges and i do strongly endorse more small scale pvp note that i promote gfs much more than i promote the ability to get good ganks easier there is a huge difference im not trying to endorse abilities for rmt botting and that other crap its dumb and ccp should rule with a much stronger fist on such fronts
and i know you are thinking it so i will just say it and get it out of the way for any of you tards that think nc or drf has it made because we have huge jump bridge networks think about this nc has over 400 bridges im guessing cause im too lazy to count thats 400 towers to manage fuel and protect 400 actual bridges to keep fueled 200 systems where ihubs and sov bills have to be maintained its not about the isk its about the work that goes into it the work in coordinating setting up documenting and managing this type of network is frakin insane if you think any part of managing this many bridgesposs is easy or fun or makes for a fun game bite me oh yea magical fairies are great but i prefer the frolicking ones just saying
there for you did say that im only saying you cant speak for all major areas im also not saying its what people do or dont want votes will decide that im just saying i dont personally think thats what makes the best candidate im entitled to thatyou sayempire is not my only interest in eve but it needs to be represented in csm and nonpowerbloc community needs it too i can represent bothyou then say again you might be able to represent empire but you still are a powerbloc member with a 00 sov and jumbridges to defend you just cant represent outofpowerblocs playersso you have your own interest but you say you can represent both why cant iso its not your only interest who says 00 is my only interestyou too make too many assumptions in attempt to attackdiscredit dont
fact is this thread title is any candidate who is not advocate of big alliances  and you are from a big 00 powerbloc allianceive never said 00 is your only interest stay calm all csm are interested in eve as a whole they will have to participate on every subjectbut the reason why you cant represent antipowerbloc people is because you are from a powerbloc when 00 discussions will happen in csm how could you fight for something that will rip your renter space apart destroy jumbridges and your ability to haul your stuff make small fleets able to harass your megaalliance farming systems you will just like every other powerbloc csm member try to defend your personal priviledgesme as a player  i have absolutely no priviledges i do pvp only against blinky pirates which sucks because i have a lot less targets than pirates etc and to help my carebear friends during wars my playstyle is broken because of the killright system agression mechanics docking timers rich 00 players t3guardian blobs who decide to own lowsec neutral remote during wardecs
you say youre antipowerblock what does that even mean you oppose groups of people being more powerful than individuals just groups of people more powerful than your specific group do you feel that one person should be unable to undo the work of thousands or perhaps there should be strict rules about gathering in groups of more than 10so your gameplay area of choice is crappy although id contest that you cant find pirates to shoot there are plenty of chokes which almost always have camps on perhaps you mean pirates you can kill without bringing friends and youre miserable because of that how about instead of trying to make other people miserable too you focus on improving the stuff you actually participate inand living in empire has plenty of advantages not privileges though that would imply you couldnt choose to gain them there are plenty of ways you could gain all the wonderful advantages you think come from living in 00 space you just choose not to
im fairly new to teh game but it seems to me that people affiliated with goons are trolling nongoons candidates why is it really necessary
absolutely
i dont think of it trolling so much as pointing out the incredibly stupid things that people will say to get votesid do it to the goon candidates as well but i didnt reading their platforms
well i lost
because its there
why thats part of being a goon i suppose think a collection of jackasses and smartasses and those not necessarily always smart either p plus theres always the possibility the candidates making a fools of themselves in response which would be comedypersonally i prefer staying out of other candidates campaign threads except i have something good to tell about them but thats megetting elected and getting others not elected is a game just like in real life and by those standards goons are fairly moderate my one question is whether the candidates can behave appropriately after that and historically even goons have not sure this time around however well see
its a more significant to me that when confronted with anything other than gushing praise and endorsements a number of candidates have resorted to stop trolling me you trolling trolls aaaaaa rather than giving straight answersthat these potential csms feel unable or unwilling to deal with difficult questions and unfavourable commentary says a great deal about both their motivations and suitability for the post
they are goons its what they do plus its funny to see if they make somebody stumble and mess up
i liked when they were trolling thus it was easy to fend off and bumped my thread for free p
last year within my first year in eve i saw that ccp was sponsoring this thing called the csm which i knew nothing about id never seen such a thing by a company for its players before i took the time to go look at each of the more than 80 some odd candidates and wrote down names and ideas presented by each and came up with 10 that had interesting ideas and bios i narrowed my list to 5 but i saw as i was narrowing the list that i was judging them all by 1 that my mind had selected as the standard that all should be judged by based on what i was reading about each and that one was issler dainze i read extensively of her corporation and its history and its members and i was captivated by it all i voted for issler not only for the csm but i asked to join her corporation and a sight unseen noob like me was accepted without reservation by her i have been a working member of isslers corp since then she has always been one of the most fair minded well grounded unassuming people i have met and that judgement is not only against what little i know about eve characters but real people in my real life i am dedicated to this corp because i find her style of leadership and management inspiring in the way that what she offers you for what she needs out of you to make her corp work is fair and just that is inspiration from within engendered by her personality i feel she should have been on the csm last year and still feel she should be on the csm this year even more the csm the eve community ccp we all can benefit from the level headed dedicated and real life contributions of someone like issler dainze as part of this important body no one would go wrong supporting issler dainze i trust her and you should tooplease vote and please vote for issler dainze and you know what guys   shes a real girl
i am pretty certain this was an overview bug either that or you must already have been in structure  typically windy finds it hard to blow anyone up  i witnessed this first hand todaythat aside i feel sure that he will act in your best interests when he is elected
erm no shuffles no hes right i killed him in the face that was probably one of my happiest times in eve  solo wardeccing corporations and violencing their spaceboats happy days
jez put a little effort into your altposting
no doovers nope i dont ccp hasnt mentioned anything so far since members of csm5 are running for reelection i doubt they would out of concern it might offer some kind of insider knowledge advantage shrugs who knows i suggest you email kalrand and ask him directly what the situation isupdate ive posted a request to ccp xhagen and ccp diagoras to have a look at this thread and address your questions
i think its rather unsettling that somebody like kalrand shows up for csm election people vote for him and then disappear without any explanation from ccp or kalrand himselfive put in 3 votes for him
rumor on the internet says
they artificially deflate the cost of certain ships and modules sounds negative to me
in an interview ccp stated that they cannot link vote cast to player who cast it they did this in the intent of anonymity but it has the added effect of making doovers impossible and having any means of fixing the dead vote of the 4 hr accounts now i know this disappoints many of you for whom i would have been the second choice and all those votes and your base belong to me buuuuuut    live with it you voted for someone and they are gone next time vaote for someone elsethano you for participating in the processm
kalrand requested to have his candidacy withdrawn after the election started and thus we removed him from the candidacy list any votes for him will have to stay with him as it has been explained above we cannot link votes to voters the voting system was specifically designed to leave no record of what user voted only that the user has voted even though it leads to being unable to fulfill requests like this one
note that kalrand made a post regarding this here
this is an incomplete version of events specifically he asked to be withdrawn after what i consider a valid complaint about ccps conduct during the election process and that complaint being given a dismissive response however i will let him make that case
lol not having a go at you demi iirc it was a convo you and i were having that offended that alpha guy and made him run to barqs and complain like a little puss hind sight i should totally have trolled that dude for what it was worth rather than apolgizing seeing how it would all have ended the same way i love it how barqs got all personally offended too that was even more troll worthy p lol
i believe that what needs to be nerfed is the speed at which 00 entities can move combat ships form one side of the galaxy to another i wouldnt want to see 00 logistics made harder by the change thoughi dont want to see moon mining in wspace even though it would be very profitable for me i would like to see comets throughout space that have moon minerals in them as a way of relieving some of the moon goo scarcityif you live in a wormhole you should seriously take a look at my blog
im probably the only guy on eve without an alt for the moment so i only get one vote tbh it was a toss up between trebor and mike and the fact that trebor will likely get more than enough votes has me deciding on mike

supportedimplants for drone bonuses pleaseoh absolutely its the neglected drones that turn into rogue drones and that results in horrors like this
this isnt the only love drones could use but its one of the more obvious things that is lacking and could be easily added to the game with little to no negative side effectsrogue drones might be considered as one source of certain drone implant sets since currently rd exploration sitescomplexes arent so good versus the sites of every other faction because they lack the normal faction drops other factions can givewhatever the actual way of getting such implants is going to be the idea in itself is certainly a good one supported

returning from two weeks of dormancy and 6 pagesbumpgo go new csm  get out and vote folks they may only get half or less of what we ask but youll get nothing if you dont voteand support my thread while youre at it
thanks for your support future readers  if you support this topic please remember to check the support this topic box 
supported i like having things neat
this idea has some meritlowsec population would definitely spike if it was the only place to gain security status or it and hisec nullsec shouldnt give sec status since it iswell0 security i wouldnt screw with bounties thoughthe lower you go the higher the pay is finepirates would certainly see more prey which is always good imo there and itd probably boost pvp in lowsec as well i dont mind incursions increasing sec status since in lownull there can be competition for them more incursions in low with higher sec gains would increase traffic too1 research a little more but it has merit the main thing to remember is this only slows down gankers real pirates have better things to do but doesnt seriously deter it it does however place a time value on whether or not to gank
thanks
so how about the option to check lcos buildings etc as blue thena simple checkmark in the overview settings should suffice
there is others possibilies to make this inetreting for both ccp and uscurrently i would like to train 2 char on same account and no one on otherbut i canti would need to transfer one char but i dont have free slots and it cost 2 months of sub as plex x2 as youll need it back after so not interestingor create another account but same you need to transfer things and as stated you need to have it active when you dont need training or like before pay for transfer oftenmore complex change you could even think about a way to be able to log 2 char of any account at the same time if you have 2 accountsbut here not sure ccp would like this money wise as it would reduct a lot curent transfers psomething more easy to use for customer would be so goodbut well we must admit it could be pretty compicated to code or make fairbut what is proposed here is a 1st foot on this direction
try to remember that while a second account provides more benefits both online for example than two characters on one account a second account has an initial startup fee to buy the gameim all for allowing an option to double or even triple charge a single account to train the alternates on it you can only have one online at a time so flightwise combat transit mining it makes no impactccp might not want though since they enjoy the extra cash from accounts as well as the other factif you can train three simultaneously on one account youll quit the game earlier why because the fact you have to buy another account keeps many players from training alternates simulataneously the end result is that people will spend more time in eve because theyll pause their 1st character to train a second or third so from a business perspective you can unerstand why ccp has the system as it is1 would be nice feature that benefits players but it could impact eve membership as well as our infamous hard game
i will have to disagree with this i like the idea in concept but i feel this is step in the wrong direction with microtransactions there shouldnt be a way for some to benefit more by paying more moneyaccount my biggest concern is this will slippery slope into microtransactions
as a goonswarm member i fully support periodic bills with harsh consequencesmaybe you should make the penalty harsher though im worried that losing all your offices corp hangers sov and poses is too lenient
in most countries you yearly pay flat corporate registration fees why this shouldnt be the case in eve is puzzling it even will provide the game with a good isk sinksupporting a flat rate bill for corporations to keep their name in the 5m to 20m range
the problem youre trying to solve is insignificant to the point of being a nonissue and your solution to it is annoying and bothersome to everyone with a corp the bother maybe minor but why the hell should i have to suffer even that because you couldnt bother thinking up an original name or add a dot to the end of it this is a totally disproportionate solution to the issue that punishes the many for the failings of the few by creating needless fees and busywork no one wants to deal with it also seems to contradict ccps policy to encourage people to go out and form their own corps and remove any obstacles to that poor solution to an insignificant issue not supported
this
they really shouldas things stand intaki males have been entirely stripped of their visual identity and sebiestor males have been offered no hope that ccp will ever bother to give them what would bring back a very significant portion of theirs including their hair come to think of it
have you checked the test server they are testing tattoos at the moment for the character creatorthis is all content you are asking about this can be easily added when walking in stations is fully implemented the implementation now was mearly to allow the character creator to exist
a few months ago i would agree but i am starting to like rocking the dreads 
look ccp did this just for you
lork niffle and draco llasa have missed the pointyes lork i have checked the test server no lork what im asking about is not therewaiting for the release of incarna seems like an inordinate amount of time to wait for things that should have been implemented first furthermore some of the old sebiestor male tattoos would be so simple to recreate that if ccp still hasnt done so by the time incarna arrives i will take it upon myself to dig through the client files figure out the tattoo texture formats and hand ccp the results for free with no strings attached other than resentment

sounds good to me
drakes are not overpowerd dam its the current playstyle that makes him shine and nothing elsethe single point i can agree is the absurd distance you can shoot stuff with heavys its not related to the drake some flight time reduction could be enough but dont touch dmg output hes finedont touch the drake caldari pilots deserve this ship even if i think hes the pain in the ass whenever ive got one on my hud this doesnt mean he can not be countered
heavy missiles are the issue not the drakethe problem with heavy missiles is that they deal very good dps at extreme range without the need to sacrifice midlow slots for that rangereduce guided heavy missile range by 3040 flight time not velocityintroduce midlow slot modules that increase missile range and explosion velocity scriptsthis will mean that missile boats when fitted for range will have to use up their tankinggank slots to give them the engagement range they want
that seems like almost a reasonable suggestion but i keep feeling like most people starting these post do not actually fly drakes and thus do not know how lacking they are at some basic abilities most other ships have all they are is tank and low damage the only good thing is that when you have 30 friends suddenly the low damage does not mean as much as before
if you want to use the low damage argument then you need to compare the appropriate weapon system which means hams on the drake not heavies  and the ham drake is probably the one bc you do not want barrelling down on you in a fight  just sayin long range it gets 400dps using the now standard navy ammo projected out beyond 80km  closest you get with other bcs damagerange is the arty cane but it has precious little tank if it tries and it still does less dps with only 30 more alpha or so  harbinger has even less left than the cane after fitting guns to hit that rangegallente are just sed up in general so no need to mention them at allheavy ranges involved are pretty much where the thing breaks the system cutting it down some brings far more counters into play without completely ruining the drake and other missile lobbers
yes dont nerf the drake nerf the misslesimo missles should have a long range booster mod just like guns do te and tcso the idea is reduce the range of missles by a lotthen introduce a mod that increases the range and lets say reduce the exlosion radius too hamms and torps could use a boostnow if you want to hit to 70km you either need a mid slot or low slot to get to that range which will make it much harder to get good ehp and dps pick one or the other just like every other shipalso as a drakegilasnake pilot i would like to see passive regen tank nerfed too its boring only having named and tech ii shield regen mods reduce the effectiveness or add stacking penilties and add factiondedofficer gear that way i can chuck on one estamels shiled flux coil and still get the same tank but now i can put on some damage mods
pretty much thispeople dont know how missiles work guns have tracking while missiles have explosion radius and explosion velocity this is why you can volley frig for big damage far off with guns but never with missiles the one factor tracking for guns are alleviated with tracking compenhancer mods the 2 factors for missiles cannot be alleviated except with 2 different types of rigs
unusual ideabut consider thisif warfare links were grid onlyorcas and rorquals have to be where their miners are at this makes them more vulnerable to attack costs more time slow ships are slow and consequently costs more iskships with warfare links would need to be on grid t3s would be seen more in fleet fights for their bonuses which outstrip command ships for whatever reason as well as command ships this doesnt add a whole lot of isk risked relative to an entire fleet but it does add more strategy  see belowwith the warfare link ships on grid which normally only happens at towers gang fights gand when a fleet jumps strategy would be shifted some as a new and potentially dangerous element is present and now removable the warfare linksi personally like this idea but miners suffer the most here pvp wise i think it would be a change for the better 1
so instead of boosting t3 alts there will be a bloody swarm of falcon alts again no thanks
basically you have modular dronesthey dont have fittings but they do get one rig slot its pretty much the same as you have with other tech iii stuffyou put together sub sections on a base hull  there would be 3 drone hull sizes small med and largei would like to see one of the sub sections for propulsion would be a warp drive for the dronesbut as a draw back it would slow the drone speed significantlywhy do you think other then the trolls would it add value to the game would you invest in tech iii drones
i like this idea

supported in principlei might invest in tech 3 drones depending upon how they were implemented that said there are other drone improvements that id probably want to see sooner such as dronerelated implants indicators for when your drones have been locked or shot the ability to see the hitpoint bars on your drones while theyre in your drone bay and so on
10
i really like the look of these commands bettermore advanced drone ai and commands would be a nice touch to the game since none of these commands actually modify damage or stats no balancing is really needed op ideas benefit carriers moreso than subcaps but theyd be nice for gangwork too1i still wish we could have more than 5 active drones on battleshipswould be nice to have a squad of lights that could swat pesky frigates while a squad of mediums or heavies help you with your primary targetthe ewar  dmg capabilities would be neat too pve or pvp of course all ships not just gallente would need drone baybw increases for balancing can almost hear a dev screaming in agony as he envisions this
agree
supported
i support though i just have a client on each monitor rather than one spanning the two less gpu intensive that way
your right i stopped reading as soon as you tried to take the jump drive away from caps make them use gates and they will have to be able to dockunsupport
you unsupport things you havent read interesting
how does jbs factor in fixing supercaps gate jammer local delay warp speed enhancerim just going to stop there but this isnt fix capitals online this is  with tons of random things and i suspect itd break a lot more than it would fix
well the idea behind it is rather simpleit is cta the sc need to move to staging system a spy tells that to an enemy alliance the enemy alliance where a certain sc is and where the staging system is so they know the way he has to take they can easily set up a gatecamp with delayed local scs scou jumps in sees nobody in local since it is delayed for him and thinks it is clear sc follows and warps to outgoin a hic decloaks everybody else too or comes through the gate and sc is dead
the only reason why i stopped where i stopped was because i didnt feel the urge to list more or less each and every modification you had in thereyoure mixing jbs which supercaps dont use sov changes removal of jumpdrives industrial changes gate jammers blues list limits warp enhancers sov fees rising exponentially local jammers outposts that can create faction ships removing rat bounties in 00 etc etc etc etc etc etc etc honestly im not going to read more of that listits all over the place its tons of changes that you have no idea how will affect everything else most of which has all to do with capitals hell you even think that 00 is safer than hisec paying particular attention to ratting logistics and pointing to jbshow many times have you autopiloted a freighter in empire when was the last time you moved a freighter in 00 how often have you been ratting in 00 without glaring at the intel channel vs afkratting in hisec how much extra work do you have to do in 00 just to avoid getting ed vs in empire and how exactly is this going to have any effect on capitalsin short your long list of suggestions most of which have all to do with capitals is most likely exactly the kind of suggestion ccp should look at and just shoot down in flamesand just to tackle your scenario of the sc going to a cta staging system scs dont travel alone and scouts would most likely be in place more than 5 minutes before anything happens probably even hours if the alliances in question isnt a bunch of complete scrubs thats how its done now let alone with delayed local
wow unsupported i had to stop reading after the first post yes i eventually finished have you ever lived in 00 and been part of sov large fleet or cap warfareim with lord zim here i could write 5 posts explaining all the mistakes and misconceptions i just cant be bothered got get ready for some some real 00 combat next time try smaller scale ideas and keep it to stuff you have actually done and really understand i dont dispute alot of your root issues but your solutions for them would make things so much worse in so many wayslawl sry still laughing about sieged dreads using bombs you know sieged dreads cant move to align for a bomb launch right
hmmm i had to stop reading after the first two paragraphsunsupported these changes would negativly effect eve on a large scale base i am to assume you are not a cap pilot and have been blobbed a few too many timesmy advise to you is to learn how to live in 00 and pull your skirt down
it would be fun but i think it would not add substantially to the game play the view would very very rarely be used as would just lack the quick access of information the current view provides i do not think it adds enough to the game play to supportit would be fun but really ships are not flown like this in rp sense of capsuleers either so something to consider
currently one opens saved fits by hitting browse selecting a relevant entry and hitting fitif one wants to mix things up and change just a little one has to either make sure the offending modules are not present in hangar or fit manually add tickboxes in the fittings shown in browse so that individual modules can be deselected prior to fitting
its that much of a hassle to remove the offending module and put in the one you want afterwards
not really just a wasteful amount of extra clicking ui optimization is the futurealso the rather large expense if the item is a rig which can cost quite a lot
maybe thats because drones are based on the original gallente design and were acquired by the other races by various means donated to minmatar stolen by caldari who shared with amarr then reverseengineered to fit with their different technologiesthats why you have to specialize for a races drones later onships on the other hand were developed in parallel so no two races technologies are the same

theres also a saying when you accuse people of something that isnt true theyll often point out your errors funny how that works yes
two steps was in goonswarm federation until about 2 weeks ago check his employment history to give the impression he is neutral and wasnt favouring nc he decided to leave which tbh he should have done midway or did what white tree did and hide his alliance tickertwo shots  someone who doesnt even have the balls to admit his nc loyaltybad comment please ignore haha got two step mistaken for two shots
do you know just how many people have at some stage been in a large alliancecoalition how many people havent been in a big alliancecoalitionim not sure what has driven you to vehemently hate anything vaguely associated with the north of eve but its unhealthy and seems to be driving away any ability to reason you may once have had
would you believe it i actually got two shots and two step mixed up if they are alts my post makes sense but i doubt that very muchconfusion at my part sorry for the negative comments quite embarrassing since i try to be sincere as possible disregard any negative comments i said in this threadps looks like imigo made the same error too hahaonce again sorry for the  up xd
nope no error made on my part because i wasnt saying anything about the candidate  i was commenting on your poor reasoning which was directed at two step mistakenly or otherwise and comprehension further evidenced by you not realising thisif youre going to go around throwing poop all over peoples campaigns at least do so with realy poop instead of making some up
i could just link all your comment right about now and call you out on all your bull but i think most people are aware of what you are likebesides its not like i got called out on the error i was the one who corrected myself im all for criticising people for their hypocrisy but if i screw up i will state that doesnt really make sense you calling me out after i correct myself though lol
please do although i invite you to start a new thread or post in my campaign thread especially if youve found a post i should be called out on so that we can leave two steps campaign thread aloneim yet to see you back anything up so id really like to see this

more like following the good instructions of vote early vote oftenbetter than waiting for an opportunity that never arrives
my own advice comes back to haunt me
jonathani wanted to let you know that i put in a very enthusiastic vote for you today i wish you well with your csm experience
amaroq you can think of it like the futures markets jita is the nymex amarrtashmurkon oursalert and rens are like the mgex kcbot and cbot the market system will naturally create hubs one central hub and several distributed regional hubs this arrangement is not strictly out of convenience but rather an emergent architectural feature of virtually all trading systems if you remove the central market another will emerge simply because the market has participants who will travel to the busiest market to receive the best price
as you may know im the csm6 candidate the most attentive to the roleplayers voices and such a use of it makes me sadi wont troll this topic into turning into one about godmoding and the way rp shouldnt be used as a way to present concerns that have lets face it nothing to do with rpto speak of the underlying problem of trade hubs i think it wont be easy to nerf them its very possible even with the market needs for them  a rise in trade costs based upon stations hangars free capacity meaning increased costs for market orders in busy stations would pretty much achieve that and with a valid rp reason nonethelessnow is it really needed  since the removal of stargates highways the main trade hub have switched to jita and several secondary hubs appeared in all the main empires traders love em and while one can dislike the crowded stargates hisec pirates and local scamming logorrhoea they will continue to existif elected as a csm member ill do absolutely nothing about trade hubs unless the situation evolves vastly
there is a way to prevent market to create one big main hub like jita increase taxes broker fees etcmake your nearby market interesting again because it has almost no feesor just increase travel cost but would be a lot harder
if ccp does things to jita everyone will fly their stuff to new caldari niyabainen perimeter and urlen distributing the amount of stuff being sold from one system into five if prices havent dropped sufficiently at that point then the market would migrate into the citadel which sits directly between domain amarr and the forge jita and expand to fill stations as needed based on price pressurethe citadel region index would replace the jita system index as the central market of the eve economy due to the availability of stations and proximity to two previous hub systems
still better than an overcrowded jita in my opinionand i think it would greatly improve secondary hubs in other regionspeople who nowadays make a trip to jita every week or so to sell their stuff when they live near dodixie rens amarr etc will probably just sell it in the hub nearby instead of wandering in citadel in their freighter to find the best price ah and add more taxes to ranged buy orders it would be logicalim not an economist but i know there are ways to weaken jita im honest though i dont know all the effets they will have
it looks like were going to breach 50k i was not too educated on voting systems before reading this thread i must admit after some reading and the inevitable hyperlink compulsive clicking while i somehow ended up on a page about some aspects of buddhism i also gathered some new knowledge about these election systemsand i concur a system that would create less wasted votes would be better for the eve community
yeah definitely putting something up for debate on the internet is the solution that you were looking for herehint this will accomplish nothing and youre just putting words together to make yourself sound important

saturday evening bump
a deserved bump for a deserving candidateps you owe me a vote
thanks and no i dont actually i have four votes i used three of them on myself and one on you figure if i dont get elected youre the csm delegate i get the right to pester also i have written a blog post regarding my feelings on vuks resignation
i just read the post and agree with your conclusionsand you actually spent one of your votes on me boy if you miss out being a main by 1 vote youre going to be ed
while i entirely agree with you on an abstract philosophical level one also has to consider the reality of both playing in and running a game universe when the server is lagging out or melting nobody is having fun  neither the players nor the operations staff and last time i checked having fun is why we play games or perhaps thats what makes eve different  its the game you play so you can feel good by escaping back to your real life eve is full of artificial constraints imposed for reallife performance reasons for example the watchlist is limited to 10 ships for this reason changes implemented to encourage as opposed to require fleet sizes to max out within current server capacity are no different theyre just more visiblefinally it should be noted that as the technological limits increase either by better servers or better code constraints imposed for performance reasons can be relaxed
no youre misunderstanding me the only reason i mentioned grids were because your idea reminded me of how i could foresee your fog of war working i was assuming that the server would have to pr client calculate the distance to everyone around him and adjust the overview accordingly im currently not giving ccp the benefit of the doubt that they can actually make this work in a nonsuck way and to be frank it sounds very nonsandboxy and jarringalso i may not know the exact technical details behind how grids work but i know the general idea of how the falling off the grid deal works i have read the gridfu manual a while ago but i have read itim in agreement with this as long as eve is as limited in how many people can be in a system moreso when those people are using drones andor missiles as is the case today for technical reasons not mechanics or policy reasons however im strongly opposed with the way you wish to achieve this and i think your thinking on this along with pinball titan dd we got rid of aoe dds for a reason it was overpoweredyour way is essentially creating dungeons in space and that is the wrong way to go what you want is a way to enable attackers to attack multiple systems at once and have a way of making progress even if the defenders were to turtle up in a single system at a time dominion sov doesnt do this it enables the defender to turtle up in up to 6 systems in a roundrobin fashion and that much more than anything else is creating the hit it with a bigger hammer tactics of today that is what needs to be fixed it should be my choice to commit 500 dudes to a single system and leave the rest of the systems vulnerable to counterattacks not some dungeons in space mechanic that puts an even greater emphasis on skillpointsim aware of the limitations put upon eve by stackless python thats not really what i meant though what i meant was that it would be nice if they could refactor the way eve was structured at the core so it worked in a way that did actually scale a lot better im just theorycrafting here and itd probably end up with a fair bit of overhead if its even possible but if they could refactor the codebase so that players and the missiles etc they fired for example were one process instead of keeping this in the solar system processs then it would be much easier to scale up but as i said ive no idea how much work that would be nor would i bet on ccp doing this or if they did theyd probably find some way of ing it up or leaving it unfinishedhowever as i think ive made abundantly clear this is far from the main problem with 00 today as i see it the sov system the fact that living in 00 apart from ratting mining abch ore moongoo and pi materials and of course the epeen is more or less pointless and the fact that even mining is more stressful than in empire i cant watch a movie while minig which makes it a lot more of a chore than mining in empire all combine into one irrefutable fact if i got kicked out of goonswarm today i probably wouldnt try to go back to 00 with it being in the state it is now id go back to empire and manufacturing stuff there if i wouldnt just outright quit
and that is what needs to be changed we need to get more empire dwellers enthused about 00 we need to get them out there we need to make it so they can go out there and try to live there without being a 2000 alliance with 15k napped friends thats what they said they wanted with the new sov system thats what they completely ed up and thats what needs to be fixed not tack on dungeonsinspace mechanics to try to cover up that deficiency because thats what ideas like fog of war would effectively be trying to docorrect thats why im pushing you so hard on the fog of war idea because its giving me an impression that you might not be as good as you think you are at doing exactly that namely asking ccp hard questions about their ideas for 00 ill probably get tons of lol ur a goon eyerolls over this but i honestly want this game to get better and i firmly believe that for it to do so it needs to avoid these kinds of ideas
zimi think we can agree at this point that we both want to get to the same destination were just arguing about which route to that destination is the best onei would generally agree with you that some sort of multiple simultaneous objectives mechanic would be one way of addressing blobbing it would basically cut the blob into subblobs similarly addressing force projection so that deploying the capital fleet was strategically committing is worthy of considerationhowever i would point out that cutting blobs into subblobs does not deal with the underlying gamemechanic reasons why blobs happen in the first place it merely delays the problem for a while as the number of players increases which we all hope it will and as nullsec population increases which it will if nullsec is made more attractive which both of us want the total size of a fleet and thus of the subblobs will again creep up into the danger zoneso in the longer term the issue of blobs still has to be addressed  and this has always been the point i was trying to makewhether this is best done by addressing godseyeview issues by fogofwar or in some other way or by some other mechanic remains to be seen clearly whatever mechanic is chosen has to be computationally feasible within the limitations of the eve architecture and fun to playwith respect to refactoring for better scaling team gridlock is working on this the io serialization was one result of this effortfinally whatever you think of any individual idea i might have i hope that you recognize that i am usually thinking critically when i make them starting by attempting to define the real highlevel issue i will admit to a weakness for outofthebox thinking some would say out of the building that contains the room that contains the box but while that means that many things i come up with may turn out to be deadends the discussions that they stimulate like this one are often very useful in unexpected waysi am a firm believer in sturgeons law 95 of everything is crap and do not labor under the illusion that i am exempt from it but at the same time i do have a 30year track record of crapping out the occasional lump of solid gold
thank you again to everyone who is filling my inbox and casting their votes please make sure to direct everyone you can to massivelys eve online csm 6 candidate roundup this is an excellent article where you can learn quite a bit about who is running and why
if you dont vote for draco a goat will go to your house and eat all of your turnips
you got my vote because i believe you represent best the industry minoritygood luck
thanks to everyone that has offered support if you havent voted be sure to realize that forum activity and votes are not the same thing miners carebears industrialist solo players small corps and folks that live in high or low sec you have a csm candidate that will represent youvote issler dainze for csm
issler has been to csm before and is my voice for the way i like to play eve which is a desire to turn gameplay into isk profit a vote for issler is one for better profit from what you do no matter what you do erm that make sense
i prefer someone who isnt still trying to get a little notoriety by making a mole hill out of a nonevent and cant seem to stop themselves from making disparaging remarks six months latersix months later and youre still making sour little remarks surely there is someone with a better agenda than this how about ripard teg trebor daedoow or mike azariahwindjammer
sour remarks not seeing any in the thread but thanks for the bump commenting on some funny drama in previous csms maybeanyway again i really appreciate the in game support im getting i remain committed to supporting the majority of eve the miners the industrialists the small corporations and of course will try and get ccp to show low sec the luvin it has needed for yearsissler dainzevoice of reason csm candidate
agreed  im not seeing any sour comments here and issler has always been positive and supportive with any problems or concerns ive ever had in the past good luck issler  and i think we need at least one lady csm youve got my vote
with all these trolls out there i like to be sure i convey my ideas without misunderstanding its sad that it makes me a bit verbose indeed but who cares  if someone has a very short attention span he will never get to this thread anyway the eve forums being what they are they will cast their csm vote basing upon the messages displayed on the vote pagethank you for the information i did not know some of these things in short whatever my role is in the next csm ill do what i can for that policy to be continued so expect to hear my annoying accent in some audio meetings even if im not a fulltime member will you accept a haiku  i need my votes im not a returning candidate like some of us here
you could set up some alchemy pos to create tech roc that might win you some votes ed except you cant make r32s through alchemy oh well no nc votes for you

your paymaster mittens is hardly going to be delighted that youre bumping this pr disaster of a thread bet youre kicking yourself that it cost him more to bribe the eve news 24 website for an official endorsement than your own impartial eve tribune website im willing to bet he only paid you about 200m for that
the purestrain rageposts in reaction to a thread not particularly relevant to me personally are a good sign for my csm run i thinkif you werent scared you kids wouldnt be this desperate to flail about so 
so bushels then
all the poop flinging and dummy spitting going on in this thread show just how much csm needs rational clear headed candidates voted in just like me
this is now a widot thread
op minus his comments since who really cares what mittani has to say anyway did yet again another lets post something for no reasonvuk lau didnt even run for csm this term but to say he resigned is pretty funny since he only started whining about csm  ccp after his term was over anyway like a little baby hahaas for mittani being in well that was obvious no one for a second thought you wouldnt get in the sheeps will follow you as long as you have your title the contradiction in every mittani thread just shows how stupid goons are agreeing just because its the mittani careless of the fact that mittani hasnt been consistent about anything he has said since he started his lets obsess about molle campaignfinnagain zero  yeah still ignoring your poststhis thread is almost as funny as those 1 day alts spamming my mailbox with hahah you got rejected from csm which is funny since i never applied nor had the time to commit to something like that anywaycoming soonmittens  the hand that rocked the cradlea documentary about how mittani rps sarah palin in game and at the csm meetings which resulted in daily whines about how supercarriers were underpowered and how jump bridges needed a buffthankfully ccp wont give a  what he has to say anyway
ccp has already threatened to sue him for what he had to say in the past
yup im sure ccp will make a fortune out of suing people in a different country with no assets or income outside rmt all because they said words
hey hey finn finn im not listening to you can you hear me i said im totally ignoring you finn did you hear me hey im ignoring youby the way speaking of your obvious trolling found a cite yet to prove that the nc only had 20 titans and about 8 motherships among all their member alliances how about proof that any single nc supercapital pilot had their loss removed and somehow also removed from hostile boards go figure how about a cite to show that razor has set aaa and atlasdot blue no yeah
still not caring
i think we can all agree that all forums everywhere will be better off when kalle demos stops posting foreveralso if this were a mittanirun conspiracy vuk would have gone to fanfest and loudly denounced ccp gms live on evetv with his pecker out
hell if it was a mittspicracy vuk would have endorsed mittens as the only hope for eve
no honor in resigningsorry but if you felt strongly enough about the issue you should have championed it as long as you can by resigning you only remove the only voice fighting against it its kinda how certain politicians fled a state recently to avoid voting and then were upset because votes were held why they were derelict in their dutyreimbursement has been inconsistent for years we all know that it largely depended on who got your case whether or not youd get reimbursed while we may not agree with the stated reimbursement policy at least it is there for all of us to see now which is better than what we had beforewe all know the servers cant handle thousands in a system yet everyone keeps sending thousands into them a gentlemens agreement not to send more than 300 on each side into a fight would probably help more than anything ccp can do this doesnt mean you couldnt have reinforcements next door to replace losses lag is a problem im not going to deny that it was better prior to dominion which means the problem most likely lies in the dominion code however it can never be completely eliminated as our technology level isnt high enough to do so
what bang some guy didnt get preferential treatment from the gm department like the important internet politician he thinks he is so he threw a sissy fit and resigned when his turn is over anyway
so vuk lau loses a titan and tries to use his csm position to get ccp to give it back i am not surprised by this quitting the csm in a temper tantrum is also not surprisingyou got what you deserved vuk you have been the biggest opposition to fixing 00 and pushed for it to remain the same stale and stagnant ultra power block  it has been for a long time nowthe funny thing about all this the fact that the csm alternate that will take your place will easily be more active in the last two weeks of the term than you have been for the entire term lets face it you will not be missed hell you were never really there to begin withif ccp decides to removenerf jump bridges you going to quit the game too
good riddance if vuks post is representative of his ability to communicate just how valuable could he have been ive little patience for quitters especially when there was so little time left in his tenurei dont much care for the mittani but i dont really see how he benefits from vuk resigningspeaking solely for myself petitions are usually met with courtesy and some attempt at reasonable resolution no not all gms are created equal and this is why ccp put in the ability to escalate a situation to a higher more senior gm andor review board ive only had to escalate a petition once and the situation was quickly taken care of when i did i havent experienced any worse customer support from the gms than i have from any other customer support team other people are obviously having issues but ive never seen a company that didnt have a similar situationthe csm has largely disappointed me as it has others however csm5 did make some serious contributions to the game of eve i dont agree with everything they did and didnt do but some of the things they did were absolutely for the improvement of the game and were an invaluable platform for feedback to ccpccp has disappointed me as well over the years however they do seem to be growing up a bit and have pleasantly surprised me of late am i in love with all their decisions heck no but they do show signs of improvementseems like vuk had himself a little hissy fit and thats just about it i doubt it will have any sort of lasting effect more likely people will forget about this in a couple monthswindjammer

this coming from the guy whose platform is basically i promise to glare meanly at mittens  co and be as obstructionist as possible simply to screw over those dumb goonies while enjoying my free trip to iceland hey guys myyyyy turbo diesel estate sportscar
for those of you unable to read let me splain it to youhes not going zomg i dint get preferential treatment im quittinghes resigning because the gms as a whole tend towards incompetence and very obvious bias and all attempts to get the issue addressed fell on predictably deaf ears meaning the only way to raise awareness of the problem was through a big public gestureccp csm candidates listen up the players are speaking gm incompetence institutionalized bias unfair reimbursement policies ridiculous nerfs to 00 unwillingness to accept player input these are things that concern us
you mean like all those nc super capital ships that died and were respawned after down time and ccp let them keep themstill worried jump bridges will be nerfed and the entire nc power block will collapse over night and you will be subjected to having to put forth effort into living there i welcome the idea of logistics and power projection that requires effort againoh yeah those ideas were brought up by the player base and ccp is listened vuk is just hoping to pull a im resigning because of microtransaction on remap bit like tamber did
the bias has existed as long as ive played the devs are themselves biased always have been it exists in every game it happens because most of the gm pool is always taken from the player pool as such they have friends and inevitably will be more lenient towards friends than foes i think thats why ccp published for the first time a reembursement policy since ive been here they wanted to work on improving what would happen we may not like what it says but it is progress at least we all know where we stand now and that works to remove bias at the same time it removes the wiggle room gms used in the past in a way vuk was successful just not in the way he wantedquitting something because you are not getting the result you want in the timeframe you want is not heroic it only silences the voice that might could have continued the fight you remove a voice that could have brought these issues up at fanfest instead he cops out and quits
csm drama best drama o
why are people even bringing up vuks lost titan like it means anything you do realize he is the leader of one of the richest alliancescoalitions in the game his personal lost titan really doesnt mean  however it is apparent that ccps attitude towards a lot of issues has been at a steady decline for quite sometime
you summed it up right there ccp didnt bend to his im the nc leader and on the csm so no changes to 00 to keep it boring and all nc ships are to be respawned after down time for us if we lose anyccp wont autoreimburse nc ships and wants to nerf logistics and power projection for super coalition and he quits like a little emo 
try reading the op a little harder mabye you could gain some insite as to why he quit the csm until then stop spurging it makes my eyes bleed
re vuk more like a tempest in a teapot no one really cares with only two weeks or so left in our term if he really wants to demonstrate how ed off he is he should just cancel all his accounts and quit evealso the incarna open letter is merely a public record of csm5s concerns as i stated in the letters thread there has been no drama and none expected there has been zero response to the letter from ccp and quite frankly given the precedent they have established related to lack of communication with csm about incarna none expected
what i read was he was trying to help some of his friends with some petitions and it is not going his way so he gave up and quit does he use his csm influence to try and help nonblues with their petitionsalso your posting is some of the worst

1 mynxee best csm wdiedra vaal2 vuk quit thats what it looks like if he really wanted to push his agenda he would have made ccp pay his way to iceland then made a real stink in every meeting that he could get into far as i can see all he did was quit but points for giving the alternate a couple weeks notice3 mittens no one doubts hes going to get into the csm because of his name and his affiliations however because of who he is super serious internets spacelawyer  he will be no more effective than jade constantine was entirely because hes such a divisive figure and possibly even less effectiveno one will trust what he has to say because hes said so many times that hes a lying manipulative bastard re lawyer re the op ive done about a half dozen petitions got fast turn around on the important ones decent service on the rest vov
he probably couldnt get off from work to go to ff and decided to use the opportunity for grand standing csm5 is all but wrapped up so he loses nothing and gains points with whomever is gullible enough or do not follow politics in general guess this constitutes the csm version of emoragequit which is in all honesty what i have come to expect from the memememe crowd living in null currently
i completely understand where vuk was coming fromi had a petition in once where a pos magically warped to another moon that already had a pos so there was a pos inside of a pos the modules on the pos that moved remained at the old placeyou couldnt change settings on either pos because they were in each others pos bubbles so tearing it down wasnt an optionit took three weeks to resolve the situation it was eventually solved by a gm manning the stuck queue who just destroyed one pos and recreated it thats all we wanted it took another week after that for the original gm to reply with sorry we cant reimburse you for the lost minerals you would have mined lulz which we expected anywaythis is just the most flagrant example of terrible gm petitions ive had plenty of petitions responded to with canned responses because they werent read completely or at all i dont expect 1 hour turn arounds on petitions but a little competency and some timeliness or responses claiming to be working on the issue would be a massive improvementbesides its not like im petitioning hay my toonie got blown up in his mommie by smarties and i lost a bunch of iskies can i hav it bak plzzz mr gm sirrrrrrrr
do you have any idea how much effort it takes to live in nullsec now how much work it takes to import materials construct ships distribute ships to market hubs how much of a pain in the ass it is to get fleets formed up and moving to their destination power projection wont really be negatively impacted but the lives of individual players will be made about 10 times harder than they need to bethose ideas were brought up by goty hisec mission runners in terrible 8 member corps much like yourself
i have written a blog post with my comments on this
extri posters remind me a lot of bob posters their arguments all amount to a smug declaration that they and only they know the right way to play eve online followed by demands that anyone elses way of playing be removed asap for the good of the gamei suppose that explains why such personalities constantly clashed and resulted in like seven alliance cascadesrespawns
as opposed to you claiming that you and only you know the right way to run the csm followed by assertions that you should be chairman for the good of the game
obvious bias is obvious brave sir robin for those who didnt know 
glass houses and all
just to be clear  im not 100 sure that we can take down any more macros than ccp already is currently what i know we could see is some transparency from ccp to show how much they are actually doing about it and from there whether they could be doing more
maybe you should fight the macros in your own coalition firstsurely you dont expect anyone to believe nc is against botting do youespecially when nc have an open policy on botting and do it just as much as drf
kalle thank you for gracing my campaign thread with your presenceim unclear however exactly what youre trying to show here all i see in those links are a few systems with some npc kills  some with as many as almost 7k rarely thoughnumbers of npc kills does not prove macro use with an upgraded system and running anomolies in 40 minutes easily achievable particularly in pairssmall groups you can get over 7k npc kills in a 24 hour period 2 havens  2 sanctums per system 50 npcs per anom 40 mins per anom 235 hrday and thats not counting belts or complexeshidden belts etc so what the numbers you are showing proves that the nc might just be full of carebears stop the pressesgiven your apparent inability to distinguish heavy ratting from macro use im glad that its not you that is leading the campaign against macrosto be quite frank i dont care whether youre nc drf caaaserol empire whatever  if youre using macros youre cheating its that simple
i expected your kind of bull so i will just ask anyone who clicks those links to just put two and two together just by looking and comparing stats on jumps  npc killsnot to mention the fact most nc and other alliances alliances are open on their botting issues dont you think you should deal with your internal botting issues before focusing on the rest of eden after allnext up we will have vuk lau give his i want to end number warfare speech
how are those numberscalculations bull were they out in any way please elaborate on thatare you also suggesting that people who heavily rat in a system jump around a lot rather than parking up in their pos when theyre done i do wonder how much grasp you have on life in nullsec if youre suggesting that those numbers conclusively mean anything regarding macro useand would you like to actually provide some reference as to who made that offhanded comment that you quoted or did you just make it up it does seem to suggest that somebody thinks somebody else does something with bots there is a big difference between offhanded comments and proofconfessionmy message still remains the same  im for removal of all macro use regardless of who for the benefit of active players
eve needs more magical fairies  with bells and sparkly dust to turn missiles into flowers thanks for the new campaign platformas for bridges i was in a 40ish pilot gang trying to engage two 35ish and 50ish pilot gangs on seperate occasions who were roaming through our turf and without bridges we would have been mucking around for ages trying to engage them as it happened we got a couple of good fights fairly quickly so bridges help to facilitate small and medium gang warfare and who doesnt love thatsure that extra mobility helps the home team and not the invaders but if youre paying the sov bill and maintaining all the infrastructure its fairly reasonable to have some advantageone thing with jump bridges vs titan bridges is that they are fixed from one point to another whereas titans can bridge all over the place with just one pilot for a cyno so titan bridges have a whole lot of flexibility and can be used dynamically where jump bridges are pretty static meaning the invaders can find out where they are and account for themand just to clarify ive used both jump bridges and titan bridges and also black ops bridges  lots of funedit spelling and grammar
removal is questionable balancing is not i would struggle to find a single military strategist that would not consider logistics as one of the most important issues for a military both in their effects on maneuvers and on their economic effectsjump bridges allow nearly infinite logistical capabilities of the defending forces this leads to the ability to turtle which leads to strategic sov warfare being boring and well not strategicthen theres the economic factor null sec is already the single most profitable realm in eve the ridiculous ease with which materials can be moved in and out of null sec with jump bridges means that the strength is only that much more intense this means that null sec goods end up having high sec liquidity for even the most minimally organized alliancessince eve is a total war system the economics of an alliance are directly tied to the military strength of the alliance this means that the economic logistical strength is yet another logistical defensive strengthtldr jump bridges lead to excessive defensive strength
no jumpbridges do give a slight defensive bonus but the majority of jb usage is mostly nonmilitarysov warfare is made boring mostly by the ludicrously awful sov system combined with supercarriers we can theoretically keep up to 6 separate systems under siege more or less completely safe by stuffing them choc full of supercarrierstitans and rotating them one system pr dayi think youll find that most material is moved not via jbs but via jfs and mostly on the way from jita not toagain no
i call your magical fairies and raise you one space kitten
please elaborate how do jump bridges provide infinite logistics and how do you mean they provide the ability to turtleadditional please add the length of time you served usingdepending on themim afraid i agree with goonie here most everyone i know uses a carrier or jf to move the 00 spoils this is usually due to the fact that jbs can not provide any level of save transport through low sec or protect from gate camps where jumping a carrierjf right to a station does so i dont think this is a valid point in the overall grand picture
bump oa vote for me is a vote for sanity
you fail to see the point thereim not antipowerbloc as a playstyle in evei want to oppose to powerblocs in their wish to have full power in the csm to keep eve easy for themand yes i do think smaller groups of people should be able able to disrupt powerbloc lives in a way or anotherjust like a 10 men corp can really annoy a 100 men corps in high sec with a war  its the only way to bring some risk to them thats the reason why i consider myself antipowerbloc i think they have too much gamebreaking priviledges right now and someone need to voice that concern in csmno i have nothing against powerbloc players they have the right to live i dont want powerblocs to disappear either i just want some balance new wars in 00 and new kinds of guerilla wars no more locked stronghold full of tamed npc and belts ressources in wild areas again a new possibility for smaller alliances to live in 00 whithout being a powerbloc slave will that kill powerblocs  i doubt that
hey guyslast year we did a massive csm candidate roundup article at massively where we collected together all the links and information on each candidate and put them all in one place a spike in the voting graph for the days following the article suggested that as much as 10 of the total votes may have been due to our roundup candidates also reported large spikes in the number of hits to their campaign websites and videos the article clearly had a big impact on voting so this year weve done it again in an effort to get people votingmassivelys eve online csm 6 candidate roundupas with last year the article has a full listing of all candidates in the running with a short researched paragraph on each of their goals and what platform theyre running on next to each candidate is their picture and links to any relevant campaign resources like a campaign website forum thread debates interviews or videos all the info on them is there all in one place so you dont have to hunt around for details or endure information overload candidates are divided into three sections  members of previous csms and exccp employees new candidates or those who havent been previously elected who are running active campaigns and a few relatively unknown pilots that didnt make much of an effort to run a campaignit was pointed out last year that this order might favour previous csm candidates but figures from massively showed that around 90 of people who visited the first page of the article also went on to read the list of new candidates it seems people really do want to know what all their options are before making a decision not many readers went on to view the final page of players who didnt make much of an effort in their campaign but thats to be expected for many of these players i couldnt find much concrete information beyond a vague forum thread or lazy blog post some of them have made absolutely no effort to convince us of why we should vote for themalthough there are only four days left in the voting i encourage you to point out any mistakes additional information or relevant links such as new interviews you find perhaps someone in the list of relative unknowns has a detailed campaign website debate or interview ive overlooked that would put them into the list of new campaigners or maybe the summary ive written up of someones position isnt entirely accurate and could do with some ammendment whatever the issue is please let me know and ill get right on it as long as you guys supply any new info that comes to light ill keep the article up to date as a comprehensive resource leading up to the votings closing on march 23rd feel free also to submit new information links and corrections via this threadmassively has always been a big supporter of the csm providing coverage of the csm summit and interviews with csm members to put them in a more public arena for those still hesitant to vote last weeks eve evolved was also dedicated entirely to convincing people that their votes really do count if you know anyone who doesnt think their vote will count maybe one of these articles will change their mind
neat next term earlier timing independant and industry media are becoming ever more important to this emerging dynamic called eve please visit your user settings to reenable imagesseleenes blog  trebors blog
i had forgotten just how much work it took to produce this roundup last year and so started a few days late next term it should be much earlier but hopefully this term it will help indecisive stragglers to select a candidate
csm and everything around it including coverage like this is a hell of a lot of work at least for those who want to do the right things right so no worries its nice to see this maybe next term there will even be options for creating synergy between player and other media along the wayplease visit your user settings to reenable images
of course people should vote trebor seleene and ripard and then meissa and roc if those wont do nice roundup i lold at your ratherbluntcomments about those who appear to have thrown their hats in the ring on a whim and with no plan or platform you tell em nyphur
is it me or was draco not on that list
nice thats a fairly accurate summary of my campaign messagetheres a lot of detail missing in a brief lineup like this so i thoroughly recommend people look at candidates a bit closer toothanks for putting this together
woops ignore
yeah looks like a pretty good summary i dont think you should have lumped former ccp devs with the returning csm though
this was primarily a decision made based on the numbers as there were much fewer returning csm members this year since exemployees will have the same experience in dealing with ccp directly if not more it made much more sense to put them alongside excsm than to put them in any other category
someone finally noticed i got the csm 5 perfect attendance award
some people have jobs and a life that interferes with the meetings but its definately something that needs to be pointed out and its a good indication of your level of dedication i do not doubt that everyone would have assumed that youd attended every one
very nice round up i learned a few things about my competition  possible future council members
nice article you made there  it brought me some extra info on some of the other candidates and allowed me to update my dream list of who id like to share the seats withalso way to burn some of the relatively unknown there ouch for em
one thing nyphur the article states several exccp employees have signed up to the councilonly two not several
that image  saw it on shc and it still looks like a poster foragainst spouse abuse poor guy looks completely whipped by his dominatrix wife right down to the ever so sad face
just goes to show you i wasnt kidding when i said i was running for reelection because i had not yet plumbed the depths of my own masochism and i will point out that my wife thought that this movie that animeigo released was charming
thanks for the supportissler
only a few days left on the csm elections thank you if you have already voted for me and another thank you for all the people who have mailed me over the past few weeks i really have had a lot more mails than i expected to get but all have been answered and your ideas taken downjust because the election is coming to an end doesnt mean you need to stop mailing me please continue with your questions and ideas for the game
my apologiesi thought it would not be discovered but you sir have singlehandledly uncovered what could possibly be the biggest alt  csm conspiracy of all times i must hand it to you my alt posting disguise was no match for your superior power of deduction 1010 sir good fight and jolly nice neck beard you are sporting today
until ive exhausted my means of internal protest im not ready to bring a case to the forums
who wouldnt support this
i think the ccp devs in general have an extreme prejudice against drones because of the lag they have caused moreso in the past but the prejudice remains so whenever they see anything about improving them in any fashion it makes them immediately recoil they want to discourage drone use as much as possible to cut down on the perceived lag threatthe first step for this drone improvement and any other will be to convince the devs that drones are not evil incarnatethey are part of eve and as such need to treated with the time and support they and their users deserve as part of the eve community
objection if we did something to improve drones that would disproportionately benefit gallante and as we all know it is vital to the ongoing development of eve that they should get a boot to the face at all times
i wouldnt call an 80 to 150 price difference nothing it may be chump change to us but the price differentiation is significant
maller to proph amazing buffer capabilityomen to harby exelent gankage at rangethis is the thinking
being flashy is not comfortable in long term people get big advantage being able to aggress you anywhere without being fired by sentries themselves ie they can just aggress you with rifters at the gate this docking youre talking about is somewhat meaningless theres docking delay for everyone aggressing if something needs adjustment its that one
that would also fulfill the rebalancing quite nicely good idea thanks
it would be nice if fofs didnt target members of your own fleet who happen to be flagged for aggression towards another fleetalso how about a system for setting the default target for all fof missiles fired by a fleet eg following the fcs target broadcasts or the closest ships picked out by designated fleet target painters
supported in principle fof missiles could use some improvement of some sortim unsure about the present proposal though
yeah that is beyond annoying lolthat is a good idea i will add that to the op thanks
well thats awfully rude last i checked this was an open forum for discussing game fixes we are all by definition amateurs herethe attitude isnt appreciated however
absolutely supported flying a dramiel feels like cheating and dying to dramiels makes you feel like the other guy is cheatingthe first concern you have when you fit a frigate out these days is how can i specialize this fit to kill a dramiel firstly because there are so goddamn many of them out there and secondly because you have to specialize to kill them this shouldnt be the casehit it with the nerfbat
i know this has been a feature for a while but wtfi spend all my time my isk to train for supers and titans then find i need another decent char to play the game normally if i want to fly a supertitan otherwise its visible in a pos for all to see and shoot so your forcing me to have 2 accounts or but another one so i can pvp whilst my other char is stuck in a ship in a pos are you for real jeez what a  takelet superstitans dock and if ppl post no then better give a damn good reason why not cos this is srant over
oh noes supercaps are inconvenient we should make them like normal ships so there are more of them
death to supercapsdeathtothem
in all fairness the idea behind supercapitals and capitals in general is that they are not supposed to be solo ships and require logistical help from others to do things andor get around thus promoting teamwork people get around this by making a second account so they dont have to rely on teamwork to do stuffmoreover supercapitals were never meant to be costeffective or easy to use want ewar immunity and shiny firepower options pay through the nose and live with the idea that your ship will always be at risk ie you cant dock as those really the only limiting factors such ships haveedit not supported
the whole point to being stuck in a supercaptitan is to deter players from using them if you could dock a titan everybody and there mother would have one and the game would be flooded with them so nono docking for supercaps
they are not supposed to be a easy they should be a pain in the arsethey should not be able to dock in any stationyou dont need a second pvp pilot you need a holding toon a secondary accountalt that has the skills to sit in it and log off in so you can use your main toon for other pvp or yea get another pvp toon works too now one thing im not opposed to is an upgrade to a sov held system that would allow supers maybe just supercarriers to dock in player owned stations def not low secnpc stations even this idea would have to be thought through to make sure it doesnt make them too convenient
im sorry to hear that you dont have any friends and have to play with yourself
not supported
there are really far too many inactive dead corps in game and there should be a way to clear them out and make way for new ones tickers for example are very nearly exhausted with limited options and few choices remaining how many 5 year old 1 man corps are out there lotssupported if a flat rate fee is charged such as 15 million isk per month something inconsequential to established active corps and low enough to make new player corps still viable
it is a fact that what players enjoy a lot in video games is personnalization of their things it is for sure that in eve lot of people would enjoy personnalizing their ship with their own or proposed decoration and painting it would be great that a corporation would impose to their corp member to have a logo on their ship it would be great that a corporation will suggest main colors for the corp members ships or would notwe are really waiting for such thing lets give us a chance to personnalize our ships one way or another thank you for listening my ask
i think this would be a great idea there is no way possible that we could make our own skins not just because of the lag and bandwidth issue but content just look at the most common type of creations that were made in spore various parts of the human anatomy but if there was a giant predetermined set of skins patterns and colors to choose from it could easily be implemented with hardly a touch of lag if at all lets say that each model had 10 skins 20 patterns per skin and 3 color options out of say 10 colors the game already loads up models once they enter the grid so lets take a drake for example attached to that drake would be the details of its skin pattern and colors it would really be no different perhaps less so than typing a message into local chat one person sending a message to 20 30 50 1500 people it could be formated thus 514376 5th skin 14th pattern primary color 3 secondary color 7 tertiary color 6 thats less resources than it takes to transmit all those thinly veiled scam offers in jita
agreed  they could create kind of decoration fitting 
i say lets wait and see how the game handles loading up several hundred people in jita 44 station when incarna releasesthen lets talk about ship skinsi say this for one reasonload timeswhen incarna releases we are gonna see how the system handles loading so many different skins costumes and whatnot if it can handle that then it would likely be able to handle custom skins on ships i would also only support the idea if the personalized skins are something that can be turned on and off that way when i get into that large fleet battle i can shut them off and not worry about the extra lag time and load on my pc it would causeotherwiseyeahnot a new ideabeen something players have been crying about for some time now

great idea 1
thats a terrific idea dude
supported of course good idea
damn it  what is it  its look great  i want it  
awesome if again players could choose to deactivate this feature serious also gets a cookie
one of the most commonly argued points in eve is ship fitting and overall effectiveness of design everyone has a complaint or praise available in reference to one design or another myrmidon drake rifter or raven they will have something to say about all of themheres my issue i find the design of various ship types and fitting requirements offer little or no room for realistic fitting and cost effective design sure one ship or another theyll all get the job done and yes provided you have a fleet you can utilize all available slots to make a ship truly effective for a given task in accordance with its intended purpose you can find the breakdown of my idea in the features and ideas discussion forum
supported of course though i believe it needs much more thought and could use some additional input and fine tuning this would take some serious time and thought with a great deal of rebalancing and reprogramming required i think in the end however it would make for a better eve
that would raise eve to the level of a modern space sim i dont think ccp is up to the task
drakes are not overpowered fitting one with a half decent tank while using point andor web means you cant fit decent dps and you rarely have room for anything else theyre a chunky awkward ship thats illfitting with little purpose thats why there are only 23 recommended fits for a drake because the rest are crap if you ever flew one and tried to solo pvp youd know they fair no better than anything else t1we dont need ships to be nerfed to balance eve theyve already been nerfed enough now everything requires squeaky fittings that leave slots empty and the ship is generally still underpowered and easily ganked anyone who flies solo in anything but a cov ops is easily ganked to put that in perspective you just cant fit a ship to survive as you sacrifice the ability to achieve the goalfit for tank and lose the ability to apply dpsfit for dps and lose your ability to tankfit for tackle and lose your ability to tank or dpseve is balanced so pilots require other pilots to attempt any sort of pvp or succeed in it there is no versatile ship platform and soloing is out of the questioni say we add one mid and one low slot to every ship available in the game then make sure anything above destroyer has more than 4 weapons available sure scorpion has ewar but you need every midslot to ecm a tempest effectively which means you have a 4 slot armor tank and cant apply bonuses to your ecm i flew a scorpion with a full passive tank and got taken down in about 45 seconds by a lowsec gang it was just a test of course but it was kind of pathetic how poorly it fared for reference i have almost max shield skills and max capacitor skillsi also proved to myself that ecm burst modules were completely useless i got ecmd out neuted completely in less than 10 seconds didnt have range or targeting to apply nos and had no dps it was a short battle and not much of oneno more nerfing
youre doing it wrong cassus temon sorry but i thought i had to say it give your minge a wipe and learn how to fit your ships drakes are exceptional ships because of their excellent bonuses and weapon systems i dont want and most other people do not want to nerf the ship almost all of us can see that the problem lies with guided missile rangeham drake570 dps kin 475 all others before overload out to 20km778k ehp before implants overloaded invuls and fleet bonusestackle point and webmwdand a small nos to keep those invuls alive when youre getting neutedhml drake520 dps with t2 scourge 434 with t2 others before overload out to 75km75k ehp before implants overloaded invuls and fleet bonusestackle pointtarget painter it does help with those t2 heavy missiles a lot but optional slot for something elsemwdmedium neut if you need it or if youre a fanny fit a nosthese are both solo fits that will cause your enemies a lot of grief if you get ganked solo thats just eve for you not much solo stuff happens in eve any more and there is no such thing as a fair fightthe fact a missile boat can get over 75km range and keep its mwdtackletank and most of its dps is the problemno other weapon system can compete
sniper mid guns get 100 km and snipe small targets missiles cant damage take long time to project hits for almost no damage on smaller faster targets regardless of lack of transversal lacking tracking mod but rather have to use valuable rig slots on two separate tracking rigs rigor and flare catalysts if you want short range use hams long range weapons are supposed to have long range nothing wrong with it just because you got killed by a drake blob doesnt mean nerf you buff me is warranted
i have to agree with goose heavy missile range isnt an issue do you have problems with caracals nighthawks or sacrilige nopethe problem with the drake is its tier 2 so get a hp bonus and on top of that gets a resist bonus making it a huge brick in fights with low numbers you may have problems getting over the shield regen hump never mind the huge number of hit points and with larger numbers drake blobs the resist bonus basically gives a 33 remote shield rep boost along with large amount of time the buffer gives the logis to lock and save the primary similar problem with hellcat fleets notice abaddon  top tier with resisti dont think the drake needs a nerf just change the resist bonus to a rof bonus and remove a launcher works out less hp and alpha but more damage for a more balanced and importantly easier too kill drake
gooseseriously you think guided missiles with a target painter are inferior to turrets at applying damage to small targetsare you ed just go into eft and create a new dps graph and see the difference between artiesfailgunsbeams vs hmlsoh yeah
undock once in a while tps suffer heavy stacking paint something very small and its still very small not to mention speed is also a big factor flare not just sig if youve actually shot at interceptors youll know that missiles do no dps after long chase while guns sometimes score devastating volleys at long range missile dps are poor to begin with and the eft warrioring kinetic dps rarely translate well on anything smaller than a stationary bs and dont somehow has a kinetic hole whinning about tank is one thing but whining about a drakes dps elicits no sympathy
making ships unprobable and offgrid boosting are not good game mechanics just another stupid game mechanic ccp has failed to fix or they just do not care

not a bad starting point i think t3 needs more attention overall but drons are not a bad place to look with the right details i would support t3 drones yes
only if i can launch drones that loot and salvage distant wrecks for me
do want
noyou really need to look into back story about anoikis and rogue drones to understand why this is a really bad idea
i completely agree especially the last part the one box i have a major issue with is the status box that tells you the countdown cycle of the enemy that is using ewar on you it is stuck in a spot that i use for my local chati can see it but it is annoyingly hard to see and not able to be moved it seems please fix
you dont agree on my point of view and this is totally ok however i would like to comment on some of your argumentsive moved my freighter through 00 like 2 weeks ago its not a big deal in high sec while flying on autopilot my freigher was scanned a couple of times and i am sure that it would have been ganked if i have had valuable cargo in 00 you have intel that warns you plus jb are quite safe you have no such things in highsecwhy should i rat in 00 without galaring on intel however before i moved in 00 i did missions in amarr space there were certain alliances who droped by for suicide ganking multibillion ships and there is no way for you to know that they are coming for you while in 00 you know that there is a hostile gang incoming like 10 minutes before they actually arrivehonestly ive seen several scs ratting while hostiles in local and we have successfully ganked some of them i am quite sure that ther will be enough sc pilots traveling without a scout at all
my main has about 700 kills in 00 i certainly dont lack experience
i read the whole thingit is a horrible idea anybody with a brain can figure out whynot supported
you said it yourself all you need to do to avoid ganks in hisec is for the most part just avoid having too valuable cargo and the only reason there isnt an intel network for hisec is because there is absolutely no need for onebut lets compare a freighter in hisec vs 00hisec load up cargo set a destination undock press autopilot make dinner dock up 2 hours later job done00 load up cargo set a destination check intel check local check intel check intel check intel undock hope no blue is awoxing warp off after an eternity check intel jump into the next system hope no blue is awoxing there warp off after an eternity wait an eternity for the freighter to warp to the next gate check intel check intel jump through hope no blue is awoxing warp off after an eternity wait an eternity for the freighter to warp to the next gate  should i go onin 00 you get ganked just for being there in hisec you have to be a pretty valuable target to even be considered ganked yeah no difference thereagain in hisec l4s you have to be pretty valuable to be ganked whereas in 00 youll get ganked just for being there this increases the amount of work you have to do and it forces you to glare at intel this means that unless you find mining or ratting extremely fascinating then hisecll probably be a lot better wrt iskhour and iskriskface it no matter how much of a sea of blues there is 00 inherently has more of a risk than hisecyes thats gots using scs to rat in its not sc pilots travelling to a combat area theres a huge difference there sc pilots travelling to a combat area tend to be  ever so slightly more on guard than some idiot using an sc to rat inso you get kills in 00 bravo how much time have you spent owning space how much time have you spent doing logistics in 00 how much time have you spent in a capital ship

this is how it should bei simply ask a corpmate to scout he flies to jbs and tells me whether they are camped then i fly to jb jump and warp to the next jb and so onif there is a big group of reds in system i simply dont jump where is the risk or challenge that my brain turns off and i jump even though i know that i get gankedin highsec i can only escape a gank with luck because someone was kind enough to warn everyone in localtheoretically you are right however in practice you have to be brain afk or stupid to get ganked in 00 besides the enemy has a blue spy who tackels you while in highsec you can never be sure that you wont get ganked at the next gate i kind of doubt that a titan takes like one minute to align and only 15au warp speed he is an easy target for subcaps or a covert ops fleet that cynos in if he travels without a proper support fleet besides that fleets with titans would be as fast as the slowest ship in the fleet force projection will become quite pain in the assso you would have to devide your fleet in order to defend all bordersi still dont get why this matters 1 like 4 5 months2 i do the logistics only occasionally we have one guy who handels the logistics for the entire corp mostly alone it is too easy3 0
edit i went through and re read your idea just to make sureevery single idea you have is built on a belief that is totally wrong about current game mechanics and things you can and cant doyour gigantic wall of text might try to mask all those error but they are there and before you say whats wrong with them just know that my answer is everything and the points are too numerous to take individual issue withtldryou dont know a damn thing about sov warfare or whats useful and whats not
youre not understanding the meaning of the word risk are youyou wont get ganked in a freighter in hisec unless your content is worth more than oh i dunno 500m 750m the rest of the time you can just afk autopilot around in 00 you have to constantly pay attention to intel or have an alt warping around and checking for you or have a corpmate check for you or have an alliance mate check for you why because theres more inherent risk how much clearer does it have to be spelled out for you it doesnt matter if you can use intel it still means theres more risk there you have to actively mitigate it and keep vigilant in hisec you donttrust me if hisec had been as ing dangerous as you seem to think it is nobody would be warping anywhere least of all without scouts as it is very few are because the risk doesnt merit the extra workso youve got 1 guy doing all logistics for your corp how many poses does that involve how many ihubs sbus tcus fuel for the poses modules for the poses fuel for the caps ammo for the caps warcaches near the front prefit ships for the members after each fight moving moongoo to empire to sellbasically it matters because from where im sitting youve got very little idea of how much work it is to keep up a largeish alliance in one or more regions and you certainly have no idea what the changes youre proposing actually will entail nor have you been in a war as anything other than another f1 f2 f3 guyquick edit spelling also hi grath hi5
the real john maynard keynes is spinning in his grave as he reads thisnot supported sorry
john maynard you have to understand something you are proposing a lot of things for sov and capitals neither of which you have much hands on experience wish to your own admission you are being told by people from razor goons and pl three alliances that are very heavy in 00 have a lot of logistics to deal with and understand both capital and sov warfare because its what we dothe other thing to note here is while we are actually not all friends but are enemies we do understand how things work its also interesting that all three alliances are very heavy into pvp meaning we are not trying to keep carebears safe pl is unquestionable one of the best alliances and skirmish fleet and capital pvp i personally like to think razor is quite good too and goons well they are goons love them or hate them they do what they do  we do this stuff all the time do you really think we are just saying this stuff to wind you upi dont think any of these groups will tell you 00 is easy risk free or free from some severe flaws and the root of your points do identify those flaws we are just saying your suggestions are wacky and will make things worse not better
hello to everybodytime went by skillpoints comes through and more and more materials want to get sortedmy tries with the search didnt went succesful so i wanted to ask if there shouldnt be an update for it perhaps with an skill to learn for like hangar logistics that you could use different tabs in the station containerssecond point is the saved fittings wich you arent able to fitt when the items are stored in containersand third  producing something should work from the active hangar or containeryeah  use the search in items  i heard about it but im not a friend of chaos in my hangar xdand if some dont like it he dont have to skill itjust an idea plzzzzz xdmay the sun always shine on youehrinat
i think it would be really cool eye candy but frankly cant see it serving any practical use most ppl have to turn even the most basic effects off just for normal pvp

we are down to the last couple of days i have heard from a bunch of folks both inside and outside wormhole space that i am their choice now is the time to get everyone out there to vote and make sure that the csm that is elected has the voice of as many folks as possible behind it
now isnt that ironic  dont ya think
thank you for the vote of confidenceand more importantly thanks for voting
no no no no no youre not getting what im sayingif ccp only does a focused specific nerf against jita alone it will change nothing the jita market will move into one of the immediate neighbor systems around jitaif they do taxes and stuff then it will hurt every hub and the hub will become the citadel because people will want to get onto the central market index without having to overcrowd one station and thus incur fees but the only way ccp will kill hubs entirely is to eliminate regional markets and make the market system universewideotherwise there will always be one place be it a station 44 a system jita or a region the forge or the citadel that is regarded as the central market by all the market actors
some of you are not getting it really what the hell is the problem with jita its over crowded sure so what sometimes you have to wait a few minutes to jump in so what if ccp does anything to nerf jita as already mentioned the trade hub will organically move on its own you will create a never ending cycle of nerfunerf in attempt to do what avoid crowds see a shink
if overcrowding is such a ing problem for you move to amarr the market there is perfectly adequate unless you are a high end trader who specifically needs the volume of trading that goes on in jitai have solved your problem please send me isk as i am a problem solver tia
you do not understandim not asking for a jitaspecific nerf but for a dynamical system which would make this kind of superhub uninterestinga dynamical taxe system which gets higher when the systemstation is overcrowded or have too much orders kind of like office rent right now will really make the hub system less interestingcitadel market might stay the main reference but if its market is spread in the whole region a lot less people will come and buy things there you dont want to wander through the whole region to put everything in your freighter the effet will still be a repartition from jitacitadel onto smaller hubsthe market would be a lot more complex people will have to think instead of just jita everything local small hubs will become a lot more interestingand the op wanted some rp answer  it makes perfect sens rpwise markets in big cities have more taxes than smaller local ones there is no center of the world marketwise buit lots of big hubs big cities with quite high taxes paris tokyo la ny whatever and your local market where everything is cheaper but you have less choiceintroduce some dynamic fees and youll have a market much more logical rp and economicallywise
jitas success explained
very nice graph and extremely interesting information overall i rather agree with everything you said but i think you missed somethingyou pointed out that people wanted the safest shortest routes but they also want the easiest and fastest ways to trade having to move to a group of distant systems jump in different ones depending on what you want to buy or sell its a painright now everything you have to do is dock jita 44just splitting jita market in two or 3 systems would already have a huge negative impact for lots of people who cant be bothered separating their loot or produced modules that and the taxes will make them consider their local market more and i really think with a good tweak you could have a more coherent market overall with some regional hubs of equal importance with rather high taxes and a very elaborated market like jita now but with less traffic to keep taxes lower and many smaller hubs with a simplier market but no taxes and better priceswould be a lot better rpwise in my opinion
what again are we trying to fix whats wrong with jita
so you are proposing that we roleplay an economy that defies the natural emergent behavior of economies behavior that stems from real psychological factors influencing the market actorswhy would we do dat
in real life broker fees and other taxes are driven by natural behaviours in eve thats not the case turning the market in what we know  jita as the center of everything the rest for people who dont want to travel either because it costs too much money or time or because of the riskdynamic taxes and broker fees would just be a mean to turn the market into something more realistic where travel timecost is not the only issue people facejita as it is pleases lots of people because its easy 00 alliances for instance who can just come to jita buy and sell everything without even having to think about market dynamics but id like eve economy to be more challenging
no on the contrary those are the only things which are fixed in a market and driven by policy rather then by the choices of the actors nowhere in your words have you proposed an actual fix youve just given the vague impression that youre butthurt over how things are im guessing youre either tired of getting suicided or tired of having to fly back and forth from whatever hovel youve chosen to squat in because nobody buys in your backwater region
keep calm we musnt live in the same world in mine there are fees on everything you buy and these fees change by a huge margin depending on the country you live in for instance taxes differ from a product to another depending on what the government decides all over europe gaz has extremely high taxes not the case in the us or in arabia in france tobacco is twice as taxed as in neighbouring countries our value added tax change depending on the country tooarent these actors when you look a a worldwide scope  of course they are  and why woulndnt jita govenrment decide they have a higher tax because they want to and they can and it will replenish their wallets the fact they are npc doesnt mean we should not try to make them a little more realistic complex and fun in fact i used to trade and i stopped because trading needs more jita order update bot than brain right now
there is more to it than just jita sure jita has become the big market place by natural processes not by ccp making it so but there are regional trade hubs too im not just talking about amarr ourselaert rens etc but in 00 too hw in tribute g8ad in cloud ring ya0 in deklein c3oy in tenerifis to name a few with local alliance based trade areas toomission hubs are another thing to consider  drag some ammodrones to places that have a lot of good level 4 agents even if theyre only 3 jumps from jita and youll make a tidy profitthe only thing higher taxes in big trade hubs will do is act as an isk sink unless the tax level is cripplingly high which would just be a big pita and not much fun
i am so glad to see that all 32000 of windys friends did actually vote this year grats windy we have this in the bag 
higher participation is good from those stats the number of accounts in eve has grown 11 in the last 12 months growth is good not sure if the rate is accelerating or decliningccp how does that compare with previous years player base growth
i appreciate the support of those who have voted thus farim sincerely hoping that people are actually thinking for themselves rather than bloc voting andor having their votes boughtthose need to keep in mind that the only incentive needed for your vote should be your desire for a better gamethe potential for a fatter wallet now simply means youll pay for it laterhave a great weekend
why apologise most people living in technetium space agree that its ridiculously brokenwed be dumb as hell not to be exploiting it as hard as we can until it gets fixed though
if you dont get in then i will rage elise
its those high cheekbones and snappy dressing that does it
or i dunno  finding them again and offering them a consultancy fee to explain their code so it can be alteredimprovedanything has to be better than adding another layer of  to an already enormous  lasagna
has my vote
people who dont document their code may not be able to figure it out themselves after the fact i know that from personal experience and its one of the only reasons i document my code since i dont work with other codersedit but this is far outside of the scope of the csm csm isnt in a position to talk about document management for ccp that is definitely beyond scope
i cant help but think that coders not documenting their work is a deliberate attempt to create some job security you cant fire me im the only guy who knows how this crap works
it can be two things honestly1 ccp has a lax documentation policy so all the lazy coders didnt write any for their code2 ccp is forcing the coders to produce so much code for each expansion remember it was two a year that they didnt have time to document the code before moving onto the next thing to be done because theyd miss the launch date
i have a fairly good handle on the technical details of ui modding im more interested in peoples stance on the gameplay implications
if you lose by 1 vote youre gonna be sorry lol excellent blog post
voting closes in a few daysbe sure to have your vote cast before that
i too understand what you are saying and i would even agree with you if the csm was voted in to be part of the game design process  but they arent it is not your brief to come up with solutions it is to provide feedback on proposed solutions as a player there should never be a push to impose more limits but to always fight for open ended sandbox conditions this is the problem i have with the approach taken and the reference to past experience designing games it is irrelevant in this context you are not going to be designing anything and even if you were you should not be designing solutions that limit the players freedom to approach the game as they want the csm should be the last line of defense against the kind of ideas that restrict player freedom not an active supporter
it would also mean that picking one system to defend as one would do today while leaving the rest to tick down on timers would no longer be a valid tactic and it would be a throwback to the old bob war where bob occasionally babysat a whole system because a pos building a titan was reinforced in the meantime all the other systems were put to the torchthis is a good thing because it adds depth to the strategictactical subgame both for attacker and defenderand while this is all good and all it still doesnt change the fact that the main limiting factor is still that the solar system is running absolutely all the code in a single thread blobs will thus always be a problem until this limitation is refactored out or fixed and since cpus generally dont get any faster pr core these days but mostly just add more cores that means that were effectively locked at a fairly low number it doesnt really scaleill go ahead and lay out what i think would be the main reason for shutting down your fogofwar idea first of all its highly antisandbox especially if i interpret the idea correctly that youll only see say the nearest to you 50100 people lets say for the sake of argument that we set the visibility level at 100 people total to make sure that blues dont pop in and out of view they would probably get the priority so youd have to start making choices about who and what to bring some optimal median would have to be found lets say 10 logis 5 tacklers and 60 dps leaving 25 slots of visibility available for the opposite fleet is that more or less how you would see this happening or would it be more chaotic so that youd always see a maximum of the 100 nearest youin either case what youre going to end up with is that newbies are going to be told to  off because theyll be a liability instead of an asset like they are in goonswarm tight fleet compositions are going to end up being even more key than they are now and smaller and less skillpointintensive alliances will have even less of a chance to break into 00 than before that change was added this is why this is a bad ideasome of the same goes for the titan pinball idea back in 2009 it looks cool on a trailer it sounds cool just like both ongrid titan aoe dd and titan remote aoe dds but try imagining being on the receiving end of one regardless of whether or not the titan weapon did or did not discriminate between blues and nonbluesgood ideas for eve needs to be balanced and have counters and it shouldnt involve one or a few people ruining it for a lot of people say hi to the titan aoe dd and now supercarriers respectively and to be honest numbers should be a valid counter to skillpoints i want shobon newbies to have a place in fleets and ill oppose and  about any mechanic that tries to artificially limit or stop that from happening
bumping for great justice
i have never claimed otherwise except with respect to our subrole of questioning ccp decisions and providing feedback when requestedi believe you are making an absolutist argument that i do not believe can hold up i would think it obvious that someone who has written successful games in the past and who has been a professional programmer for 35 years would be one kind of person you would absolutely want on the csm for the simple reason that i am extremely difficult to bull over technical details both of coding and of designa perfect example of that was at the june summit when ccp rejected the proposal to display drone damage status for drones in the drone bay it took me less than five minutes to drill down through their argument and demonstrate how a modified solution could be implemented without significant performance impact as a result this item was not rejectedand by your logic seleene a former dev would be a horrible choice for csm yet i dont see you making that argument again you are making an absolutist argument that has no place in the real world of software and game development there are always tradeoffs that have to be made  often nasty ones  and one role of the csm is to help ccp find the compromises that provide the most value for the players
if youd permit me to come back to your crowdsourcingprioritisation efforts i think thats a great idea but there is one point which slightly concerns me and id appreciate if you could take a few minutes to address itone area which could do with development in eve and im pleased to see ccp have some plans on the drawing table for this is the eve api id hazard a guess that eve players have a higher than average percentage of people who understand what an api is and does but ive met many pilots who clearly had little clue beyond plugging it into insert name of your favorite skills monitor here the fact is that the features in the api benefit almost every eve player including the ones who dont have a good understanding of what it is or what it doesso coming finally to my question how do you balance the importance of work on the api which is likely to get less prioritisation votes simply because not everyone has a full understanding of how api changes will affect themconsider your reply carefully because if i end up voting for you and you get onto csm6 im going to be bugging you about this
bump for support if only i had more accounts to cast more votes for you
ive had the chance to work with and fly with mark and in my opinion he is the best choice in this election
3 for seleene you have hit the issue nail on the head we all understand that ccp is in the money making game and they wish to expand their player base to as wide an audience as possible incarnadust that said the players who are already playing an
since youve been therewhats your opinion of the agile development processand do you think its the best choice for ccp in developing eve
not the turnips
i have a few questions regarding your campaign objectives1 what specifics do you plan to address in regards to bringing gallente in line with the other factions do you support redoing hybrid turrets as a whole alterations of ship stats and bonuses some have suggested a overhaul of armor tanking what is your position on this subject2 do you plan to support mission runners and any changes made to the missionagent aspect of the game3 what is your position on faction warfare and lowsecthanks in advance
specifically id like to see the tracking looked at and the ship bonuses for blaster ships to allow them to get in proper range for blasters specifically i would not be opposed to slightly increased range option i have done my fair share of mission running and would be more than happy to support a good proposal but i also understand that lvl4 grinding along with mining are one of the foundations of the economy any changes made would have wide spread impacts and would have to be thought through carefully both need quite a bit of looking i personally am not the most experienced on fw and would be contradicting myself if i said i could 100 represent it low sec does need some love tho my main issue with low sec is the riskreward system is way out of scale except for pirating either hi sec or 00 offers much better options making low sec a place many people avoid at all costs i think the rewards need to be increased or the risks need to be buffered some there are dozens of ways to do this but that would be the end result drive more people to low sec for somethings thats actual worth gettingthanks in advance
sorry i wasnt able to make a voice interview this morning i know some folks were looking forward to hearing me seems someone cast flu on my rl character why do we still play that game i will be on this evening and would be glad to chat either text or voice in case anyone would like to ask me anything directly or just to chatand thanks to everyone that votes in the csm election support of the csm can improve eveissler dainzethe voice of reason csm candidate
ha thanks for that link and for believing
so vuk lau is resigning at the end of his csm periodresigning at the end seriously sets a signroflendofcyclecsm trying to have a cool ending
mittani you are really trying hard to win i lol when i read that post it seems only one not more than one but one person was upset over ccp cust service all the other csms were fine with ccp one disgruntled guy cries and you use it for trying to get people believing you will be the man to do stuff lol it seems you are getting desperate what else will you pull out of your azzhat
look it is simple if vuk actually wanted to make a statement he should have posted this stupid thread himself letting mittani create the thread is a pretty damn clear indicator of what this whole thing is actually all about
post some more about how scamming makes you a bad person i loved your earlier work
i was being involved in 5 times more petitions for neutralsreds then for the blues in last year or so there goes your ty trol also if you have halfbrain you would know that gms cant know that anyone else is writing the petitions cause sharing private communication with ccp employees is breach of toseula i am running my own company so its not a problem for me to give myself days off pi initially posted the thread on the rawr forums only and later in the evening on the nc hc and rzr forums despite knowing this will eventually end posted publicly it was not aimed for the general populationi had an option to travel to iceland and raise my concerns on roundtables and panels but i already did that on 567 previous iceland trips also as i said despite looking forward seeing a lot of chill eve players and ccp guysgirls i would eventually see a lot of ccp dudes i think all the worse professionally not personally ofc as getting older my tolerance bar for stupidity is bellow ground zero so i would either have to contain anger inside myself which is unhealthy or to cast rage publicly which will not serve the purpose
this is basically what a lot of you dumbdumbs are doing itt
there will never be a 100 agreement between players on how the game should be you know this everyone will debate till they turn blue in the face because they truly believe their version is the right one it is a never ending battle do you agreethe one key factor is time players willingness to travel a certain amount of time to get to a target varies the longer it takes for a player to get there the number of players wanting to make the trip goes down and down this applies to many things same for the market buy a module for 25 million isk at the station your in or travel 19 jumps away to buy the same module for 249 million isk is traveling 19 jumps to save 10k isk really worth the players time of course not do you agreei am one of the players who would like to see smaller local wars in 00 in order for this to happen it means iteration on the sov system moons poss local resources more space mining nerf boosts balancing blah blah blah then so ing be itpower projection has become easier and easier in this game due to game changes and more players playing at what point does it slow down when a coalition can click a button appear next to a small tower on the opposite side of the galaxy that a ten man corp setup as a stating point for some exploration obliterate the tower and corp in a matter of seconds click a button and have their armada of thousands of ships instantly be teleported back in time for lunchif that same armada was told they had to take every gate to get to the ten man small tower that had no moon value no space value would you still get the same number of pilotsif you want it to remain a power block haven then so be it at least give you opinion and stand by it instead of just looking at someones alliance history as a cop out to letting everyone know where you stand on what the game should be is the current version of 00 the way you think it should bei honestly dont expect you to answer me in any sensible way not without every second word being about some comment on t20 or a persons alliance history neither adding anything of value to your statementis goonswarm still on its first version if so then why does it say goonswarm federation
except of course this ignores the actual issue most nullsec folks simply want to play the game the way they want to play it if other people want to form small pirate alliances or mercenary alliances or play in lowsec or play in fw in lowsec or play in wormholes or run missions in empire until their fingers fall off then theyre fine with that they just want to play the game their way then there are others who declare that small pvp is better than everything or midsized pvp is better than everything or roaming gangs are better than everything or what have you and then they declare that the game mechanics themselves have to be changed to boost that play style and nerf opposing play styles some go even further and rage while trying to argue for reasons that people shouldnt freely associate in a sandbox game and form political structures as they see fit in a game thats driven by playercreated content actually it means you need to find some other people who also want small local wars and go fight them instead of trying to change those who want large transregional wars its a solution so obvious that youve gone right past it and onto trying to force through game mechanics changes to stop other people playing the way they want its just as wrong and for the same reasons as someone who only wanted largescale interregional conflicts and demanded that small fleets be nerfed for all practical purposes yes the goons did not cascade anymore than bobkenzoku did before we kicked them out of their space
so finnagain what you are basically saying is that you believe all the players in 00 when it comes to pvp should be between huge power blocks and if it is small to medium sized pvp they should go somewhere else besides 00do you also believe that all the current game mechanics that are associated with 00 are working perfectly
no not only is that not basically what i said it has absolutely nothing to do with what i saidand of course not all 00 mechanics are working perfectly but that also has nothing to do with your desire to deliberately alter game mechanics in order nerf play styles you dont like in order boost play styles you do like
then what are you sayingyou do a  ton of talking without actually saying anything maybe they should limit the amount of characters in your post to that of a tweet or a haiku so you dont bury what you want to say with a bunch of nonsense
well spoken lady spanky  you look to be truely spankworthy 
hint what i actually said your failure to comprehend is not an error on my part
the problem 10 man corps have with getting set up in 00 is not mega powerblocks crossing the whole map to crush them if anyone is crushing them its the locals the real problem though is that the logistics of feasibly holding any amount of territory in nullsec are such that even if no giant powerblocs or jump bridges existed it would be nearly impossible without a spacerich organized group that had reached a certain critical mass sizewise such a group could hold 10 systems just as easily as holding onetldr version its too hard because sov mechanics are too ed up and the basic level of logistical organization needed is absurdly highplz learn to troll better
if only the locals were not part of the same power block that spans the the other side of the mapso make improvements in how residents can utilize their own space to survive instead of having to constantly suck on jitas titi agree the current sov system is ed up if ccp made some improves into local resource gathering in addition to removing titan and pos jump bridges other things like blockade runners black ops jump frieghters and freighter escorts would be more than enough for logisticsyour problem is you have the mentality of why should i have to put forth effort into logistics when there is sanctums to be farmed on the brainso what improvements to sov could ccp do to improve on say paying for a sov bill they could make it fully automated so each month it pays the bill and people dont wake up to no sov at all
try doing the same thing in say delve querious or period basis theres probably no jb network there now thats being used for defensive purposes anyways ive no idea how the 3 corps still left in it are using it if at all then come back and  and moan like the little  you are about power bloc not block that spans the the other side of the maptell ccp that theyre the ones that have essentially made it so deklein cant make more than 6 minutes worth of t2 ammo for a full maelstrom fleet the slowest firing bs in the game or 2 days worth of ratting ammo ie missiles pr day which means we essentially have to suck on jitas teat not tit and thats during peacetime imagine doing the same thing during wartimewhat kind of local resource gathering would you propose to make it easy to gather sufficient amount of minerals etc to build up and maintain a subcap capital and supercapital fleet let alone poses pos fuel noncombat ships etc etc etc within a reasonable amount of solar systemskeep in mind that with the current game mechanics 1 neutralred guy sitting in a solar system cloaked and possibly even afk is enough to completely shut it down for industrial useswhen was the last time you actually lived in 00
why is everyone so afraid of the afk cloaker
so what you are saying is if i invaded nc all 55k of their bandwagon wouldnt join in because theres some pets i would like to kill would go after rawr but you guys have yaay and well thats an iwin button on its ownthe funny thing about the last several comments is the orion guy brings up pretty valid points that most people criticise the nc for anywayyou guys are trying to make it easier for yourself just so you can removed navigator more moon goo and make it easier to control more spaceoh and an alliance doesnt just have to have 5 people manage the logistics the whole idea of 00 is group work not 5 people get the credit for 5000 people p
ahaha do you even pvp how do you suggest i escort a freighter a 15 man fleet averaging 400 dps will kill a freighter in 30 seconds and they certainly arent going to shoot the escort first people regularly drop dreads on jump freighters at bridges just for fun perhaps a freighter escort should be 2000 people so that the nodes cant fit any hostiles
because the afk cloakers can easily be containing a cyno to hotdrop a ratting carriersupercarrier or they can easily provide just enough dps to supplement rats to kill off your mining or ratting ship and theres all you can do about them short of ignoring them which will get you killedthis isnt rocket science
how many gots from dc are even close to deploying in force to geminate right nowi usually dont do this but im having a hard time taking anyone with 42 kills over a 3 year period seriously when it comes to how 00 workshow many pray tell do you think are involved in logistics in all of dc or even goonswarm
guys you dont get it owning space in 00 is supposed to be awful and tedious and not even slightly fun youre supposed to spend hours every day escorting freighters around and babysitting minerswhat do you think this is some kind of game
why do people in the northern coalition keep saying they are in the deklein coalition there is a coalition within a coalition
anyone who makes the serious argument that ccp should do something to break up power blocs is an utter moron people will play with whoever they want to play with before alliances existed ingame corporations worked together i cant speak for all of the current power blocs but the northern coalition and deklein coalition are bound together both within their own members and to each other by bonds of friendship and mutual spaceship brotherhood there are no game play mechanics that can dictate who players want to associate with never mind that virtually all of the organizational tools to organize and maintain eves power blocs are done via third party sites and platforms that ccp cant control if you want to break up the nc oh god then youre going to have to do it dont sit on your ass and expect ccp to handle it players took down phoenix alliance ascendant frontier band of brothers and all their vassals and it alliance and all their vassals now lets get back on topic ccps gm team needs serious improvement there are lots of possible causes and possible solutions try to come up with some instead of crying about how the nc is killing eve
is this really your best comeback to my post really
i think ive subscribed for the last time nowccp just keeps on astounding me with shortsighted maneuvering and terrible expansions and grossly terrible forum modsi cant believe im asking for zymurgist back shadow wasnt so bad either
the language wasnt great on my part but the point has to do with maneuverability jump bridges give a massive advantage to maneuverability in terms of speed safety and limiting intelligence this all leads to advantages in force projection and concentration of strength now thats not inherently a problem the problem is that the advantage is too strong guerrilla warfare against a defending alliance should be about the ability to attack logistical capabilities of a larger force and the ability to have a higher level of maneuverability with the prevalance of jump bridges this isnt a possibility you cant split a defending force at a gate and you cant outrun them the fact that a battleship fleet can outrun an interceptor gang is an example of the problemas for whether or not i have ever usedrelied on them no because holding sov for any reason other than selling it is incredibly boring
first off thanks was hoping to be able to get into a good debate on this and im glad you posted cause i think you represent so many that share your views let me go through each one and see where we get speed  yes it does allow the defenders quick movingsafety  yes it does provide some level of safety for ppl that arent idiots limiting intelligence  no i disagree with you here any fc that does real 00 pvp knows the enemies jb network already i know that when we are the attackers we use this info to our advantage all the time we know their bridges and use them tacticallyok i dont mean to be condescending here but a frigate gang isnt really what we are getting at here a group of ceptors will out run bss regardless of bridges you cant even bubble them in i will assume that was just another bad example as for attacking logistic capabilities as you say let me explain his one thing as i assume you dont know it or you wouldnt have said that do you realize that a fleet of 4050 bss with a few guardians can knock out a jump bridge well under 15 minutes closer to 10 actually that single act alone if planned right can cripple a network have you ever seen a bunch of 00 pvpers when their bridges are down half of them dont know what do to and the other half are yelling at those noobs to quit whining point is you speak as if these amazing overpowered structures of awesomeness are invulnerable they are far from it and think about it you spent 1015 minutes doing that and they now have to rally a fleet defend and then they have to spend hours getting logistics ships together to rep that bridge to bring it back online as a point of reference it would take roughly 10 triaged carriers about 20 minutes to fix what you did with those bss and i totally respect thats how you like to play just do bear in mind that having never used managed maintained defended attacked or repped jump bridges it does kinda leave you at a disadvantage to speak on them
do they fly
the limited intelligence is that the hostile fc has little idea whats coming because jump bridges will allow people to come from any number of systems granted most alliances are too lazy to actually split up their forces before concentrating them and good guerrilla forces will have spies in the alliance home defense fleet channels but still the point remains that there is little way to scout one of 20 jump bridges that are in range of the system you are innot a bad example maybe i just wasnt clear lets say were in cloud ring in p5kcc in an interceptor gang with a bs home defense fleet forming up nearby we can haul ass to w4 and there is absolutely no chance that we will reach there before the bs fleetof course on the field we can out run them the reason i chose the inty vs bs thing was because of the different warp time fast fleets should be able to outrun slow fleets defensive or notfirst i doubt it would cripple the alliance since they could just use one of the other 100 jump bridges they have second in what world could a 50 man bs fleet sit in a hostile alliance system for 15 minutes attacking a strategic objective and not get attackedif destroying the jump bridge actually caused a significant disruption then maybe i could see your point but i dont think that it really would the nc jump bridge network is filled with so many redundancies that only the laziest and most mentally challenged pilots would be affected by removing one of them
i think we might have hit on a very key misunderstanding there are no redundancies in jump bridges there are not 20 possible places in range it does work like that if you are in system x there are only 2 points you can come sin from jump bridges points are hard coded if you are at a jump bridge you can only go to the one points its link to not anywhere in range if that one points is knocked out well its down you can not jump you now have to resort to gate travel travel as you cant have as many jump bridges in a system as you want its limitedthe other point is you can sit in an enemy system for 15 minutes and this shows me you have never tried i have on many times sat in hostile space and refed posstations and jump bridges hell we do it sometiems just to get a fight it can and is done it comes down to strategy knowing your enemies down times and if they are off on another op somewhere else the reality is many alliances wont bother to defend a station or a pos on initial attack they will let it get refed and then defend on the timer
bridges are they unbalanced or even overpowerd in my opinion they are not yet they are not in the current enviorment that eve has to offertitans bridges are they unbelanced or even overpowerd yes they are and have been for quit some time now back in the day when they where added to the game as lag killer and means for logistics as well as projection of force they where fine because it took one hell of allot of effort for an entire alliance even an entire bloc to get one build but in eve today this is different very stable 00 regions to build in without any thread to the csaas at all eased logistics and much higher avaliblity of titan bpcs at reasonable prices as well as much higher income for alliances due to dominion changes as well as moon goo changes it takes hardly any effort to build titans now a day there are just to many of them today so a nerf is in order either removing bridge from the titan entirely or limiting it to certain ship classesforce projection i can not agree that large blocs will get the same number of ppl to boring blob fights which last for weeks or even month if the more casual players suddenly have to fly 50 jumps instad of 68 taking them hours instad of minutes to get there just to be back home after a few minutes also having to use gates for such long distances will increse the chance of getting into an enemy roam while on your way to destination as well as it will make it harder pilots who lost there ship to just reship and be back on the battlefield in a matter of minutes so without jbs fights would take allot more concideration and planning ahead of time moving replacement ships to nearby station system placing medical clones there etc which again requires logisticsalso the carebears are to lazzy for that so you will see reduced numbers on battlefields in the longrunyour rules well when talking about bridges your rules dont work quit well because the question is not whatever they work as intend which they do but rather do they work in the current enviorment which they dont and the reason for that is that blocs have build an bridge empire covering half of 00 space in my opinion there is no real fix for bridges making the ihub upgrade more expansiv issnt going to fix the problem because one of these blocs has infinite income from tech moons the other an infinite renter empire nerfing its range wont do much either but removing the ability of bridges to connect different regions might not be such a bad thing bridges would still be usefull but ppl would be forced to atleast use the regional gates for once
it doesnt have to be within system to be redundant even having a jump bridge next door is redundant being able to keep your fleets or your solo pilots off of gates 247 represents a massive strategic advantage and are you really arguing that yall wouldnt whip out an nc blob home defense fleet if you had a 50 bs fleet reported in intel i meanare you really arguing thatof course you would for me the problem simply comes down to the inability of small groups to disrupt large alliances their large fleets can use jump bridges to outmaneuver even the most maneuverable fleets and the individual pilots can use them to avoid any risk of using stargates
thanks draco pi do agree that titan bridges do need to be nerfed some the best thing i can figure is to require soem special becon be used for the titan portal to lock onto i am thinking of a carrier class mod that would have around a 30 second warm up where everyone in system woudl be able to see what you lighted and after teh 30 second warm up its up for 45 minutes when people can bridge to you like the cyno you can not move jump out cloak etc but it also has the aspect of the triage where your local rep is buffed and you can not get remote repped if you move or drift into a poss forcefield it is imposible to jump to teh carrier anymore my rational is that your not going to be able to nerf them enough to stop them from being used but just make them so that there is a bit more warning that a fleet is coming and so that any cyno frig cant bring in a 200 person fleetfor jump bridges i like the idea of making jumps between regions harder eiher by not allowing them between regions or requiring special region bridges that use mroe fuel so its harder logisticallyim not sure if this was jsut for 00 but i do think that black ops jump bridges need a bit of a buff not in range or ships that can go through but allow them in empire so covert cynos can occur there which woudl lead to a nice change in empire war so that it can have a 00 feel of fleets movign around more freely than just down pipesshort versionrequire cyno carriers for titan bridgesincreadsed fuel consumption and cost for regional jump bridgesallow covert cynos in highsecmy spelling sucks and i dont care
not arguing what would happen but what is observed  its not at all uncommon for a 50 man bs gang to move through an area unchallenged this can be for a variety of reasons like not enough pilots online pilots being cut off from their pvp ships pilots being elsewhere doing something already out roaming moving goods whatever but for whatever reason i can verify that this does happen
knowing the pos password to a blue jump bridge and being able to use it is pretty ing over powered dont you think
the 1 reason to not engage and just ignore them is there is nothing that 50 man fleet can do that is not incredible easy to avoidrepair when they leave ignore them and they will get bored and move on should not be the go to tactic for defenders
here are a list of things that a can be done with 50 bs man gang or smaller size with various ship types1 incap jump bridges abotu 1015 mins2 knock out station services time varies but the smaller services can be taken out relatively quickly 3 camp jump bridges4 black ops bridging into carebare havens for ganks5 roam for good fights this is usually the motivating factor to do a lot of the above itemsi know this can be done we do it all of them all the time when we razor deploy to enemy areas do you still want to sit and say that a small alliance cant do anything to a large one
i have talked about the capitalcarrier type cyno with many people and at a basic level i like it i have also talked about reversing the bridging mechanic so the titan is where you bridge too maybe even require 2 titans in source and dest to form the bridge all valid ideas that i would entertainincreased fuel for regional jumpbridges or blocking them all together are decent options too blocking them would form inheritance choke points that smaller corpsalliances or just small gangs would camp on a regular basis and could surely create some havoc it would not promote much more pvp tho as in 95 of the cases when these types of camps take place they scatter like roaches at the first sign of opposing force so is this promoting small scale pvp no it just create ganking opportunities which is fine from a sense it increases risk but lets not confuse it with promoting proper small pvp unless they actually stay to fight
when you bring a hostile fleet into an alliances space you choose the time and the place you have the advantage of potentially weeks of planning you can bring your best fc a perfect fleet comp the defending alliance has what 30 minutes before your add kicks in and you move on to scramble for an fc pick up whoever is on and assemble them in one place you as the aggressor have all the advantagesive had this conversation with a number of people and what it eventually comes down to is them pointing at the 20 people docked up in a station and crying that they wont undock and fight them ignoring the fact that undocking from a station leaves your fleet blind all in one spot and potentially staggered half of those people are probably afk the other half are likely ratting or industrial altsyou dont get good fights from industrial alts you get ganks if thats what you want then fine but stop getting all y that people wont fit their haulers with guns and undock into your fleet assuming youve not had an existential crisis at this point it should be fairly obvious that jump bridges allow the defenders to form a fleet to engage you before you spot a shiny thing in the distance and leaveunless of course by good fights you mean fights i win in which case youre never going to be happy with any reasonable solution
well except the defender has jump bridges pvp ships and capitals already in place stations to dock up in intel channels to keep an eye on aggressors the agressors on the other hand have the advantage of surprise and thats it and the really ed thing is even if an aggressor does make it into your space without being blobbed and even if it manages to keep all of your forces docked theres still nothing they can do short of a massive invasion that will result in any significant damage to the sov holder even though they didnt bother to defend their spaceanything of significance these days happens in systems where taking 15 minutes to fire your guns is considered to be reasonable lag and half of everyone in that system is staring at a black screenaggressors having all the advantages i lol at you sir
firstly id like to point out that draco misquoted me in post 19 when it was marconus orion who made that statementi will also add to the aggressordefender discussion having time to plan and gather forces ready for when you want to strike or even just roam around does give a significant advantage it may not be the only advantage available and the defenders have some advantages too a point i disagree with yeep on but to say that the only advantage the aggressors have is surprise shows you either didnt read yeeps post or you have very limited experience of alliance level combat pvpalso to comment on the anything of significance thing  those things of significance might be the only things which attract caod chest beating or eve news 24 reporting but they certainly arent the only significant things happening often the truly significant actions go entirely unnoticed
this is frigging crazyok lets do it this way1 how many times have you come into 00 sov held space with 50 people and of those times how many resulted in your being blobbed to death before you could do anything causing your whole fleet to die in a fire2 i already listed 5 things above that you can do as the aggressor to cause damage since those are obviously not what you want what do you want
how few pray tell should the aggressors have to be before they should be able to cause significant damage because theyre ignoring you like the little gnat you areand whats the reason for that thenoh right its the dominion sov systems fault but lets blame something completely different thatll teach them for ignoring you
right so because the dominion lag hurt fleet warefare its obviously due to jump bridges i totally see the logic there get rid of jump bridges and we we put 1500 ppl in a system it will now workand 15 min lag is not acceptable frankly most pilots will consider module lag of up to a minute manageable but more than that is considered unreasonable
they do at the moment but i think improved mobility in space you own is a reasonable advantage to expectyour roaming gang isnt in pvp shipsbut we just established being able to dock up when hostiles enter local is unacceptable people should be forced to fight any hostile gang that shows up in their space and bangs their chest but they shouldnt have enough time to actually threaten the gang that would be unfair on the poor small gang pvpersintel channels arent something ccp provides to space holders talking to other people isnt exclusive to 00 alliancesits nice to selectively ignore the parts of my post you dont like ill give you a minute to go back and try againso how many man hours would you consider the minimum to put in to do significant damage to a spaceholding alliance in fact i think youll find the sov holder will defend their space if you actually threaten it however you probably wont like what happens when they get to choose the terms
all trolling aside they have fixed the majority of the session change bugs the problems mostly just the massive amounts of hp and the hilarious amounts of timers now
i dunno i mean i really dont think its game breaking or anything but i still feel jump bridges have too much power people defending the point argue that they arent really that powerful which seems a bit ironic because if they werent that big of a deal then why would people be arguing to keep them that strongly i still think that the reason people are defending them so vehemently is that they offer massive advantages to the defending alliance if they didnt then why would you even start this threadthe only part that really bothers me really the only part is that so few people in alliances have to use gates with the security that jump bridges allow for moving and the low risk pve due to sanctums and whatnot that already exists its no surprise that small gang warfare is as dead as it is we need to have pilots using gates and earning isk in belts this leads to gfgfs and a less lazy mentality in alliances jump bridges arent the wholeonly problem there are other issues like sanctums but the end result is easily defended and highly lucrative space which pushes people to nap train everyone they cani have no problem with blobs btw small hostile gangs should get blobbed in alliance space my problem is that its either blobs the rare idiot using a gate or nothing rarely will people have a 5 man roaming group and no pve systems are ever actively defended because the defensive setup in null sec doesnt require it null sec defends it self by its very nature
having people moving their pve ships by gates still happens a lot btw and earning isk in belts doesnt lead to good fights it leads to ganks and ganks are never good fightsgoing out looking for a similar sized group to fight with while avoiding the bigger gangs is what leads to good fights sometimes you run into smaller groups and solo players and you can either gank them or they get away neither of which is a particularly good fight but either way ganking pve ships isnt nearly as satisfying as an evenly matched fightadmittedly those evenly matched fights are a whole lot harder to find amidst dodging the bigger gangs but they definitely are out there for anybody who wants to look
i rarely use bridges because currently i log in to a staging system join the fleet shoot  go back log off i dont do ratting because its boring as  i dont do mining because its boring as  so i dont travel the main reason i argue for keeping jbs is because it makes life more convenient and less like stabbing yourself in the ing face with knivesof course it is used from time to time to get ahead of a roaming gang but at least in deklein people either roll up the region which is basically just one long corridor or down the region and they have to go through at least a few heavily populated areas by 00 standards at which point they either get ignored or they get outblobbedwhy do you need to have people using gates the only argument ive ever seen have been because it means we get more pvp action and theres something else which i think is the root cause for this im outlining this in my answer below00 does defend itself by its very nature insofar as the dominion sov system basically require a very large fleet up to 6 times in a row i keep saying that any alliance can basically easily defend up to 6 systems by defending one system at a time and breaking the sov grind chain one system at a time provided theyre all properly setup with stations etc that means that when joe random elite pvper comes around with his small bunch of elite pvp friends people are either going to be travelling blind ie theyre dumb caught unawaresafk ie theyre dumb or theyre going to form up a large enough group and  the everliving  out of these elite pvpers who of course will  about blobbingthis has all to do with jbs and everything to do with the fact that we have developed intel channels because we basically need it we havent got concord to make sure that you roaming gots need to make a choice between a securityisk hit and a killmail so we have to provide our own security that is after all what 00 is all aboutif you absolutely want to see a change in the number of people in a system then you wouldnt be vyving for making life tier in 00 you would be trying to make life in 00 for the common dweller easier and more fun because then they would be logged in more and theyd do more stuff of course the flipside of this if you do things right ie if fex the whole of goonswarm couldve lived in a single constellation and not feel stifled is that roaming gangs would have it even harder to get a good fight because theyd pop into systems with maybe 100 or more goons in it which means that youd get even more outblobbed if everyone except those who werent paying attention didnt dock upas for the whining over not having 5 man roaming gangs face it eve has more people in it cope
some interesting points raised im all for making armor a viable alternative to shields but i still have a few questions1 what changes to the gallente faction do you plan to support overall eg redone hybrid turrets ship speed and statsbonuses2 do you plan to support mission runners and any changes made to the missionagent aspect of the game3 what is your position on faction warfare and lowsecthanks in advance
i cant speak for any other alliances but goonswarm historically does not deal well with peace in the absence of external enemies we find conflict within our ranks the loss of delve is probably the most recent example of this but its held true all the way back to 2005 the mittani knows this vile rat knows this theyve both lived through most of the alliances big self destructive peactime phases its in neither of their best interests to stagnate 00 but they already can come sit 10 people in my ratting system and i wont be doing any ratting for a while you might even catch my ishtar if im busy with other things sit off a jump bridge with a cloaked dictor and stealth bomber and youll kill countless haulers all this is disrupting the lives of powerblock playersyou still dont really understand what a priviledge is other than supercaps requiring sov space to build and being required to take sov space something that nobody likes what youre complaining about is tradeoffs you seem to think living in 00 is all puppies and icecream with no sacrifices at alltried living in npc 00 the market mechanics make sharing a conquerable region with people who arent your friends more painful than its worth how many systems would you like your 10 man alliance to hold goonswarm holds about 1 system per 100 characters thats 110th of a system for your 10 man alliance if a big alliance isnt allowed locked stronghold full of tamed npc and belts how is a small alliance going to make any money or are they allowed these mythical strongholdshave you asked test or tnt how they feel about being slaves or do you just want to live in 00 without having to do obnoxious things like make friends with people outside your corp like it or not politics is a big part of eve online its one of the many things that makes the game unique without politics you wouldnt get the grudges that cause most of the games most memorable wars but im sure your desire to have a small part of space to call your which nobody can take from you no matter how many more friends they have is more important than that
list these gamebreaking privileges and why theyre gamebreaking privileges
thank you yeep you took the type out alot of the things i was thinking when i was reading thatalsythi would love for you to get a seat on the csm just so that if i get one i can have this conversation face to face 1 you are absolutely right the csm should not be owned by 00 powebloc delegates but i think you are mixing this valid argument and powerbloc game playright now there are no mechanics in eve that promote coalitions for the people that have to manage the standings and access its kind of a pain which is one of the reasons the diplo role evolved from nothing to an relevant career line in eve i dont disagree that 00 sov system could use some love but groups of people will always join together for a common cause and i want to reiterate waht yeep said there are sooo many things you can do with a small alliance to disrupt a large one if you are 10 people do as he said put afk cloakers in carebear systems roam through regularly so ppl cant mine or rat camp jump bridges if you have more say 3060 mess with structures incap jump bridges knock out station servicesrazor is an alliance that is constantly looking for gfs when we dont have action at home we go and find it yes many times alone without daily support from the rest of nc we go to low sec or npc 00 and do this exact stuff we roam with 1020 man gangs we do black ops and jump bridge camping and even market pvp we really p1ss off our enemies not be playing to sov grinding and large warfar but by being irritating mosquito s mostly trying to instigate a real fightagain im not saying 00 and the sov system dont need love but dont confuse things you cant do with things you dont know how to do 
late responding but i think the key is a csm that has a the full range of eve pilots represented the majority of pilots in eve will never be part of or care about the major actions in 00 space that doesnt mean that arent affected by what happens there so yes every csm member has to understand how 00 affects eve overallbut my issue is that i think the ccp continues to be overly focused on aspects of eve that may generate epic conflicts for 10 of the player base have nothing to do with the lives of the majority of the pilots in eve someone needs to be thinking about those other folks and making sure ccp considers their game experiences that has been and will continue to be my focusso lets hope we get a csm that can fairly represent the entire population of eve and not just the major 00 power blocks which is what i fear we are getting in csm 6issler dainzerunning for csm to represent the little guy
issler you do make some quite valid points but i want to add one thing almost everything that happens in 00 effects everyone i know a lot of people dont realize this but that 3 month old n00b pilot is severely impacted by the happenings in 00 the results to any change to 00 will affect even those typeshere are examples1 recent conflicts in geminate specifically o2o battles have results in the loss of thousands of ships who made those ships who did the invention for the t2 hulls and modules and ammo who did the manufacturing whos mining the trit and pyerite and other high sec ores whos mining the ice to fuel the towers used for staging and capital fuel2 moon goo any changes to sov or moon mining will effect every high sec person that only does invention that person may not give two craps about 00 but when the cost of there reactions shoot up or crash that affects there ability to make profits3 missioners that love phat faction fit ships well yea most of that fancy faction loot comes from 00 changes to complexes anomalies sov ability for 00 carebears to do those things will affect the availability and prices of said items not saying its bad thingpoint is confidantes need to understand how everything is interconnected and how at the end of the day 95 of everything that happens in eve is in some pay for or based around pvp in any security space but 00 is a major part in that
one of my campaign platforms is promoting more low value npc space for smaller alliances to occupy that big power blocs wont be interested in this is a perfect example of a member of one of those power blocs thinking about the game as a wholejust realise that being a member of a group doesnt necessarily mean that your only interest is that groups welfare at the expense of others  it is possible to be part of one group a 00 power bloc and part of many other groups too mission runners miners industrialists traders etc etcedit quote messed up
so having spent the last week reading a variety of blogs sic and posts and websitesi find myself in a conundrummy understanding of the csm is that it provides feedbackfeedback from the playerbase in its entirety and feedback directly to ccp on their ideasmany if not the majority of candidates are promising to lobby for certain change alteration concepts or otheris this not a cheap tardy cloak of deception is this not polititian speak for we want your vote but will do what we want with it this behaviour cannot be condoned anyone who cant spell colour with a u or cotton with two ts surely cannot be trustedin addition to the basic facts laid out above i find the only candidate who promses to run against the others against false promise misdirection deception and a powerbase that is hugely inflated in a certain direction is nonother thangeneral windypoop if you chose to waste your vote elsewherethen so be it but please if you do please do not post anywhere any whiney blob this jumpbridge that smallgang poopoo t2099 exploiting rubbish ever again the only candidate who has promised one thing and one thing only is windyplopp  and all he has promised is what can truely be delivered  to stand up against the tyranny of evil that is before youok so that may be a bit strong but it is a major coallition of potential notnicenessvote hard vote often vote windythat is all  keep up the good posting edited cos i was told to  just like you were told to vote yes you know who you are
if you dont want false promises youd do well to vote for someone who has a proven track recordmember of csm 2 3 4 and 5 youd think if i was making empty promises andor stupid statements i wouldnt get reelected especially when i have no large alliance backing me offso go with someone reasonable intelligent knowledgeable who can work with everyone no matter what play style they chosesomeone whom many members of past csms say positive things about including but not limited to mynxee larkonis tamber mazzilliu trebor etcin other words vote for me
another fine candidate i agreehowever i take heed of the political speak that tries hard to persuade me that indeed you may or may not be more or less intelligent or knowledgeablebeware citizens of eve read through the words see past the rhetoric look through the clouds find clarity in the gem that is windy unpaid but i will find him if he refuses me the 100 cap booster 150s that he promised me i will continue to lobby as is my right for the one true candidate that is windyplop please waste no more votes on these unsavoury except meissa as she looks to be a bit of alright wannabe jimmy carters and winston churchills i cant mention certain other political leaders but you get the picture
so windy is wanting your vote because he doesnt want others to get in  what exactly is it that windy is running for or will supportpersonally id rather know what a politicians if you can really call us that stance is before i vote for them which is why i outlined where i stand on various issues no false promises just stating where i stand so you know what youll get
i understand your questioningmore should question toowhat windy stands for is the populace currently it appears if the vote numbers and candidates are correct and we have no reason to question ccp that there is an influx of players who share a common goalareaphilospohyblue listwith this in mind what the feedback to ccp would be is likely to be slightly prejudiced at the least  as we all ultimately have our own interests at heartthe only candidate i could find who promised to stand against this and to feedback honestly to us was windy he also did not make questionable promises about gameplay features causing havoc shouting at ccp or any the suchwhat he stands for is a freedom of speech of a voice in the wilderness of a light in the darka break in the cloudsi am not here to answer your questions specifically  i am not running  i have no need to answer your questions what i am here for is to lobby for a candidate that i beleive has significant value to me personallyand i can assume to many others tooyou wish for the csm to be so totally onesided that it slides and falls off the edge of the world or would you rather a candidate that helps provide the world with a spherical being  ensuring the csm can slip effortlessly without the fear of falling off the edge 
its puff puff pass
just means you havent read and dont understand everyones campaignor your just an alt of windy and this is another thread for shameless promotion 
of course this is a windy alt hes not even trying to hide them
he could at least make them attractive im not taking voting advice from someone with a portrait that ugly
oh god ive wanted my own personal fanboi for years since general windyp0ps was biomassed why oh why when i finally get one does it have to be this one
sorry all your posting is a glaring example of a mindless rhetoric itself
as some of you know as part of my election campaign ive been running a free lottery with a top prize of up to 6b isk so far over 1000 podpilots have signed upwhen voting closes so does the lottery so time is limited theres no cost no obligation and lets face it no advantage to me  most of you guys have already votedin fact the main reason im posting this is that a large number of goons have signed up  and id really rather not be sending the isk to one of them so take a minute enter the lottery and good luckthe winners will be chosen in public after the csm session at fanfestbesttrebor soon to be poor daehdoowps a complete list of all the goons who have entered the lottery and then traitorously clicked on my vote button is available for a reasonable fee pps traitorous goons can be removed from the list upon payment of a slightly lessreasonable fee
im really just after a candidate to push for change in the inventiont2 production realmthe current ui and system is not very nice for those who make their cash from inventionheres a good example post regarding the issueim not after someone who suddenly decides to see god id like to read a thread written by them regarding this issue somewhere in the pastrev
improvements to the ui not just in invention have long been a focus of mine it was one of the core planks of my platform in the csm 5 elections and i raised the low hanging fruit ui proposal last year and ran the associated prioritization effortwhile it is impossible for any csm to promise that a particular area of the game will get attention ccp is clearly focusing more resources on the ui and the whole scienceindustry interface is in obvious need of some love
being inventer myself i do up to 250 inventions a day when i do modules i made several requests to help on that frontdoing multiple inventions with one click has been requested already it didnt get prioritized yet however ill keep pushinglikewise i requested pos improvements on that front try manufacturing using equipment assembly arrays a nightmarewe got last year a more responsive ui on the invention front if you remember 2 years ago one had to wait a long time between job runs because of the unresponsiveness of the ui we still have way too many clicks and for s sake remember my range settings but you can trust that ill push for improvements on that front
both of the above choices are good but i would also put my name forwardi do a lot of research and manufacturing and understand the click issues i will be pushing no promises form ccp for a revamp of the science and industry interfaces as well as the corporation management interface
invention is a primary way we fund our corporation trying to improve invention and pos lab access is a big piece of what i will focus on in the csm if electedissler dainze
clickfests are one of my pet peeves with eve in my csm campaign ive highlighted planetary interaction as something that i just dont do because of the insane amount of clicking to implement anything and that its just not funinvention is something i do on a small scale so its kind of bareable still im firmly opposed to any and all clickfests  this is a game well persistent world if we want to be pedantic which we do and it should be fun and engaging rather than repetitive work with sporadic moments of funexcitement

im still here guys dont worry a little busier than usual however atm ccp is plowing through a back log of changes that usually land on my desk to be put on here rest assured i do check this weekly for changes and new topics
here is an idea to make fw occupancy meaningful without making it so everyone joins the winning factionlets say amarr gain occupancy of the system evati right now there are a few minmatar npc stations there well lets say that with time after amarr take over there is a certain percentage chance that those stations become amarr npc stations so a boundless creation might become a carthum conglomerate the idea is that companies are generally not well served to open up factories in places that are occupied by the enemy they would tend to fair poorly for numerous reasons in other words the players are shaping the universe it would no longer be a universe that ccp made and always remained the samethe chance of this happening may depend on how long occupancy is held say every 6 months you roll the dice on any enemy faction corps leaving there may also be a chance smaller chance that a corp from the sister faction would move in  so perhaps lai dai caldari would move in there would be new agents that go in to that etc the rp story would be boundless decides to close down facilities in evati due to a sudden increase in taxes and sells station to carthumlai dai or some suchnow it would be an indirect benefit because you usually have high standings with the faction you fight for in fw so you would gain new agents and resources for those in your faction but then again if one side loses many agents the value of that lp should see a slight rise because the goods are more scarce so it would be a decent storyline consequence that wouldnt likely lead to a lopsided war would this work for actual militia stations that might be going too far and lead to a lopsided war but maybe not if they added some decent faction specific items to the fw lp store there would be a natural balance those lp would be worth more i certainly think many amarr mission runners would fight to keep huolaif for example minmatar took over huola 24th crusade station and it became a tribal liberation force station then the missions would have to send minmatar back into minmatar space the agent might say something like  i figured we were stretching ourselves too thin in capturing this station now the amarr are starting to attack us back at our home stations
agreed i prefer the original proposals modification to the idea of a new cloaking device duplicate modules arent a very elegant way of fixing problemsas for removing passive rechargeehh i suppose though the amount of time itd take to regenerate any significant amount of hit points is so long that im not sure its an issue
no to dumbing down eve for peops who want cheap capital kills
cloaks should have more of a down side when used on ships they were not designed to be used on although i would like to see local in null sec go the way of the dodo if a change like this were to come into being
i think this change will make eve more complex not dumbed down capital ships dont deserve to be able to cloak to regenerate cap in 100 safety
i should start by saying that i regard neutral remote repping as an exploit and believe that it should incur the wraith of concord something i think most posters here would disagree withso if the neutral remote repper is flagged with an aggression timer against a ship in a corp he is not at war with what will happen
sorry pitboss im one of those of the opinion that those criticisms you claim were addressed were either insufficiently addressed or criticized andor countered themselvesi still find nothing wrong with current rr as it stands in game changing it will do nothing to help current high sec wardec mechanicsstill not supported
agreed i support this hybridsgallente needs rebalanced and fixedwhats a bit more damage when you cant apply that damageits like telling gimli to fight legolas gimli is very skilled but hell never win against legolas who can just flank him and avoid his strong arm and axe and shoot arrows at him all day
i have a few skills i would like to get rid of my pure pvp gallente alt has like research 3 and a couple of others that were from pretyrannis character creation good idea imo and not a big deal
because mining level 1 just looks bad on my character sheet
providing there were inbuilt fail safes to prevent accidental deletion of skills eg handled similarly to biomassing then i would love this to be implemented for the benefit of those of us who like to keep skill sheets cosmetically appealing
which is the problem some of those ships are pregimped by the tier system the omen does good theoretical dps but it fails at the actual application of dps the prophecy and maller both fill a niche role that really doesnt need so many ships in it if the proph had 8 turrets it might be viable with no dmg bonus
the problem with the teir system was never that it simply exists just that ccp have lets face it been pretty poor at revisiting old balance problems and fixing broken shipslack of iteration is what is causing the issues with old ships its nothing to do with teirs whatsoever when was the last time stock t1 ships were even looked at balance wise
do it
they have have a spotty record with that sure they are good about revisiting things that affect the richest players but not so much about the general populace i dont think ive seen a patch since sovereignty was implemented that didnt have a lot of changes to 00 specific game content inlcudedim dont think iteration means what you think it means
i agree i support this wholeheartedlyim focused in gallente and there are serious flaws as stated all over this thread and in the op that need to be addressed gallente is becoming more and more broken over the years please rebalance the ships and hybrids so us players focused in gallente can have some fun and pride in our ships againwere not asking to be top dog were just asking to be on par with the rest of the races because weve dropped far below them in pvp becuase of all the changes that have seriously injured gallente
imho replacing all armor repair bonus on gallentean ships with hull resistance bonus would work pretty well in pvp buffers work better then active and hull buffer would make gallentean somewhat unique  powerful tank with low fitting requirement but painful to repair in a hurry
my alt has fof 5 for the reason i stated they really dont need to be made any better although the not shooting fleetmates bit would be cool
trolling comments removed
i reported them like 12 days ago lolbetter late than never i suppose
throwing my full support behind this one
amazing about two years ago just after i started playing eve i submitted a similar proposal and was quickly shot down and flamed by just about every response it wasnt pretty my oh my how attitudes have changed towards this topici definitely agree that there should be some way to train more than one character on an account at the same time the ops suggestion is just as good as any ive read and has the advantage of both giving the players a wanted feature and putting more money in the ccp coffers as far as this being a microtransaction  hogwash its simply additional subscription fees and since you still can only play with one character at a time those who have two or more accounts so that they can play two or more characters simultaneously would still keep those other accounts i happen to have three accounts and i guarantee that i would be using this on all three accounts at least to train a second character on each the third would be as necessity dictatedi would prefer though that the price was a bit lower than a full sub price and with the option of using plex as payment as well as the standard sub payment methodoption 1  standard payment method note  using this option you cannot use 3 6 or 12 month plans except with only one character training andor using plex for the others1 month1 character training  14951 month2 characters training  24951 month3 characters training  3195option 2  plex payment method note  since plex costs more  34992  than standard monthly subs the benefit is seen in the training times1 plex applied to an account  add 1 month sub time to account or 1 month training on both 2nd  3rd character or 6 weeks training on 2nd character2 plex applied to an account  add 2 months sub time to account or add 1 month sub time to account and 1 month training on 2nd  3rd character or 2 months training on 2nd  3rd character or 3 months training on 2nd characterin addition training times would not be at the full 100 for all characters training1st character always trains at 1002nd character trains at 753rd character trains at 50in the skill queue you would designate the status of the character as 1st 2nd or 3rd this could be changed and switched at any time so that no character is locked into a slower training rateso anyway supported with some adjustments
quoted for emphasis i forgot this bit in my original support post
not supportedthis is the thin edge of the wedge once you go down this route then there will be calls to make it cheaper there already are some in the repliesposted from an alt account
thin edge of a wedge what is wrong with suggesting it be a bit cheaper than a full months sub rate or be able to be payed for with plex besides its only a suggested proposal at this point i actually think that even if it went through as the op proposed its still a good idea and would be used by a lot of players the main point of the proposal is to be able to pay for concurrent training on one account and ultimately if the idea did ever get accepted by ccp they would set the cost to whatever they decided is most beneficial to them and as fair as possible to the players regardless of what is suggested here
im not sure but couldnt you eject at a safe private pos and then board with an alt on the same account then try to safely get to a station to jump clone out of your slaves
this tbh
im not against the idea they can dock sincedocking time is really really slow 15min or to avoid station gamesstation fees for docking are very very expensive and daily you dont pay account stoped not enough isk  ships kiked out of station and everyone can take or shoot itjust some ideas but wy shouldnt they be able to dockthey should but with titanic drawbacks
what made you think you need a second accountjust make a new character on your account train to fly the hull and nothing else on it e on second thoughts train to use the basic cloaking device too you might need to use it at some point and just do a safespot login alt  eject  login main  board dancea little dangerous for sure someone could steal it if they scan out your safe quickly enough though youre not going to be doing this anywhere but in a secure system held by your alliance so its not that much of an issue
hell you dont even have to train to fly the hull  you can buy a character off the bazaar god knows the price is reasonable for anyone that actually intends to fly the ships the way they were intended
maybe because they are already larger than the station unless someone does manage to find a new technologies allowing us to create storage bubbles overlapping on multiple dimensions we wont be able to put them in a docking hangar
hang on firstly why should i have to train another character why where in the game does it state if you want to fly a super then you must have 2 chars or accounts and ideally yes you would have 2 accountsyou say i need to just train the hull thats is still considerable training timeguys with respect your trolling not one of you have given me and answer or reason for thisalso what has friends got todo with anything it makes no difference lol to this situation is ccp going to give me back all my wasted sps now because thats what it is i should not have to train another char i dont want toyes i dont literally have to fair enough and ccp can dispute that technically you only need one but then my super is exposed to the world in a pos which in essence means the games mechanic pretty much make me have another char or in this day and age im 100 going to lose my shipyour making the rules up from your own heads there is nothing in official literature thats says i must be in an allaince or anywhere i may want to be solo and live in low sec with a superalso come on with the amount of titans and supers about you really think being with friends is going to stop pl russains nc removing it i should have to be in a large alliance to own a superbut anyway i really dont understand your logic on saying no about allowing superstitans to dock you have not given me any real or decent argument against this even if that means upgrading the station component to allow it obv in low sec this would be available in all stationsif you dont support this then i am more than happy to listen to it god knows why anyone would not support it even 00 guys but hey i have trouble understanding the intelligence level some ppl have in eve
the point is mate why should i have to train another account i understand the game mechanics thats fine what if people dont want to be in a large alliance the game is becoming so unbalanced now its silly so what we saying is you have to have a second accountchar and be in a big alliance to have a super i must of missed that when i signed up for eve otherwise i would never have trained for it
you dont have to train another character for that matter you dont have to even get into a supercap there are methods to playing in other ships while you have a supercapthey have been explained to you already in this thread you dont like those options dont get in a supercap pretty simple
it is ed that so many things need multiple accounts but hey this game is built on exploits and metagaming shrug
if you can afford an sc you can afford one plex a month for an alt holder characterbesides two other slots on that same alt account can make enough isk for a plex without much effort or playing actively datacores pi invention production station trading scamming so basically you get it for free
so you knew this was a fact and still you invested everything you had for them only to get angry about it when you reached the finish line i am sorry no disrespect but you have only yourself to blame then really
sorry meant to post with my main
really now theres your argumentlike others have said there is nothing that prevents you from climbing into such a ship and there is nothing that says you have to get such a ship or that you must get a holder alt however all ships have limitations the inability to dock andor go from system to system by itself are just 2 such limits its these limits that prevent wholesale proliferation of said ships and something that maintains balance within the game as a whole if such limits were not in place then everyone and their mother would be scrambling to get one and the bar would be raised for being a competitive forceso harden up and realize that there are simply some things that you will be unable to do alone
as stated you dont have to be in an alliance or have a second toon you dont have to setup your own tower in your own corp and leave it in the bubble just cause you think you should be able to do something doesnt mean you shouldi should be able to dd in low sec i should be able to use a dichic bubble in empire i should be able to bomb or smart bomb 44 should i demand to get all the skills back after spending 2 months training for a onyx only to find out i cant bubble up in rancershow me one piece of official documentation that tells you anything about half of this stuff eve is notorious for being undocumented so your arguments are all invalidthe point is as many have stated the reason you cant is that its a deterrent to make them hard to manage hard to support and hard to deal with that is the point and the reason if you dont accept that thats on you
i propose supercapitals should be able to use jumpgates and dock just like any other normal ship this allows them to be the only ships in the game worth having which is obviously the way it should beid sarcasm here but if you managed to miss it i fail to care
or do we just have a bunch of 12 man corps for avoiding the 11 taxa bit of a poll i suppose if you feel that the change was ineffective pointless or worse than the problem it solved check the support box perhaps with a reason you feel that wayif you dont feel free to throw in your two cents too
i fail to see the use of those npccorp taxes mission runner just fly through one more mission every 10missions cycle and thats allwhat was the goal of those taxes right from the beginning just suppress them and we wouldnt see anymore of those sologuy corps
the goal was two fold first to encourage people to form their own corps and leave the npc corp nest second to remove the unfair tax disadvantage player corps had compared to npc corps player corps have to use taxes to fund corporation activities so they have to have a tax rating unless they are for the purpose of tax evasionglorified chat rooms the average corp tax was around 10 at the time so the npc tax was put at 11 the 10 comes from removing the disadvantage and the 1 is the encouragement to push people to leave the npc corp i will also like to point out that ccp was quite fine with the fact that many would just form a tax evasion corps so if that is a problem to someone it is their personal issue but it isnt a problem for the game and needs no solutioni feel it was a good solution to the problem of player run corps having a clear disadvantage in taxation and it made them competative and even attractive compared to npc corps the extra encouragement to join player run corporations was just a bonus so i would say the change has been a success
it has accomplished its goal there are fewer people staying in the safe harbour npc corps
twocents
i think an npc corp should tax you about 1520forcing you to join a corpif you are a new player  you get like 512 months grace  0 taxnew players are not effectedany player wanting to hide in an npc corp that cannot get war decd gets taxed from the other endjust my opinion  many may not agree i just dont like the fact that you cannot war dec 1 person in an npc corpcheers

hi i logged off during a battle becasue my ship stopped responding and i received repeated and contant lag report which never cleared and several hours later my friends were saying that my character and ship was still online and visible in the gamei did not want to loose my ship while not even in the game so i logged back in it took me about an hour to log back in to find my ship stuck and non responsive to my commands once again next thing i knew i was killed and podded to my home systema good number of my friends all died while logged off due to game bugs and the mechanics and programming of the game failing to work as intended this is not acceptable given the amount of money we pay to play this game fleet battles are not working many of us are reconsidering whether we want to continue playing eve after recent events we need the game to support large battles at the moment one side gets major lag and cannot even get into gang and the other side gets free movement and no lag and can totally destroy the laggged out enemy this is not a fleet battle this is a fkn lag massacre we are not dying because our tactics are bad we are dying because the game cannot support large battles and continuously s us over with lagmany people logged off at safe tower then desynced then logged back in at spawned at the enemy tower what the hell is that for christ sakeplease fix the bloody game and address thisregardsvlade randalpvp director  hirr corporation

exactly what vlade said logged in after dt and after 20 mins waiting and finally loading there was no local or chat windows sat there trying to move for 20 mins and nothing responded however after that period of time i started taking damage sat there for another 30 mins still unresponsive and in the end said wtf am i even trying to dologged off and today am back in station in clone i mean i knew that would happen but get serious is that the best that can be doneprior to dt the lag was there but workablei mean the same old stuffguns taking 15 mins to cycle etc etcbut after dt absolutely rubbishi mean is this really what we are paying forreinforced nodes should be capable of performing better than thattotally right vlade
bump i wasnt in this particular fight but this has been an issue for quite some time the entire large scale combat system is in question at this pointmodule lag is one thing but the excessive desync and utter inability to make any action is completely unacceptable
its true ccp fail you should at least change this eve online  a massive multiplayer online roleplaying space game  becose massive multiplayer cant be done in eve you are lying to your customers
agreed it was quite ridiculous 4 hour fight and i only shot 10 volleys the entire time 15 minutes per command people dying to lag and not being able to login quite ridiculous in these situations it should be ccps to priority to keep things as smooth as possible i feel bad for the people that lost big stuff due to dcs and unrealistically terrible lag that is a lot of time and effort wasted
you got to shoot 10 i got about 6 off i was at least on 3 titan kills who knows how those happened due to the lag
ghost supers warping and moving themselves around eve i mean seriously wtf

it was the same heresitting in africa i accept a certain amount of lag but i think with the way the game has grown and the direction it went it is time that changes are madei was a player years back and back in the day even with the african lag we could pull fleet battles with minimal lagi know this is petty ing but it is getting to the point where i cannot be bothered to join fleet battles and would love to see a response from ccp in relation to this problem
i was among the lucky ones did not dced and was able to do one action every 35 minutes i warped off and back 3 times and i loaded grid in minutes totally i did in 4h a total of actions that would probably would have taken me about 3 minutes in normal game conditions if ccp finds this acceptable and they are happy with their amazing progress against lag than ok if not maybe they actually start doing something to be able to scale support for fleet battles unless their purpose is not more subscription and more ships dieing cause i thought that was the goal for them start acting acordingly  oh and hire some developers while youre at it dfreaking bump
agree  it would be one thing if these large battles were something that was not wanted by ccp but considering they are used in trailers to attract new players that can hardly be the case its time to put a little effort and developement into fixing some of the basic mechanics for a bit rather than some of the bells and whistles weve been getting lately example planetary interaction  it was all the rage for about a month after it was released but who even uses it now for gods sake please fix some of the existing problems when it says soul crushing lag your not lying
i was one of the lucky ones and after downtime fiasco with tool bars not showing menus not working align not working and all that i logged off for some miracle my ship actully disappeared unlike alot of the other players ships which ccp cant blame on agression timers being the reason why the ship stayed as some of the ships were still on grid after the user logged off an hour before just broken game like the enthusiasm and support the cause but ccp dont give a  lets face it they get there money amd we get standard mail saying the same old awnswers welcome to the massively online lag called eve
with all your new content added recently you seem to have totally forgotton about us out in 00we cant fight for our spaceour enemies cant take spacesince incursion there ahve been so many strange happens and bugs i even wrote a petition for one and got the same anwswer  its not uswell it is you cause its not us we log on to play internet spaceships you allow 1000 ships to be in the one system yet claim no responsibility for what happens afterwardsstop advertising epic fleet fights until you can prove they can actually take place and listen to the players
supportedwe all worked very hard and spent lots of time and money to get to this so call end game of eve online you know the this is eve part and it is in most cases not playable wtf ccp

same thing heretried to login after dti see entering game as blablabla and after waiting like 10 minutes i am entering game and see thatgf or no fightim looking at my wreck inside my shipwe are spending a lot of time and money to make these thingsbut in 10 min due to lag we are losing all of themand ccp doesnt care about itthats not fairlooks like eve losing its popularitybecause 00 pvp is dead
use your money to provide some sort of fix for all of this nonsense lag

i dont even go to large scale fights anymore i do not find it enjoyable clicking f1 button every 45 minutesthis isnt about our alliance tag it happens to all pilots in large scale fights sometimes you can be on the lucky side and  sometimes you will be in the receiving endmy personal choice is to simply keep away from these fights because i actually want to have a ship that reacts to commands or logs off when i have no aggro however if everybody did this nobody would contest sov the game urges us to continue jumping into these lag fights if we dont then alliances lose space
1 i support
when we were ordered to warp to safes it took me literally no serious not a guess it is how long it took 15 hours before the warp command was executed before dt it was a bit better serious was it moved to a nonreinforced node during dt but still horrible lag now some people will claim that when ccp improved performance we will just put more people on a node and it lags again they are right but that is not our fault that is ccps fault to be precise the idiots who designed dominion sov the only way we can defend our space or attack someone elses space is by stuffing as many people as possible on one grid sadly by changing it now ccp would have to admit it is a horrible failure and 18 months incarna and all that stuff it wont happen for a long time
basically 1however id state it this waygameserver should be able to detect when clientplayership arent controllable due to server side issues and at least make such pilots invulnerable to make if fair so those famous scenarios when you jump gates or cyno and that is last last moment when you controlled you ship before you find yourself in medical servise should not belong to game if you are not loaded grid if you blackscreened dont know why  you should remain untouchable because you simply can not protecttakecare yourself that is acceptable minimumas maximum we all could wish that such things wouldnt happen and even biggest fleet fights would happen without lag  but that is technical issues and we understand its naturebut still when you ship died in condition when you are not able to control it due to server side problems  it is not fair and makes any bad feelings like i didnt pay for it
i agree had almost identical situation lately made a petition and ofcourse got rejected the game is broken making locked out ship invurnerable or cloaked is a one part solution to this 1
it sucks if you get stuck for hours and hours duck shoot for one side massacre for the other it doesnt depend if we win or loose this sucks 
i dont know if the node of the system went from reinforced before downtime to sleeping hamsters afterwards  but this is not the way how this game should work yes there is lag in eve and ccp tries his best to fix it as someone mentioned before and they are improving it for sure  but they made adverts for big scale fights and the servers atm just do not look like that they support itso i just say continue the work in improving eve and please let players of all sides of a fight control their ships againwe as your customers want epic fights not click to wait fights
in before u mad and nc tears commments di couldnt even do anything in this battle ship was stuck before dt i was at our pos not able to get my damn ship moving after dt i was for some strange reason at the enemy pos and warped from there to the station on where i could donothing again and i have been in quite some 1500 fleet battles but this was probably the worst ever this game needs some serious work to be made playable again

same here im lost my carrier 7 hour later when jumped and logedccp give my carrier back
same experiences on all 3 accounts game is so laggy sometimes that you cant log off  your ship just stays there one account can log off and few hours later the ship and the character are still there how are we supposed to play like that you can kill people when they are offline for hours like thatnot to mention the entering space for like 2 hours after logging on but even if we dont have the clients open at all for hours we cant log off our ships even warp around by themselfsive died and made a petition about this aswell allready but i keep getting the same crap that you dont have log from it while the gm specifically said that you were aware they were issues lolstill no reimbursements this lag is the sole reason why i never even bothered to get a supercap im not going to have you kill it with your crappy servers and programming ccp
i support this i was not in this battle but i have been popped and podded hours after i logged off without aggro i am with anarchist uk i no longer go to big fights it is simply no fun having a ship that will not respond please fix this ccp
i support thisit is not like larger fleet fights is a new or unexpected thing in this game yet the lag only seems to get worse and worse with each patch with no sign of improvement
being stuck orbiting a station with my ship completly unresponsive for 1 hour recieving the soul crushing lag error is not what i pay for ccp fix the lag
three words ccp fix the game
eve is lining up that shark pond and racing towards it at 100 miles an hour can you fix your pathetic system before your player base jumps the sharkyou have repeatedly promised to fix lag 1500 in a system is nothing it was barely 5 of the logged in player base at the time  so there is no excuseand your pathetic puerile our logs show nothing is the kind of head in the sand approach to player management that led to the t20 debaclebut thats all right soon i will able to walk in a station shame i can never fly in space

the thing is the game engine is a little outdated it needs to be overhauled
interesting fact was the lag was actually manageable only took 1520 minutes to cycle weapons before dt but after it was purely sickening i think the node was not reinforcedlog in was blackscreened for 20 minutes after 5 minutes of being logged in chat windows and local froze local froze for me when it was at 1553 people that is about 400 less than during the height of the fight and when local was reported at 800 and dropping lag was actually worseit took an hour and a half to warp to the tcu at 30km during this time i was locking the station for 45 minutes till it actually lockedby the time i warp to the tcu there are reds and blues on fieldall blues and this is confirmed  all blues in our fleet and outside of it were stuck the caps supers and titans that were on station with me were actually logged off the whole time but never disappearedduring all this the reds drf were not stuck at all and could mobilize as they wanted this was confirmed as the op saida single abaddon targets me has 5 valkryies and artilleries on me at the tcu and dpses me as if there was no lag he cycles normally i log off because the warp i initiated to a safe pos when i landed on the tcu wont work and i know it wont take effect until 15 hours later at the tcu i am locking 5 targets for 1015 minutes none of them do lock of course i launch 3 garde iis and 2 warrior iis which never do leave my drone bay as i am taking damage from this abaddon who seems to have no problem while im still trying to lock him i decide to just log the hell out perhaps i can survive 15 minutes assuming i dont become a ghost yeah you guessed it  i die anyway in my death mail the drones i launched are still in my drone bay of course the warp i initiated to safe pos would not save me within 15 hours of getting hit by the lone abaddon and subsequent reds who did lock me in the time i logged off and in the next 10 minutes how were they able to do all this and blues were notfact if i stayed logged on  dead anyway if i warped anywhere dead anyway if i warped back to the station  dead anyway drf dropped bubbles and supers on the station again how were they able to do thisfinally i log in the next day today and find myself back in my clone station so after all that my pod was a ghost too and i was killed long after i logged offccp this is not acceptable this is sickening we pay real money for this the ones who dont rmt etc people have spent months months to acquire the amount of isk to buy these supercaps and they lose them when they are not logged onand how do you all reply to that standardized messages inhuman replies something has to change to the people who claim its our own fault for bringing too many numbers well slap yourself in the face right now this is war and in wars like this things are at stake that will affect thousands this is a battle weve fought for weeks where double digit titans and supercaps have already died we are a large alliance and we will keep bringing large numbers in real life war numbers make the difference so do not spew that bsccp the state of large scale combat is broken it needs to be fixed now i hope something is being done right now to address these issues just imagine how much fun a 2000 local fight would be with zero lag can you imagine the fun hell doesnt have to be zero lag even realistic lag but not being stuck for hours and losing major ships and isk without being able to do anything thats my dream ccp and the day this is fixed will be a good day i just hope something is being done about it

very unfair i logged off safe at dt in my maelstrom and logged back in 2hrs later to a smoking pod apparently the reds were shooting me for a very long time even though i was not logged in no survival chance at alland ccp refuses to reimburse this is completely unacceptableif the servers cannot handle something dont allow such a situation to occur limit the size of battles andor improve server performance
damn right son es better get that  rightwhooo weee ccp be popin these commercials with big o fleet fights and  cant eve activate moduals to pwn some mofos in the damn fights and  cant even log outta that  at a safe cause yall never be warping of grids and and den mofos be like we aint giving you squat back cause yall be fleet fighting and even though we advertise naggas popin that way our servers cant handle the  so yall aint getten yo ships back fix yo 
please ccp we want less crappy new features and more solutions to soul crushing lagplease fix the current game issues before trying to update the game to newer versionswe love the game you have created for us but you are crushing our souls with lag to the point that its not fun any more spend a little money and resources on better hardware and refined programming to reduce lag we want to have seamless fleet battles as featured in the eve promotional video please give us what we want
caricat savoia 
a few minutes lag or whatever were used to we accept that sure there might be soooo much demand on the server that it takes time to keep up with everyone what becomes something that we petition rightfully so but get slapped in the face with is submitting commands to our ship and seeing them stack up one by one in the soul crushing lag monitor only to have other pilots fly around with no lag killing you while all you can do is hope the game catches up and responds to your four hour old requests your only other option logout 4 hours ago to login and be respawned at a hostile location which you werent at before and get killed dieing in a fight is fine  we accept losses happen but seeing your kill mail appear when youre at work at the next day isnt a game you can be playing let alone one you want to play
the lag was terrible it was bad before dt 5 mins for every action but impossible after dt i tried to log in immediately but it took me more than 30mins and finally i logged off as my fleet has moved off grid i logged in another character 2 hours after dt it took me 70 mins to get into 020 30 mins to warp to pos and than 70 mins to jump out i was one of the lucky ones able to save my ship this game needs to improve we are all being killed by the soul crushing lagggggggggg
what makes matters worse last friday one of ccp was actually in system recording and gathering intel check the data with ccp veritas same system 3 days later ccp you honestly suspect that when the final timer comes out there will be less people inside on a sunday then on a friday maybe you should set a warning dont hold fleet fights at sundays cause we are not working i was one of the lucky ones that got my cap out after been blackscreened after a frozen game for 3 hours and dont hide behind the our logs dont show anything you have a setting to see listed commands and when there executed if a ship doesnt perform a command within 15 minutes it should have gone to emergency warp and be safe stop useing eve as a test platform for wod wod is a great game wich no doubt will be verry enjoyable but we would prefere to be actually play the game thats available now
our logs show nothing stfu angry customers what do you know about eve what is next you want well educated and intelligent gm staff get out now but leave your moneydo it like pl and move to xsyon runing around naked and ganking people gathering grass
supportedi hope we can get our drf friends to support this topic too as im sure they have the same experiences as usccp say they want 00 to be more dynamic maybe it would be if fighting over it wasnt such a pain in the behind
1to come at this situation constructively  many of us understand the nature of the players in the lagfest each side of the fight wants a bigger blob so more and more come in until we exhast the supply of players to join or the hamster explodes an awf
quite right
the solutuion is simple unfortunately unless you make it hurt ccp they will persist with their current course of action and this will be the way it will be you want results either take ccp to court over false advertising or demonstrate a commitment to make them suffer by restricting their income by canceling subscriptions and exercise the only real power you havethe game is bugged no denying it i was in the fight and could do stuff but it was not an acceptable situation the user interface needs some serious thread lovesorry for the pain but you all know the solution to your problem
fully supportedi wasted 4 hours for lag and then lost my carrier thanks ccp for another awesome gaming experience
priority server side disconnectsas a temporary solution ofcif a server can not recognize your clients status for a period of time server issues an emergency server side disconnect and removes your ship from the fieldit will not solve lag but it wont influence the battle either if you are unlucky enough to be stuck youve lost your play time for the night but at least you have a chance of seeing your ship after logging in the next day at least you could die only by the game mechanics and not because the company you are paying for does not have good enough server to handle the game mechanics offered and advertised
1 this problem is getting worse ccp is already losing players to the issue if this is not resolved or at least alleviated then more people will leave
supported
signed this game is doomed from view of many old players and new players if ccp dont chang its mechanics  it will bleed more and more players out of the game  there are so many good solution to create multiple objective battles in same times  so we are 200 vs 200 not 2000 vs 2000 but ccp keeps ignoring very good solutions posted on the forumsty signed
1 fix this
supportedccp you are clearly aware of when the lag is occuring is there nothing you can do to ensure the vital game mechanics stay functioning seperate server to track logoutdisconnects and their associated timers
sadly but ccp really needs to make some kind of hard limit on player count in a system say around 8001000 people if someone just blobs in 1000 members enemy just has to go to system near and take his rage there the defenders are forced to jump in and take them out if fc are stupid they will sit there and wine ccp are  smart will make it a playable game and try at least to stretch forces and play the damn gamereally it should be down to the members planing an attack just make a hard point to fc that if they will not stretch the forces you people will make your own fleet and go roaming and not to the event after 23 such messages they will have to think something because if enough people support such action there will be not much forces to attack at alli think ccp can do something but it will not be fast and it will limit the gameplay or something else its just damn hard to do something fast about iti think players should make a message to the alliance and corporate leaders really why not split in two groups with 300400 members in each and make a simultaneous attack in 2 directions enemy is overblobing your fleet of 300 with 800 get the hell out and go to different target while the second fleet rages through the enemy space because the its blob is somethere else there can be only 2 outcomes1 enemy splits its forces and you get plenty and probably almost lag free fights something of 700800 pilots total2 enemy stays in blob  1 fleet gives a quick pounding of the infrastructure  poses bridges outposts second makes the blob to try and catch them  plays cat and mouse and takes down whatever it can reach maybe the fleets will switch the roles from time to time when the enemy blob switches the targets anyway blob will have hard time to catch 2 more mobile fleetseverything is in our heads we have to start with ourselves if our leaders make it a target  lag the enemy to hell  then the leaders has to be poded by the fleet as the protest
i cant really support this ideafirst off the problem isnt ccp there is no game that can support more than ccp can in a single battlepl vs a and friends has been having lag free fights the trick dont cram 900 of your own side into a system thats already past the server limit so anything more makes it crawlthe technology does not exist on the planet that you can have 1200 vs 1200 battles that are lag free we dont have the infrastructure for that fast of transmission and processors are not advanced enough to process fast enough to control that much
fix the lag
hiwhen you came to system with 2000 ppl you can expect lag i have one mesage this game should be  a massive multiplayer online roleplaying space game  ccp told us on web and when you look at promotional videos there are epic fights with even all efects on so i dont know how about iceland but in my country its even crime told customer something what isnt trueyeah they are definitly have something in eula what makes imposible to demand qualitythis games is played about 50000 ppl in same time so you can exept even 3000 in system you can call me crazy but i am not if they made game which cant handle itthey should setup limit to max players online then and not only take our moneysif they cant handle numbers then separate regions and make more servers do what you want but server should handle at least 14 ppl in one place you told us every pilot can join corporation which is part of alliance and together rules parts of the universe  from one of your own videos  something like that was in one of them i have to ask you force us to cooperate as much as we can and when we do you crying you cant handle 2000ppl in system thats realy crazy dont want to be rude ccp but you force me and i am not only one who think about end up with this game becouse of this lagfest my opinion is go back to beta if you cant solve it and made it free becose you take money and do nothingyou had a plenty plenty of time to solve these problems there are new patches and problem is still there if you cant solve this and you probably cant then you should make some changes not meet so many ppl in one systempls fix 00 fighting and systems lag end thanks for atentionsorry  my english is not so good but i have to wrote this
i support this i have lost a ship to this lagg fest in 020 and i couldnt get a new ship because of the large fleet battles ccp needs to do something or make it free we pay for this game and expect to get our moneys worthccp needs better quality service
yes plz fix the lag before bring new useless  like pi
this is because pl and a are much smaller entities than those fighting in the north its a totally different scale of war in geminate there are more pilots more alliances and more supercapitals involved this creates a need for more resources than the smaller fights you are referring to
the problem is ccp and only ccp nice no other game can support more than eve in one fight but the issue is that no other game has game mechanics that requires that unlike eve sure the nc or the drf can decide they wont put more than 200 people in a system that side loses any war the entire 00 sov mechanics are atm only about putting as many people as possible on one grid other games might not support battles the size of eve but they have better mechanics where such blobbing is not a requirement in eve you just have to do it if you want to keep your space it is not optional
i lost more ship in my eve life while offline or being unable to react then i lost while being online or being able to do anything one of the main reasons im nowhere to be seen in eve recently
i believe we should divide the problem into 2 parts1st  thats the lag which is fine blame and flame all you want  but expecting lag free battle with 2k players in local is just unrealistic 20mins cycling  dying without knowing it till it is too late etc well this is what we sign up for when we w8 at a titan bridge rdy to jump in a system with already lots of pilots inside2nd  game mechanics  server  client issues since we do sign up for that stuff not because we want to crush the nod or because we are mazochists  but because we cant stand letting our brosefs die while we make iskies its ccps minimum obligation to protect our assets when we are not logged in i dont care how they do it they must do it it is beyong comprehension to loose assets when you are not even logged in perhaps ccp should make a real time combat limit to 15k players  and above that number implement a turn based fleet vs fleet mode that is playable only by the fcwingsquad commanders or everyone somehow i dont know large fleet fights are turn based as they are anyway with clicking  watching the monitor window for outstandings  clicking  w8ing  and so on the irony is that ccp invited all these pilots into 00 when they implemented the dominion expansion im not judging  i actually prefer it from shooting poses down to take sov  but i think its safe to make some conclusions now about how that expansion influenced 00 afairs
i look at it this wayfirst of all i totally agree with randel 110secondly they do more and more new stuff new feature instead of making what they have atm work perfectlythey need to concentrate about making what they have work and iUFFFDm sure this will make all of the players in eve happyby now ccp should be able to handle big fights in eve hell they can handle 1200 something in jita with out much lagthey  ccp have even made a form to send in before big fights but it seems it has had no effecti do not wanna loose anymore ships due to lagblue
so you are wondering about lag while there are like 2000 players on grid seriously i bet when ccp makes 2000 men battles lagfee the nc will simply bring 4000 people and keep ing about the lagactually the nc is only bithching about the lag they cause only when they loseface it this fight against the lag is one that cant be won by ccp because huge power blocks will simply keep bringing more people as long as the game mechanics necourage them to do so in order to win
pl and a have battles with low lag in delve atm with around 700ish in local tell your overlords to cancel some blue standings and you can have fun again
and get overrun by drf who do bring then 1k pilots the first group here that decides to bring less people loses in the last part you show you understand it so why the first part if the server can handle 2k people we will indeed bring more than that but that is simply because bringing alot of people is not optional in sov fights more people is always better if we dont do it our opponents do it the issue is ccps horrible sov mechanic blobbing the crap out of a node isnt fun but it is the most effective way if you want to keep your space
in general i support the ideahowever while the lag situation with all its perks 1015min cycle time soulcrushing lag messages ships dying half an hour after being shot and warping out etc is something that certainly has to be worked on it is also something everybody more or less willingly accepts when jumping into a laggedout system im not saying its not relevant but ccp knows this and raging about it at this point wont help the processthe main problem i see here and the one that really causes a lot of anger is that in the current state of the server you can lose your ship despite having logged out or crashed hours ago many nullsec dwellers live by the philosophy that once you undock your ship in 00 you accept and eventually expect to lose it fine but efforts should be made to ensure that as soon as an account is offline and their aggression timer is up their assets are invulnerable losing ships while at work  in bed with your computer turned off is not part of the dealevery single fleet battle is essentially a showcase for a prisoners dilemma case with bringing as many pilots as you can always being the dominant strategy that has nothing to do with who is involved any side in any conflict opting for the inferior strategy of just bringing a few hundred would inevitably get obliterated now i am fairly certain ccp understands this premise and within current game mechanics there is nothing either they or the players can do to solve itbut there was a feature announced once that might have helped a bit anyone remember treaties sure nobody brings 200 people when the opponent has 600 at the ready but what if the leaders of the involved parties could sign an ingame treaty voluntarily limiting their fleet size to a certain number a small breach of that treaty within a margin of error of say 10 would result in a reasonable fine but if any side decided to bring significantly more than agreed to they would automatically forfeit their strategic goal usually sovrelated

because eve is a sanbox and because huge power blocks are a part of the problem alliances like pl ncdot and ev0ke have desided to stay small in order to keep having fun in eve nc and drf could simply cancel 50 of their blue standings and the problem would vanish for the most part and everyone would have more fun again alternatively ccp could nerf the ability to gather blobs by removing jbs and nerfing cynos or limit the ability of power blocks to be big by imposing some kind of limits to blue list or the maximal number of players in an alliance however i promise you that such limitation would cause the playersbase to outrage even more just look at the jb discussion in this thread plus the to didnt  about the game mechanics but about the inability of ccp to fix lag and it is funny how nc never es when they win thank to the lag they cause or successfully crash the nod on purpose thus the right question here is not why cant ccp fix the lag but why are powerblocks able to or rather do gather such huge fleets and according to the opening post this thread is about the first question thus this thread here is just ridiculous and doesnt help at all
ncdot recruited everyone with a pulse to outblob the localssure the nc can split up then soon again we are back together under our new russian overlords the most effective method to keep your sov or get new sov is simply outblobbing your opponent of your examples pl does not actually want to keep the sov and evokenc have an interesting way of intentionally staying small considering the margin at which they outnumbered the locals in fleets you do realise evoke couldnt achieve anything until nc came along to provide more numbers and especially supercaps no disrespect towards evoke
UFFFDve have not been playable for more then a year in my opinion
bump
i am not an ev0keexpert but i do read en24 propaganda as far i remember there are only few battles where you see ev0ke and nc together ev0ke has the problem that they dont have us tz players and this is where nc helps them outthe search function of en24 helps here as well
signed and before all you russiansex tri mk 352 and butthurt pandemic legion toons type in umad it is the same for drf etc than it is for us the other night we got lucky and d their face due to them being stuck then 2 days later we get our faces d due to being stuckwhat im saying is this game really is at the end of the road if this carries onalot of us are at the end of our patience with you ccpsosort your fg st game or we take our money elsewhere
welp my opinion just another one of those times when the ccp staff is just too busy or too arrogant to take care of business yes the game is screwed up and its our fault lol its always our fault and ccp will take this position every time unless you have proof positive come on guys shouldnt it have been obvious to the ccp staff that this system and the surrounding systems should have been perma reenforced this is real simple stuff here i cant tell you how many times ive lost a ship to this exact situation you know in a good fight if we loose a ship at least we get the satisfaction of a real fight loosing it this way is just shtbottom line is total disappointment with this be advised ccp my playing buddies decide there going to migrate to a different platform where you think im going to go by the way here are just a few of the gtcs ive purchased and sold in the last year code gswusjhbr96sxp4n code gsxdcths7xqkgvcz code gsxejmynmegckc6y code gsxez3qc5djq67f8 code gsy5byv932cghapl code gsysfmqmadwy8e5e code gsyvf2xr85vpmrap code gsz9d5ub5jly9mew code gszhhm6gf79q98fe code gszpplpsue4nrx6j code gt2bfvhrq7bknk4m code gt2dvx7nvj4ebq7z code gt2sa62hxdbstjgn code gt4sh6y2uhznx98g code gt4t2a398mmx5gu4 code gt5uzx494fkp8h22 code gt8eu55texexy37x code gt8kn89xg2ua9r54 code gt9qups2sv8d4kmr code fba8nslkal3cgwar code fbalf4l3xr4nbbrj code fbavd4brr9h2fsh8 code fbbavwf2dbszjwkl code fbc4fxwa5xwqsz95 code fbc4wgayyb6xb8qh code fbcdlm7pfjjwaqa2 code fbcgrnmjcgjwsa6a code fbcr645fuq43zcjd code fbct699d7y5tba6t code 7vxpfkx6fkhqjxq5 code 7vxr3aqrgza96xz7 code 7vy4r2ayx3bxhk4r code 7vypdy6cufufzevg code 7vz7ezr2nfgn3l8s code 7vzf38nxzqhsr9fw code 7vzfdch56rd2bmng code 7vzgjfpdhra3nxxc code 7vzhyw3k6lksb9e3 code 7vzugk7jc665qwey code zzt7lqhvbkj2f9yc code zzt84qxh3jwp3s6k code zzt87sp9f5rn5as7 code zzt9nw7zlwscf298 code zztbtgtfm9k7kd4k code zztcraftwrhpdmjm code zztczh3ncbt4rw85 code zztdcg4tykzb5ycz code zztdvcm9muc8xyqq code zztef6qmr4prz6s5

not working as intended
the problem is ccp if you cant eliminate lag at least you can offer some kind of customer service its not a client side error its not related to the quality of your connectionits not your isps faultits not users errorits not playing outside of game mechanicsits ccps direct responsibility to handle this situation because its happening on their server infrastructure and their server side codelosing your ship due to lag became acceptable in eve losing your ship several hours after being kicked out of the server is incompetence of ccp and their sole responsibility if they wont reimburse ships for reasons stated in devblog the least they can do is patch the server code to remove your ship from the field when you get the black screenthat is not messing with the outcome of the battle or showing favouritism to any side involved if you cant even log in and you got kicked out because of server halt not lag  complete stop then your ship shouldnt be on the field in the first place you still lose your paid game time by not being able to log in which has to be fixed too but for a start at least they should provide some kind of customer serviceafter all if removing of ghost ships gets the highest priority possible and actually works complete halt would maybe be reduced to lag only thats far from a solution but its a start
having lost an erebus after being logged out and on an alt for 1h 15 mins and then having my pod killed at 9h15mins from logout id say ccp has some work ahead of them but ofc tyhey just say your the one bringing the numbers nothing we can do well its now gotten to the point were 00 is conbsidering testing the limits of empire nodes consider it a promise or a threat of briniging the issue to light from those that wil lcomplain and do the choice of hitting quit faster
may i ask you somethingwhen you hit the jump to 020 button while sitting in your erebus and knowing that there are like 1000 players in system what did you expect to happen
1 supported an unresponsive pilotship should not be on grid at all  disconnect would be the easiest solutionon a personal note i know how hard it is to implement a good load balancing cluster but a node should never let 1000 people into a system i
joining fleet battles with supercarriers and titans is just suidice atm ccp must fix this throwing all those good titans and scs to die in lag is crazy
game exactly works as intended by both ccp and the ncccp says massive fleetfights and afaik having 400 players in system without mentionable lag is achievablenc says cram the target system until our enemies cant fight and by bringing 2000 players this is also achievable drf might call the same tactic but i donUFFFDt speak enough russian to quotei promise should ccp ever manage to support all nc ships in one system there will be another move your bookmarks or drop containers initiative to generate enough lag to have something to cry about and petition when ships get welped if all this doesnUFFFDt help some hostile entity will be called cheater botter or whatever seems to be an acceptable excuse for oneselves failjumping a titan into a system everybody knows to be crammed and laggy and loosing it only means one thing pilot and fc failed to eat enough brains for breakfastnothing more nothing less ccp made a sandbox they allow players to ruin their own fun through their own actions this is not a fault  this is simply an different concept than teletubbies online
ill answer for him we all expect this to happen logging in pvp combatif you are in pvp combat your ship will warp to a random point and remain there for 15 minutes unless its being warp scrambled in which case it will be at the mercy of your enemies if your ship is blown up after you log out your pod will remain for another 15 minutes which is plenty of time for a resourceful player to find it using scanner probessource
i have seen this happen too often and is getting worse instead of improving large scale battle is one of the best features of the game if it is broken so is the game it isnt much of a victory when you are on the side that isnt lagged to death more like shooting fish in a barrel the vast majority of players prefer a more sporting scenariolosing an expensive ship because you are on the lagged out side is bs and a reason to look at new avenues of entertainment on which to spend money
no youUFFFDre expecting heavy lag und unforseeable consequences that why both sides bring that amount of peopledonUFFFDt tell everyone youUFFFDre stupid and donUFFFDt know what happens when you enter a 2000 players system with a supercapstop whining and accept reality itUFFFDs simply and only your fault
eve used to lag out with 100 people they fixed that then people brought 200 and crashed it so ccp improved it further now youre ing about having 2k people on grid crashing the game the problem is not the game its you the hardware and code can only support so much eve is designed to not have hard limits but ffs keep it reasonable
supported
ive bought myself a new computer it has a quad core processor which allows me to open several applications at the same time last night ive been working on my masters thesis i kept the word file open and forgot to save it then i opened 20 eve clients and the computer crashed it didnt even let me enter error mode to close some eve clients so i can save my thesis should i sue the manufacturer
lost my hel the same way supercarrieroriginally intended to have a corporation take months and months to build and constructunintended to die to reds while not piloted or able to for 3 hoursi also love how the gms close you petition and you dont get to rate them if it was because of this situation
if money is the only thing they care about wait until those huge alliances all leave
not much to look for after empire i guess 
ffs i wish people would read the topic before making such posts yes the first part is true but only because ccps sov mechanics force you to blob there is no choice if you want to keep your space when a large block attacks besides cramming as many people as possible on one gridso the conclusion is it is ccps fault not because the node cant support 2k people well the issue was mainly after dt when the funny people at ccp apparently decided to move it from a dedicated node but because the node cant handle the amount of people required to defend your sov per ccp mechanics
depends if it actually killed your computer or not since its working as intended to crash your eve clients instead of burning up
no the manufacturer in that case is not responsible the responsible party in that case is system administrator which is you if you did something wrong or havent done necessary steps to save your work you are responsible for any damagejust like ccp is responsible for functioning of their servers and server side game code they didnt make sure to cover the possibility of a large fleet engagement which is advertised and supported by the game mechanics and servers halts with their hardwaresoftware configuration they didnt implement a failsafe server side code to make sure you dont lose ships hours after logging off and they are not providing any customer support whatsoever whose fault is it customers
i love this thread
so when microsoft  intel give me a system and promise that it can handle several applications and i overload it it is my fault but when ccp gives you a clientserver that is supposed to handle big fleet note a fleet of 300 is also big fights and you overload it because ccp gives you the freedom to do so but you know from experience that it will happen since it is simply impossible to handle this numbers it is ccps fault
so jumping into o2o as the pilot of some supercap doesnUFFFDt make you responsible but the admin of that pc islolsounds like those s thinking cruise control allows you to make coffee in the back of a caravan while being the driver on a highwaythe problem is not weird things happen during lag the problem is to bring more people than a system is capable of supporting on purposeccp should just dissolve entities trying to damage their server using such tactics
ccp advertin this video ccp says a battle between thousands of players and its their advert so ccp fix ur game and then ur claims through adverts will be validalso the thread wasnt about lag yes we know when we jump to every 020 as every one else its about the bugs of server side code and one major bug is the inability for ur ship to dissapear from local after the 1 or 15 countdownalso ccp a suggestion reduce the number of fighters and fighter bombers make them 5 and only pump their hp and dps to match the 10 or 20 deployed by carriers and scs then the crashing and bugged bombers will be less and ur node performance will be improvedfor me as a paying costumer makes me angry that ccp has a jitanode of supporting 2k and they cant offer same nodes for large battles in 00
so is this an official statement  theatening ccp to damage their nodes if they donUFFFDt act in a way that supports your group of playerwhat would you think to be an appropriate response here just ban you as the threatening person or dissolve your whole group as they are  by implication  the tool to make the threat realwhat you donUFFFDt want to go that farthen stop talking about legal  like in their announcement bla bla they promised me youUFFFDre playing the game long enough to exacly know what to expect and whenstop whining when things work exactly as usual
exactly in a clientserver environment i did everything in my power that my client will function in optimal conditions got the hardware configuration that can handle the client closed all applications stopped download reduced graphics to minimum removed brackets etc as a client side administrator ive covered every single possible issue and made sure everything runs smoothly as a user i also made sure to get all failsafes in place jumped to a combat clone checked if the clone is updated and updated it if it wasnt insured the shipon ccps server side theres something wrong either hardware or software or both they havent done enough to keep the server functioning or implemented any fail safe in case something goes wrong and its going for a too long period of time now but they refuse to provide customer support or build the fail safe server side mechanism that works as quoted above
jeah fleet fights are brokenbut so is ccp customer service
the server limits are well known just because they are no hard limits doesnUFFFDt mean they donUFFFDt existyou and your fc made the decision to jump into that system while perfectly knowing all possible consequenceslet me guess you always choose the road that has reported traffic jams and blame the state when youUFFFDre fired due to being late
this
yes server limits are well known  but only in jita because of the artificial cap since their halfdone broken sov warfare mechanics is still in its original dominion form capping the nullsec system isnt an option before everything gets sorted out on that side how about just a little fix like a priority failsafe server side code to handle ghost ships its not that hard
my thoughts exactlythread fully approved ccp if youre doing something feel free to share with us because right now its nothing but lag and bad gm policy all around
1will consider cancelling next sub for both my chars next round if gms keep pushing this off instead of admitting the problem in the system and trying to fix it i understand that its a difficult problem  thousands of players on a node is a tough one
how about joining a smaller alliance like pl or ncdot isnt that hard
supportedcurrently i wont go on the large fights anymore the lag is just too frustrating and not worth losing a ship over take for example the fight in uemon that was the biggest cluster ive ever seen people called it an epic fight and id agree if the lag wouldnt have been so massive people being logged off for hours or entering a command hours ago and not getting a server response is just unacceptable think about a fight as big as the one in uemon if there had been little to no lag that would have been truely epicfor eve to continue to be a truely dynamic user influenced game something needs to be done about large scale fleet warfare because these battles are only going to continue to grow
renault advertyou see the cars are extremly safe go ahead and try such crash with a renault should be safe right
10
ya i should leave the corp and friends ive been playing with for 2 years and join because pl and ncdot are nascent little alliances im sure they would just welcome a couple of thousand mmmeragerazor pilots with open armshow about ccp fixing the game like other mmos do isnt that hard
what mmos allow you to have 1000 players at the same spot the most of them have more than one serveryou could also simply reset your standings to the rest of nc there are many ways how the players can solve thisccp could of course impose limits on alliances so that they cant form such big fleets anymore however such an action by ccp would cause epic outrage by this very same alliances that dont understand why the server cant handle 2000 people in one system
supported
lag and server crashes impact players in other regions than 00customer support handling the issue does not existplayers should be able to play together if they want toenough reasons for me to support this
ships shouldnt get blown up when the players that were controlling them get kicked from the game or dont even load the system1
1 to this idea just because theres nothing between fixing the game and this proposal except trolls who use inappropriate rl analogies
so u mean that they missleading us and they talk trush we agree on thatofc and they r trolls thats the reason they use alts

supportedccp is about to lose customers because they cant provide the product they say they can sov battles are not supportable by this company either they have to set a hard limit for maximum number of players allowed on a node at any point in time so that lag is not a factoror tey need to be able to stand behind their claims and support their nodes to the nth degree when size doesnt matterlag losses are this companies responsibility period end of story your product can not do what you say it should be able to do and therefor ccp is responsible for that loss one side can not effectivly fight the other how exactly does ccp consider this a fair and legitimate loss reallyim at the point where i will not fly in large fleets because this company can not provide the environment where large fleets ca both act and fight at the same time in real time this isnt a feature i am willing to continue to pay for and ccp continue to fail at providing either you can do it or you cant it works or it doesnt ive paid for this feature for 6 years now and it still doesnt work how much longer do you think im going to continue to pay for services that ccp can not provide not long at all ccp not long at all
best proposal ever notjust provide all the cowards with just another way to save their internet spaceships just in case anything goes wrong and the enemy actually shows up just another addition to your stupid blobbage and logoffski warfaremaybe stop cryin iUFFFDm gonna quit if you donUFFFDt give me my carelessily lost ship back and actually quit solves multiple problems at once
this needs to be the absolute top priority on ccps agenda not incarna not wis not highsec neutral rr mechanics not drakes not evefps not world of twilight not fanfest not at9 not hiding cams in stevies bathroom not superior white elephants or new ship skins or music videos or chess boxing every ccp employee from the ceo to their illegal immigrant mexican janitors at the georgia office need to be in on fixing the god damn lag
just say it like you mean itccp give us with all the ships that we carelessily lost back and just keep our enemies ships downor isnUFFFDt that politically correct enough for you
bump support agree this issue has not changed or improved in 4 years maybe its time to set some priorities
it already has priority at ccpthis is just the same thing as everytime this entity loses a fight players not getting the concepts of technical limitations into their strategies loosing internet spaceships and assigning blame to ccp afterwardstears tears tearsjust imaginge the tears that would be spawned by a technetium rebalance hilarious iUFFFDd really like to know the specious arguments that would be provided by the same group of players
supportedwe pay for a fun and functional service please hold up your end of the bargain ccp
something likethank you ccp you first let our ships die in lag and then take our tech so we cant replace them and have to buy gtc money is the only thing you care about dont you
hahaaaahahahahahahaaaso where are the drf tearsthey also died in lag and  oh wonder  donUFFFDt have tech to replace their losses for free shouldnUFFFDt they cry for some free ships firstoh wait this is the moment someone plays the evil botter empire card right
supported one thing to die in a fair fleet fight another to die when your not in game please fix fleet battles
especially when goons refuse to show up in order to crash the node and post funny gifs and internal chat logs on kugu instead
since when is fair fight the new agenda for the ncoh wait it isnUFFFDt nice pun
funny thing i never said just the nc i think anyone that lost a ship to these pitiful conditions should get there ship replace yes anyone but that would be good service something ccp seriously has a problem with
totally agree with this  there is absolutely no fun in big fleet battles because of lags ccp needs to fix this  even if it means breaking the fight up into a number of sub fights  i suspect that simple math n in fleet  nn interactions means that ccp cant even keep up as it isal irksome
i agree that a bit of node lag is a problem and more so when it involves a fleet battle eve is about that right at least a small part of it is dont give me this crap about it not being massively multiplayer though when was the last time you saw an mmo aside from eve that could get more than 20 players in the same instance without lag occuring right neverfleet battles are however an advertised and celebrated part of 00 life in eve they should be more easily managed and nodes should be capable of handling them the problem is reinforced or not the nodes and servers they are attached to dont have the ability to handle the  you guys throw at them when ccp comes out with a fix or buys a bunch of newbetter servers 00 decides its time to up the ante and brings another 1000 people thats the real problemgoonswarm is what now something like 5900 members fleet battles occur with excess of what 3000 players you guys are killing not just each other but the servers meant to handle the battle and resulting load sure they can be betteri could and very nearly have designed servers that exceed the specifications of the ones ibm designed to ccps specifications they would be marginally more costly but could handle the load required as things stand the problem is that the 00 crowd would just seat another 1500 pilots and wed be back to where we were before the problem with ship loss and log outs i understand can be annoying chances are you lost it anyway and just dont know it are you sure clientside hardware has nothing to do with that at least in some small partheres the deal lag sucks but your computer and the servers can handle it mostly but when you get alphad suddenly that little bit of code that handles clientside details skips a beat everything was fine until your clientside data exploded right before your ship decided to and your client froze okay pure speculationi do know however that that little login glitch so often described here happens one out of 10 times i login it doesnt matter where i am heres the key its a minor little bug or memory leak that just craps out when you load your client call it internet traffic downstream gateways and ip routing or whatever but somehow the messages dont all get through and your client doesnt entirely load now ive personally got about 20 down and 1 up and it doesnt get any better without spending over 1000 on my connection thats the limit on local highspeed on the upside and about 4 shy on the downside around here causes some problems and a few dropped connections with ventrilo and eve when the local traffic constricts the flow thats not the problem somewhere down the pipeline things are jamming up and traffic is bottlenecking and packet loss is occurring not often but enough could a fix to the client cure this i have no idea i am pretty sure a bit of code could be cleaned up and better optimized for throughput clientside code but thats allhow does that cause you to take 4 hours to log in it doesnt and thats the point whats causing 4 hour log in times is you insistence on bringing everybody to the party pushing the servers beyond expectations and consistently organizing bigger and more demanding fleet battles im not sure thats fixable
supported please fix the lag
you want the janitors working on the code wow just wow what is he gonna do keep the keyboard clean maybe warm the chair at night
lots of text  and no actual explanation why you propose these changes all i get is vague mention about neutral repping is this a problem of a fit system 
agreeing with di mulle no explanations of why the current system should be changed and since usually there are no complaints about it i fail to see whats wrong with itthis step aside i see a major drawback to your system no more adaptability each ship would become rolespecific and we would see a whole range of hybrid fits disappear im thinking of the dominix missionsrats grinder usually we use an armor active tank but you can easily be more effective with a semipassive shield tank using your system we should probably restricted to just one tanking methodso not agreeing with your idea you should have take a tour through the feature and idea discussion forum firstly
drakes have good dps l3rn2f1ti love killing intys with missiles i think its hilarious and very easyoh and kinetic hole on ships ever heard of t2 minnie ships they love engaging caldari missile boats
lol fail post of the year
seriously you do get good dps out of drakes if you dont passive tank them which is the impression im getting from everyone in here saying drakes dont deal dps you must be doing it wrong if you cant get at least 500 dps out of them
a 3 bcs hml buffer fit pvp drake get 400 dps kinetic and 300 dps anything else with max skills in game kinetic deals much less dps than em or explosive 3 shield expander rigs leave no room for missile rigs it wont hit the broad side of a barn worse if t2 instead of faction ammo they are overtanked sheeps individually only dangerous in blobs where they dont die drakes were the laughing stock for pvp for a long time with the same stats the only difference now is blobs grew larger
dont nerf drakes unless your going to remove them from game coz i hate themon the other hand there is nothing wrong with them apart from low dps wich is made up for by numbers i love killing themif your going to nerf them remove them alltogeather because like most caldari ships they are as ugly as i am with a hangover
you can only even try to argue that the drake is unbalanced under very specific and limited cases outside of those cases the fitting capabilities and attributes of the drake are as limited and specific as any other tier 2 bc ive fitted drakes harbingers hurricanes and myrimidons before and they all have similar problems and limitations when attempting to fit for just about any situation
i agree that the drake seems overpoweredbut since you can technically train for any ship in eve to fly it without a fair nerf i would leave it as ismy arguement for the drake is that it can solo c2 wormholes and c3s easily but any other bc cannotbut then again anyone can train for it  so its not such a big big issue in my eyes
i agree drakes are not balancedthey should get increased powergrid because having a little bigger powergid than a thorax is a disgrace it should also have an option to fit active tank like cyclone for example which can be passive tanked too because caldari as a shield race does not have an active shield tanked battlecruiseroh and while were at it its not fair that missiles take damage reduction on all ship movement and cant even hit a target when its moving fast enough even on a straight line while all gun based weapon systems take damage reduction only when theres a high traversal and will always hit a target moving on a straight line
confirming draketrain is totes op
you need to learn too english how to workingglad someone was able to figure out what you were trying to say though
been talked about for ages but with a shiny new topic here on ccp sucks cause the game crashed when we tried to put 2k players on grid brings it back to the front we have blobs in eve because the only counter to a blob is a bigger blob irl the counter to the blob is itself aoe splash damage and so on there comes a point where bringing more simply means you lose more it doesnt enhance capabilities this real world mechanic needs to be imported into our virtual worldlos is a tricky issue particularly in highlow sec with gcc mechanics so ill leave that out for now instead lets bring in some proper antiblob aoe the key to antiblob aoe is it must be low damage but with a wide aoe the reason is simple if its high damage it actually encourages more blobbing the weapons must be weak enough that it only makes sense to use them against large concentration of targets where a little damage across lots of ships ultimately means lots of damage this also allows for some new ship classes to specialize in it so heres what i have in mind feel free to modify and pick it apartscripted smartbombs unscripted have their current stats with a range script we get massively enhanced range but greatly reduced damage a large named smartbomb would have range increased from 5km to 20km and damage reduced from 300 to 50 normal smartbomb rules for gcc and aggro would still apply use in high sec at your own riskstrategic bomber new t2 bc that specializes in bomb launching it would not get a cov ops cloak or any other sb type bonuses it would be a bomb delivery system with the following attributes 100 bomb velocity 100 bomb blast radius can fit 4 bomb launchers simultaneously base resists should be inline with css additionally all of them should receive a 5 per lvl resistance bonus and 10 to shieldarmor hp im thinking of a damnation with 4 bomb launchers basicallythe purpose of these two things is to try to get fleet sizes under 100 anything above that becomes a lagfest and tbh even once above 50vs50 player skill largely become irrelevant anyways so its a bad mechanic really this is accomplished with these two additions by giving fleet sizes diminishing returns sure you can bring 1000 smartbombing bss but youll lose 999 of them to your own smartbombs if you do
instead of scripted smartbombs how about scripted doomsdays unscripted is the single target massive damage as it currently is and scripted dd is a low damage say 100k with the ae size of remote ecm bursts 20k this would give fleets the ability to remove massive numbers of support ships if coordinated properly with multiple titans and bring back the scary part of titans being on the field
aoe by nature brings its very own lag problems while one massive aoe blast doesnt hurt that much a gazillion weak aoe blasts for the same effect are costly
so in other words bring caps or gtfo for fleet combat
there is no lag without blob there is no lag once ppl are popped and podded bring back the aoe torps
no bring an imagination to what sort of ships you bring small sig fast ships or dont blob all your ships into one ball
hello allthe following has been bothering me for a while technetium is insanely overpriced and is giving the few powerblocks that hold them an insane advantage for instance if one block holds 50 moons for a month which is not an exception they gain 65 bil  50  324 billion each monththis is isk that can be used to manipulate the game even further and will provide the means to keep holding these moons also you have to realize this is isk that will never leave the game in the end nobody will be able to withstand these few individuals no matter how good they are and eve will have been broken the holders will be able to buy high sp characters for their newer players replace unlimited ships  caps buy gametime for alts  superalts prevend newer players to grow into their own entities because they will never be allowed to get a foothold hire unlimited amount of mercs raise prices on markets to their advantage etcand all to relative little or no effortin conclusion the longer you allow this scam to live the stronger the holders will get and the less fun it will become for the rest of eve that tries to achieve something by hard work and dedication right now the organization behind the ones that hold the moons is not strong enough but once it is theres no fixing it anymore there will simply be to much isk in the hands of some individuals even if they get defeated at some point they can start a new army on the fly and retake what was theirs under a different namein short this has to stop  i hope you agree
i know a good way to stop tech deficit  stop buying t2 but actually its not a problem with technetium reduce consumption of tech and next big thing will be neodimium then something else the problem is with moons producing the same amount of materials as years ago while t2 demand growsthere should be a fix to moon mining maybe allow individuals mine some smaller quantities of moon minerals with pilike mechanics have separate material abundance in moons for these prospectorsrp explanation can be it is not feasible to mine small depleateable deposits with a pos moonminer
feel free to come and conquer our moons
from
i like that ccp referance only thing is that the reason that this is possible is because of a big scam therefore it is a scam itself and should be against the eulaif you think that t2 building actually made the price this high you should wonder why the price didnt go up when t2 was first introduced
im not seeing an actual proposal as to what to do about it but the problem isnt with tech its with moon mining in generalop shows a fundamental lack of understanding of economics there is always a choke point give all choke points a release valve and its possible to keep all prices balanced to whatever ratios are desired the big issue isnt that tech is too valuable its that one mineral is valuable because a special interest group can control its sources its also showing that the alchemy mechanic is failing is tech even covered by alchemy isnt tech an r32 and only r64s are coveredi do support that a more permanent and thorough solution to the moon mining bottlenecks be implemented
im not sure i understand this sentence are you saying that tech moons are giving out isk how much isk can you fit in a silo
the north is ready for the taking all you need is a few thousand dedicated pvprs a couple hundred super caps and plenty of spare replacements and fcs who know how to run major cap fleets during every time zone when you get all that together youll fix the tech moon problem 1 support
your story is full of poopyany friendly remote act by a neutral upon anybody with an aggression timer will transfer that aggression to the neutral any friendly remote act by a neutral upon anybody with a live wardec will gain an aggression timer and turn red to anyone the target is at war within simple people talk if a remotely transfers cap sensor boosts armor rep shield rep or hull rep to b then a goes red to anyone that can currently shoot b

ccps complete failure to even acknowledge this issue is disgusting
restoring 00 mechanics there have been so many ideas for this i propose a mixture of all of them the tldr version is this sov has 3 levels that affect different areas of control system sov constellation sov and regional sov as you lose sov in these areas of space a steam roll affect happens that allows attackers to gain momentum by dropping more defenses this means that you cannot just welp a timer or a single system and be ok the more advances an attacker makes the better they will perform in the future to prevent fortressing system sov  directly impacts upgrades to a system in financial terms this means ratting mining pos fueling once you lose system sov there is a 7 day period of claim required before you can online an ihub station can only be repaired in armor and reinforcement timers are reduced by 1 day constellation sov directly affects jump bridges  requires 50 control of a constellation in order to maintain jump bridge networks jump bridge fuel cost is directly related to  claim of a constellation cyno beacons requires 50 control to online a cyno beacon sbu onlining  claim directly affects sbu onlining  once you lose 50 of a constellation sbu onlining becomes 50 of its original value reinforcement standards ihubs require 50 regional control to maintain shield reinforcement shield levels will be reduced based on how much  control of a constellation is maintained loss of 50 control removes the ability of ihubs to have a shield reinforcement timerregional sov directly affects cyno jammers you must maintain 50 of a region to use cyno jammersstation defenses station shields and services shield levels are directly tied to the amount of regional sov you claim reinforcement standards ihubs lose all affect on system sov controlsbu onlining  claim directly affects sbu onlining  once you lose 50 of a region sbu onlining becomes 5 minutes feudal system to offset the complaints about regional control a feuldal system will be implemented the feudal system is as followsa system rental contract will be set up once a contract is in place the holding alliance will receive a 10 reduction in system sov billsa constellation rental contract will be set up once the constellation contract is in place the holding alliance will receive a 15 reduction in sov billsactivity requirements to maintain contractsjust like with current sov system in a feudal system there will be an additional calculator for the renter that requires their system activity levels to maintain x of each activity in system including mining ratting and station service use this will prevent alliances from exploiting the reduced cost failure to maintain levels for at least 4 days per week will result in a revoking of the contract by concord
i support this product and or service if only because the current system is bad to the highest order
i support anything tomcat supports
wouldnt this further penalize smaller 00 entities v larger entities which can control an entire region or a significant portion of one if the 500man alliance which owns a single constellation cannot online cynojammers they are left without a significant defense against entities who can drop 100 supers on himsure if you can field 100 supers you can probably outsubcap blob too but at least with a cynojammer up the attacker has to make it about taking sov and not just harassingmoon harvesting with capsuper fleetsmy own alliance would have been sorely put to defend against pl in pure blind if these changes were in effect during that campaign as it was we were able to use our cynojammers to our advantage allowing us to fight holding actions with subcap fleets and calling in capsuper support when neededi see the proposed changes having a paradoxical effect from the one i believe you intend where the small 500man alliances have to band together and form bigger alliances that are able to control 50 of a region in order to have any systems at all we have some of that now with coalitions but if game mechanics force you to control lots of space in order to control any space thats what people will doplease correct me if im misunderstanding part of your proposal
not emptyquotin
which means a small alliance has only a few choices feudal system or the desire to grow and claim more space this means more conflict the alternative is a reduction in their ability to defend also creating more conflict most small 00 space holding people are there for conflict in the first place as for super cap production it can be changed to reflect the feudal system to allow building you still get the bulk of protection just from constellation sov however affording you all abilities simply bc think its fair removes the willingness for conflict conflict makes 00 interestingthese changes also make it easier for another small entity to come in and fight you at a more reasonable level yes it also allows a larger entity to do the same but ideally the complexity of holding space because of the way these changes impact everything means theyll be too busy guarding their own space
can you explain more about the feudal system to whom are the contract set up to is it concord or maybye your local blob who will make more isk than ever after this
both there will always be a cost to renting bc nobody is willing to allow it for nothing but there will also be a sink to concord that would be paid
so no one cares its a good thing im not a gallente player
a lot could be done with drones theres just so much room available to improve them overview and ship icons sure more control over them command them to orbit another ship but not fire etc
you stole my hotkeys cept i also have ctrl4 to toggle aggressive stance
its very hard to tell when your ecm drones make someone lose their lock on you during pvpwould be nice if the overview or something on the target icon above had some icon show up that he was actaully being ecmd
you mean like when you hit the cycle with ecm modules that little grey bar below hmm could be useful if its not too much to ask
how about the little yellowred blinky brackets surrounding the ship disappear
ive not votedi recived and email today about voting for csm on the email was a questionare i completed this to the best of my ability from the response to that questionire it has become apparant that not one single csm has a grasp of the changes that need to be made to eve and that they contradict them selvesthings of note low sec needs love no it doesnt works fine and we get loads of killssuper caps need nerfing no they dont they work fine they can easily be taken out by carriersjump bridges need removing to make 00 better tweaked a little mabey but removed hell nodo large power blocks need removing  yes but its never going to happen why do we bother to vote for these people who dont have a cluewhy are ccp taking such a small representative sample as the views of the massesclose the farse ccp before it goes any further
hah youre funny

as a mining foreman orca pilot and owner of three alternate minersoh and ceo of our corpi dont see anything wrong with hulkageddon in fact i love it heres why1 competition gets slammed mineral prices adjust a little higher because of the event a lot no not really but isk is isk is isk and i get more of it during hulkageddon2 as a manufacturer i do see an increase in the value of the equipment and ships we makewhich not surprisingly is most mining stuff whod have guessed again more profit for me3 its a player driven event which is incredibly cool since most mmos dont have a purely playermade event4 hulkageddon wont ever run into a marathon unless the organizers can throw together enough resources to make enough prizes in quality or quantity to keep people interested that long even if it did run that long and the prizes were that good the market would begin to feel the burn from lack of minersindys transporting if it didntat least wed have proof of bots dsoif you dont like hulkageddon sorry but it isnt griefing or against the eula its a really cool idea and you ought to join in on the fun our corp doesnt mine during it we get out and hunt other folks its like a vacation for us better yet why not organize your own player event  pirate shootout or something since you obviously dislike ganking where the prizes go to the most kills of wantedcriminal pilots or do a capitalcarnival and hunt capitals onlylong story short hulkageddon is fine and it works well if you only plat eve to mine then hulkageddon is like a season for you and adds to the difficulty of your chosen career you might want to consider missioning during it instead its not like mining leaves you too poor to do so
hugim not trying to say hulkageddon should be restricted as it is now but am instead raising the question of how far can the players go to develop the game before it conflicts with the vision of the makers of the game this game is built around how players make it and is far more sandbox than any other game out there that i can think of and thats what makes it special however i have to wonder whereif a line will be drawnfrom my understanding of the game high sec is meant to be somewhat secure not totally but just enoughsay for example there was a corp made for the sole purpose of ganking new players repeatedly and that they where very effective at their job chances are new subs would drop some if they made a large enough impact my question is at what point would ccp intervene to adjust things to get more subs
1 so ure basically scared of what could happen but has not happened in all these years get real2 what do u know about ccps vision besides the fact that actually its only your own vision that u want3 high sec already is just secure enough rookie ships arent being suicide ganked and exhumers face the only risk a t2 mining ship would ever face in high sec or u can stick with a mining barge and lose nothing if u ran your mouth enough to still be worth ganking try it sometime4 and how would u know if that hulk pilot is a newbie or an alt of a 10 or 00 player who cant handle risk outside of high sec u dont5 if a corp is that effective in ganking newbies it would not be by suicide ganking since their targets wouldnt even know how to defend themselves in the first place6 do u know what it really takes to get more subscriptions take a look at wow which caters to laziness and stupidity in fact try it sometime
dang ok well i concede to your pointsright now the game is fun for me if it becomes unfun ill move elsewhere til then no point in worrying about what might happen
tank your hulk problem solved

hello all how are wethis proposal is on a variation on the contract mechanics already in place called treaties they way i propose they work is that if alliance a was next door to allinace b in order to feel slightly and only slightly more secure with one another alliance a can signa treaty with alliance b that they would not attack one another provided certain conditions be met such as payment of rent transfer of resources every month military aid during conflict etcyou could also ask an opposing alliance after there defeat that they sign a treaty with any some or all the conditions stated above and any suggestions you the community can think ofrather than simply ransoming them for there corp walletthis system could also apply to corperations as well in terms of mechanics of enforcing these treaties i honestly havnt thought of a sound way to do it any suggestion on that but its more of a feature that makes agreements between corperationsalliances seem more official with effectivly a digitaly signed copy from the ceosand or directorites of those involvedcommentssuggestions
the words of a treaty are worth naught but the blood theyre written in let the skies be the open domain of all with the firepower to claim themplot the destination and let all those with the courage to follow do so the rewards are ours to claim and weve nothing but our lives to lose the age of the capsuleer is upon us and the wait has been long enough lock primaryits 4 am ive been watching pirates of the caribbean and im feeling weird carry on

creating an artificial tax on the market in jita will not fix the problem if in fact there is a problemas for your assertion that big markets move to a lower taxed area that is crap  really big markets turn to the location they are in and say give us cheaper tax or we go somewhere else the location then realises that they have come to rely on the tax income and can not afford to lose itlook at all the largest cities and see how they startedlondon  trade center for englandparis  confluence of a number of trade routes in europeconstantinopleistanbul  meeting point of european and middleeastern trade routessingapore  trade centrehongkong  trade centretrademarket hubs are a natural progression in human evolution dynamics we are inherently lazy creatures and if we can have our needs satified in 1 place rather than 10 then that is where we will got just look at the success of the hyperstores like walmart target ikea etc these are just commercial versions of the same human dynamicnow in eve the empires do not bid for a share of the tax income but if we suddenly started putting taxes on the market hubs people would find a way to avoid this in a way to that still meets the human needif the crowd in jita annoys you then just use red frog i think that is their name the freight hauling alliancein actual fact it is proven that people will pay a premium for convenience so even if jita was a couple of percent more expensive than other markets because it has everything i want i will still go theremarket hubs are natural from an ingame point of view the only thing that will break them appart is an automated interbus that will ship to anywhere in empire cheap and a global market that shows all trades then it would not matter where i brought it from as i could have it all shipped to a single location for my convenience

hey prom ive got a few last minute questions for youthere are a lot of voices out there all with differing opinions how would you attempt to come to a middlegroundagreement with them in regards to ship rebalancingwith your push to improve the grosslyunderwhelming t2 frigates and command ships in view of small gang warfaresoloing what other potential ship improvementsrebalancing would you suggest that would supportbe good in both small and large fleet formatswhat are your thoughts on keeping small fleets still relevant yet maintaining large fleet power and where would you start might be a repeat question from abovei know you have been grilled about lowsec as a player who has some mildly horrified interest in the area id like to know if you would and how would you improve upon the mechanics already in place in lowsec what would you add or changewhat are your thoughts on highsec and wormholes and what suggestions you make miniprofessions such as ninja salvaging and exploration more relevant to gameplayam i even allowed to ask these questions
i would start by looking at the overall picture sure some changes may sound cool and effective but come testing they may prove to be overpowered or completely terrible ie 4mid deimos some ships may work well on their own but as a fleet asset totally useless or redundant there are many things to look at when it comes to balancing so im sorry i cant really give you a straight answerrebalancing can mean anything from lock times ewar tweaking gate sizes to even sensor strength this is a fairly broad question but overall id like to see ccp focus more on a players ability to be effective rather than simply adding more people to the mixsmaller fleets shouldnt be considered dead simply because they are outnumbered once again id like to see individual skill being more effective than simply having more people i have some ideas regarding this but nothing so fleshed out that id be willing to discuss them as part of a platform i think its a safe bet to say that increasing the value of lowsec space is as simple as moving most if not all of the very well paying missions there it may end up promoting teamwork among mission runners and perhaps even result in missions fits turning into pvp fits and the like on the other hand things such as neutral and pirate remote rep should be looked at for example it makes no sense for a pirate to get a gcc for repairing another pirate who doesnt have gcc just my thoughts im not the authority on lowseci feel like highsec has become a bit too much of a safe haven many will tell you its far to easy to make a ton of money doing lowrisk missions and it isnt really worth the effort stepping into more dangerous space i partly agreeexploration and ninjasalavaging have been  are in the process of being looked at by ccp iirc the new salvaging ships are a great example as well as the refurbishing and addition of new 00 complexes as for wormholes my experience is limited to the first few weeks of it i dont have any input on themprobably not but we have freedom of speech in canada

lol just logged my jit alt inapproved boratz  15 free 30 day gtc left convo urlshowinfo1376874265450darius iiiurlbtw are mass emails allowedcheck this outhiim writing to you because youve participated in significant discussions on the forums so im pretty sure you care about the future of the gamethe csm elections will end soon and id like to encourage you to take a minute and vote the bigger the turnout the more seriously ccp will take the csmive been a member of the previous 4 csms ie csm 2 3 4 and 5 as such ive helped carry your message and represented you with ccpas a player with experience and interest in all areas of the game from industry to lowsec wormholes etc ive been a constantly unbiased voice in the csmyet ive earned the respect of my fellow csm members no matter where they originated from you can find positive comments and endorsments from known names such as mynxee larkonis trassler tamber vuk lau mazzilliu trebor the eve tribune etci have a proven track record of efficiency and consistencythis time more than ever the csm needs players who are not aligned with large groups but rather it needs people with experience knowledge intelligence and the ability to work harmoniously with others so please voteyou can learn more about me here
this was already getting dull in cp and now you have to drag it hereinbmorl
he should be made chairman or whatever they call it
scamming to get votes sounds like a true eve pilot to me
probably the only person running deserving of getting elected tbh and i dont even know them i got the same mail and replied with my why im not voting spiel got a well thought out and expressed response and a good one too
can we list the achievements of past csms maybe there is something awesome they have done for the community that i am not aware of if so perhaps i will start voting if not then meh
as you wish
they will be quick to point out stuff in the previous patch notes but those changes were going to be done regardless if the csm was around or not that something was done that also happened to be on the ginormous list of things the cms wants done is simply convienient for ccp to have a nice marketing gimmick to point to for interviews and such as in hey look gaiz weccp did something the csm wantedeven though weccp were going to do it anyways so they do have a valid role vote now example 1 the skilltraining queue was a csm initiative yes because no one in the entire time eve has been around has suggested that ccp impliment a skill queue ever
how naive andor literally and tragically ed does one have to be to think that a plex is worth a csm vote the fact that this issue has multiple threads in cp and now in general as well means that not only are normal eve players fecking stupid but that there is far far far too much isk available in game to the extent that its apparently believable that a plex is a worth a vote in a system where thousands upon thousands of votes get casti hate you all and i hope you hurf in flaming car durfyeah well
we know csm has been a good influence over the game untill now the question is will that good influence still be here with these low level morals that some csm candidates show or will the candidates throw isk around in hopes of a free trip to iceland we should focus towards those 2 questions and answer them as honestly as we canin my opinion this kind of moral should be banned by ccp as it does not support the healthy development of this game
does it matter noout of the last well current really csm i hear we are now up to 3 who have quit the game one of whom apparently said he wasnt interested in playing second life in spaceccp do what they want their company their choicesthe csm is there for ccps pr benefit not the players playing experience although the current csm were bloodyminded enough to say enough so fair play to themultimately its a sideshow ccp can shut down as and when they choose
and that somehow marginalizes the other 6 examples howactually ccp originally stated that they would never implement a skill queue because of fears that it would enable character farming when ccp eliminated ghost training ccp prismx promised that he would try to get a skill queue implemented for us if he was allowed to however nothing more was heard on this front it wasnt until the csm brought it up that ccp was actually convinced to implement italso the csm has given ccp the opposite of positive pr they have made the most noise against ccps intentions to increase profits through microtransactions and also made a huge outcry when they felt that ccp was ignoring them iirc both of these events resulted in ccp issuing an apology of sorts and changing their policies
ccp should only ban players for nda shenaniganslike some of the ones that have gone on in the pastwhich is likely to happen again if darius is elected and probably the only reason hes running dont perma ban them though just a month or so
oh we vote right cause all i see at the top of these forums is a stupid banner for new forumscoming soon
let me reuse a bit of text i wrote in reply to one such comment and please stop with the free trip to iceland ive been there a bunch of times i havent seen anything but the ccp offices also sitting for 89 hours of continuous meetings after meeting is gruesome work each hour the teams talking to us change theyre fresh were not its no vacationthats not even taking into account the time we take during the rest of the time to read forums answer player queries and requests spend time in our own csm meetingsif i had to charge the time spent on csm stuff those would be the most expensive holidays ive ever been on and not a single geiser or whale picture to take back home for it
then why do you do it
because i dont go to iceland for vacation i go there to make this game i like better
best qa ever
suuuuure you havent
you just got my 10 votes
elise knows his stuff and no nonsense around it either
thanks for the unsolicted evemails to 3 of my characters telling me i should vote for you be rest assured that if i want to participate in the travesty that is the csm i can do it under my own volition and suggest that you refrain from spamming peoples inboxes in a desperate attempt to get more votes
im sorry you think the csm to be a travesty i suppose you dont appreciate the things it has brought youwe unfortunately have few venues to reach out to people and many people dont read the forums judging from the feedback i got many of those found my mails useful im sorry you didnt
i have a few questions regarding the changes you would support1 what specifics do you plan to address in regards to bringing gallente in line with the other factions do you support redoing hybrid turrets as a whole alterations of ship stats and bonuses some have suggested a overhaul of armor tanking what is your position on this subject2 do you plan to support mission runners and any changes made to the missionagent aspect of the game3 what is your position on faction warfare and lowsecthanks in advance
the first thing is that balance is not about making things equally useful in similar circumstances but rather making sure nothing is so useful using anything else would be stupid also always keeping in mind a boost to something is a nerf to somethings elsethat said gallente hulls are in my opinion mostly fine i love my myrmi dominixes are great etc theres a few tweaks required on individual ship basis but the same can be said of the other races tooabout hybrid turrets theres lots of crap information into why hybrid turrets suck the fact is close range theyre great when one needs to move between targets they suck they outdamage everyone else when theyre in that sweet spot between not having enough tracking and being out of range and there lies the rub the distance at which theyre at their peak has cliffs on each side making them not really viable in a fleet situation or even small gang situation where targets are not packed so i do support changes to hyrbid turrets not a total change id rather see the sweet spot at which theyre great extended and their range extended as welloverhaul of armor tanking im unsure about that there have been suggestions to change the way they work more peak repair with less continuous and vice versa im still unsure whether a change is needed i like it as it isdo i plan to support mission runners sure why wouldnt i but changes to missions have to be evaluated theres different kinds of mission runners theres the people who like the predictability of farming their well known l4 missions those could use more variety but not necessarily more danger likewise for the adventurous l5s dont live up to the expectations theyre harder but equally boring there needs to be extra content for both of those groups and ffs not more mining missions pfactional warfare great idea botched implementation as things currently stands it sucks donkey balls and it needs a serious overhaul rather than the small patching that happens to fix the most glaring holes unfortunately with incarna taking the resources theres precious little left and given that limitation i cant in good conscience decide to devote the majority of those resource to fw as far as lowsec goes it needs a better riskreward ratio theres fights to be had but the situation is far from ideal incursions may lead to more people here i live in lowsec at the moment but im doubtful about that but there definitely needs more people and maybe the way to have that is some form of risk mitigation rather than increase in rewards
voted for vile rat but mittens is a chill dude that you want fighting for a better game

1 look at
as nice it is of you to reply to my post e man due to the fact your answers contained phrases like i presume rip will and i cant speak for rip i would still like to hear from ripard himself full answers to my questions especially question 1no offense intended
surely this is an inevitable side effect of any idea that removes the bring numbers method once you stop getting a scaling advantage with numbers then youre going to focus on qualityhowever i suspect that the situation is not so dire for the noobs as you assume even with magicsolution that fairly sandboxily and gracefully deprecates blobfleets in favour of merely big fleets numbers are still going to give a huge advantage in that for example the nc will be able to deploy 6 250 man fleets to hit 6 objectives rather than 1 1500 man megablob the hypothetical opposed small alliance that can only cta 300 guys might be able to defend one objective and harass 12 others with bombers whilst being forced to leave 3 others completely unopposed
well keep in mind that neither the csm nor ccp just blindly follow the prioritizations they are a baselevel input to the process which we then filteralso the api has been getting resources within ccp most visibly through the work of ccp prism x aka lord dreadlock slayer of learning skills and ccp stillman there have been significant discussions in the csm internal forums about the api most recently related to customizable api keys so i think ccp understands to some extent the leveraging value of the apinow if you and other apioholics believe the current level of resource allocation is insufficient or that a particular area of it needs particular attention and can make a decent argument to that effect i would be happy to help with getting a proposal through the csmi personally love the api have written multiple tools that use it most notably evie a browserbased skilltraining applet and in fact am developing a new one now so like black ops ill have to be careful not to let my bias in this matter affect my judgment
quality is such a loaded word here in that it implies that a low skill point player is worthlessthe worth of the low skill point pilot only comes into question with hard caps and if your hypothetical 300 man alliance is unable to defend their space with force and incapable of preventing hostilities with diplomacy why should they hold any space at all
well whatever the magicsolution is that means bringing larger fleets gives no advantage it will implictly mean that after you have n pilots in fleet you get no advantage from increasing that to n1 thats not necessarily a hard cap but it might as well be since it means that for every scrub in a t1 4x spr drake youre potentially losing the use of a a high skill guy bringing the correct shipbut as i said above thats not an automatic death sentence for noobs in fleets it just means that theyll get assigned to more appropriate objectives than pack out the system until the node diesthats a seperate issue i included the hypothetical example to make the point that despite whatever magicsolution is implemented or discussed a large alliancecoalition will still have a significant numbers advantage over a small one in any case it doesnt matter since there are currently no nonbloc small alliances within sov space with the single exception of pandemic legion who have made their shorttermist intentions quite clear whatever magicsolution is it cant possibly make the situation for small indepentant alliances worse than it already is given that overwhleming numbers will always give an overwhelming advantage one way or another im not sure that a merely magic solution can help divine intervention would probably be required
what size of engagement do you think should be the maximum before bringing more people is not effective is it coincidentally the size of fleet you personally are able to field or should we extend that all the way down to 1 person that way each alliance could put forward one level 85 spaceship pilot champion to fight in honourable combat in an instanced arena to decide who gets to keep spacebecause new players should just mine in empire for 2 years until they can fly tengus right how dare they even look at you with their t1 fitted ships i thought this attitude died out 3 years agoit really isnt any objective achievable by a 300 man alliance is achievable in half the time by a 600 man alliance or to two targets at once small and midsized alliances need to be setting themselves small and midsized goals currently the game doesnt really allow for that because all 00 space is equally good for member level money making therefore theres nowhere that a bigger alliance wouldnt want to take but that has nothing to do with jump bridges or force projection or filthy newbies daring to fight you
youre fixated on nullsec in this question i think eve uni is a good example of an alliance that has many new and low skilled players but they make up for it in gangs often outblobbing pirates and being hated for that its also from what ive heard how the goons originally started off by using large numbers of rifters to overwhelm their opponentswhile things have changed in eve and especially nullsec so that you probably couldnt use the zerg rush method effectively any more the basic concept still stands that a group of new players has a chance against a smaller group of more skilled players however the problem remains in getting new players to work together its a social question one which goons solved by getting their recruits from sa and one that eve uni solves by offering pvp classesi dont think that suggesting that theoretically a 1500man nub alliance will have much of a chance against a 500 man highly skilled alliance is true these days any more though
i am not taking an abolutist stance  compromise is always a good thing taking a compromising approach from the outset though is not how you start a negotiation the impression i get is that you might go to ccp and say hey guys dont worry about fixing x by doing y i know programming is difficult and so if you do this which is easier it might be fasterbetter i am sure players wont mind not being able to have more than 200 in fleet  i did not mention seleene because i have no prejudice against developers  programmers being on the csm as long as they know their place and do not try and design solutions for ccp that are not of benefit to the players i do not want a csm that actively works towards curtailing the freedom of the system from the outset  i prefer people with no knowledge if necessary who go in and push back rather than bend over so to speak
thanks good to know that the prioritisation is just a starting point and that ccp have an understanding of how important this area is if there are a couple of devs working hard on this im happy that this is an appropriate amount of resources as long as theyre not pulled off to do other things too often id like to see api changes go faster but im not so selfish to think it should be prioritised above everything elseid love to see the holy grail of all publicly available information in the game being available on the api but i agree that the customisable keys should come first as soontm as possibleyou have my 2 votes sir and when the election results are announced ill drop you a note with my more detailed thoughts on the api so that you can show your own personal bias is backed up by at least one other player hopefully there are many more like me
3x votes from me
thanks for responding to my question on small gang pvp i listened to your interview on lost in eve podcast great job i hope you make it on the csm

confirming i got bullied via helicitys blog and vile rats own very persuasive arguments into volleying for him
1 are you sympathetic to the cause of the shader 20 community who will lose support in a few short days2 do you believe that players should be able to recall csms due to poor representation
1 sympathetic  yes can much be done  not really technology moves and while ccp have been really good about maintaining support for old hardware there is a time it must be let go2 very much so but how to do it in a way that can not be exploited would be my major concern
so it looks like were in the last days of this voting periodsome of you are waiting for the last moment the last bit of information before adding their votes and take a lot of time considering their options before voting if you have not voted yet it can be due to several reasons because of all the uncertainty you can feel about several candidates platformsbecause you couldnt find someone who would care about your issuesbecause you are a roleplayer and felt like you were going to be neglected at the csmand many moreif you are one of them if you have not voted yet please reread this thread including my campaign message at the start together we can do ita vote for me is a vote for you
thank you all for your support 
vote for krutoj only he can fix the supercap problem if you know what i mean
death to all supercaps
thought i will repost a short br of o2o fight pre dt from kugu
seems some canditates are using spam to get the mail out i really enjoy the lack of spam in eve no one wants there mailbox full of isk offers or corp join requestswhy do cdm think they are above thses rules and spamming peoplelist who you have been spammed by so far and will thus 100 not be voting fortrebor daehdoowmeissa anunthiel
when i get mail i feal wantedit makes me all warm and fuzzley inside
you have mail
you received two messages the same as me hardly a deluge is it
i got one and the only reason i got it was stated in the first part of the email i forwarded it on to my corp modified becouse i want them to vote
bump well guys  gall its getting close to the end of the vooting period so dont delayvote menalapan todaylets make balance out priority for csm 2011
absolutely which is why bernie madoff is running for presidentoh wai
vote cast for manalapan good luck update your campaign blog site will ya
yes i will do that tonight i actually need to redo the blogi didnt copy over the permissions when i switched servers so it is a little painful to use
this thread wasnt even anything todo with killing nc it is todo with mechanics and the fact that vuk lau quit eve for wow because gms wont give him special treatmentnc make a campaign to take over csm focusing on making 00 easier they also announce that the whole controlling csm was to protect jump bridges and punish nonsov holding alliancesthen about two weeks later mittani pops up and goes they are all lying to you rages about something that makes no sense flames everyone that isnt him then es like a little girl on kcomnow he posts this thread which is a little random trying to get votes but instead everyone is once again against him minus the sheepcan you really expect anyone that isnt brown nosing to take you guys seriousnot only that mittani couldnt even answer questions on the vote match and half of his answers were ccp have a back log yeh no we are aware of how to kill nc with the current mechanics it doesnt take a genius to work out what would happen if everyone aligned and took out ncthe problem is the second you guys are dead drf will replace you how is that any better than the current situation the current mechanics promote blobbing and number warfare that makes it impossible todo anything without huge numbers this is the problemdo explain how this is considered good game play
i think its a low blow to even imply that that vuk would play wow thats the eve equivalent of when did you stop beating your wifei think youve stepped over the line here kalle have you no shame
hahafunny enough that was only included towards the end reply felt too normal without it
in the treborland wife beats you winkwhen it comes to community dudes  is anyone missing kieron
vuk lau is a wifebeaterwhy didnt you share this tasty morsel earlier
the question still remains why did mittani even make this threadall it did was make nc look worse than it is if thats even possible mittani look like a inconsistent sociopath which was obvious and vuk lau like an emotional kid throwing a tantrum yaayim sure this wasnt the plan but with mittani trying so hard to mimic his predecessors its hard to tell
the game mechanics dont promote blobbing  human nature does that all by itself i dont see ccp being able to change that in any expansion or patch
jesus theres some sick people playing this game
no kidding howd you like to read the mutual spaceship brotherhood line right after breakfast its the most important meal of the day and would be a tragedy to lose talk about your gag factorwindjammer
i think it was a prearranged stunt by mittens supposed to prove his assertion theyre lying to you that ccp dont care about the csm he expected us to be outraged at marvel the martyrdom of vuk taking a stand instead all it proved is that one of mittens main rolemodels on the csm and closest allies had a childish tantrum and tried to influence the petitions of his friendscripes
those of you fortunate enough to meet my wife at fanfest will quickly realize that a this is true and b she makes it hurt sooo good
quite how you interpreted the above as mittens asserting that ccp dont care about csm is beyond mevote for me i have solid reasoning and comprehension skills
keep working on those solid reasoning and comprehension skills kiddo
seems few people like to try and get there votes up by taking advantage of newer players or players who havent seen trhe scam beforea guy called darius iii offering a plex for a vote and then sending an empty packagelolshould people like this allow to run for a candidate
i personally dont see a problem with thiswhats the difference between him promising plex for votes and then not delivering when others are promising ideas or promising to fix things in the game that they have no hope of ever delivering yoursserious ip
all this from a guy who tried to sell his vote epic lulz ensuing
you seem to be suggesting that trying to buy votes is less morallyreprehensible than trying to sell a votei say darius should be dqd as he deserves and those who fell for this scam should simply have to deal with the fact that they lost their votes as they deserve
i fail to see the issue here there have been no announcements against the buying or even scamming of votes there are no rules against this as this is really encouraged eve conduct there is no reason he should be dq from the voting simply because you do not like that you got scammed out of a vote or do not like his conduct
in real life i have personally driven a bus full of random people to a voting station to vote so no lyingscamming is within reason to get votes so long as you dont dig up people to vote wait nm i activated my old accounts to voteyea its all fair game in this rigged contest
still waiting on kalle demos to call me out on my bull good thing im not holding my breath
making jump bridges only able to be used by the alliance that owns them would be a good compromise imo
ill bite what does a smallish mobile roaming gang have as an advantage other than surprise ive already covered the fact that anything of significance happens in laggy nodecrashing blobstruly significant actions of a gang in hostile space such as  what exactly how many alliances have fallen because some roaming gang shot their station services up every day because the alliance would never defend it do you think that causes any realistic longterm damage to an alliance none of those things cause lasting damage even if they never ever defend their space and always wait till youre gone to come up and repair what youve broken you cost them nothing i didnt blame anything some fool thought the attacker has all the advantages all i did was point out how stupid it is to think that when faced with how entrenched alliances are nowfor you i can understand that why do your allies share the same benefits if they want the improved mobility they should be forced to get their own space not form naps and reap the advantages of holding space without actually holding any of that spacealright ill go slow this time my roaming gang members each have one ship to fly the defenders each have several ships in their hangar hopefully which they can choose from to form an optimal defense fleet this is a defenders advantage does that make sense nowno they can dock up and not fight if they want but it should cost them something if letting a roaming gang shoot uninterrupted at some target in your system for 2 hours caused no anomalies to spawn in that system for a dayfew daysweek its far more likely theyll cobble something together to try and defend their space rather than wait for the hostiles to leave and then go right back to doing whatever it is they were doing if they choose not to fight fine but now the pve value of that system is temporarily reduced if they blob us they defended their space and therefore continue to reap its benefits you seethis is exactly why taking away an aggressors power of choosing where and when to strike and putting in reinforcement timers the defender controls instead was such a bad idea and led to our current predicament obviously a small gang cant compete with this so there have to be alternative goals the small gang can pursue which are meaningful or else small gangs dies off gasp turning off the services while i camp a station hoping to fight the locals only to have them repaired 30 minutes after leaving is a pointless waste of time
you have nothing other than surprise to lean on youre invading albeit temporarily someone elses territory youve setup no staging pos youve made no preparations other than youve got a hopefully quick and nimble gang of high dps ships and you have hopefully a plan of where to go and how quickly to get there and an exit strategy apart from that youve got alladditionally its not all laggy nodecrashing blobs almost the entirety of the goon vs it fountain war involved less than 750 in local and i almost didnt even have to turn automatic gun cycling offdo that for a week or a month straight and see what happens i dare youhint either the people holding that station didnt deserve to live in 00 in the first place and will actually failcascade or you will get faced because they will get sufficiently annoyed with you to actually start fighting backtechnically this is more or less a reflection of how it works in real life friendly railroads etc were easily usable by allies vovwhere do you think my pvp ships are in the middle of our main systems or at the fringe where there might be a use for them if someone should try to do something other than just be a tiny but annoying gnatas i said earlier try to do that you might get away with it the first time but try doing that more than once see what happens thenobviously what you need to do is to keep doing it and not move on after less than 15 minutes what most roaming gangs do however is run through a region almost as fast as they can and the only time they spend in each system is enough to check the majority of belts andor anomalies  giving them any heed other than getting safe and waiting for them to leaveoh and additionally you are affecting the locals by being innear their system most of them safedock up before you get to where theyre at so theyre not getting ore and not shooting any rats what more do you want given the average roaming gangs effort input
 these things are further advantages to the invaders as previously mentioned by yeep as previously referred to by myself ive been on both sides of this coin and i know which is more funexcitingeasiertake a look at the recent fall of it alliance the camp in 6vdt was the final straw that showed that they werent going to defend the weeks leading up to that included regular harassment roams to weaken their and their allies resolveatlas and a lost their space a have gained theirs back now because they didnt put up a fight to protect their and their allies space the large capital blobs at the end were what finished it but the fight was over well before that because of the lack of response to the regular small gangsmy point is well made by the fact that you hadnt noticed these things leading up to the caodevenews24 worthy eventson this point we can agree  if the locals all pack up into the castle or lock themselves in the cellar and let the barbarians do as they will while the villagerswomenchildren stay safe the barbarians should have the ability to raid supplies burn crops etc etc the analogy is simple enough you get the ideathe issue is that a pitchfork fleet vs an organised roaming fleet will very often go badly for the advantages that have been mentioned above having the ability to destroy local resources would only mean that the big alliances can go burn down the small alliances infrastructure without having to organise for the sov warfare grind this would simply make it even harder for a small alliance to occupy sov spacesomething worth thinking about if it could be balanced right though
as the others have said if you do this for a few nights you will start getting fightsbut i dont think thats really what you wanti dont think you want to be able to roll up into pure blind with 30 bss and get a fight with 30 bss in fact im better if your scout spotted a 25man abaddon fleet youd prolly runwhat im getting from this that you want is for a small corp with 20 ships to be able to roll in and surprisingly devastate the foundation of an alliance cd
hey guys lets have a discussion under terms that exclude perspectives i dont like also well be discussing game mechanics but my feelings will be very hurt if you illustrate your points by making reference to the way theyre used by their primary beneficiariesoh and you define a 30 man tardblob as a small gang that would be hilarious if it werent so tragic
you might value your time as worthless but i can assure you most people do notwhen i invite my friend around to help me with something i dont force him to  in the street because its unfair to all the other people on the street who dont have easy access to access to a bathroom i let him use mine because hes my friendthis is pretty rich coming from someone who appears to have selective reading disorder but why arent you bringing an optimal attack fleet in the first place youve potentially had weeks to prepare the defenders assuming they all have pvp ships in one station that you happen not to be camping the undock or the route to have in my experience maximum 30 minutes before the attackers move onreinforcement timers exist for a reason there was some guy in the euro goon channel yesterday arguing that alliances should have to maintain 23 hour camps on their chokepoints 365 days a year in order to defend their space thankfully everyone else agreed hed probably been dropped on his head repeatedly as a child but eve is a global game with people in different timezones any permenant damage has to come with a reinforcement timer unless you want the servers to be split into useuropeasia so now your time has value im not sure what you mean by putting in reinforcement timers theyve always been in for the reasons i outlined above once again youre banging your chest and demanding a 5000 person alliance does what you say when you say it because you want them to and its not fair and mommy the nasty people have more friends than me
projection  delay on cynojump or mass allowance on cynos think babylon 5 with a bazillion hyperspace holes opening up tweaking of ranges and fuel involvedbridges convenience  vulnerability move away from armed pos or declaw towers and allow anyone to use them  even hostiles highway of space  have bridges and jammers be mutually exclusive perhaps combined with mooring of supers at stationssmall scale pew revamp sovereignty to ditch ehp based system in favour of smaller objectives constellation wide a mashup of fw and incursions if you will defensive measure could be partial control over the sizes required for the various objectivesthe only ehp involved should be that on ships dammit
as it seems this socalled csm debate isnt only for candidatesi think itd be neat to jump bridges them from moons to a specific fairly rare planet type such as ice oceanic or storm it would make them a bit easier to interdict if thats your thing but the main advantage is it would make some systems much more valuable than others logistically many systems couldnt have a jb and of those that can most would only have one jump bridge while those with two three or four would become important transit hubs empire entrances with a planet of the appropriate types become more valuable than those without  for example in providence kbp has an ice ymp does not while with oceanic jbs the reverse is true this change could introduce some more friction to nullsec politics  not enough to break up bffs but adding tension between neighbours who are only blue for convenience also ccp could probably then tie dust into it somehow or other oh and for the apparently essential first hand experience i used and came up against jb networks for a handful of months in catch and provi and did refuelling of them from timetotime when uk was in catch

black ops ships should be excluded from this with a role bonus
shoot the caps when there engaged in battle  not while there trying to travels aroundso you think eve would be a better game if it was a complete pain in the arse to move caps about staying cloaked with no cap regen till the one idiot in a buzzard finally gives up a pulls in his combat probes after 40 minutes no thanks to this dumb not thought through proposal
because god forbid anyone ever move a capital ship with an escort fleet
lolhave you actually played this game yet who the f is gonna call all there buddies and arrange for escort when ever they need to move there carrier from a to bno oneall this proposal will do is increase the amount of time capsuper cap pilots have to sit around cloaked doing nothinway to go to make eve more fun
so every other ship in the game having to deal with travel combat is okay just so long as it isnt your thanatos righthell yes i do caps already move around far too easily and being able to be just about perfectly safe while doing it doesnt help anyonelet him find you then kill himit is far more thought out then your counter frackin carebears
id much rather see a change to the module right now super caps are strong enough and their deployment should mean more than omg we are losing this fight quick throw out supercaps
delicious approval go
combat probes use them1

great analogy since gimli would lose a knife fight to legolas anyways since gimli would never be able to hit legolas with his axe give gimli better tracking
i would love to use hybrids but frankly they are all around the worst turrets bad range bad tracking low damage
remove the plex out of game the numbers of bots increased nearly at the same time plex introduced to this game and still risingtake them out of game and force players to pay direclty to ccp and not via other players through plex will cost all the bot users a lot of rl money and force them to rmt which is much more trackable and sanctionable by ccp
nolegitimate players should not suffer because of bots plex is useful
i rather enjoy playing for free if i actually had to actually pay 30 a month 2 accounts i probably would have left a year ago what makes botting possible is that eves pve is highly repetitive remove the repetition and botting becomes basically impossible
i know players who have to buy plex through the web or in game because they live in a country where its very hard to pay with a credit card directly to ccpso i do not think your solution is a good one  as some players would lose the option to playcheersm
without bots the eve economy would crash much of the ore to make the modules that are sold in highsec and many other places is mined by bots
oh joy yet another antiplex thread by an rmtisk sellerplex is the best thing to happen to mmos and the worst thing to ever happen to gold farmers go find some other way to make your family its cup of rice
the concept is flawed and plex is mostly a good thing it hurts the bottingrmt markethowever ccp must already have considered the idea of tying all accounts to some realworld bank account or creditdebit card to force botters and rmt agents to either commit fraud suddenly it is a crime to bot or give ccp a way to find and ban every current and future account a player ownsthey must have thought of this and discarded it because its stupidly obvious yes there are downsides not everyone has access to a creditdebit card international payment issuesbut these can probably be worked around the key thing is that i think it would be a good idea for all players to have a traceable method of identification which is is illegal to forge then ccp can take the problem from a technical angle bot prevention and detection an economic angleplex unholy rage and a legal anglemake it possible to take the bards to courtplease rework your proposal to this concept and youll have my full support any suggestions to work around the issues i raised
this is both stupid and wrong for two reasons1 the market is selfcorrecting if mining becomes very profitable which it would should there be a shortfall  go spend some time on md then people will flood to mining  even if its dull  to make some cash2 if the shortfall is so great that this selfcorrecting measure cannot keep up then ccp can easily change the dynamics of mineral faucets  simply say doubling the rate of oreminerals or halving the mineral requirements of every item fixing a market problem is easy fixing the botting problem is much harder
bots ruin the eve economyand only plex allow a bot user to run more than 3 bots 247 because the bot making the isk to buy the plexthis is no isk seller  rmt whine this is the only option what will hurt them if they have to pay rl money for their bot armies

i gave you a solution that would be slightly inconvenient but allow you to use your titan as if you can dock it in a sense  while your alt is flying it and logged off its untouchable id suggest you make use of that as the game isnt going to change just because you demand it hell who are you to demand such a thingby all means keep whining but dont expect ccp to bend over and change the game just because you asked titans cant dock for very good reasons  for one off the top of my head they arecan use freaking superweapons are you saying there should be no drawback to that at allid rather be questioning the intelligence of people who do support dockable titans than those who realize that really it isnt that much of a drawback to begin with and that titan pilots are lucky its so easy to work around
i have no sympathy for supercapital pilots at all nonewhen supercapital pilots complain i feel like im looking at some celebrity brat throwing a temper tantrum because her rat dog is not the right shade of pink
heres my assessmentthe tax does absolutely nothing to remove the disincentive to join player made corps when you can still get a 0 tax rate by training a 10 minute skill even the newest player can claim whatever tax rate he pleases the only difference is that now youre losing a 0 tax rate from a 1person corporation instead of from npcsthe tax does absolutely nothing to remove the safe harbor of npc corps as long as corp hopping exists the complete wardec safety of an npc corp is something you can achieve by docking up every 24 hours and clicking apply to corporationthe tax penalizes younger players before the tax new players would use npc corps as a way to acclimate themselves to eve find new people and eventually work their way into a new corporation many corps actually kept alts in these npc corps precisely for that reason now these players are penalized for precisely that to the tune of 11 of their revenuethe glut of 1man corporations has removed many of the available tickers available to new corporations with legitimate aspirations while not a huge issue its significantly worse now than it wasi feel this cure is far worse than the disease it was meant to treat
15 tax is fairly common throughout all corps i too think a rookie period 0  2025 when not rookie anymore will do more but nobody stops you to form a corp for just yourself neither does anything to prevent alliance hopping or corp hopping to escape war decs
supported 100 bots are a problem in any mmo but especially in a game with a supposed player run economy i know its an impossible dream to get rid of them entirely but ccp could surely be doing a much better job than they are today
i want to paint flames on my hulk
under a corporations attributes tab there is a member count i propose that on the attributes tab for an alliance it shows the member total of all the corporations in the alliance

fix it please
i had recently a bug in win 7 which i already had in win 98 unfortunately ccp and mass battles is the same story
supportedheres my 2 cents on a fix that could help why not design an option that would require players entering a potentially overstressed node to use a different pared down version of eve that would have much less in the way of stress on the server per player sure the graphics may be down to 1980s level and everything be oversimplified but when we go into these 2000 in local battles we arent there for the graphics we are there for the results of the battledunno may be a totally ed idea but its mine dammit
supported you can jam your walking in stations where the sun dont shine fix the problems first
once local hit 1600 people my commands were a average 18 minutes behind the action when safe in a blue pos my ship warped off 28 minutes later to the tcu i couldnt stop the warp
thank you for the post vladethe drf and nc players are suffering equally as a result of the games inability to support their communities ships should never be destroyed hours after the player logs keep feeding the trolls you can count on them to continuously bump the thread

drf shows there hate on everu and evenews24 all the 1000 opinions stay the same need to fix lag and not make my characters pretty
it doesnt look like its a priority like mentioned before on this thread there is a game mechanic that was supposed to cover disconnects server kicks and other nasty stuff  the 15 minute ship disappearing timer unplayable lag server crashes and black screens started to b more frequent and intensive in dominion since then the only mechanical thing that got fixed a couple of times is desync other fixes were only cosmetic like rocket fix for example what they needed that much time to change a couple of static database values come on hardly any effort at all but on the other hand what was introduced that does have to do with mechanics pi thats favourable to 00 players because of abundance of resources in 00 space and incursions which is again favourable to 00 alliances because they can drop some very expensive stuff there at the same time level 4 missions got nerfed npc corporation taxes introduced good quality agents give crappy missions if you work for them too much and they tend to send you in lowsec in your pve fitted ship well guess what i want a taste of 00 space too but how the hell can i move there if the damn thing is broken so i got myself a situation here stay in highsec and be bored to death play docking games with wardec griefers the most ed excuse for a pvp enter fw which is meh anyway oh and broken play like a pirate and sit on a gate while my eyes bleed shooting at the targets that cant defend themselves or finally move to 00 where all the action is and where everyone is a fair target for me 00 is the endgame goal but having tasted the lag when some of the alliances clashed in lowsec empire some time ago and me not even being in that system for that matter makes me wonder what crap do i have to endure in order to get some proper pvp experience in the lawless space in the gameyou see i dont give a damn about technetium change the bugger so it comes from moon interaction or something i dont care about the nc or drf i care about being able to play this game and having customer supportedit paragraphs
makumba aki and schantalle stop trolling plz this is not caod if you dont have anything smart to say its better to remain silent this way you are looking so funnyonce again i want to support this it is one thing to die while you are online and another to die 10 hours after you log off
ur dum shudup u
the entire thread is a trollask ccp to introduce machanics that would discourage blobbing even though they would hurt big power blocks this whine here is just ridiculousto ask ccp to remove the lag is like asking scientist to provide you with unlimitted source of energy the technology that could accomplish this simply doesnt exist
what about customer support is that impossible to have too
would you like ccp to spend the limited amount of money they have on more gms so that they have more time to work on your petitions or on more developers so that they can improve the game
yes
on more developers that will improve the game by giving priority to the 15 minutes ship removal mechanics
as far gms ccp needs to train them much better and offer them better tools so costumers dont take the answer our logs show nothing as far developers they recently hired 150 person in us that means about 1015 teams assign more teams to lag and fixing bugs than to incursion incarma etc also how many times did they introduce more bugs with a patch where is the qaand again its not about lag its about bugs of certain features not working and when they gave jitanode for lxq battle and in local there were about 2000 the lag was ok for me this means that they dont want to invest on better serversnodes for 00 they could hav 23 such nodes for big fights finally about 1 or 2 months ago in a big fight less than 1k nothing was working in geminatebranchtributetenal many characters were stuck can ccp clarify how many regions do they hav on each nodeand last proposal ccp can inform that a system is reinf by putting a sign or something many times we dont hav knowledge about a system being reinf
this 
this is why im not renewing my subscriptions as they expire im sick of ccps years of not giving a frak
did any of you guys report the schedualed fleet op to the gms before the operation ordinary servers are not able to handle the thousands of enitities interacting so gms can use a second upgraded server to minimize the risk
from what ive heard during last o2o fight ccp removed the reinforced status of the system at dt even though the battle was in full swing that or anything else happened certain is that according to most reports the servers performance was way worse after dt with less ppl in localsupported
apocrypha
oh god this
my prospective is simple the ccp silence in this regard is deafening everyone plays this game to have fun i cant tell you how many times i have petitioned ccp expressing my disappointment in poor game performance i have tried to get into so many battles with a simple battle ship and simply couldnt do anything system is locked up totally couldnt do anything what so ever ive lost at least a dozen battleships and such to this sort of thing so much so that i personally really look before i leap want to join the battle but realize the futility of it not one of you no matter who you fly for can say this isnt frustrating be real here now imagine your in your titan or super carrier these ships dont come easy man many players nc rf it pl etc worked years in this game to get one of these ships only to loose it when they couldnt do anything they couldnt log out jump out warp out fire a laser or gun they couldnt do anything what so ever i know what its like with a battleship honestly i couldnt even imagine what it would be like with my prize super my position is a simple one anyone that looses a super to this sort of thing no matter who they fly for should have it replace promptly thats called customer service the real question is who holds ccp accountable for ty customer service i sincerely believe the ccp prospective is just eat the  sandwich and smile the real question here isnt why havent they fixed the game i think we all know this may be beyond there capability and probably is the real question is why ccp feels we should just accept this level of customer support and serviceif you do happen to be a super pilot and have the overhead in cpu please make sure to frap your operations ccp cant simply ignore this type documentation but then again its there servers they actually know what happened they simply choose to ignore it once again who holds them accountablecould you just imagine the outrage if the mgm grand hotel and casino in vegas experienced a network wide server failure in there gaming machines and said sorry folks we just had a network failure but all the money you had in your prospective slot machine is gone couldnt be helped these are the just the risks you take when you play our slots better luck next time

is this thread seriously just issuelag is badwow can i have my 5 minutes backeveryone knows lag is bad everyone knows ccp should fix it ccp knows and if youd read a devblog once in a while or even say pay attention to eve youd know that it is being worked on and it is getting betterthe real and only permanent solution is to nerf fleets that are too big
dude from eve uni if you think this is all about alittle lag you need to get out of empire and try a fight defending sov against 800 or so redsthis kinda lag is just crippling trying to target a ship and after over a half hour of finally locking to find he warped of already yet his ship is there or to finally lock him after more than a half hour and wait another 20mins to get one shot off is ridiculous about 20 of the ships were ghost ships then i got kicked of and after 40mins of not even entering the game 5 hrs of that crap i gave up on eve that day 
supportedthe excuse of you made the lag by getting 2000 in local is dumb and pathetic to use eve created the idea of having huge battles in their videos and expansions but we barely can even get into grid
killing bridges wont do it nc existed before themkilling cynos wont do it there were coalitions before thempl hasnt gotten away with keeping to a small list of blues theyve lost sov how many times in their history not really an example of success when it comes to sova was successful when they were in coalitions a was not successful once the sc fell apart and the much larger drc invaded again not an example of success when it comes to sovso you cant point to them and say why doesnt everyone else do that because it is not a successful adaptation to the game mechanics this is darwin beating you adapt or die it doesnt matter much how you would like the game to be it matters what the game mechanics are
forgot to click the support button before
me too
you made the lag by getting 2000 in local what a pathetic execusei never heard execuse like that in any mmo ive played1 if the system doesnt support 2k people then set the systems max numberslike 500 or 600 250 a alliance 250 b alliance2 people losing their stuffs coz of lagits not their fault its yourseverywhere in lifeif u are buying something and finding something wrong about itthen seller changes it with new one or give your money backthis is customer rights and service everything looks normal in our logs  is not support or customer service3 yeah u are rocking with sanshas4  eve online the universe is yours  sure we saw that universe in o2o
and thought the events in 020 can were the biggest fight ever plus there were no fighter bombers and such capital blobbing before dominionso you dont wont your shiny capotal fleet anymore
coalitions are not the issue the ability to gather many players in one system in a short amount of time at low transaction costs is the issue they are doing quite well are pretty rich and  fleets twice the size of their fleet the only reason why they cant hold sov is because you guys always come with a huge blob cause you know that you need to outnumber alliances like pl at least 3 to 1 to have a fair chanceso again the problem it not the lag but the game mechanics so please nc start a theread where you welp about game mechanics that made you and drf so huge and mighty and not about lag you causeexactly so why are your brosefs the most of them still complaining about lag and customer service and not about the actual problem the game mechanics
supported the only real way to combat blobfests is to increase lethality of large battles to the point where theyre a significant drain on resources regardless of how big a coalitions magic isk faucets are and how do you do that fix lag to the point that a good part of both sides fleets will die if they go for a numbersovereverything slugfest edit2 ensuring the viability of other tactics would help but same tactic more people is pretty much inevitable to this end i would suggestadd wormholeincursiontype effects increasing damage modifiers of nonaoe weapons but increasing cycle time as well to nullsec systems over a given number of pilots say for the sake of argument that it scales from 1x at 500 to 5x at 1000 to 10x at 2000 note that this would also reduce the impact of 15minute gun cycles and reduce the number of gun cycles being fired in the first place due to the rof penaltymake sure bombs travel the correct 30 km and consider giving priority to bomber decloaklaunch commands edit also add rage and javelin t2 bomb variantsconsider restricting full overview in packed systems only to pilots with 9 or more subordinates ongrid and transmit broadcast targets only to the restget some good data on whether autorepeat works if it does fcs seem pretty confident that it doesnt and if it reduces load try and get people to use itget rid of local in busy systems or have it show only  of pilots per alliance and mute it not sure if this would reduce load and may be reading too much into the name but i noticed that the step i was hanging at on login attempt was joinchannelsadditionally get a wellannounced brainstorming thread going to see what corners might be cut under high load that would increase performance but not dramatically alter balance
epic bumpage
the whole post was intended to address the fitting system so yes i was addressing that particular issue neutral repping is the simplest method of creating a winwin scenario provided the opponent fleet does not have the same or similar advantage the same could be said about ecm and various other roles im not proposing we remove thembasically what we have is a situation where people can fleet fit for strategies based on role bonuses and not on real tactics its a cookie cutter system where you pair and match ships so that you can provide the best possible scenario to take on any adversary if you know what ammo types they are using or have intel on their fits then you have tenfold multiplied your chance of success this works because of the current fitting system and the ease with which it is exploited nevermind the fact that ship scanners always return muddled fits its still relatively easy to determine what you are up againstim proposing a more complex ship fitting system one which makes ship fitting tighter and less open to exploitation a good example is the hurricane with 6 low slots and 4 mids which can be used for a variety of purposes heres onehurricane passive command hurricaneshield power relay iishield power relay iishield power relay iishield power relay iishield power relay iishield power relay iirepublic fleet 10mn afterburnerrepublic fleet large shield extenderrepublic fleet large shield extenderdread guristas invulnerability field220mm vulcan autocannon ii republic fleet emp m220mm vulcan autocannon ii republic fleet emp m220mm vulcan autocannon ii republic fleet emp m220mm vulcan autocannon ii republic fleet emp m220mm vulcan autocannon ii republic fleet emp m220mm vulcan autocannon ii republic fleet emp mdark blood medium nosferatusiege warfare link  shield harmonizingmedium core defence field purger iimedium core defence field purger iimedium core defence field purger iivalkyrie ii x2hornet ii x2now drop that into eft and tell me should we nerf the hurricane id like to think not and i hope not but thats a lol fit from hell drop a low slot change something else and you have a useless ship that would almost never be used thats what i mean the hulltanked lolmoros i saw mentioned elsewhere is another great example of how the system fails as it is
your assumption of a drawback being limited adaptability is incorrect though i understand my rather limited explanation leaves a lot to be desired i was actually considering proposing role bonus removal and making all ships reliant on the officer system to provide their role bonuses the officer system is something i heard mentioned elsewhere where ccp would be adding slot for personnel with the coming of incarna sometime after the release possibly though it is currently just in the proposal stage i understand this would result in all ships having greater versatility given that you could simply move officers around and provide yourself with the bonuses you wanted the base design i have formulated is actually relatively flexible on its own personally i like ships having versatility and wouldnt want to see it disappear what we have now though i do not consider versatility
1 that lol fit hurricane is bad it doesnt really suggest any changes are needed to me to explain further why would you so heavily tank a hurricane which serves no purpose in being present at the fight why is it even there its fit with random faction mods for a passive shield tank that isnt really super amazing or anything minimal firepower and you dont even have an optimal spread of drones hint its 1 med 4 lights its apparent purpose is fleet boosting which requires none of these things and your fit hasnt added much in the way of usefulness beyond just that2 removing the seperation of missleturret hardpoints is also known as how2makeminmatargodmode theres a reason caldari are the slowest crap in space
try thinking outside the box put 10 hurricanes like that in a squad and put one in as the squad commander over them providing bonuses now add to that the squad members all have remote rep instead of the gang link save one which can take over as squad commander have the rr each other and all can provide dps now fill a wing now make more wings of the same toss in some ecm and others sure the drones could be swapped out but the faction mods arent random i threw them in there for two reasons the first is because the ship cost is pretty high already with the purger iis the second because it provides the best speed lowest sig and highest resistances swap them out for tech ii if you like it was also originally looked at as a pve fit which was not intended to see pvp the point is the sameindividually it wouldnt last long in pvp in a fleet with the right bonuses its quite unbelievable in a blob its not individual dps that kills its combined dps and every ship supplies it whats not impressive about a 700 dps tank on the lowest resist combined with 500 ms velcoity and a relatively low sig radius while putting out 445 dps under even a relatively good fc drop rr on that tank and see what happens have interchangeable squad commanders to apply variable bonuses for different situations no need to dock up either just swap the boosteryou seem to have a limited imagination
wait ever heard of drake blobs only difference is they are overpowered with t2 fits instead of faction fitsthe officer system will not be implemented it would totally destroy the ship diversity seriously just take the hull with the better survivabilitymobility rate then put in a role dedicated officer then pouf cest tout
stop playing in eft seriously if heavy missile are so good why are you correctly fitting aml to caracals if heavy missiles are so good why isnt everyone using cerbs not zealotsmuinnsvagabonds im mean stuff 84km cerb gets 180km by god it must be the best ship ever to what range are you suggesting their range too anyway 70 60 50 30 20 10 youll have to massively nerf range to make any real difference then introduce really powerful mods to get it back up to 84km did you consider what effect those mods would have for all other missile shipstheres a hurricane harb and drake in the fleet guess what will get targeted is it the drake with its overpowered long range weaponry or the harb and hurricane its the others everytime why because of the drakes tank its a huge time sink to try and kill it even if it is slow and is easy to hit with its huge sigto reach 80km even thats a theoretical range missiles take time to accelerate and target movement can tends to increase the distance the missile has to travel the missile takes 15 seconds in eve combat thats an age the target could have been destroyedwarped or even yourself warped or been destroyed long before your missiles arrived drakes typically do not engage at long rangethe main exception to this is vs hellcat fleets when they can sit outside scorch range frankly if your outmanuvered by a drake blob with a hellcat fleet your deserve everything you get finally ill leave you with this with t2 mods no implants no t2 rigs no faction its possible to get over 840 passive regen even neuted it near regens nearly 600 try engaging one of those and saying missile range is the drakes problem
purger drake
that is a waste of a drake and is useless for basically all sorts of pvp except bait
that sounds off by a long shot even with purgers drake get 235 hpsec max passive regen assuming you save 3 mids for hardners myrm on the other hand gives 350 hps regen under the same conditions rattlesnake gets 800 hps
you including resists maybe i should have said 840 ehp regen seems a bit pointless to quote figures without resists taken into account or youd just use extendersthe 840 semipassive or passive tank to none anal people is a pve fit which variations of you across in low sec00 frankly if your not in high sec all fits are pvp  yes its a fail fit but is a pain in the arse to take down none the less
rubbishi solo passive drakes in my brutix its easy
yes there are other nice ships but lets face it the drake is easy to get into while offering a large tank along with very good range and alpha however the real issue is the nature of fleets these days more than anything the ham boost was a major impact along with everyone and their grandmother using logistics even in small gangsthe drake has to give up little to still support a solid tank and good dps other ships mentioned above are targeted first because they can be killed much faster you can kill 23 with the effort it takes to kill 1 drake
well really people primary others first cause they want to clear the main dps off the field rather than waste time shooting what is possibly a brick tank with no dps
sounds like a challange to me what do you say i throw together a passive drake and you bring along your brutix
yet another it takes too much effort to kill a drake thread from people who cant think for themselveswow is that way  no thought or effort required
yet another post made from a a snap judgement instead of reading the thread and posting any constructive counter arguement simiply states nerr your wrong nerrperhapes eve is bit complex for you maybe youd be better playing something a little less taxing farmville perhaps
its difficult not to troll when people throw expert opinions claiming that purger drake is actually a good ship or that ham drake is remarkably good at anythingit takes some time to figure out what went wrong but i am sure we get there after 20 pages of trolololing

im sure there are many of these threads but i thought id start my own ones and present my ideas on the situation hopefully you can all give your ideas and comments on mine first ill explain why i feel this wayfor me this would help balance 00 combat a little bit more effectively if you have a bomber or force recon ship which sits afk in your system you have sovereignty 5 it can be quite frustrating because it puts a halt to all activity in your systems what i propose is the following1 provide an alliance with a sovereignty upgrade or a pos module which scans the system for any ships who have an active cloak this way if the person is in the system waiting for a juicy target all they need to do is keep moving between safe spots they have no disadvantage if they are active it feels like its quite unfair that one can simply fly off into space cloaked for hours and then decide to come back at any time and search for targets in all situations there should always be at least one way to counter the strategy the way i propose the module works is that the fc or whomever is in the highest position in the fleet ie squad commander if no wing or fleet commander is present is able to use the module to scan the system and warp the fleet into the location from the pos2 i dont support the idea of probes that decloak targets simply because it will not solve the problem if you have a selfmade safe somewhere and cloak up the probe wont hit you anyway unless its a system wide effect however i find that 1 makes more senseguys i know im revisiting a very much discussed topic but i hope you can comment on my ideas im really looking for some opinions thanks a lot ill be replying to your comments
cloaking is finejust man up and rat if you are sure he is afk and if he is afk this wouldnt solve it anyway as you can make an unprobable cyno stiletto that you would never catch and he can just go afk in thatalso as im sure it will get pointed out this has been suggested before
if you warp in a dramiel to catch the stiletto when he is afk flying into space then i argue you would be able to catch him edit the covert cyno is the issue
not supported
thank you for your reason
if that stilleto goes to his usual safe spot that dramiel wont catch him covert ships as in the ones that can fit the cov ops cloak have already got plenty of drawbacks for the ability to fit the cov ops cloak
if we have a cyno jammer then why should a covert cyno be able to be activated in the system
how will the change you are suggested stop this from occurring in your op you say that the change wont affect active cloakers only afk ones but afk ones dont light cynos
sure you can open a covert cyno in a cyno jammed systemand no support for your idea it is one of the less things you can do against bots
my suggestion is introducing a module that scans for cloaking ships so if they go afk they will be exposed because they are not moving between safes i dont want to get off topic and discuss covert cynos edit spelling
my suggestion was to counter afk pilots not to remove the covert cyno in a cyno jammed system
but what you suggest doesnt stop people going afk in a safe in unprobable cyno stilettos and now we are back to where we startedyou brought up covert cynos as an issue with the cyno jammers not stopping them and they shouldnt your suggestion also does nothing to people with covert cynos
this is why i posted this topic to look for suggestionssolutions to the flaws in my idea i know its not perfect im looking for feedback thanks for that i didnt realise that problem do you have a suggestion
but what you suggest doesnt stop people going afk in a safe in unprobable cyno stilettos and now we are back to where we startedthis is why i posted this topic to look for suggestionssolutions to the flaws in my idea i know its not perfect im looking for feedback thanks for that i didnt realise that problem do you have a suggestionnot really i dont see them as a problem when a neutral or red goes afk in system i go back to ratting i keep an eye on my directional and local i dont sit at the warp in spots in the beltcosmic anomaly im running and because i take these precautions i dont tend to lose ratting ships
this is why i posted this topic to look for suggestionssolutions to the flaws in my idea i know its not perfect im looking for feedback thanks for that i didnt realise that problem do you have a suggestionnot really i dont see them as a problem when a neutral or red goes afk in system i go back to ratting i keep an eye on my directional and local i dont sit at the warp in spots in the beltcosmic anomaly im running and because i take these precautions i dont tend to lose ratting shipsreally you watch local when hes already in system you watch direction scanner to keep an eye if his cloaky ship shows up you also dont sit on the warpin point because then youll see him warp in his cloaked shipdo you live in 00
i live in catchcurseyou watch local because if he isnt a cloaky and just a scout local will spike if someones comingyou watch directional scan for any ships on it as most of the time these afk cloakers arent covert ops just whatever with a cloak fitted and if they are warping in they can be seenand you stay off the warp in as obviously they will get warped there first if he warps in on your head then so be it just one of those things edit if he warps in on you he isnt an afk cloaky and again your suggestion doesnt work
again im talking about the situation before heshe warps in once hes active well then we cant catch him anymore with the module  because he is moving warping
ah sorry i thought it was afk cloakers that was your problem so you want to be able to find cloakers before they decloak next to you and shout surprise
and as many thread like this and before itdown in flames it goesdo not start your threads with for me i feel this is wanted by the majority or many feel this way when the only conversation you have is with three people that has less of an idea what is going on than you dothreads like this and others fail because it is based on a self centered emotional view they assume every one thinks like they do or should and once the crashing reality hits the ops proposal will then deteriorate into a defensive you are nothing but trolls and illiterate sociopaths in reality it is really a terrible idea
np
the problem is that local is usable as intel tool not the fact that someone can cloakthat afk cloaky is alot less scary if you dont know he is there or alot more scary
actually no because smartbombs nuke drones and we all know how good dreads are at hitting bss
want to see how many sentry drones i can put in a carrier
look how well titans workedother than that stop and think area of effect weapons do not reduce number of people in fleets if they can accomplish a strategic goal whatever it is by gathering up in one spot at the time they will current game mechanics do not particularly weigh on travellogistics and dividing your forces

r64 needs a buff p
charles test wouldnt have been able to do this without the help of the nc or goons which indirectly relates to the technetium income they were put there by nc  goons because theyll create a buffer nothing more nothing less also im not raging i
moons in general need to be far less valuable possibly even not giving out any resources period and if they do nothing thats worth anywhere near as much as technetiumthere was a time in this game when alliances could actually become bankrupt from war the reason this was possible was because making isk actually required a degree of effort mining used to be the only large source of income and getting together in a system and coordinating it was both dull and time consuming but it made wars better because losing ships actually hurt tactics were a requirement because the more you lost the more you had to put in to making isk again and the more morale dropped so it was important not to lose ships or fleetsin its current state losing ships is simply a nonissue there is so much cash available that the only way to beat an alliance is to either crack it from within or beat the hell out of them so much their members dont want to fight anymore however thats not really possible since with 1k2k in a system there is no beating an alliance tactically or with skill because your modules and tactics mean nothing when there is several minutes of delay on every action i would have no problem with alliances making 350b a month if all of their membership put in the effort to get it but when large coalitions get together and sit on these literal isk printing locations with such ease it means the game is indeed broken and regardless of the flames that changing this would bring on ccp from these large entities they need to do something about it soon because this isk will just build up and keep building up so how could we fix thisthere are a couple of options i think would at least be a step in the right direction1 have certain npc stations offer unlimited resources at a certain price ie 999999999999 technetium available at xxxx price at certain stations in every empire region this would prevent technetium from ever going above a certain point of ccps choosing thus controlling alliances incomes2 have a much smaller portion of profitable locations make it harder for alliances to split the massive volume of available resources between them for example nc have 10 alliances an example only but there is only 12 valuable resource locations per region the reason for point 1 means that controlling the markets would be taken out of the players hands after a certain point they will have control but their control would be controlled by ccp in the pricing of certain mineralsfor point 2 the reason i feel it would be better is because it would be a reason for coalitions to break up if there is only a few easy and large isk printing locations in their space the alliances will all want those points for themselves and theoretically may go to war for them or at the very least create friction between those allies if taking again the nc as an example theoretically mm have a much larger income than say mh there are only 24 of these high value locations within their space mm can try and tell mh to give those resources to them in turn annoying mh and causing friction or mm can choose to share evenly and keep a cooperative relationship lowering mms income and raising mhs and sharing the isk more evenly rather than a few individuals controlling a huge portion of a coalitions overall income as that was quite a lengthy post ill summarize  large isk making should be a time consuming task requiring the input of many  the volume of resources needs to be far less than it is currently because huge coalitions can work together and share resources and all be happy this wouldnt be so much of a problem if the servers could handle fights of 123k smoothly but it cant quite simply coalitions must be split up war needs to cost more than alliances can make it shouldnt reduce the overall income of the alliance it should cost more than the alliance makes resulting in bankruptcy
confirming this doesnt work why simple whoever managed to get it will become the new owners of the monopoly different people same stuff as far as the market is concerned it will change nothing that matters
throwing random numbers around angrily50 tech moons really very very few alliances have moon goo on that level it also takes tons of resources to secure and protect such things as well as to run the supply chain you could call that cogs andor expenses if you want to break down the numbers like an accountanttechnetium sells for about 100kunit a moon produces 100 units per hour or 10m isk per hour a ratter can produce about 100m isk per hour with the occasional faction loot drops a lvl 4 mission runner can make about 100m isk per hour if your argument is that one is passive income and the other is active you clearly havent had to manage a posthe biggest flaw in your reasoning is that alliances are some kind of giant monolithic individual and not a whole ton of individuals grouped together for the common good often the moons are spread among corps within the alliance cause lets be honest everyone is greedy and they arent going to protect someone elses income stream without reciprocity and a similar income stream these corps have about 100 members on average these members lose ships defending the moons which are reimbursed usually through said moon goo in the end a corp like mine nets a few hundred million to a billion in passive net income per month from moon goo depending on how active military operations are right now with the fighting going on between the nc and the drc this number is much reducedto put that in perspective my rd agents give me about 300m isk each month in completely passive income i dont have to defend anything i dont have to fuel anything i just have to jump clone to empire and empty them every once in a while if there is any passive income that is ridiculous it is rd agents in empire space
last i checked thats how it already works
if this where only true but this is not what happens i see it all the time in domain region with neutral remotes which can not be touched as they never go red while boostingrepairing engaged wardec target
i wonder if thats an overview bugliang
new topic is not the same as reply to topic
ok hopefully that got a gms attention but yeah at the moment there are thousands of players like me who are not very happy with the situation being placed on them in null sec they feel that ccp are not doing anything for them and at the top of the list for thousands is to fix the major issues with large scale fightsthose who say its our own fault are partly right technically the game cant support what we throw at it but we have no choice with the sov game mechanics now im not saying that i expect a gm to say yeah next update lag is fixed but what are you guys doinglooking into to try and improove thingsan idea thrown about is something like jita where players get kicked into systems that isnt crowded or there is a system limit and so on some players wouldwould not support this but what about ccp all i would like is someone from ccp giving us an update at the moment we only hear from you guys when you have actually got something for us but we need to know we are not forgotten please ccp a update we want to know how you guys are doing on these issues are you working on it  are you struggling with a specific aspect  have you got ideas in your head already 
my suggestion fit smartbombs and fof missiles also try reporting to the gms when youre going to have a fleet fight so they can reinforce that serverive lost most of my sympathy for complaints about lag in fleets since my caracal was hotdropped by a titan and support fleet im pretty sure that the only reason i survived was because of lag
i gms wont post hereii there are more important things to be fixed like new level 4 missions or grammatical mistakes in item descriptionsiii not supported
you reap what you sow sorry no pity for the 00bears
anyone who dares a gm to do anything is either ed or just flat beyond all reasonable helpget help fastor take a break from the game
within a couple of hours of a devblog on lag being postedpriceless
as title say  when you apply plex you become immune to lag for 24 hoursall server and bandwith power gets primary to suit needs of your game
rofl you dont know how the internetz works do you
its probably a trollscoops out its eyeballs and eats themhmm strangely crunchy
all the changes made with the addition of the carbon engine in the game are alienating a good chunk of the player base a lot of the lag comes from the hair model generationsupported since the graphicscode changes made since the carbon engine is worse than the ingame learning curve
the op has been updated with new infothanks for your support everyone keep it coming
please unwithdraw the proposal this issue is not only caused by shader model for example i can load the character design screen but not the portrait design screen the loading bar for the latter fills up and then sits there doing nothing forevermore the only reason i have a portrait is because i managed to get it to work on linux
i was not aware of this mirabi i unwithdrew the proposal
thank you 
well if one alliance owns too much space then it just takes a few other alliances all attacking different places to take some of their space in the end one alliance isnt worth a whole lot takes a few alliances working together to do anything big all these alliances that supposably own most of 00 actually hardly do anything with any of their space so as this topic is about its fairly common to steamroll them the reason why coalations like nc work is because its a whole bunch of smaller alliances working together with the bigger onesif by any chance any of the big alliances decides to defect or go against what the coalation wants the rest of the coalation is still bigger than that one alliance so the coalation can survive it
well this is ed why boost alliances holding entire regions of space and allow to steamroll the smaller guys isnt that the opposite of what ccp always declares they want  to allow smaller entity entrance to 00
so small alliances should have the choice of either being way more vulnerable due to game mechanics than larger ones and then add the numerical differences or they may become petshow does this actually solve any of the dominion problem it only makes the last part of steamrolling a dying block or just attacking a smaller alliance easier you should be aware hell anyone who makes posts about fixing 00 that pretty much everything you do to promote conflict ends up in more people naping each other to compensate for the decrease in safety
fortressing should be a valid way of holding off attackers regardless the territory an alliance controls it will not work if morale drops or you run out of assets and this propsal will just discourage subregion level sov brawl id think very carefully through any changes of territorial mechanics
because one of the lunacies of 00 atm is that its a massive grind reguardless of who holds the space small alliances atm still cant hold space on their own without big brother all this does is make it a defensive disadvantage this proposal only speeds up the attack on the current system of moronic space holding making the larger alliances more vulnerable if they choose to keep it in placeits also incredibly hard for larger alliances to hold huge amounts of space they way they currently do using the new system for example ill use mm currently mm holds part of pure blind and part of vale space under the new system those territories would be much weaker also mm jump bridge and jump beacon network across the north would be removed under this system because of the requirements not being met this means mm would have one of two choices give up the space to someone else or claim the entire regionconstellation this means theres a higher cost and a much easier way to break the sov than trying to grind an ihub just in the primary system attackers can now attack the entire constellation and force morsus to defend 6  systems rather than stack 1 system with crazy numbers it effectively deblobs an entity to some degree this means using a large coalition as an example the larger alliances can fight the pirmary fight while smaller groups can achieve secondary task in other systems left undefended this actually adds viable goals for smaller groupsif youre asking me how this changes the ability of smaller organizations in todays eve the simple answer is it doesnt it changes the requirements of the larger entities to actually defend their renterspets from a lot of attacks or for those renters and pets to actually lose more of their freedom both of these ultimately create more conflict
vindicated by mittanis confession of nullsec conspiracy to blob the csm
you are aware that big protected hubs are hubs because of the resources available around them right the deserted areas would become very populated almost immediately if your big plan came to fruitionjump bridges arent at all safer than gates you dont know if a hostile gang is waiting for you on the other side and you do not have a cloak they also require expensive fuel for every jump  getting a decent sized bsbchac gang through a jump bridge route will easily cost hundreds of millions of isk

i will be travelling interstate when the campaign endsgood luck to all candidates it has been fun fun fun all the wayespecially good luck to windy his goon made campaign speech will contnue to haunt my childrens sleep long after he has won
my god windypops is doing so well at trolling this csm election cyclei love it so much
cool maybe this csm term will actually be interesting
i still  goons would have voted for goons but know a cool dude running so voted for him instead
blatant bump without even the pretense of adding to the discussionexcept to say gl jon
well the elections are almost over and i am happy with the way things are shaping upcongratualtions to all teh other candidates and good luck on the final resultsif there is anyone still out there that has not voted for me  then please do soi will see you all on the otherside of the counting process
entertaining but utterly biased column aaah the old but they want to destroy our nullsec by taking away our jbs argumentbtw helen highwater was also present at that meeting i hope i do get in csm 6 so we can have the opportunity to discuss this whole 00 thing again
tldritt attention seeker seeks attention
no scam ever pulled by any goon has ever come close to the level of pubbie tears that this csm run has createdgg
counterpoint disband of brothers csm1 t20 threadnaughtwhile amusing this csm run has been little more than entertainment while we wait for someone new to destroy
insecure much
sorry i voted for someone outside goon
3 goons unironically talking about pubbies we all know that paying for sa membership fee makes one elite
good article
went to the site pretty much expecting a self serving biased article  i was right
speaking of divisive personalities i like how mittens thinks he will be more effective than jade constantine hell because of who he is he might even be less effective which would be a hoot in itselfat least this election cycle has provided some good forum pron
i has an sa account ive played other games with goons confirming they are the pubbies pubbies
i know its a long shot but if the mits didnt get his pubbie grubbies into csm6how would we ever stop laughing a potentially serious medical concernwindjammer
i think this is the cue for mittani to go all xanatos gambit about how tth page views ultimately benefit him
in case your votematch result didnt suit you so well then vote for ms pacmanms pacman the fix nullsec csm more challenge for pirates and empire corporations
this is a wonderful resource dierdra as a relative newcomer to the world of eve i could not have possibly gleaned from all the candidate statements how strongly they felt about the wide range of issues facing the csm csm vote match helped me avoid the common mistake of selecting a wellspoken candidate who happens to support gameplay revisions to which i am diametrically opposedthe vote match is a great starting point and i am grateful i did not have to read every candidate statement or personal web page before voting thank you
why must people always compare csm elections to rl government elections people in rl get one vote people in eve get one vote per account that alone makes the current process comicalmay as well do it like those ty reality tv shows so that players decide who gets in and ccp decides who stays
theres something wrong on the  values pretty visible when looking at the 2 last numbersi checked some others number and so you give value with 2 decimals while your base value seems to change between 344k and 351k oo
oh hey idea make voting mandatory even if its just to abstain once voting starts bring the vote box up on the client login and dont let them continue to the game until a vote has been cast
john the 2200 hrs update pls and the closing one at 0000 hrs
pathetic goon mindwar failed voted for trebor
many thanks i do need them
 the skilltraining queue was a csm initiativereally  this idea has been around since launch csm input 0  the csm helped the players give ccp a corporationwide wakeup call in the summer of 2010 resulting in ccp allocating more resources to supporting and improving old contentoutcome 0  the recent removal of learning skills was implemented almost exactly as the csm suggestedagain been around since day 1 csm input 0  csm and player pressure about performance issues encouraged ccp to create a special group team gridlock dedicated to the war on laghahahahahahahahahahaha war for lag more like  csm crowdsourcing and prioritization efforts resulted in many csmsponsored game fixes being released in incursion and the allocation of team bff to the task of fixing potholes during the current development cycletoo many meaningless buzzwords to make any sense of this   csm lead the effort to ensure than any microtransactions added to eve would be limited to vanity itemscsm sould have stopped this altogether microtransactions  crap this isnt zero its negative  csm encouraged ccp to implement staged release plans as was used in incursion and will be used with incarnaccp realised at last that they arent good at releasing lots of changes at the same time  then said the csm helped them figure this outps encouraged csm is like gaddafis cabinetutterly pointless
indeed some think of the csm as something like this linkageof course some of us actually read the csm minutes and i wish more did the same its not about just throwing your ideas at ccp and ban hammering any bad suggestions ccp gives you its really about knowing the mechanics behind eve as well as knowing what is resonably possible for ccp to do the more both parties understand each others limitations the less wasted breath there will be in such discussions its when newb csm members get in and start spewing nonsense ideassuggestions that things turn sour there are things sour on ccps side as well in that developmental resources have already been allocated and it can be hard to get any good suggestionidea somewhat into the development process this is why we need more people like you in the csm to provide balance and at least some insight into what would actually happen from a players perspective when certain mechanics are put into the game and im sure you push for action against bots and rmt just as much as the next guy however if i dont see or hear anything of significant substance about what ccp is doing about such activities during fanfest i am disappointi had voted for you before you sent that mail i hope you get reinstated to the csm you are needed edit darius buyingscamming votes is just silly
ok meissa anunthiel i voted for ya now csm people maybe give us some pvp without the blob mkay
since the majority of eve doesnt vote especially empire scamming people into voting is a good way to get a free plane ticketdarius will come out on top too youll see id bet a plex for it
meissa knows more about the mechanics of the game than anyone probably including some of the devs all you have to do is review meissas forum posts to see who you should vote for
ive never heard of her him until this election shrugon topic about the csm ive had more development impact alone than all the csm sessions put together
no i havent i would give you my chat logs but everyone knows they can be faked in fact i was the one wanting to scam him to give me the plex first and vote for someone else later in these conditions a vote for csm is useless and i shall vote for none
you shall be the source for lolz and you sir truly are
as long as im the n1 source its ok with me 
he is rooks and kingstherfore should be banned from csm
ok so i voted and he sent me the plex this is not a scam
if youre prepared to have your vote bought you should be equally prepared to have your vote stolen
im curious as to why you think thatwe dont smack we make nice videos we fight outnumbered 21 or 31if anything the attitude knowledge and skill we display should be reason to vote not the opposite
listen to yourself your reasoning is the very reasons people shouldnt vote for a bunch of clownshoe like you and indirectly rk for csmnice videos surely you mean videos where we chase after the zen of uptightness with the narration of david attenboroughwannabes
do not vote for csm candidates that spam local chat in game that is what i do block and do not vote for themps miilla for csmpps if you convo hemp invader to give your vote you could win a plex
i dont like people buying votes because i have enough of it in rli also dont like those who jump all over high sec spamming to vote themfinally i dont like those who mass mail its actually forbidden by ccp terms of serviceso what csm candidate does not fall in the 3 above and still has a vague idea about how eve works
actually when i have encountered rooks and kings in low sec you guys smacked like little babies just saying
shame all the good replies never get credit well done
thanks for letting me know about this candidate and on further investigation his position6 votes for darius iii
funny thing is he posted this email to me too or should i say to another alt or main depending on how you view it that i havent posted on the forums with for years so either he reads old old posts or he somehow has some inside way of knowing who my main is versus who i mostly post with
you pay attention to jita local
sending excessive emails is a tos violation petition rules  policies  harassment
he gave me my plex also after i voted for him no scamone darius  as csm  to rule them all
indeed hence why i cleared the matter with gms before sending messagesbut really if you were offended im sorry it should be obvious the email wants to be informative in nature not inflamatory most of the replies i received were thank you or questions
your finished contracts are open for all to see dont have to be a genius to figure out a main if you have a regular supply traffic via contracts tofrom your altalso if you bought a character from the bazaar mr google knows it
confirming that i am that candidate confirming that i am a suicide ganker with over 1 trillion isk in suicide ganks confirming that i never ever bought votes confirming that i offered to buy votes confirming that those i offered to give plex to for their votewill never receive them cold dead hands confirming that ccp likes my style as i got more people who would have not voted without me smirk having scammed them into voting sorry for the trillion threads i swear not one is me or my pr agents read the non banned non locked cp thread to see how i infuriated so many people and trolled them to a froth literally me please do not make forum post him someone already did make forum post me please dont make second oneit would crush my campaign lolz 999 darius threads and not one out of my camp lolz sorry ccp mods win lose or draw i kept my only election promiseto have fun with the election process i do love you guys protip op was scammed by me out of my vote looking thru logs this whole thread is by a liar about failed to sell his vote about a suicide ganker fraudster pirate and known troll he is worse than han solo from star trek
moved from general discussion
 hemp invader  hope you lose
excessive evemails means a lot of mails to you not one mail to a bunch of people you ing moron
epic
confirming that darius iii gives plex for votes he also gives a wicked reacharound
so by your logic if you send 50k mails one to each player it wouldnt be excessive hahahah
i know i would never do anything similar while running for a csm seat but i have to say spamming and scamming are the sort of shenanigans ive come to expect in eve i can only hope it really didnt net any votes but there are those that play eve assuming youll never go broke underestimating the intelligence of the average eve player issler dainze
i stole hundreds of votes by scamming scrubs and hundreds more voted for me becasue they approved also the game o
guys this is totally a lie i voted for darius and he sent a plex to each of my accounts that i voted with hes just trying to maintain his scammercred but tell your friends that you will definitely get a plex for each vote you give to darius
last day of voting in upon usif youre looking for a pvp candidate and for whatever reason you value killmails im apparently on more than a thousand this month yea thats totally relevantseriously though if i place i have a pretty sweet victory speech written so you probably want to vote if only to read it my welp i failed speech is significantly tier its basically welp i failed
hope you get elected and serious candidates like you with the best intentions for the game in mind and no personall agenda
1 i love gallente ships and theres no question that both gallente ships in general and hybrid weapons in particular need rebalancing ive written a long blog post about this when the subject comes up before the csm i will strongly support such a rebalancing may it come soon2 i spent more than a year as part of the empire recruiting corp for a 00 corp in that position i ran a weekly l4 mission group for new members of that corp most of them new eve players i was running l4 missions weekly when the mission lootdrone loot nerf hit last year in my opinion the nerf was taken too far i understand why it was done but i think it hurt people who just want to play eve casually in empire that said missionrunning is one of the aspects of the game that needs some new attention many of the missions need to be rebalanced or releveled and it would be nice to have some new missions written3 ive written a post earlier in this thread about my ideas for lowsec
i am with you
your quick helpful response to my issue with ccps treatment of factional warfare puts reallife politicians to shame im voting for you and my friends will all be advised to do the same
first of all negotiating tactics that are appropriate for a political or business negotiation between two parties with power are almost never appropriate for situations csm usually deals withwe dont have power we have influence csm gains more influence by repeatedly proving it is a useful business tool for ccp  the more csm does that the more likely it is that groups within ccp will consult csm on a more frequent basis listen to our advice and take it into accountstaking out an extreme negotiating position is pointless because all it does is provide ammunition for the lolcsm argument and its foolish because its not a negotiation in the first place its a seduction
is that not a tad contradictoryyou spend most of this thread proposing solutions  giving the impression these are things you want to push to have implemented but now you say the csm does not negotiate the csm does not have power the csm tries to beg and seduce ccp to make changes and this is ok with you i wont drag this on indefinately i am sure you wil work hard if elected you definately seem to take the whole thing very seriously but i can not agree with your goals or your approach so best of luck but my vote goes elsewhere
i dont think its contradictory at allthe csm has influence the candidates post their opinions on the directions they want their influence to work in and why they will make certain choices when dealing with ccp trebor has a great track record working on the csm whether you agree with him on every point or not doesnt matter whats imnportant is that he understands the csm process and will work in everybodys interestsunlike other candidates who make great pronouncements with little real substance launch smear campaigns and rely on the bloc votes of their alliance peons to prop up their own personal ego
as i told trebor in some private correspondence character still matters to me i would much rather place my vote with someone that i disagree with on some issues but is an honest person who listens and tries to make a well informed decision compare this to other candidates who run smear campaigns and will promise you the moon an r64 one at that for your vote just to get electedi dont begrudge those who have the backing of a large alliance after all a large alliance represents a lot of players and they deserve to have their say in front of ccp as much as anyone else the problem comes when those elected have only the interest of their alliance in mindthe csm being a committee means that the members have to play nice with others if they dont then there isnt a point in having a csm at all
i really would appreciate it if you would do me the courtesy of misrepresenting my positions in a more skillful manner sikhtar you obviously have the skill to do it and the fact that youre not trying your best is well it makes me sad you well know that a the discussions in this thread about particular mechanics were not started by me b they refer to suggestions i made in the previous campaign and c i dont push my own personal ideas at the csm levelcsm doesnt get things done by telling ccp to do things it gets things done by demonstrating to ccp that it is in their best interests to do something that the players want
just a message of support to say good luck selenecsm6 is probably the most important csm yet and we need the best people we can get on board
you get all 5 of my votesill see you in spaceglobi
you have got mine vote too if that mattersbut please  do humor me and share your thoughts about those neverseen t3 frigs

i could simply say yes to this as i do believe all of the above need looking at but the issue is much larger than just one race or set of modules i want to see a fully dedicated live balance team that does not get pulled off to work on shiny butterfly fotm new features if we can get that then issues like this would resolve themselves over time through an everevolving balance processi would like to see a complete overhaul of the agent system i touched a bit on that in this posttwo very neglected aspects of eve you might enjoy reading my reply here as it details my mindset on this issueevery vote matters and thank you as for t3 frigs your guess is as good as mine they were hinted at in the keynote presentation at fanfest in oct 2009 its been two years since the release of apochrypha and t3 cruisers one would think that one of the more popular bits of game play ever released would have seen some form of iteration by now amiritethis is exactly the kind of thing i am trying to win a csm seat over  i want to ask these questions on your behalf and i want to see the game play we have now and enjoy today be finished and balancedthe last ccp tweet said that there are 47816 votes so far please poke everyone you know to get out there and vote
best of luck seleene  will be interesting to see how the results pan out its been a pretty rough ride this year
elniaga youre so ignorant lemme educate you when seleene was an eve dev players loved his ideas and when he left players were asking ccp to bring him back for months people were repeatedly saying on forums bring seleene backso elniaga point your hate towards yourself for being uninformed seleene was a respected and admired dev and i hope he doesnt need your vote to get on the counsil
anyone know if im winning because if not im going back to bedalso what do i get if i win
i will only support this if i can get kelley to take care of my fish because i wont remember and they will die
ok just voted all 3 of my accounts for youbest of luck
last chance to remind everyone to votei hope i get a chance to represent the industrialist small corp or solo player folks interested in seeing low sec improved and the general carebear pilots of eveelect me and i will do right by youissler dainzethe voice of reason csm candidate
huge thanks to everyone that supported mei hope i am given the opportunity to represent you in the csmissler dainze
i use aura for android but its really only useful for displaying pilot skill queues i would love to see an ap that has more useful features like being able to check and send ingame mail to the best of my understanding the current api parameters do not allow for these kinds of features is there any chance we could get some leeway here for a more interactive mobile management interface
1 as one of the developers of the current shader architecture dx team member through dx 90 i guess the question id ask is how many players this change will affect a small number i expect and i can tell you the jump in the shader revision provides the developer a lot more capabilities2 definitelyissler dainze
1 no upgrade there no reason why development time should be spent working around old architecture if you want to play something on your p2 play solitare2 no largely because what the public sees and what actually happens are typically clouded special thanks to ndas

your post just shows how much you pay attention to this game and its communityresults will not be posted until the 30th unless stated otherwisethanks and dont forget to vote prom4csm before its too late
whatoh youre mad he didnt include you
ok came back early vote for butch last push 
last day of votingi am not a crook   richard nixonask not what your country can do for you jfktear down these walls ronald reganread my lips george hw bushahhhhhhhhhh bill clinton good luck to all great voting run this yearbutch leupold
let me preface this by saying i havent been asked by anybody to do this in order to promote him im writing this post simply because im bored and figure that my posting isnt quite terrible enough that your eyes will meltif you dont live in nullsec and specifically the nc you probably dont know who i am within the nc and tests allies im slightly infamous mainly because i yell and scream obscenities constantly on voice comms and partially because i trolled own alliance into caving in and being shipped off to the kalevala expanse to forever live as a buffer against the russian horde i have terrible killboard stats as if they matter and have purposely lost a one billion isk rifter to blues to further that opinionim voting for the mittani for a few simple reasons the primary reason that im voting for him is that hes realistic he hasnt sugarcoated much of his campaign hes been blunt honest and generally straightforward with his opinions and objectives on the csm he wants a large nullsec presence on the csm to avoid another situation of yeah you should get rid of jump bridgeseven though nullsec only makes up about 10 of eves population i agree that the csm should consist of largely nullsec players this is because of the impact nullsec has on the game it is in my opinion the driving force behind eves popularity the majority of advertising ccp employs is nullsec related whether its massive fleet engagements capital warfare invasions or politics most of their advertising revolves around the various entities that live in nullsecurity spacethe importance nullsec players have on the game is also astounding the sheer volume of alternate characters that nullsec pilots have in low and high security space fuels the various areas of the game beyond the fauceting of level 4 and mining supercapital engagements have even been known to spike the price of minerals throughout the entire game universeno mittens does not have an enormous vested interest in fixing faction warfare he doesnt much care about balancing various lp stores or tweaking highsec aggression mechanics such as neutral repairing hes a nullsec candidate who is going to focus on nullsecurity issues and general game design choices the ui for example however changes to nullsec have a loud reverberating effect on the entire game whether its from manufacturing sovereignty modules instead of poses the recent popularity of the maelstrom or the death of the sniper armor battleship every shift in nullsec changes the game for everybody in a way that just isnt present with things like faction warfare or level 4 missioningthe final and one of the most important reasons that im voting for the mittani is that hes intelligent yes you can say hes a goon the fact that hes a goon doesnt change the fact that he brought goonswarm federation back from irrelevancy you can say they were donated deklein by tcf you can say they blobbed but the fact is that running the largest alliance in the game across multiple timezones and languages is hard the fact that he is able to consistently and effectively manage his alliance with realism and without ctas or forced ops is a respectable achievement this gives me confidence that my vote to the mittani will not be a wasted one
hurf blurf please visit your user settings to reenable imagesmaybe you should listen to what the man says
the dude makes so much money in real life he could afford to go somewhere a lot cooler than iceland a million times over i dont think he cares too much about winning a free trip to hang out with some fat developer nerds in an overheated office in iceland so he can argue about video games
please show your alliance name when brown nosingalso its been done 
how much money does an unemployed lawyer make
dont be cruel to the guy missing the point can happen
a ridiculously employable excorporate lawyer with residual incomealso i can show my alliance name on here
you cant i mean most people can but im told montolio has specifically asked that any time you post that your alliance is not displayed this is for our safety of course
somewhere a lot cooler than iceland the north pole perhapskaching
i want a photo of mittens kissing a baby s fist vote for mittens
last day to vote vote krutoj 
an insightful read even though we are red to each other cant argue the man doesnt know his stuffas regards destructable outposts i think more in the lines of severely disabled until a new egg is dropped to repair it but upgrades not lostpeople could still dock but absolutely no services work and only to put items being held into current ship allowed
i do understand the sentiment however i made sure nobody was contacted twice one email a year hardly constitutes a major annoyance especially when in this case it is relevant to current matters and directed at specific individualsthere are few venues for us to reach out to you so im making use of what is available and yes ive cleared this with the gms before sending mails outjudging from the feedback ive had its been more well received than not and the vast majority of replies were thank you rather than  youbut anyway if that is deterrent enough for you to vote for me or trebor im sure there are other viable candidates to vote for out there seleenes not half bad jonathon has merit check their programs see if anything suits you but vote
i also dont have an issue with it i have received a few mails from candidates three maybe four spread out over two weeks is very reasonable many players never read the forums and believe it or not dont even know that the csm exists or that elections are going onif you dont like people sending you mail then jack up your cspa charge theyll probably skip over someone who is asking for 1 million isk
actually i was paying the 1 million isk cspa charges just to get the message out so some people made well off it all in all i have spend about 5060 million isk on cspa charges which is well worth it in my opinion to get more voters to the pollslike others have reported most responses have been good some few bad for which i appologise and wish them wellmost people are just happy i have reached out to them had some really good conversations as a result of this program
reposting
are you sure you know this game as well as you think you do yes thats a rhetorical question  now go and read up on cspa charges
made well ment that they forced me to shell out isk i know it goes to concord not the character
ankh did this as well but she was annoying in general
bump for a candidate who understands what makes eve great
low sec pirates are crybabies who are afraid of bubbles or they would be in 00 to have some real pvpfw is a training class for real 00 pvp00 is every industrialist dream they just dont realize it because they are to afraid to come and hisec is too cosy moving all lvl4 to lowsec should do the trick and bring us more pets andor targets to shoot atnapfest are here for a reason so we can make more profit and buid supercapitals without worrying about wars or depletion of ressources and thats perfectly normalnerfing jumbridges would kill 00 without them 00 life wont be bearable at all we wont be able to move in hisec they can move safely its unfairdominion was a huge success it brought lots of smaller alliances to 00 as expectedbesides they are our pets now and it means more money without even having to effectively do anything but building supercaps to frighten them everythings good we can roam lowsec in deadspace fitted t3 fleets when we are bored and hotdrop 5 titans on a random drake fleet for the funtired of hearing that from 00 playerssee why they cant understand empire playerswant empire to be represented in csm6vote for me 
yes thats a beautiful example of a straw man argument
thanks for the free bump youre right but i think its clear enough its an overemphasis so
pity bump
you know youre desperate when
mittens emorage is subtle and sophomoric rather like a young student whos just figured out that the student council president cant really do anything about lessening the amount of homework or getting better food in the lunchroom and decides that the student council is therefore worthless
no see in order for an insult about reading skills to have any weight the person saying it has to not demonstrate their cluelessness in that very comment mittens said correctly that ccp treats the csm as a focus group that doesnt mean that they dont care about them just that they care about them only as a focus group this is basic then again as youre still hunting after a conspiracy theory maybe that point is lost
the assertion made that you referenced theyre lying to you is very much referring to the csm candidates who are promising all kinds of shiny stuff and new features not ccpmittens asserts that ccp are treating csm as a focus group not a stakeholder this is somewhat distinct from asserting that they dont care about itpolitics are crap largely because people misinterpret and extrapolate what others say and then hold them to those misinterpretationsextrapolations kiddo vote for me  i like to make sure were all clear on exactly what people do and dont say
funfact the above quote can be said about everything associated with humans when dealing with any game mechanics honestly do you even know what human nature meansalso if eve was the only game out there people may have believed your ed  generic reply however since it isnt only the flying monkeys  sheeps will believe your bull
funfact the plural of sheep is sheepseriously though human nature ie what it means to be human how humans naturally thinkact guides game design considerably but ultimately whatever mechanics are put in place will take second place to guide what players do than what they are inherently conditioned to do anywayone really cool aspect of eve is the sandbox  giving people a persistent world to go explore and play around with but ultimately theyre not playing with the game theyre playing with each other the mechanisms in place support this at every turnthis is a social game where the content is provided by the players if you dont like that there are plenty of theme park mmos which guide players actions a lot more and therefore arent as susceptible to the effects of human nature but they are artificial and arbitrary currently eve is neither of those thingsadding game mechanisms to limit how players interact with each other eg blobbing will fundamentally change what eve is throwing the baby out with the bath water as it werei thought the previously posted summary would be enough to convey the gist of this message but apparently notwhat might be nice is if you actually addressed the issues rather resorting to petty personal attacks is that too much to ask
ccp dont change lowsec because of human natureccp dont change fw because of human natureccp dont change anything in eve because of human natureccp since everyone wants to survive just prevent ships from dying by making it impossible to kill ships  podswhat i mean is changes arent needed because of human nature so therefore dont change because of human needs make sense no thought not pimigo guess what theres a difference between real life and make believe and theres a huge difference between need and want know the difference and maybe you will understand why the game mechanics are at fault
how lowsec works is a game mechanic and can be modified by ccphow fw works is a game mechanic and can be modified by ccphow sov works is a game mechanic and can be modified by ccphow moon mining works is a game mechanic and can be modified by ccpblobbing and number warfare what your original complaint that i referenced was about is not a game mechanic or an effect of game mechanics it is an effect of human naturetry not to put words into other peoples mouths just so you can argue a different point that they never made in the first place
once again you have said human nature and fail to see how saying that can be said about anything a person does you may as well have said players in eve do stuff because of human naturethen do explain oh wise one why blobbing aka number warfare in huge 2k numbers doesnt happen in hisec why whs arent blobbed with extreme numbers and why you will only hear about huge mega numbers in 00you can try and word it to benefit your cause but it makes no difference but dont think for a second anyone is going to fall for your number warfare happens because we are all human and need to survive and it has nothing todo with the mechanics of 00 and expect people to believe itin a game where risk  reward are balanced with every action explain how 00 mega naps can blue everything within 60 jumps get numbers past 2000 just with half of their coalition and not have any penalties for having 55k people naped you guys complain about hisec mission runners all the time but the fact of the matter is you are no different to themin an internet spaceship game human needs arent always taken into consideration otherwise you would have had to feed your nap train now thats human nature too are you saying to ccp that you want to age have hunger get ill in game i mean if we have to include everything in human nature we would have to include those which is fine since im all for a nc faminefact of the matter is it is the mechanics that allow huge mega to form and why 00 is only affected by gigantic mega napswhat needs to change in the mechanics is timers and sov warfare claiming a system atm timers allow coalitions alot of time to form and blob in numbers only another coalition can match sov warfare focuses on one system where battles end in blob vs blob vs structureif sov warfare and timers were changed to make it faster in claiming a system and involved alot of movement no jump bridging to a random system via a titan then sitting there for 10 hours isnt considered movementthere will be people who say well the nap wouldnt break it will just have alot of mini fleets everywhere while this is true everyone else can manage mini fleets only nc and drf can manage 2000 in numbersnaps would be naps and not hey we should blue because meatshields are best friends yo i mean the whole idea of a nap is nonaggression but all we see are naps being renters and pets there as cannon fodderoh and one last thing ccp and the previous csm including vuk lau all stated in the last csm minutes that the mechanics in 00 were in short  the warfare was limited to shooting structures so i cant really see why you are trying to convince people number warfare naturally happens and ccp cant do anything about it especially when it is an obvious problemtldr blobbing happens and someone will always get blobbed number warfare numbers  numbers  numbers happens because of ty mechanics that limits movement reduces warfare to structure and forces new alliances to pick a side rather than be independent timers allow mega huge numbers to form they also make the enemy focus on one system they also prevent dead alliances which have been dead for weeks from dying are you really telling people that the mechanics arent at fault here
im going to attempt to write this whole post without using the b word because its used pretty consistantly to mean any fleet bigger than what i can form but first im going to crosspost this from another thread because it seems pretty applicable herebringing more people needs to work because otherwise you end up in a game where only people in t3 ships with massive entitlement complexes are allowed to pvpwormholes and highsec arent fought over by large fleets because anyone with the organisation to form one is out in 00 wormholes also dont stay connected to the same place long enough and arent able to support more than a couple of people at oncehuman nature  biological needsthere are very few people who think the current sov mechanics arent broken but giant coalitions existed before dominion and will continue to exist long after its fixed you are exactly the kind of person i was concerned about being a csm candidate in trebors thread youre mad because your 7 man corp cant claim space that a 5000 man alliance wants so youre willing to accept solutions which massively compromise the vision of eve because they also further your waaa people have more friends than me its not fair agenda
you really must stop putting words in other peoples mouths and arguing with points that havent been madeive never complained about highsec mission runners ive never said the mechanics of 00 are perfect and ive never suggested that human needs should be modelled in the game you seem to be asserting that i have and providing counter points to thati also havent said that ccp cant do anything about blobbingnumber warfare i said that eve is a game where content is provided by the players and preventing that ie arbitrarily preventing players from forming groups would make it more of a theme park mmo which it currently isnt and shouldnt bewhat you have said is that the current mechanics promote blobbing and number warfarewhat i have said is that its not the game mechanics that promote blobbing and number warfare its human nature you can change the mechanics all you want but people will always find a way to get safety in numbers due to human nature if thats what they want which it seems they dodont go confusing human nature with human need they are quite different thingswhy doesnt it happen in high sec you ask one possible explanation is that people in highsec dont need to defend their access to their territory its not really theirs as such the game does that for themwhy doesnt blobbingnumbers warfare happen in wormholes well that would be assuming that it doesnt but to humour you if you look at the qen youll see that less people live in wormholes than anywhere else also moving around wormholes is inherently a lot more arduous no gates these points could go some way to explaining the perception that whs dont get blobbed so much although try asking the targets of aharm whether or not they got blobbedso again please try to argue the points i have made
thats your gripeyou dont like that folks that have large numbers of allies can bring their full force to bearwelcome to mmoswelcome to the real worldas much as blobs  me off when im solo roamingmehfleets happen
imigo i replied to exactly what you said i even quoted you on what i was replying to i cant see how im putting words in your mouth when my reply was about mechanics and human natureas for the people saying blob if you bothered to read what i said which obviously you never i already mentioned that blobs will happen and will continue to its number warfare where strategy is dependant on numbers  numbers  numbers and i guess who can get into the system the first and not lag out and dieblobbing and number warfare are two different things ponce you figured out the difference between the two let me know after all blobbing is being outnumbered and number warfare is exploiting mechanics so that you are always ahead in numbers and your strategy is as simple as that 00 favours this because of timers  structure bashingi made it perfectly clear what my point was p
timers exist to prevent smaller entities without 23 hour coverage having their space taken while theyre asleep going on a crusade against large alliances then bringing up timers really highlights how much you dont know what youre talking aboutyou really didnt your post descended into almost unreadable white noise before the end
lolyou do know what aka means dont you
not really having more friends than you do is not exploiting anythingif you must have issues with 00 people take issue with the vocal portion of them that are arrogant selfentitled heads who think that 00 blob warfare is the only way to play the game and anyone who just wants to make a quiet living missioning in empire or mining or whatever the hell is a idiot pubbie
interesting observation by raph koster ultima onlinestar wars galaxies that 40 of players dont like pvp this is an estimated and general ie not specific to any game value eve still has its appeal to these player types which in a primarily pvp game is quite an impressive design feat
pirates and empire corps cast your votes on ms pacman
im totally better and more qualified just putting that out there
i am an empire player and i spend 95 of my time in pvp be it pirates against antipirates or wardecsim antipirate myself but im not biased at all i need pirates to hunt them and have my fun and i think there is not enough of them how to have more pirates  make lowsec really interesting for everyoneon the other hand i also think antipirates and all lowsec pvper who are not pirates should see their gamestyle improved through killrights wardecs and fw improvement mostlyas for industrial empire corp i play with them every single day i assist them when they get waredecced and i really know what their everyday life is like why they dont usually like lowsec and most importantly why a lot of them dont want to move to 00 because its not the endgame something almost every 00 candidates just cant understand and explain why they cannot represent you 00 pvpers thinking low sec pirates are crybabies afraid of bubbles i think everyone knows that how could you think these candidates could represent you everif you want to know more about me ask anything or tell me what you think about anything please come and tell meeve mail preferred for today but if im connected convo or nw public channel will do
all eve players remember to cast your votes on gehen sealbreaker seriously extremepacman you should not give yourself such hard limitations
do you really want to go there againalso want my turn to hijack the thread to say im the best candidate for all play styles and you should vote for mewhat everyone else is doing it
not empty quoting vote for me instead
no me
 because we dont think1 anyone actually listens to you2 any of you actually give a damn what the majority of players actually want3 any of you are worth voting forthank you for playing have a safe flight to wherever your alliance sit around and hurhur about getting their guy on the teamcomplete and utter waste of time
much like this thread
and indeed your haircut
siouxsie and the banshees are effin horrible get better taste in music
happy house
in fact im running to make the voice of the majority heard when some minority tries to get all seatsreminder  empire players are the vast majority of eve players sadly they dont vote enough thus they are not represented enough and the vast majority of csm members are 00 players most of them from powerbloc this year i betwant someone to represent the majority in csm  vote for me then
start by reading what some of the candidates say or learn to troll better 
what did someone say something oh sry thought i heard something guess not
last call to votevote through this link
you must be trollin right 
krutoj sadly didnt do much campaigning and i should have really made this thread a week ago but no matter 1 day left so why not if you havent voted yet krutoj would be a great choicefirstly i would like to mention that drf arent the source of rmt  botting and sadly due to propaganda by nc the finger is sadly always pointed at them not saying they dont have players who bot but every alliance has some botters  rmt and singling out drf is pretty stupidok so it may or may not be obvious by now but nc have thrown in the towel in this drf vs nc invasion which in effect will kill them now while this may not be something major since lets face it it is just another coalition beating a weak one despite the weaker coalition nc having more numbers and isk drf unlike nc dont have this obsession with taking over everythingas you probably know nc want to control all of the csm seats as well as all of 00 whatever the true reason behind this nc invasion we should actually look at how it changes 00 drf have no plans to control all of 00 though xix have some past friendship with goons unlike nc when there was a goon conflict they never got involved this is proof alone that 00 will be better now that nc have surrendered to drf this may seem a little confusing so i will put it in powerbloc  csm terms after all this whole post is todo with csm and the future of evewith nc gone goons will most likely die to the first alliance that invades them they have never been good without nc and it is very unlikely drf will save them this opens up a lot of opportunities in the north and west where several alliances now have the freedom to create new friends enemies and most important wars and drama dthis is something that has been long expected the 00 problems will still be there but now the urge for an evil dictator to control all of 00 wont be ofc drf will still be larger and strong but unlike nc they arent afraid to reset and probably will as they enjoy local combati for one thank krutoj and drf for making 00 a better place already and think he would make an excellent csm as he understands the balance even in this horribly broken game and already is making the game and 00 a better place through war and destructionvote for krutoj and bring back small scale warfare in 00
while i certainly hope ive earned your vote if i have not krutoj would be a great choice as well he would do a good job on the csm
seriously that isnt scamming its out and out trolling fools  if people even stopped to think for 10 seconds who in their right mind is going to give a plax for each vote they recieve  are people really this b if they really are and it appears some must indeed be so then good luck darius iii5
i stole hundreds of votes the suckers were coming at me so fast and furious i couldnt keep up with the convos i had to tell my remote posters to chill for a minute at one point i had 20 open windows most of which i snagged made a few friends best part was when it came time to find it that they were scammed when will i get my plex me when do you think neverplease allow 999999 weeks for deliverythanks and sorry thanks for your vote sorry i had to steal it loads of fun free trip to iceland here i come lols
i voted for him because i like his style
i voted darius as well for the amount of joy he has brought these forums
definately a great marketing ploy nice work p
at the end of the day with the democratic process it doesnt matter how good your policies are how qualified you are or why people voted for youall that matters is that enough people click the vote button beside your nameisnt democracy grand
so petition ittheres a good chance that it isnt allowed ccps stance is that incontext scamming like selling a regular raven as a navy issue is ok out of context scamming like cheating on plex aid is completely out of bounds
you are filled with bitterness and fail dont be a hater so some scrubs got gaffeled out of their vote those scrubs who tried to sell their vote then got ripped off ahhahah ahahahah ahhahaha desreve everything they got bless the morons for they are many not to mention using their shattered sense of importance to fuel the butthurtthey made no less than eight separate posts using their very bones to fuel the pr engine how does it feel scamming votes very satisfying ps leave brittany alone i know my rights
in a way its in the spirit of evei personally think it is lame albeit funny for someone to do but even more lame for someone to accept the offer and then come to the forums to complain about it seriously what did they expecthowever how many of those people just pretended to vote   har har free plastic wrap for whatever thats worth if the plex was real then the forums would be full of darius is an idiot i didnt really vote for him but i got a free plex anyway lulz arent i clevermuch ado about nothing
personally i would have done a vote for me and ill vote twice for you spam just for the sake of it
so you believe your circle of friends make eve what it is today im a young alt but my main does do all the same things the confusion for me is this you are trying to make the game easier for yourself to get kills in high sec why if im understanding it wrong please explain it to me back in 04 when i started high sec was dangerous mines set it and forget it kinda stuffget kill mails a few days later because they wouldnt disappear for random amounts of time m0o gate camping high sec routes popping sentry guns concord and passerbys ccp has since changed sentrysindestructible made concord almost 100 indestructible and left high sec pvpers with suicide ganks as their only means of pvp without aggression or war decs why would the industrialist want to step backwardsccp will not go backwards black ops ships dont help anyone in high sec atm so that might be a good topic to touch bases onyes i know its a lowsecnullsec ship past that i dont see much else on the horizonbesides you wanting to make ganking industrialists easier in high secfor your groupon a side note i listened to a conversation between your group and some random in local educated or not they didnt know that you wanted to change black ops ships or even change the whole cap ship fleet battleblob structurethey were calling the person names and i think they popped hisher frigate eventually yet they were more than happy to link me to your voting page i guess thats what friends are foryou should at least give them a link so they can properly advertise for you

ok so i was thinking about this idea and figured out there may be a problem  ecm lets say your in a minor plex what is the best ship to use well a griffin with multspecs will perma jam every other frigate so they would need two or three ships to drive you out not very funbut there are various solutions that would actually not only solve this problem but i think make fw plexing overallhere is one potential solution inside each races military complex they have boosted the strength for their own targeting systems so in an amarr complex radar would be boosted 20xs im sure pie would be happy about this in other words jamming an amarr ship in its own military wont workif you enter the minmatar plex then using the ladar would be boosted 20xs im sure pie just decided this idea stinks now so that both sides do not always have to use the same 2 races of ships caldari and gallente or minmatar and amarr we could have some allied plexes spawn in each allies territory so say 25 of the plexes in minmatar space are gallente military compounds some amarr would be found in caldari etc and yes allies should be able to cap plexes for their allies lets face it ecm is nice when you are trying to fight outnumbered but it sucks for soloand really small scale pvp on the whole i think this would chill the use of ecm in general where it isnt an issue if it were to become an issue people could start using the correct race ships to cap the plexes moreover i think this would add a certain amount to the rp of fw
problems1 fw occupancy usually has little to do with pvp pvp and occupancy are often very different types of activity or put differently fw occupancy involves too much pve and not enough pvp2 fw pvp too often consists attacking someone and then getting blobbed3 too much time is spent shipping up or down4 too much time is spent looking for a similar sized gang you may want to engage as opposed to run from or that will just run from you solution1 remove npcs from occupancy related plexes npcs in the plexes ruin it who wants to fight with your ability to win gimped by some intangible amount of rat dps and ewar from rats its lame fighting when you are under fire and ewar from npcs really i dont want npcs whoring my killmails anyway 2 inform militias when players enter plexeswhen someone from fw enters a complex gate all militias should know who entered where ship types and the plex type this is intel that should just be provided via a separate chat channel after all if a system is contested that means both sides likely have npc spies there giving info here i do not mean player spies but npc militia spies that will post in the channel but they do not fly around in ships they are more like bureaucratic spies the only way their presence would be known in game is they would post in the plex intel chat channel this way the players could get a gang out there to fight the enemy pvp gang before the plex runs no npcs in the fight instead information about where you can find pvp 3 have more plexes pop up through out the regions and throughout the day not just down time 4 dont require scanners just have the plexes appearcommentsif ccp made those two changes i think plexing would make fw the absolute best pvp mechanic in the game will it solve everything no but it will i believe substantially cut down on the problems i listed abovei would point out 3 plexes shouldnt mainly spawn at downtime they should be spawning throughout the day and frequently i thought the csm already recommended this to ccp  though i could be wronghow will this make plexing more of a pvp activity by removing the npcs people will fit their ships for pvp there will be no trade offs that need to be made for dealing with the various rats fit your ship for pvp and go capture systems wont this lead to people just flying noob ships in plexs that is where the second change comes in currently if you are going to do plexes the most effective way is to get in a small ship that can tank the npcs and hope the timer runs before the enemy knows your even there the current mechanics make this the smart way to plex snipbold  very good idea the whole plex idea is a little odd unless you conider it as a moving enemy militia site a good idea would be to have the little teal text popup in militia chat with enemy fleet spotted in system move to counter advance asap or some such you could also add fw plexes to the map highlighting all current militia activity for the faction you are in incursion like features could be added to the journal for major plexes telling you what ships and pilots to expect is unneccessary and would fw pvp entirely that brings us to the next oneitalics  if they are indeed moving enemy fleets then you should have to scan them down or at least run your scanner to detect them if you want to detect enemy pilots look in local and use combat probesunderlined  if the plex is there because of enemy fleet movement why wouldnt there be a fleet present kind of ruins the whole idea does it not player fleets responding are elite reinforcements remove that and its just pvp go pirateyou dont lose standings that way
yessignedccp has ruined my character
no support to blanket changes to nail a very specific issueits all about avoiding unintended consequences  collateral damage and hidden agendasif you want support then make a change proposal that only hits what you are aiming atbut that would require a new specific module is no excuse that is run of the mill stuff for ccp you ought to know thatlatest example is the sansha hacking module tied to use with a specific ship more prevalent example is stripminers tied to exhumer and barge classt3 subsystems tied to racial cruiserutterly trivial tried and testedgiven that even more determined not to support blanket change to cloaking
poorly concealed attempt to keep your exploitnext
good onesigned
i would just like to remind everyone that the proposal will have little to no real effect on noncapital ships the only exception being the black ops battleship which is specifically stated that it should be done in a way to not affect themthis is also not some silver bullet to zomgnerfcapitalships or anything like that it is simply to encourage a better exit strategy than warp to safe spot cloak wait till capacitor is at 725 or higher decloak and instajump out in 100 safetyalso please note that it does not mean when your cloaked you lose shields or capacitor it just means that whatever your shields and capacitor was at when you cloaked stays that way while you are cloakedcapital ships should be encouraged to have support ships when moving around this does not mean that omg now it will be impossible to go anywherei have also explained why making an entire new cloak module for capital ships to do this is simply unnecessary when a change to the current one will do just fine without almost minimal to no impact on sub capitals
not sure if you actually read the proposal
shouldnt be able to self destruct while a cyno is lit
please help the poor space french
thats wy they suck and are not close to be upgraded
agree the gallente platform needs work over all
i started my character specifically to fly the myrmidon would be nice to actually be able to fly the myrmidon without feeling gimped in fleet
i think it U043Cust be nerfed much more than slight speed cut frigate that is faster than interceptor and more powerfull than asault ship fitted in dual prop its really imbalanced but still i support ts
succubus and worm are balanced i disagree if we say daredevil is balanced then we need to bring the other faction ships up to it and tweak the dram down to it but we dont need to balance the dramiel with the kestrel is the dramiel price balanced versus other ships its a bit inexpensive and it sounds like the bpcs drop too easilly but on the whole its not horribly underpriced its no more powerful than any tier 2 bc which you can buy 2 of for the price of single dram and you can insure those bcs its not like people should be running scared in their cruisers from solo dramiels and that dramiel loss will usually be at least 2xs harder on the wallet as for other frigates well no you shouldnt be engaging a pirate frigate with a t1 ship
the problem is little more than the dramatic difference in speed between the dram and other frigate class ships other frigates should have more speedless nerf more boost
you probably are right but because of how over powered they are everyone is farming the  out of any sites and lp stores that provide them factor in that jita is the final answer to a market hub and you have tons of people competing with each other on the market to get their dramiels sold so cost to weigh in to the balance part of the ship starts to have less of an effect on it im no market expert but just my opinion on the matterit just really would be nice if the dramiel was not an automatic check mate against other frigates solo im sure there are the rare stories out there of how a dramiel fell to insert random frigate class ship but we all know that it was due in part to a lolfit and a lolpilot emo tj anyone
to clarify people who sell isk for cash cannot afford to pay cash for their bot accounts
to clarify rmts do not want to use traceable payment methods but then they really dont have to not because of plex but because they bot mine on hacked accounts or those purchased online illegaly or some other thing removing plex isnt going to help that will just compound the problem the problem is rmts have always made their isk from the use of other players efforts or temporary accounts ccp has worked fairly hard to limit rmt means of isk profiteering but there are limits to what they can do without destroying the game why do you think there are untrainable skills for trial accounts inability to transfer isk on trials what ccp is missing is the carefully concealed isk transfer done in alliances with players in those alliances providing the work to make that happen the players in the alliances arent responsible most will not know its happening most botters are also not rmts though they may inadvertently work for one they are lazy and seriously lacking in ethics or morality unwilling to do their own work or find another means of accruing income most are pvpers they would rather watch ships blow up or nuke pixels than honestly put effort into paying for their lossesbotting destroys pvptheres another tagline for you if you cant define my logic or reasoning then perhaps try this if they didnt macromine and bot for isk they wouldnt be able to afford to fly so many ships into battle if they couldnt field so many ships so easily they wouldnt be quite so willing to risk what they have if they didnt so easily risk what they had they wouldnt pvp as well as they would lack practice if they lacked practice that would make them the same as the rest of us i cant afford to pvp i burned up all but 700m isk of my in game finances across all accounts just testing it out and flying a few fits the only thing that makes these people cautious is their personal killboards their record otherwise itd be just as suicidal as bfbc2 ever played suicide pvp it stupid annoying and adheres to no normal rules of warfare people charge into 30mm machine gun fire just to get one more kill and break the line its the worst pvp youll find playing fps far more annoying than having a crappy squad or team
its not them its joe 00 alliance member who uses plex to pay for his botting alts yes rmt can absorb sub costs though not always free trials and f2p games are a lot more infested with rmt than pure subs but say the goon who was busy running 7 accounts has to pay 100 dollars for them botting starts to look a lot less appealing
i have been giving the dread problem a bit of thought it seems that for most things they have been replaced by scswhat if as a counter proposal the damage out put when seiged was doubled the stront and seige cycle time was cut in half making it more viable to drop dreads for quick cycles and higher dps it would kind of make up for the fact that dreads are stuck for 10 minutes while scs can drop quickly kill a target and gtfo
that would be silly dreads in siege do about half the dps of scs do with bombers so they dont really need more damage the big issue with dreads is that they are easy to instapop with drive by titans while stuck in siege something scs arent faced with carriers dont have to triage to fight so they too have the ability to escape if they are quick to jump when a titan shows up titans had an ehp buff sc had an ehp buff dreads havent really changed since the day they were introduced to the game other than a few nerfs along the way
i support this proposal i do believe dreads need a long overdue buff
dreadnoughts should always deal more dps to structures than supercarriers when they are in siege mode that was supposed to be their niche extended installation sieges
a dread can field more than 6000 dps vs a target and theyre meant to be used on stationary structures who the hell flies them in small gangs aside from lowsec wardec ganksquads with too much time on their hands go away
furthermore mining alts of 10s and 00s can permanently stay in npc corps unaffected by war decs and the npc corp tax and of course they still do to avoid any risk so the only option left is suicide ganking so yeah in actuality nothing was accomplished from this
sadly we do have a bunch of tax evasion corps which is just a part of how people choose to play the gamesad too is the fact that most people looking to join a corp these days whine about even as little as a 35 tax rate and want the corp to supply ships for pvp and give them isk for skills toys and the rest try working for iti say we impose a minimum 10 tax on all corps from concord and double that in npc corps possibly even add 5 for npc corps like aliastra npc corps gotta make isk too and so does concordi support my idea
if you want universal tax why not just decrease bounties of all npc rats the effect is the samethe whole tax concept is a silly one there is already sales tax everyone is paying most profits come from selling of stuff not from bounties so why tax them at all makes no senseas of corps you know you need 1 real man corp to set up a pos to be able to invent anything since all copy slots are taken for weeks ahead so tax or not alts corp is a requirement to play this game
have you already looked tax rate to all corps existing or that you cross every time you are connected youll be surprised to see how much of those are over 11 tax have no reimbursement plan for implants or ships aask their members to fill cans with enough pi to fuel more pos than they have give no retribution from mining ops dont pay loan services alike 00 or low systems harvest moons and etc etc the ceo has nice ships the directors have nice ships both have a very good wallet but i dont see the point of your threadthe 12 men or alts corps are fine if you would like to have them in your corp then maybe you should start by take a very close look to your own methods and goals change your corps image and give people the will to join you instead of avoiding you by creating alt corps
sounds like a bad corp cant imagine people would stick around when there are so many corps out there that dont screw over their members
reduce the cycle time of mining lasers and mining drones by 11 if your in an npc corp
considering you can actively dec those little 12 man corps id say ccp accomplished a nice goal thereeven if people jump from corp to corp to avoid decs getting them out of the npc corps adds a breadth of immersion in all aspects of eve that some had previously been avoiding by cowering under the banner of taxless nubcorpness
what exactly have they accomplished i dont think theres any great breadth of immersion to clicking apply to corporation each time you get wardecd
would you vote to bring back the draft in the us or canadasome people dont want to fight in wars this is why they drop corp in the event of a wardec so they can continue doing what they wish without being subject to sactioned ganking in high security space what does that have to do with taxes anyhow
we need more people to support this threadcustomizable ship graphics is way better than 28004000000007 of the game populations opinion that we need to fix 00 fleet battle lag more than we have already i mean really isnt 3 years of dedicated development on nullsec enough and they just keep whiningthey get sov systems better isk farming through better upgradestitan redux funny how theyre the only ones who can afford titans let alone chew through them like ham on mashed potatoessuper caps note only usable in 00 like titansthe best of incursion ultimate in isk farming in 00 which is why they never beat an incursionstations also only in 00 and now they want to blow them upultimate moon mining best moons available only in 00 and now they have enough isk to say nerf em or more and better means to make iskbest of planetary interaction everything is made better in 00 to appease the nullsec crowd else theyd have far mor to complain about new servers and much work on lag reduction oddly this only really benefits 00 fleet battles and nullsecs favorite highsec hangout jitano rules save their own no concord bombs interdictors drone fighters and fighter bombers and mobile warp disruptorsno standings required for poss and no cost for faction chartersthe ability to secure space and prevent unathorized entry through greater force projection jump gates and titan bridgesevery reason to encourage players to join fleets corps and alliances in 00no standings required for jump clones with them installable at player facilitiesthe ability to say unequivocally who gets access to all these benefitsrentspaceno requirement for wardecsmore isk through better ratting exploration and complexesthe devs sneak little things in for everybody but have to make it better in null to avoid getting flogged lynched and burned at the stake
its because if you really think about it nullsec space is what eve is truly about ultimate freedom to do what ever you want whenever you want the legendary exploits of null alliances is what draws new players to eve in the hope that someday they may be able to get in on the actionhave a problem with our isk making capacity come take our systems from us i would truly laugh my ass off if i saw a fleet comprised of angry qqing carebears coming to take a single null systemyou want those juicy 00 incursions come get them we sure as hell are not stopping you hell i bet if you rented the incursion systems from the alliance holding sov that they spawn in during the time they are active you would be able to do them as well and if you are so scared to make the trip hire a merc corp to escort your incursion fleet there and to man the gates for protection during your care bear timei mean sure a obnoxious neon pink nyx with decals of human anatomy splashed all over it would get a few laughs but it is hardly something worthwhile hell i honestly think incarna is a waste of time and will be a flop sure ill try to walk around naked for a bit in my toon but after five minutes of that i doubt i will ever use it againtldr  less qq moar action
good idea on paper but it wouldnt take long before we see a bunch of  logos goatse pics and whatever else stupid people can think up to be charming
interesting idea there are a number of issues that i would probably triage this somewhere after major game mechanics are addressed i fully understand that not everyone is an inhabitant of null sec but with our different structures we ofcourse will have different priorities this is still something that would be a great addition to the overall gameplaysupported
fully customizable skins isnt an option due to 100 chance of eula violations such as graphic imageshoweveras a link was shown earlier demonstrates preset skins would be a good start effectively layered skins  pattern color 1 color 2 color 3 two layers adjustable to zones on shipan examplerifters  they have 5 zones two wings one cockpit and the two front pieces each of these could be colored a certain way want a 5 colored rifter go for it want striped wings a preset pattern with solid black cockpit and front surethere is one problem here t1 vs t2 ships often have minimal if any hull difference so two similar paint jobs render a t1 and t2 ship near identical not that overview wouldnt tell you thats a wolf not a rifter but it is something to consider
support with the caveat others have mentioned of not allowing users to provide images or requiring image approval similar to alliance logos i would suggest too that corps be able to define a roundel that could be used instead of a logoi would also note that even if this is not implemented t3s should be able to choose which color scheme they want to use a ham legion for instance would look far better in the khanid colors it would logically havewith regards to cassus comment highsec players should definitely have some of the features available to nullsec players lets start with adding destructible station services you want to fit a ship in jita you may need to rep up the fitting service first
to make you guys play even more bluelist bingo my splitting up into even more little pieces just to circumvent this limitationlol wonUFFFDt work in teletubby landthis one is the bestships die in laggy fleetfights due to fire and sideeffects and donUFFFDt get reimbursed this is not only a well known technical reality but also an official statement on reimbursementadapt or die  this is where the statement also fits
1 agreed and supported
this is the only relevent piece of information in this thread
quote from another thread that has equal or greater relevence herestop whining youve shed enough tears for a pool party so why dont you go enjoy it
and by the way while youve all been whining about pretty character portraits has it ever occured to you that 3d modelling and animation have absolutely 0 to do with coding and lag fixing with all the coders working on fixes for lag sov fixes and improvements jump gates and the rest the 3d artists had nothing better to do so it was either fire them lay them off or put them to work on something that didnt require much codingbunch of dumbasses
give them a how to fix lag for dummies book and set them to work pouring through code as well scratch that ccps coders are still waiting for their copies amirite ooapocrypha
we dont want any shinybullcrapdistracting features until this aspect of the game is fixed
iam blog you might wanna readso you see thy continiously work on thathowever i guarantee you the lag will be there as long as the game mechanics stay as they are and they will stay as they are as long people keep whining about the lag and not about the game mechanics that cause the lag but also make this groups so big and mighty
ya support checked off now
nuff said ccp get your stuff sorted or at least have the decency to give a proper reply
maybe just maybe you are trying things the game isnt capable of doing and wont ever be capable of doingmaybe the onus is on you to fix what your doing to break the gamewhen you drive too fast and your car comes off the road you cant complain to the car companywhen you put a water bed on the 2nd floor of your house and cause structural damage you cant go after the waterbed companyyou are breaking the game you not ccpthe argument of the sov structures have too many hp and need mega blobs is a total lie they die all around the game to groups smaller than yours the battles everywhere but the north are playable because of what you choose to do to the gamemassive battles happen in eve 7800 players deep and the game functions just fine you are exceeding what the hardware and code can take and its not on ccp to fix that if you dont like the conditions your playing in change them or quit its not that hardplus if you quit we all know the lag will dropyou want less lag dissolve your coalition
that would require the nc to actually think about developing a tactic other than cramming as many knuckle dragging mouth breathers as they can find into one system time and time again i so do enjoy the nc crying like little babies over situations like this for which they are solely responsible for creatingtry something different next time idiots
i like this guy
this is more or less what i meant why the crap would you use an overly expensive hurricane with mediocre performance when a random cookie cutter drake outperforms it your highly cherished passive shield regen has no purpose in blob fights either alpha will wreck you no matter how edly high an amount of isk youve spent to max out your regen likewise rr serves little purpose when you die in 10 seconds certainly its pretty indestructable 1v1 but honestly most ships can be fit that way and nearly all of them are rendered useless that way as wellare you honestly implying blobbing up is thinking outside the box i think we already knew blobbing is strong a blob of 1000 velators would make for a pretty powerful force and for cheaper but that doesnt make the velator any less awful as a viable ship nor does it make it good in a fleet when you fit for passive regen and passive regen only thats all you get and no it doesnt make up for everything else
your proposals really are in a bad need for better wording talking about neutral repping or exploitation have zero sense in this contextwhile i may have some assumptions about what you  maybe  are trying to convey i am not sure if i got that right at all
well im fairly certain its not my english skills as i passed com 12 with over 91 maybe you all need to brush up or im missing lingo that would make it sound cool to you
i think cloaking in general is a perfectly valid tactic however i also think that there needs to be a better counter to it than waiting to get attackedpeople tend to use the uboat analogy a lot but seem to forget that we had sonar and depth charges and were able to hunt the other subs who attacked cargo transports at sea pi would like to see one of a couple of things introduced firstly some way to scan down cloaked ships make it really hard make it require special skills that take forever to train and still be difficult enough that the majority of pilots in eve are not going to be good at scanning down cloakers this would give the crew who love scanningexploring a little bit more that they can do it would also require that those who are cloaked either log out or keep an eye out for probes thus fixing the whole issue of people abusing the game mechanics by not being at the keyboardanother alternative since the issue is not that someone is cloaked but rather that they are essentially playing the game while not being at the keyboard introduce a simple timeout on the eve client no mouse andor keyboard movement within say an hour ewarp and log the character out of the gamethink of the resources saved on ccps end in both cpu power and bandwidth in fact it boggles my mind that ccp is so far behind the times that they do not currently have such a system in place i cannot think of a valid reason that anyone could have for needing to stay logged into the client without any input there just is not any of course people will create macros that press the spacebar every 5 minutes but it would be pretty easy for a gm to see that a character has been logged in 237 and take the same actions they often take against other players using 3rd party macros
youre absolutely correcteve online or any other game for that matter was not designed to be played while afk its not only an exploit of the game mechanics it violates multiple terms and policies set forth by ccpafk cloaking is in effect the same as botting youre accomplishing a stategic pvp goal using tactics that no mmo is designed forthere are a million ways to prevent afk game play ccp just needs to get on the ball and actually acknowledge the issue and solve it i would be happy to see any direct reaction from ccp on the issue no matter which side theyre on
i have no problems with people being afk for all day if they are sitting in an orca or rorqual providing bonus for hours or merely being afk but watching corp chat it is their prerogative its quite literally their money plus how would ccp ever reach higher goals of xxxk people simultaneously onlinei do emphatically agree with sorting out afk cloakers im not sure about the proposal to scan them down but the time out would be better say a cloak fuel bay to limit cloaking use to 2 hours and then you have to refill in a station or pos or maybe some sort of timer on the module or cap usage so that you can only cloak for 20mins at a time and then you automatically decloak for several minutes anything to discourage alts from shutting down systems for hours noone likes it ccp change it
a client timeout is a great idea one i have brought up before as well i dont think a full hour is short enough however i would say 10 or 15 minutes tops if you cant be at your keyboard to play within 10 minutes then you have no reason to be logged in the primary concern of this issue isnt the fact that you can sit in system cloaked and disrupt all activity just by being therebut the fact that you can do this while afk for as long as you care to leave your pc on while you do whatever it is you are doing out of the game a client incactivity timeout would fix that perfectly i also agree with you on how is it possible that ccp is so far behind the industry to not have introduced this already there is no reason for a player to be logged in afk except to cloak in a systemas for a method for scanning down a cloaked shipi dunnoi am a little torn by that one on the one hand the whole point of being cloaked is to be undetectable on the other it feels like an exploit to sit in a system afk while cloaked i am guilty of doing it myself on a few occaisions but i do not prefer to waste my time doing so i cant really say if there should be a scanning method of cloaked shipslet alone suggest onebut yeahinactivity timerdo it ccp
well imo being afk for any reason and effecting game play is the same effect as using macros it provides an advantage for some players without the need to actually play the game i am a pvp pilot so my experiences with passing out fleet bonuses for mining are admittedly not the best but most of the guys ive seen still carry on in corpallinace chat and do other things in game while handing out the bonuses i think if ccp were to introduce the timeout it would be fair to have a 15 minute warning and a sound that would alert those in that situation that they need to click stay online or get disconnected i was discussing with an alliance m8 that i thought ccp at one time had a timeout we kind of figured that it was removed in order to inflate the number of online players to impress potential and existing shareholders p its just a theory
i keep hearing this fuel bay idea for cloaks but thats just ed that would literally kill a covops ships main intended use sneak behind enemy lines and rip the hearts out of the carebears who support the war machine that takes time alot of time your goal is to get as deep into enemy territory as you can while being able to pop a blackops cyno to bring your fleet in but before you can really pop that cyno you have to wait until those same carebears stop hiding from you i know all these nerf cloaks are coming from carebears who dont want to have to hide but welcome to waralso good tactic to deal with them is one guy in an arazu they decloak to hit you he decloaks and locks them down you stop killing rats for the 30 seconds it takes for you to pop someone who cant run or lock all for a small portion of your bountiesmy guy gets a 3rd because i have a combat pilot and a noctis in the sitewhy is it so hard to ask a corpy to fly overwatch makes everyone happy except the hostile edit this works been doing it for weeks in a system with a cloaked hostile ganking my alliance anytime they try but for some reason he stays the hell away from me squishy little ishtar
your counter tactics are very valid but only versus active pvp pilots this thread concerns afk cloakers and the inability to counter them
ok ccp i have this sortedits an infrastructure upgrade that randomly  lets say every hour or so deals 5 points of omni damage to every ship in the system anything thats cloaked would get uncloaked and therefor scannable by combat probes if youre on your toes and warping safe spots youre probably fine if youre afk cloaking youre gonna die like the dog you are
not supportedthe thread is based on a emotional knee jerk whinge rather than real argument for this has to be fixed
i dont think the op had anything against people cloaking and actively seeking targets but rather an idea to remove advantages to players who are gaming the system and to remove the added server load it is an excellent idea and thus far the only argument against afk cloaking that has any logicmerit i agree the fuelbay solution is not workable because it hurts those who are at the keyboard hunting the very small probable signature idea is a little more appealing because it actually adds a bit of cat and mouse to the game play which i think eve could use more of but overall the timeout just makes sense and i cannot make any arguments against it
how
yeah what he said show us the proof of where this is stated for eve online
can you find proof where ccp has stated that eve was designed to be played while afk your argument is a weak one at best and offers nothing to the discussion the argument against afk cloaking has always been what about people who arent afk the op brings up a logical and workable solution for both sides of the issue and the best counter you can come up with is prove that ccp did not intend for players to play while afk seems a little bit childish to me while looking over the terms of service there are several lines that could in fact cover this topic from the terms of service you may not do anything that interferes with the ability of other eve online subscribers to enjoy the game or web site in accordance with its rules this includes but is not limited to making inappropriate use of any public channels within the game andor intentionally creating excessive latency lag by dumping cargo containers corpses or other items in the game worldcomes to mind but this is not an issue about if cloaking in someones system is indeed griefing in fact the op made that much pretty clear the issue is that players are abusing game mechanics to achieve financial and strategic goals while not at the keyboard there has yet to be one valid argument against implementing a server timeout put forth in this thread only halfhearted attempts to derail the subject
which is do nothing not to sound bitter but it is the truth i really wish i was wrong here
what about the people that arent in it for financial or strategic reasons and wrt the timeout ccp dont want their pcu to drop to about 13 of its daily value
i did not make a claim that afk cloaking was an exploit and was in violation of the policies and rules of this game established by ccp the op did and he has to support his claim to support his proposali am not obligated to make any sort of input if i do not like the proposal again it is the responsibility of the author of the proposal to sell it truthfully to garner supportat this present time hesheit has not shown any proof and hesheit is obligated to show such proof as to support his proposal other wise this thread is much like your post useless and an emotional whinge that has nothing to do with anything except your self centered nerd rage
the op has already stated valid reasons as to why an inactivity timeout should be implemented who cares if it violates an eula or tos you are just looking for lame excuses you have not stepped forward and provided a valid argument as to why it should not be implemented the op does not have to show proof to support this proposal you need to show proof of why his proposal would not work and is invalid if you are going to counter him like you did you also chose a single line out of the entire post and attacked it with thatcompletely ignoring the other completely valid reasons to implement the ideanow that i go back and read through itit wasnt even the op that suggested this but another poster who posted right after the op so now you are attacking the ops idea over something said by somebody else in the thread
he used the statement to support his proposal to give it some credibility in which case puts his proposal in questionas of right now i do not see it as broken edituntil you can tell the difference from alts and the op it looks to be all the same tripe and i do not take any of this crap seriously
i keep seeing this statement made an afk cloaker shuts down a systemthe only way this statement is true is with bots that are programmed to dock up when a new name enters localin all other cases business can continue as usual if so desired
its called a sandbox for a reasonsuch as keep in mind that this is relating to afk cloaking not the macros ure so eager to compare it toas for the op crying about server load blame the blobs in case u need help with simple math 1000 is gonna get a lot more server load than 1
no stop being a pansytheres only one viable way to fix afk cloaking 100 cap recharge when a cloak is active and a cap cost for running the cloak and no one wants it except whiners who whine about whiney afk cloakingwhine
seriously scandal thats some messed up  right there you just unnerfed the ham and renerfed the hml whats your priority aside from longer flight times now we can out run heavy missiles in a drake
sure just as soon as we get some sort of missile counter module that doesnt suck ass like defenders either a new midslot missile counter or change tracking disruptors to somehow affect missiles as well
how have i unnerfed the ham if you feel that a module boosting rangeexplosion vel would op hams then the module could simply only apply boosts to guided missileshow can you out run them guided missile velocity is still the same only flight time has been reduced with a mid slot module boosting flight time you still have the same range please explain possumyes defenders need to be fixed making tds effect missiles could cause some balance issues to ships like the pilgrimcurse but i am not completely against it
you guys do know that smartbombs and defenders both kill missiles right smartbombs are by far more effective and can completely neutralize missile dps if used righti was exaggerating about the drake outrunning the missiles obviously the hams would get some range back with your module which is a good thing in my opinion hams are nearly useless on anything smaller than a shield tanked battlecruiser and get out dpsd by hmls when used on any fast moving andor low sig radius vessel target painters and mods to decrease explosion radius will change the factor of that of course your mod would increase their smallerfaster target dps a bit with exception to the loss of velocity modifers this means your missiles will travel at player skill and implant modified speeds and i know from experience that a merlin with an ab can outrun hml dps from a missile tengu traveling in a straight linelets just accept that you are either not considering all factors or are intentionally attempting to mislead to gain support its either one or the other as it is i survived over 30 seconds of dps from a hml tengu from above and docked my merlin on station with no more than one invuln low sig speed and good shield skills providing the defense if that had been a loki id have been friedmissiles mostly suck hml range is good as is and without it level 4 missions and sleeper sites would be almost undoable in a tengu remove velocity modifiers and youve got 0 dps for 5 seconds at 28 km provided the missile is travelling at 5625 ms with max skills turrets offer instant dps in comparison and you can lose shields as is before your missiles hit the targetim not saying there arent advantages to your idea but youll lose in other areas anything travelling over 3750 ms would be immune to dps from hmls additional time required to apply dps would mean greater advantages to turret users you could effectively be spacedust before your first missile hit the target do they still exist when you vaporizeit would also make it easier to time defender and smartbomb defense making defenders more useful and smartbombs omnipotent beats trying to track multiple volleys traveling at 8750 ms when getting ready to cycle them anyway back to the opmaybe the drake is a little overpowered in fleet but alone its completely negotiable in fact alone its an extremely easy target for anyone with any pvp experience
im sorry cassus but im still confused maybe its these new pain killers im on cause i am a bit spaced outthe only thing i am suggesting is that guided missile flight time the length of time the missile flies for not the velocity or the explosion radius or the explosion velocity gets reduced by approximately 4050 55km effective range lvl5 character without impsship bonuses the introduction of a modules that acts very similarly to a tracking computer to increase missile flight time and explosion velocity or radius which ever balances better which can be scripted to do one or the otherunless this module is fitted the ability to hit fast moving targets with a small sig would remain the same and if this module is fitted you are sacrificing a mid slot for ita worm hole hml tengu would still have 80km range without this new module plentyit takes 12 seconds for a heavy missile to travel 70km a hml drake would still have more ehp 12k than any other bc in its class fitted to engage at this range with these changes i believe this offsets the initial volley delay it also has considerably more dps and more than double volley damageim making an attempt to balance this ship out with others in its class without gimping it when fitted for other roles or other ships that use this weapon system
you dont do c5s obviously the targets are out to 160km give or take can hit you at well over that and the bs all move faster than if they had mwd that being said ill reread some of this thread as i may be a little off with my response
okay im a little off with all the crap ive been reading im beginning to skim more than actually readthere is still a problem you reduce the flight time and force a mod to increase it great drakes will just skip the mod most pvp is done near gates and stations or at less than 30 km andor using mwd anyway they dont need it missile range for hmls is mostly purposeful for missions complexes and sites anyway it serves very little purpose in pvp save one hitting logi recon and similar craft that sit out at 70km give or take these craft will now be immune to missile dps while still have instant force projection of their own why immune because no pvper will fit the range modswhy not just make missiles instantaneous timetotarget and lose the lag generated by their flight time sort of like fighter bombers then we can talk about rebalancing
i am hanging in the same belt or anomaly with you i am cloaked i am trying to get closer to start an assault or to hot drop whatever now why i should get decloaked  it destroys any purpose of a cloak doesnt it not even going into any flamewars about afk cloaking lets just say it is a good goal but you just destroyed any legitimate cloaking
your idea is designed to catch probing vessels which reatian a cloak as you know it takes time to do what they do warping about will only make it harder for them to do their job and all you need is a pos module perfectly safe to do your job for you
i think cloaking in general is a perfectly valid tactic however i also think that there needs to be a better counter to it than waiting to get attacked people tend to use the uboat analogy a lot but seem to forget that we had sonar and depth charges and were able to hunt the other subs who attacked cargo transports at sea pi would like to see one of a couple of things introduced firstly some way to scan down cloaked ships make it really hard make it require special skills that take forever to train and still be difficult enough that the majority of pilots in eve are not going to be good at scanning down cloakers this would give the crew who love scanningexploring a little bit more that they can do it would also require that those who are cloaked either log out or keep an eye out for probes thus fixing the whole issue of people abusing the game mechanics by not being at the keyboard another alternative since the issue is not that someone is cloaked but rather that they are essentially playing the game while not being at the keyboard introduce a simple timeout on the eve client no mouse andor keyboard movement within say an hour ewarp and log the character out of the game think of the resources saved on ccps end in both cpu power and bandwidth in fact it boggles my mind that ccp is so far behind the times that they do not currently have such a system in place i cannot think of a valid reason that anyone could have for needing to stay logged into the client without any input there just is not any of course people will create macros that press the spacebar every 5 minutes but it would be pretty easy for a gm to see that a character has been logged in 237 and take the same actions they often take against other players using 3rd party macros
1 just because you cant think of one doesnt mean there isnt a reason2 gms dont care if your logged in 237 they have other things to occupy their time with and the macros are already logged in 237 doing things you dont see them getting banned now so what makes you think anything would changepro tip eve has been out for about 7 years nowcloaking isnt going to change because its working as intended
how exactly does a cloaked vessel logged in 237 relate to the use of botting or other mechanics if youre cloaked all you can do is watch and chat if someone cloaks 237 chances are theyre actively trying to prevent botting the fact that you would argue contrary to this only suggests that you have a problem with it because they aredont assume gms ccp and the rest of us are idiots
i liked the solution that was put up for afk cloakersjust put a timeout in place if the dude is actually at his keyboard handing out bonuses awesome more power to him but if hes out sexing up his lady in a hotel 5 miles away he should get auto logged after awhile i also agree unprobable is a bit crap but eve is a very broken game and this is one of the broken mechanics much like afk cloaking that people seem to likeedit i support anything that makes orcas and rorquals have to be on grid so i can kill them 
ephemeron is ed arguing with him is an exercise in futility as you simply run in circlesmy work is now done here
i have to ask if i can scan down and bookmark a light drone why would i not be able to do the same for a ship is it because the drone is stationary or becase they are usually grouped in 3s when i compare a drone to any ship i have to admit it seems a little oddso making all ships probeable is cool provided they are not cloaked if a ship is jumping around because its warping between deadspace pockets however i do not see any reason why it should be probeable provided it has a relatively low sig radius if youre fast or its slow then you might catch it anyway i dont thinkl it should be easy to scan down a small ship just that it shouldnt be impossible if its stationary it just requires more timethat being said with no experience at not being able to scan down a ship i cant exactly see where you are coming from or that it is indeed broken maybe youre just not doing it right
out of curiosityyou make a good point about aoe dmg being a method to break down blobs but also if aoe is strong enough thats all anyone would use so some strategy needs developinganywaysisnt this why titans originally had aoe doomsdayfood for thought
how about when fleet numbers get too high jove griefers turn up and massacre everyonethat would be an acceptable alternative to providing the server infrastructure and code that supports the thousandpilot fights the adverts promised rightin all seriousness 15 hour delays between client action and server response is not good enoughthe problem really lies with the mechanics of fleet fights your choices are blob until your eyes bleed lag then blob some more dont and get your teeth kicked in by someone who willin fairness to pl and their ilk yes i know that youre exceptionally good at what you do and have a lot of fun doing it and blobbing you may turn out to be an expensive exercise in futility but blobbing is always better than notblobbing for us plebeansthe optimum solution would be for sweeping changes to the eve cluster and serverside code that would support the whole subscription base on a single grid in drakes spamming ungrouped missiles i accept that this is a while off and so provide some suboptimal suggestionsone solution is a hard cap to pilots in system this is not a good idea for reasons i hold to be self evident and require no explanationthe best solution ive read so far was essentially that players chose the level of lag and that the server should slow the entire system down to the lagged speed so theres less scope for lost actions and the likeanother solution which i hadnt thought of is the ops suggestion that in big fleet fights all ships bleed damage to discourage mass blobs assuming that the bleed impacts all ships on grid in the same way this wont actually do much to reduce the size of blobs blobs may even grow as a result when alliances seek to finish battles as fast as possible by bringing even more pilotsmy understanding is that carriers  scs may have more than 5 drones out if grid lag is related to the number of balls in the ballpark maybe change the effect of drone control units to additional drone hp  damage instead of an extra drone out  exactly like the change to the dominix drone mechanic a while back this has the potential to reduce the number of entities on the grid by up to 5 per carriersc and be programmatically trivial this means in a battle with 10 carriersside 100 fewer npc scripts running for drones and 100 fewer system inventory entries
as long as sov is based on controlling individual systems nothing you guys have said so far is going to workmy solution is to instead make sov based on the number of systems currently held in a region and vastly increase the number of gates to remove choke points the blob wont be an advantage if it can only be in one system at a time when a dozen or more are under simultaneous attack and each one can be accessed from several different directions it will force the defender to break up into smaller groups to meet the multiple system threat and it will force the attacker to split up in order to attack several systems at once problem solved
i agree that tech is crazy i dont understand ccp they nerf dyspro and prom only to offer even more moons and higher prices with techand venal as like 70 techs itself its crazy that blocs control everythingmy solution randomise moons on a monthly basis so there is a different minerals to moons every month make alliances work for that moon gold make them have a consequence to sending never ending mom fleets
 darkness thanks for your perspective you make alot of good points especially where you mention that loosing ships is not an issue anymore a comment from an nc member regarding the valentines day massacre comes to mind just a day after it happened
it is no biggie because the core areas of the various blocs have been static for ages so there is probably a surplus of supers  at this point i am willing to bet the bottleneck is pilots moon mining  passive income  bad for eve remove all moon mining and replace with pi even on moons opens market wide and allows for actual competition in everything related to t2 make the tollbooth in orbit destructible until dust comes along as if so production can be interrupted
this is chest beating it is the internet spaceships version of it is just a flesh wound while bleeding out losing those titans hurt a lot we have lost more since that hurt a lot for a good month super caps werent allowed in fights in the east do you know how many different groups hold those moonsmost people in eve want to fight with a numerical advantage thats how the game is played however getting different parts of the nc to work together on any given day is crazy difficult people dont see all the brokered deals that go on and see the nc as a single unit within the nc is a lot of greed just like any large coalition or alliance they work together generally for common good but many wont lift a finger unless you force them or give them a carrotthe biggest cost comes from defending them tech moons provide a lot of income but that also means everyone wants more so alliances are constantly taking and losing them and losing ships in the process that are reimbursed from that income like i said the corps in the alliances hold most of the moons when you take reimbursements and fuel out of the income from the couple moons a corp gets you end up with somewhere around a billion a month in net incomenew and upcoming forces dont stand a chance but that requires explanation if you add more moons the existing powers will take them all alliances collapse on a semiregular basis new ones form from connections and need most corps have been in multiple alliance and have connections with other corps in other alliances when a collection of corps your corp has good relations with outside ingame standings band together and make a new alliance your corp might join that alliance from time to time a corp that grew in empire and became strong enough will join a null sec alliance then work its way up forming relationships moving through alliances point is malcanis law whenever a mechanics change is proposed on behalf of new players that change is always to the overwhelming advantage of richer older playersthis is case for your proposal
how would you say malcanis law applies to expanding on the alchemy system seems that helped remove the other bottlenecks what if with alchemy it was possible to go from pi  high end moon products without doing any actual moon mining though of course it would not be very efficient and still require pos reactions the moons value could settle in to a price reflective of their actual rarity tech is not the rarest moon min out there pressure relief would be an option for everyone in the line including rookie pi producers to 1man corps of course the richer and more powerful would be able to take advantage of the pressure relief but no more than anyone else
i think pos structures should be more user friendly easier to use interfacesmaybe even high sec moon miningi think a lot of new people find poses confusing and expensivemooring points for large ships is a good idea also maybe we could lock the arrays together so they can be accesed from 1 pointjust a though what do you think

xhagen on twitter said the final tally is around 49k or 14 of the eligible votersthis compares to 39433 votes cast for csm5 which was 1267 of eligible votersmore votes this time but not a significant improvement in the overall turnout
the tos refers to the player singular by their terms fifty thousand mails to one player is certainly excessive but one mail to one player hardly the number of players receiving that one mail is irrelevant
isnt this csm thing a scam to make us hope issues listed match questions 
welcome to politicsbtw those issues you listed that list was created by a private individual and is on a private website not ccp endorsed

its irrelevant whether its a scam or not offering an ingame item ie a plex for an out of game reward or service ie your vote is a violation of the rules of conduct and the eula this makes his candidacy invalid and exposes him to the ban hammer good luck mate
thats a crap interpretation and services such as killboards and eoh poker point to it being worth nothing more than crap

welcome to evescamming is part of the game
scaming is part of the game and i do like ithowever i wasnt aware that scaming is part of the way ccp handles gameplay changesissue fixingallowing scamed votes  dont giving a beep about real players decisionson plex for good japan ccp saysccp regards any scamming attempts surrounding this effort to be morally reprehensible and they will be met with swiftest actionso it is possible even though scaming is like you say part of the gameso ccp doesnt think that stealing csm votes would be morally reprehensibleso why i shouldnt say busht when i read things like eves most valuable person the player in the devblogs i only ask to treat scaming as part of the gameyou scam elections youre caught and dont denie itgood youre outsounds like a pretty good game concept to me
doplanet perhaps i can assure you knowing darius i know he will take csm position seriously i agree what scamming to get votes is very questionable at best lame and ccp should respond on this issue since a csm represents the eve players and really i dont like cheaters eitherthen again to you generally a csm is honest kind natured and take things seriously do darius fit those description if hes elected csm to my opinion yes along that he may or maybe will  troll so maybe not so serious o scamming suicide ganking is just a hobby thing for him but hes not a liar if he is i wouldnt respect him as much as i respect scooter1sure he finds loopholes within ccp policyrules but he doesnt hides them like those guys in mag wormhole and exploiting with the negative bonus for gunnery systems or pl using the delayed local exploit he ask gms if its allowable or not to be sure station contract scamming is one of them if that doesnt make him honest i dont know whattbh i dont know when exactly he started trollingscamming and stuffs but i noticed hes doing that since half a year ago an evolved pokemon darius iii since taking over geminate he was only the nice and fun guy to hang out with to just suicide gank people probably hes taking the fun factor to another level
almost thought darius got booted from csmggrrrr trolllage
and i hope for 00s sake that the ideas ccp come up with will not be wowdungeonesque or if they are that theyre shot down in flames fights that involve less than 1000 on properly reinforced nodes were fine the last i was in one as long as supercaps werent involved death to all supercapsi also hope to god that if theyre going to make just two changes for the next expansion theyll do further changes to the supercarriers and for s sake fix the ing sov system im not expecting you to agree with me on this but given my experience in fleet fights the last 12 months i believe these two things to be the major parts of the game mechanics that need updating for 00as for you as im assuming youre going to get on if theyre coming to you and saying that good news guys we havent changed the pos in particular reaction setup pi in particular the setup invention or manufacturing ui kick them in the nuts while i know that things are supposed to require effort it shouldnt have to still be eyestabbingly bad
youre reading things i havent written i am simply saying that a mechanism that promotes smaller fleets sizes whatever it is will mean a greater focus on the contribution made by each fleet member im not advocating any specific fleet size the ideal fleet size for this kind of proposal would probably be something like 49 of what a normal node can handle so that when 2 of them fight we always get good performancein any case im on record as saying that its essentially a king canute act to try and force smallgang mechanisms on the mighty starempires of sovspace as i already said and you unaccountably forgot to notice in your reply no matter what magic change is worked in sov mechanisms more numbers  less numbers one way or the other therefore norm the noobs 4xspr drake will still find a place in fleet somewhere i believe your own dear alliance standardised with good effect on arty maels good choice btw allowing pilots to bring the correct ship with a relatively low sp investment but still implicitly saying that there is a worse and a better ship to bring its not exactly a secret that correct ship types  fleet composition is a force multiplier you are reading a snobbery that doesnt exist into the simple statement of an accepted fact its not sexist to say that men generally have greater upper body strength than women by way of analogythe point is that there arent any small to mid sized goals in sov space now anything you try and do with sov immediately involves at least one of the 3 main blocs the only small to mid size things that can be done are roaming gangs cloaky harrassment and maybe the odd jf getting nynced its futile to try and balance sov mechanisms against small alliances because the game has inevitably developed politically to the point where there are no small alliances settled in sov 00 space who arent part of a bloc we might as well try and shape our environmental policies around the needs of the irish elk or the passenger pigeon
theres a difference between more numbers  less numbers and theres a magic limit to how many other people you can see say 100 closest people to you at which point joe random newbie in his rifter will actually be a detriment to your fleet as hes taking up a slot which could be used by someone else with mroe skillpoints and a better shipi think youre the one thats not quite getting what i and yeep are saying there will always be a worse and a better ship to bring but its when you start putting hard limits on how many you can bring that the snobbery starts thats why we tell newbies to bring tacklefrigates because they can still be useful they can still tackle the odd ship get on a kill mail and get enthused about oh god i helped kill a ship thats much more expensive than me i want more and those rifters can help turn the tide by keeping more enemies locked down as they move about tactically on the battlefield this is goodand dont start your yammering about filling up systems till they crasheveryone doesnt load because i havent had that in a long timeim not saying that numbers should automatically win pl didnt win over manny etc in their numerous drakes because they outblobbed the drakes but if manny etc had brought enough then that wouldve been one possible counter to high efficiency ships and high sp pilots not a very efficient counter to be sure but a possible counterso what are you getting at we should just give up everything is hopeless or start talking with other 300 men alliances to build another bloc to try to carve out a niche where other smaller blocs havent gotten a foothold yet because the map isnt just ncdrf
well the polls have closed and now we wait to find out what the results areid like to thank everyone who voted in the elections for participating the increased turnout sends an important message to ccpbut id like to particularly thank everyone who voted for me of course finally if you participated in this thread and are at fanfest look me up and ill give you one of my beer tickets
no all i was getting at were some of the inevitable implications of implementing or trying to implement some magic solution to the tendency to form ever huger fleets this in context of the thread is desirable because as we are all painfully aware there are limits to the maximum size of fight the game can gracefully support the only way to do that is to provide some positive benefit to not exceeding some given fleet size whether it be multiple simultaneous objectives some kind of stacking penalty to fleet size or whatever elsebut the point i was making is that whatever the solution is it will always have the effect of in either case what youre going to end up with is that newbies are going to be told to  off because theyll be a liability instead of an asset like they are in goonswarm tight fleet compositions are going to end up being even more key than they are now and smaller and less skillpointintensive alliances will have even less of a chance to break into 00 than before that change was added this is why this is a bad ideain other words your objection to trebors solution was actually an objection to an inevitable result of solving the problem not one thats specific to his solution
why is it inevitable see what i was saying earlier about hidden motives youve found a solution to laggy fights which coincidentally enforces your make alliances smaller and your obvious disdain for low sp pilots never mind how bad it is for the rest of the game or that better less restrictive solutions might exist this one is the best and we should do it now
um no his solution again i havent heard anything otherwise would essentially be a hard cap my assumed solution of fixing the sov system or whatever it is they end up doing so that if you absolutely want to you can go all in on one system whether that be defense or attackone system would mean that skillpoints and more importantly flying the right ships tm would be paramount the other system would still this would mean that your opponent will have the opportunity to pool just enough people in the most strategic systems to defeat your attack possibly sacrificing others while at the same time counterattacking in some of your systems its up to everyone involved and if some newbee in a rifter wants to come along hell be more than welcome because there wouldnt be an artificial limitat least itd be vastly better and more dynamic than todays system i almost get depressed at thinking of how easy it is to defend up to 6 systems simultaneously by just say parking the entire titansupercarrier fleet in one system reset the timer move on to the next system and defend it the next day or two and so on and so on until you come full circle and again it still has sov in large parts of delve and querious they died a month ago vov
um ok what what was my solution where is my disdain you seem to be replying to the posts you imagine someone like the person you imagine me to be would make im not even sure that there can be a solution at least not one that doesnt run counter to the whole sandbox thing
a multiple objective mechanism doesnt prevent superblobbingeither you have to attackdefend all the objectives simultaneously in which case you just bring 6 blobs or sequentially in which case you just blob the first one or you only need to attack one of the 6 in which case you just blob the one most convenient to you in any case theres still no disadvantage to bringing a huge blob fleetin my opinion the only way youre going to get non superblob fights is to attack the root cause of superblobs which are the vast coalitions that support them
i love how you insist on using the words blob and superblobthe thing about proper strategy is that while yes technically you can superblob one system it would also mean that the defender if he had proper intelligence on what the attacker did could launch a counterattack while keeping a mock fleet if bothering to do that even potentially trading multiple systems for the cost of a single systembut since apparently this wont work what will then spacedungeons removing jbs removing jumpdrives from capships
but my mains did vote for seleneonly a few hours left if you havent voted well dont complain that csm doesnt represent you
lol i need coffee wrong thread good luck anyway
3 from mego issler allways the best choice

i pretty much agree with prom there  no and no ccp are already doing a lot to delay the graphics upgrade and make sure people receive plenty of warnings etc im more wondering why they did not do that sooner remember ccp has to allocate some development time specifically to those with antique computers time the devs cant spend on improving the gamein other words  buy a new cg stop crippling my game about the csm no and because the public has very little visibility on that
thank you to everyone who participated in the process of selecting csm6thank you in particular to everyone who took time out of their eve online time to vote ask questions and debate the issues no matter who wins your input to the winning candidates will be really valuable as they and maybe me  represent us on the csm internal forums and in icelandthanks also to all the bloggers and podcasters that took an interest in the process and encouraged their subscribers to do the samenow lets see who won
was a tough run well see if ill manage to conjure votes from the ether as i was recently described to usually do 
i tag along and want to thank those of you who voted for me gl to the csm 6 pplbruce blacky
we figure you have the 1000 votes perk that ccp gives people they actually like and want to see
you mean like they announced rocs twitter hashtag on their newsletter
indeed couldnt believe they went for that rather than my windy4win one never mind didnt hold me back and i an pleased to announce that i secured at least 16 votes see you in iceland baby
i too crave attention on the internet
i dunno windy i think youre in tbh you caused all the alarmist pubbies to take up arms against an imaginary threat and given that test is unable to organize the wiping of their own buttes im fairly sure i wont make the cutits been a hard uphill battle and its been fun
all your ballots are belong to usooops  wrong game 
would be nice to think so but not sure that my vote will be enough for him dbest of british windy  gl man i tried
i dont think white tree would get in then again numbers is all that matters so even though he made a dull depressing and safe campaign he will probably get in because numbers hmmmittani has been begging the eve gods to become a chair not sure if he wants to be sat on or if he wants to become the chair of the csm i think if he isnt chair and trebor is then mittani will have a breakdown again you should hear it its like darius johnson mk ii except darius was funny mittani is stale like a hmm oh right stale like a chair hahaha
i honestly cant understand why it takes ccp a week to count all the votes and announce the winners the whole thing is electronic so results should be instantaneous
i blogged about thisshort version youre not a csm delegate until you sign and return the nda the winners will probably learn theyre potential delegates tomorrow via email but the email will almost certainly have the nda as an attachment plus a way to return the signed version to ccpbet you thats what takes a week
my guess is  there is fanfest between where the former csm is still in service you dont announce the new representatives before they finished their term
didnt though about that for those too lazy too check  new csm will know before the public and will have to sign nda before being made official csmi suppose theres here some legal issue in case of one would refuse to sign even if when it wouldnt happen but well if they say its x and x dont sign you need y to take his place and better doing that before its public
you are wrong the nda has nothing to do with it generally the successful candidates get about 36 hours notice that they have a seat before the public announcement goes live alternates are notified about a day later still before the official reveal though ndas are attached to those notification emails and you cannot take part in any meetings or have access to the internal forum before it has been signedthere has always been about a week to ten days between the end of voting and the results announcement even when there hasnt been a fanfest in that intervening period
the winners have not been announced when they are announced you will see official communication from ccp
confirming my vote went to youme twiddles thumbs
i dont vote for the french
well thanks to all those who gave me their votes now we just have to wait i believe i dont think the results will be announced during fanfest ccp stated that theyd reveal the results the 30th but who knowsuntil then dont hold your breath  its a long time 
more eve videos i have done hope you enjoy good season fellow candidatescaldari drakedrake youtube 720pcaldari ravenraven ahnold plays eve onlinearnold schwarzenegger plays eve onlineenjoy
a noob speaks and we all lol
kick durr
primary target is durrhurrdurr in the myrmidon
shoot the durrmidon
i didnt vote for you in part because of this if you had anything written about your so important to roc subject of rp it was not easy enough to findbut since youre still my second and only other choice i still hope youll get elected
i just have a bad feeling about all those wreck stations and not being able to put up another one there and ending up having a bunch of dead ones around some busy areas this is why if we would try and implement this  and it isnt a bad idea  i would hope to see ccp lift the ban on one outpost per system and allow maybe 2 at least

to me this is the big breaking point part of subscribing to eve was to get involved in factions my fav thus far being swg precunge but ive been holding off here thus far from training a faction character 4am my time is no time to login for me needs to be a system that is the best points from old swg and old planetside imo mostly regarding basesplexes but this is simply broken here needs to be taken care of before incarna is released thought ccp was serious about pvp until i researched the faction system im just turning into another highsec carebear for the most part  and thats no life almost worse than being a highsec wardec carebear corp
if standings are not getting deleted and a name history in employment history tab i wouldnt see a problem would be even better to avoid scammers than just selling your old scammer and buying a new character of the character bazaar which clear everything about your historyapproved
yes please to bigger especially and more readable font options
yes
i dont see why it should be an issue we can already change our portraits why not race or bloodline as well and with this new portrait system i dont like amarr as i used to anyway im doing a second post because if forgot to support itcya
i propose that a ship lands at the cyno when the cyno is still there and the jump is denied when the cyno is destroyed aka simply fixing this bugthere is no problem with selfdestructing while lighting a cyno the problem lies with jumping to a cyno thats disappearing i suspect its simply a race condition between checking if a jump can be done and actually performing the jump
supported though im not sure how technically feasible it is but id love to read a really long totally geeked out dev blog discussing the possibility
iteration means the act of repeating a process usually with the aim of approaching a desired goal or target or result each repetition of the process is also called an iteration and the results of one iteration are used as the starting point for the next iteration had to double check wikipedia havent done any programming in a few years since i left uniccp tuxford rebalanced the tech level 1 ships a few years back the original balancing process cant remember exact dates they have not been revisited since that sounds like a lack of iteration to me
you should be more specific about what iteration you refer to then since that was impossible to glean from your post
check the edit
right anyway doesnt change the fact that tuxford didnt dump the tier system and it still needs to be axed
thats a lot of bravado coming from an alt sitting in an npc corp
got my count
6000 dps that is useless in real combatmost dreads will have a long range fit so they can change between long and close range however they can only do 3000 to 1000 dps like thisthe issue is that dreads are not being used as they are intended as old game mechanics have been surpassed by newer onesgranted the fix to the range of short range weapons so that you can hit outside of 5km was a welcome fix but they really need to work on it some morei actually think if they released t2 dread weapons range and damage and a t2 seige 50 less time but requires the skill to level 5 they would become a benefit to eve combat
supporting his wholeheartedly no ship should be so good that you cannot lose it to a ship not fit for that exact purpose s failfitting it and losing to rifters dont make it balanced a failfit mega piloted by a complete  will also lose to a rifter
take a look at some big known corpsalliances no need to look at small ones so imo its a false statement when someone comes with another thread about npc taxthis kind of misunderstanding will continue until ccp grows some balls and clearly states rules you cant avoid in players corps and some ideas liketax lower than npc corps by 25 automatic you shouldnt be able to avoid thisreplacement wallets with automatic operations between thoseautomatic reimbursement when you loose stuff etc some  oc like insurance and your standing in the cropsplit benefits automatic to all members with some rules where fcs or ceos have the possibility to agree the  in relation to players investment etcnow players have the entire ability to useabuseover abuse with no control possibilities for corpies other than get their own 2man corp or get in npc corpthe problem comes from players corps and how they deal their corpies not the npc ones
fix game breaking lag for everyones sake
typical pl answer anticipated from my initial post unfortunately our enemies cram even more into the fight than we do so if we dont match them we lose the battle and also lose sov this is not an option in 00 warfareunlike pl we stay and fight for our territory our borders are vast and our enemies are significant in sizeit would be a different story if we just attacked smaller alliances that were easy to beat and didnt require our entire force to defeatyour argument is weak the growing number of player in eve means that there is a need for the server to handle the growing number accordinglydont come here and crap on about your insignificant small fights that have no lag and blame us because the game doesnt support teams of our size in combat the fact that small fights dont lag has nothing to do with the fact that big fights do
let me say it again so maybe youll read it this timeits not ever going to happenit doesnt happen in any other game its never been possible in this gamethe game is seven years old they havent made it happen in that time its not ever going to happenthe servers cant handle it the code cant handle it and the only thing ccp is going to do for the remainder of this game is bolt on extra parts to entice new fresh subscriptions to play so that the old jaded players who quit can be replacedi mean are you actually silly enough to believe that after seven years ccp is going to up and re write the base code of the game to do away with the bad communication between the client and the clustereyou basically have 3 choices 1go find a game that can support the type of game play you want2find a way to play within the means of the code of this game3keep staring at black screensedit its simple really ccp is determined to let you do whatever in your sand box but they have flat out told you that when you have huge fleet battles were not responsible for what goes wrong it cant get any simpler than that they are outright telling you the game cant handle what your doing and that they wont be responsible for fixing any weird things that are a result of you over taxing the system to me that also says that the system isnt going to be changed any time soonedit edit this is also a bold faced lie they may have more than you in certain fights but thats usually a day or two after they hand you your ass no other entity in game fields as many players in a fight as the nc and im sure you can browse our forum mirror to see your alliances forums where crashing a node with bodies is a tactic in common usage that is encouraged at every level of your leadership
nice trollback to the pointa ccp response to improve the issue of lag and bugs in large fleet battles is much needed and would be much appreciated by many players responses from pl members laughable but not much appreciated thankyou 
here is the solutionevery entity in game set everybody but nc on its blue list the new coalition destroys the nc and breaks it apart afterward the bues tanding will be resetet and the lag will be goneps it might be necessary to do the same with drf afterwards
what about my post is a trolli have been 100 completely honest with youccp will not and can not flat out tell you this because its a business they arent your friends they are a company who needs to generate business for the remainder of this projecti challenge you to point out anything you consider a troll in my statement because its nothing but the truth that you refuse to acknowledge
currently there is no race specializing skill required for t2 sentries one could theoretically not train any race drone specialization at all and be able to use every race t2 sentry dronenot only is this not skill intensive enough to field them like t2 heavy drones but it also leaves t2 sentries without the bonus of training racial drone specialization the skill adds 2 to drone damage for each level of drones requiring the skilli propose that the drone racial specialization skill be added at a prerequisite to t2 dronesminimum level being four just like their cousin the t2 heavy drone this would bring it more in line training wise and allow for a potential of up to 10 more damagei am sure it has been brought up again but i believe the proposal is locked due to the 90 day rule drones need some serious love and this is one of several steps of love towards drone lovers like myself
sentry drones are fine just the way they are
it would make sense yeah why not
any roaming or pvp group will be familiar with this incredibly annoying and old problem people in stations when invaded by roaming gangs often undock their carriers and if theyre in a cyno jammed system literally have little to no risk of ever dying even more ridiculous than their own invulnerability is the fact that they can make smaller ships such as well tanked cruiser to battleship sized ships also invulnerable through remote repair this action doesnt even count as aggro for the carrier so they can dock instantly if danger approaches my proposal is two fold first change remote rep into aggression both in empire and 00 too long have empire corps used 10052352 logistics ships not even in their corp to rep their mains concord should really show these alts to their pods secondly i would like the aggro timer on capital sized ships only to be extended to 515 minutes this would give roaming entities the opportunity to either bump off or set a trap for these capitals who have for too long known complete safetyregards

brilliant idea
not supported they do it because your blob is bigger change it and they wont undock at all it accomplishes nothing want a fight form smaller blobs and accept your chance of wiping and the fight will come to you form huge blobs that they stand no chance against and theyll play undocking games or not undock at all
actually thats not entirely true ive had guys whip out a carrier because my solo maelstrom was solo owning their little station hugging pirate gang in any case this proposal blows all thats needed is for rr to count towards the 60 second aggression timer thats plenty of time to ram them off station or dreadsc bomb them it shouldnt be limited to capitals either im tired of sitting there watching guardians rr someone on a gate jump the instant they get shot and come right back 30s later and there isnt a damn thing you can do about it unless you can alpha them 60s aggro timer just like shooting someone would fix that little problem
i too like eliminating logistics ships from roaming gangs gotta love getting that gate aggro for chaining cap liang
the last 3 posters are all slightly edcap transfer is not remote rep so im not sure what the guy above me was60 seconds requires you to have something in the neighborhood of 56 max skilled nyxes to kill a thanny more if its an archon so the guy above him is also wrongthe guy above that blaming it on blobs is also mentally ed this happens in systems where there are 90 alliance members who wont undock to fight a 10 man roaming gang and instead choose to sit a single carrier and some ridiculous ship like a geddon on the undock tanking out the geddon like a boss because there is no danger to the carrier at all
grath youre a moron and you shame your corp and alliance by even postingliang
im a moron and you had to edit your post once to get this one liner out
im not sure what me editing a post has to do with you being a moron liang
well at least you got that one line out without having to edit that one so i guess youre a work in progresswhat exactly is it in my original post that makes me a moron i mean if youd like to refute something i said feel free but simply slinging insults makes you look like an angry hungry baby
just a guess but it might be that you dont understand the core concepts of remote repairliang
you said cap transfer which is not remote repairalthough currently cap transfer bounces criminal flagging through the fleet of guardians or bassis already what the op suggests is that simply remote repairing gives aggression there is nothing wrong with that idea and it would level the playing field for neutral repping in empire and carrier repping on stations this is the point where you started calling me names and saying i dont understand the core mechanics of reppingwell heres your chance sport why dont you explain the core mechanics to me or what about that idea is flawed or wrongedit just to be clear right now it looks like you either participate in carrier station games or you rely on neutral repping in empire for your game play its cool to be mad about that i was pretty ed when they nerfed my nano ships but the game turned out better for it in the long run
see the craziest thing is that cap chaining is actually a form of remote repair thus 2 basilisks sitting on a gate will never ever ever be able to deagress that is a major problem with the ideaactually i participate in flying logistics in low sec and dont appreciate holding my gang up for a couple minutes every time we go through a gate im also firmly of the opinion that gate games as described by rothgar are trivially counterable even my 4 man corp does on a regular basisas ive always said in these threads if station games are ing your day up fix station games but gate aggression is fine as things stand
see how hard was that no insults no asshatery just your take on the situation and while i disagree with it its still valid as that happens to be your area of operation low sec gates where i normally dont operatethe only thing i see is that station aggro mechanics are unfortunately going to adversely have an impact on gate mechanics mainly due to ccps ham fisted approach to bolting things on to their code
seeing as how you started the conversation off with insults im not sure where you get off lecturingliang
yea its one of the great mysteries of the universe like the pyramids only smaller
the problem is that we dont understand exactly why do you suggest such a thingthe main point of your argumentation seems to be that neutral repping point but what you asked wont solve it thats why we are asking you to rephrase it maybe then we will be able to post some constructive contentsby the way i got my toeic with 95 and nobody care about that  being able to speak english using wellconstructed sentences doesnt make you more easily understandable if you dont take some time to explain your points in details
simply put add a 10 second delay to localcreates a nice isk sink by allowing pvpers to have a chance at catching ratters diligent ratters that pay attention to dscan will have a chance to surviveif the pvper is slow the ratter will see the local change after 10 seconds and get safe plus many more cool things like more fights always good to have more fights
brilliant idea lets make ratters have to relentlessly click on the dscan in order to survive all so you can have an easier time catching said ratters to get easy kills sarcasmit is already easy enough to catch ratters if you know what you are doing the game does not need to change just because of your shortcomings alsowhy dont you try killing stuff that can fight back or do you just so unskilled that you can only go for the easy kills with no risk of you losing
as always the only acceptable local is a delayed mode localbut ccp needs to invent something that can work as a replacement before nerfing it
isk sink does not mean what you think it means it is an isk sourceyou mean macrosif by fights you mean completely onesided ganks and more blobbing yes
this is not caod just a simple reason why you do or dont like the idea would suffice if you feel like you must troll go to that forum
change tolack of local doesnt give fights it gives ganks if anything it may stop some fights if gangs pass each other and dont realize itblobbing no having 10 dudes gank your ratting raven is not being blobbed its just a dumb gank
well i never saw why 10 vs 1 pve ship wouldnt be blobbing but 100 vs 10 pvp ships would be but it is more that i meant one sided ganks by 10 vs 1 pveer and blobs because there is less reason not to blob if there is no warning when a huge blob is incoming against a small gang
so you are telling me that since you are a pver and i have 10 mates in violence boatspopping your ship and podding you is wrongreally
i call your troll and raise you one there should be concord in 00 your move
always hard to say if people are trolling or genuinely stupid but ill be nice and go for the latter option for nowwhat i am telling you could have found that out by reading btw is that 10 pvp ships vs 1 pve ship is at least as much blobbing as 100 pvp ships vs 10 pvp ships if that is wrong or not is your choice to make but they are either both wrong or both fine now imo they arent really wrong but at the same time it also doesnt need to be encouraged which would this do it definately would not increase the good fights
simply put this proposal is without merit the author wants to have the developers implement more stealth for his stealth bomber so he has a better chance of catching someone alone there is more to 00 than hunting ravens in a stealth bomber the author overlooks every other effect that this sort of change would have on the game in the name of upping his gank countwith a 10second delay an entire battleship fleet could move through a solar system or two without being seen or reported by the locals if theyre not hanging out at the gates the only place theyd be seen in this scenario and there are many gates in 00 that are less than 1au apart this fleet could move into a outpost system and no one would know about it until they had formed on and began destroying a cynosural jammer with a capital fleet landing as soon as they finish sov structures tend to be expensive and represent a significant investment of timematerials for those who put them up should we really make it even easier for them to be destroyed before the owners can form a proper response all so that you can gank a few more ratterslastly wormhole space already exists there is no automatic appearance in local chat there if this is what you want you can go there and live out the rest of your days in happiness no need to change the rest of the game
lol reading comprehension ftl
no supportit will help only botters to go on with their buisness making isk without be on key and fraud all other players how have to spend much time to make isk to buy a new ship for pvpand sometimes i am watching a system several hours on a second client to see if the bots will start to ignore me and come out or just a hostile jb til something jumps in to get hotdroppedso this client is running 47hrs sometimes without beeing touched because their is nothing to do in this system only watching it
tldr while you can no doubt get some support from spineless cowards and people prone to emotional knee jerking that doesnt change the fact that your idea is crap and there is no real issue that needs fixing this is such a load of bs people who manufacture mine afk rat afk mission run do research trade use pi gather datacores ect all essentially play the game while not actively being at the keyboard it boggles the mind that people are too stupid to see that eve is full of afk activities that directly impact the universe but complain about the one afk activity that doesnt allow you to do anything its affect is based entirely on the psychological effect it has on some people and ccp shouldnt start to nerf things just because they make people feel insecureyour pinging solution wouldnt actually solve anything for the simple reason people move while cloaked and they can fly unscannable fits without cloaks since it would need to be hard it needs to take time and player skill so by the time you get a hit the warp in point is going to be useless basicly you couldnt catch the cloaker anyway and you are still left with the psychological terror of ships in local you cant catch this is basicly a huge load of work for ccp to implement and balance for the benefit of ing of loads of players and solving nothingsimple timeout as a solution hasnt worked in any game for the simple reason that people arent actually afk that much and you can easily force automatic input again a change that would  of some players who just want to stay logged in and keep an eye on things for whatever reason while mainly doing something else or playing on another account while at the same time solving nothing you suggestion to waste gm time on hunting down players who just want to stay logged in to the game is laughable at best and at worst will increase macro use dramatically and creaste a lot of white noise that makes finding actual macro players much harder this game has people with real issues to fix and solve so wasting valuable and limited resources in to an effort to prevent people from doing nothing is insane waste of limited resources from ccps tech blogs it also seems pretty clear that its macros active players and combat in particular that causes the vast majority of server strain if you have proof that afk players are a significant drain on server resources feel free to post it here otherwise ill just assume you dont have any backing to your claim and are just trying to appeal to peoples emotions to get support for your ideaas for not needing to stay logged without input it is a huge convenience having the ability to stay logged i can do things in the house or work at the computer while still being ble to monitor if anything in the game warrants my attention these things usually are intel channels local and other chat channels it seems like a good design that in an mmo you have ingame mechanisms players can use to stay in touch while not actively playing sometimes nothing is happening so there is no point being active but that could change at any moment and staying in contact even while not playing strengthens those social ties to other players that are what keeps people playing year after yearits also worth pointing out that inactivity timers are often used since in many games being inactive can directly harm other peoples gameplayany arena type games or their ability to play at allhardcaps on how many players can connect to the server in eve neither is the case and inactivity doesnt prevent anyone else of doing things so there is no real need for itnot supported
i stopped right there all of that which you posted was just a bunch of ignorant blathering and i am sure the rest of your post is no different ratting mining pi trade datacores missioningall require you to be at the keyboard unless you are using the assistance of a macro which as already stated is not what this thread is about your blind ignorance prevents you from seeing what the issue is so let me break it down into baby talk for youa miner who is afk can be killed by a pirate as can a ratter or any character running trade and pi as well as missions and retrieving datacores an afk cloaker is completely 9999999999999 invincible in accomplishing his goals of shutting down a system for ratters and miners and various other activities that tiny remaining percentage is in the random off chance of a player actually bumping into said afk cloaker it doesnt matter how spineless you think people are the largest fleet in eve cant catch most afk cloakers and stop them from doing what they do most miners and ratters arent braindead enough to rat or mine with an expensive and defenseless ship just so some coward in a cloaky bomber can wait until he can one shot said defenseless ratter because he is too spineless to fight in any real pvp where the other player can fight backsee what i did therei seriously doubt that will get through your thick skull anyway
thats right but what everyone is failing to realize is that if you have countered an active cloaker the you have also countered an afk cloaker after all the whole fear is that the afk cloaker will go active therefor treat him as active always i fly with the same overwatch even when no one is in system but me and my corp because its a good habit to be in and rewards the pure pvpers as wellor in my corps case because we have a few noobish people gives the noobs isk to practice staying on their toestldr treat em all as actives and the afkers arent a concern
i personally believe the fuel usage is the correct way to go  its actually makes the most sense  ships that have a cloak activated would require either heavy water or liq ozone to fuel the cloak module fuel required would be based on ship size so a cruiser cloaking would take more fuel then a frigate specialized ships that are built for recon would not only get a ship bonus for reduction in fuel consumption but also a small fuel bay that only holds the fuel required for cloaking with actually covops ships you might still get afk camped all day but atleast at some point that person will have to go back to friendly space and refuel my opinion is that with full cargohold and fuel bay  any covops specialized ship should be able to maintain a cloak for 1520 hrs anything not covops would last considerably less maybe 35 hrs depending on ship size
like the same way an afk cloaker still has to be at the keyboard get through the 00 camps to the chosen systemmanually just because u accuse someone else of being ignorant doesnt mean ure not one of them 1 an afk cloaker can also be killed at any bubble camp that actually has tacklerswhile active funny how u left that out2 its your own fault as well as your entire alliance for letting 1 harmless person shut down the system so in actuality u and your alliance r spineless ones and most likely using the same macros everyone else is complaining about no wait even more spineless than anyone in high sec because u want 00 with its rewards to be even safer than high sec3 and naturally u want to resort to your same old concordimitation blobbing to help solve your problems like u do with everything else in 00 u dont know how to handle otherwise4 dont want to lose something expensive dont fly what u cant afford to lose if anyones ignorant here its u5 if he bombs u that would meangasp hes not afk more ignorance ftl see what i did there tldr u call 1 harmless afk pilot spineless yet a all of u put together r still scared of him b u go straight to your crutch of blobbing because thats how many u and your alliance needs to fight 1 defenseless person and c u want 00 to be even safer than high sec with all reward and no riskwhos more spineless the 1 harmless afk pilot or the blob of 1000 who r scared of him yep it took a short while but this is what this thread is really abouttears over not having 100 concordlevel safety and 0 risk for easy 00 rewardsbut plz continuei really love to hear it
an hour client timer is okay a 15 min client timer would nerf afk mining too  cargo extended ice exhumers will not fill in that timeplease consider unintended consequences of your proposals
drake trains in 00 engage at 70km i think the big whine is that the drake is so appealing in this role because it vastly outperforms everything else when fitted to engage in this role so every man and his dog uses it which causes big lag missiles ate my internet hamster hence trying to bring it in line making other ships more appealing in this roleive only ever done up to c4 worm holes didnt think a tengu would be able to tank a c5 especially now with the neuting cant you approach the ships out at 160km or are they webbing you toosleepers are gits for that i know maybe have a raven there to helpanyway does the fact that a tengu can punch out to that range and tank which none of the other t3s can do not set alarm bells ringing
no alarm bells no because it only tanks on rr and resists the dps is infernally slow if effective and only makes it because you have the time 45 tengus on a c5 guardian takes a bit of time and the rr better be on the ball or someones losing a ship we use large tech ii shield transporters but 34 on one tengu just barely holds the ship up under full onslaughtedit for typo
wrong the whine is that it performs several levels above all the other bc at all ranges over 30km or so without fitting for it  it is a bogstandard fit with zero sacrificestry fitting a harbinger or hurricane to engage at 50km and youll see what the whine is about  if it actually did significantly less damage than other weapons beyond medium range then the problem could be tankedignored but it outdps both beams and artillerythe only logistics i have ever seen not clustered with its charges is scimitars zooming around the edges  being of minnie design it is rather nearsighted so a single damp removes it quite handily
isnt that what i just said and have been saying this whole thread a hml drake doesnt need range boosting modules to achieve 70km range all other bcs do which sacrifices a lot of slots which the drake fills with tankgankwould 6 or 7 ravens not be a better choice or does the low sig offer a lot of damage reductioni can get a proteus to perform similarly to your tengus but uses drones which are painfully slow to move to the target i think you can use drones pretty effectively these days too after incursion expansion as i have seen the sleepers tend to leave them alone aside from the frigates which still like to shoot them but not so much anymore
just fix the damn thing
switch the 5 shield resist bonus to 5 shield amount still just as viable for solo and pve without massively outclassing the other battlecruisers and arguably some battleships when logistic support is presentyes a couple of other bcs do have resist bonuses but without the superb slots and fitting that the drake has to have tanks even close but still inferior their dps is much lower than even the drakes
im not sure of what youre stating but with 160m radius over 850ms and lower resist around 75 maybe your guy is doing something wrong in fact full t2 fit i get between 84 to 93 with my skills not perfect these numbers are for a t2 fit and no implants so these can get bigger if you consider that missile and shield or radiusspeed implants are out thereknowing that base shield resists in a tengu are stronger than the drake knowing the 5 resists per lvl is available to the tengu knowing that the drake gets over 400m radius while the tengu only 160 your guy is doing something wrong for sure
if we are ignoring weapon problems the ferox actually gets tank and dps pretty much on par with the ham drake
i dont see a problem with them to be honest a few years ago if you brought a drake to a small gang or fleet a lot of fcs told you to pis off now you got people telling you to bring drakes they are in fashion and like people have said before lots of people can fly them i dont see a problem with the range of heavy missiles the other bcs can shoot out to around 70km the issue is they have to sacrifice tankdmg mods to do it while the drake does not if there was a drake nerf it should be to its overall shield hit points maybe a 5 to shield hit points
thats a pretty massive problem to ignore anyway the ferox still has one less mid but tank is only really on par if drake uses the same number of mid slots for it that the ferox doesa few years ago you didnt have medium rigs 3x extender drakes were a much bigger asset to risk a few years ago logistics pilots and cruisers were far less commonly seen resist bonused ships were thus not as favourednerfing shield hit points by 5 would do absolutely nothing balancewise change resist bonus to hp bonus
actually imo the reason drakes are so popular is the fact that shield rigs and especially resistsance rigs are ridiculously cheap and their penalty is insignificant its a passive tank on a big bc with shield externders you dont care about sig nothing was going to miss you anyway whereas any armor rig has a painful penalty and costs a lotalso obviously theres just a huge number of caldari pilots around
i was comparing a pointweb drake with a scram ferox so three mid slot shield tanks on bothstill funny the drake isnt that much better than the other battlecruisers its better but not by a huge amounti can almost agree with them not having to sacrifice anything for the range they get on heavy missiles but that isnt a drake issue thats a heavy missile issue
ill be honest im not entirely sure if what im proposing is possible or if it would work basically the idea is that as it stands once you get a certain amount of drones out there it creates staggering lag im guessing this is due to having too many models on screen at one time along with accompanying animations and the likewhy not just remove the drone models after a certain number of drones comes on screen ill be honest even when im doing missions i dont bother watching drones close enough to even see a model and i cant imagine anyone else does that in fleet battles either any time ive seen a fleet battle on bewbtube its always so far zoomed out that the only models you can see at all are supercaps like i said im not sure if its possible or would even have any impact on the lag but please discuss or even enlighten me if you have that knowledge
you havent noticed the drone models checkbox in eves graphics options
i didnt well crap so much for that then what the hell is actually causing all that lag during large battles is it just so many connections
i can answer this oneits not just 1 thing its a combination of several things1 while drones may not be rendered they still process commands for firing at a ship so in some place like 020 with a super cap battle you have some 2000 people on the field and lets just say on average about 750 are capitals so you have 1250 people  5 drones per person  750 capitals  10 drones per person obviouly averaged between carriers dreads and titansso you are looking at 6250  7500  13750 firing calls in 1 system on the node assuming all turrets are grouped as 1so ok 13750 object calls by players alone then dont forget pos guns then gate jumps armor rep cycles smart bomb explosions ewar checks ie ecm bursts etcby the time you get done with it you are going to be averaging about 100000 calls to the server per minute on a huge fleet fight such as o2o our fleet battles escalate faster than hardward and software can keep up
so it is simple the server cannot handle the current fleet sizes and if the server is improved the fleet sizes will increase that is not because we are such horribly pvpers well maybe a little but it is because in current sov mechanics the only effective way to defend or attack is to pile as many people as possible on one grid 4 times in a row aditionally smaller independent alliances have no chance again because the larger ones just pile more people on one grid than the smaller ones and then it doesnt matter if the larger one has 100 systems and the small one has one system since it doesnt actually become harder to hold a system if you already got a load of systems irl what fixes that is that your forces are spread thin and you cant jb at least that is what they want you to believe tinfoil now we can nerf jbs but tbh that makes it just more boring since you cannot make it take a few weeks to move your army a few regionsso why not make sovereighnity activity based so not the group who blobs the system 4 times gets sov but the ones who actually live there please take into account this is nothing specific and open to discussion but for example what counts towards sov would benpc killsore minedstuff manufactured limitted influence filling production slots of a station should not guarantee sovgate jumps cyno jumps etc obviously also limitted influenceplayer killslosses maybe maybe not first you also got them indirectly a killed ratter is not ratting however the larger problem is if you let kills play a role is that you get people who just jump in a carrier with fully insured t1 ships and you start killing some random neut alt to get your kills up this would work if the reward is not too large and i am in favour of that but it needs to be balancedplayer losses imo should not count for sov already enough kd s no need that that cute noobie gets flamed because he lost a ship when trying to fight solo against a random other player who doesnt want you sovso this would achieve that if you want a system you need to live there small gang combat is highly useful for taking sov more systems  harder to defend it would be trivial to take sov in a system with only bots running since they dont actually run when others are in local so winwinwin situationwell some thingstreaties would need to be implemented first which support nrds also as viable option so me ratting in friendlies systems does not hurt their sov but helps itaditionally there are apparently actually people who enjoy lagfests and are interested in 1000vs1000 and ccp advertises with them minus the lag so they should still happen and well there would be large fights about csaas and tech moons but not on the scale we have now however the sharp reader so none of you will have noticed up till now i ignored station ownership what i would do with stationsstation count towards sov again needs to be balanced so just owning the station does not guarantee you never lose sov and we are back to the current situations besides that we can just practically keep the current situation attacking a station where someone else has sov just gives the normal two reinforcement timers no ihub reinforcement stuff just no more sbuing first since sbus are gay meanwhile if you do not have sov but you do have the station everyone can directly take it by shooting through all its hp which imo might be decreased but that is something else maybe give it a minireinforcement timer of a couple of hours so the owners still have time to defend it without that being bypassed like ehp by just dropping enough supersso you can still have large fights about stations either to make it easier to flip a system to your side or just to ruin the day for everyone of the enemy who doesnt evac his stuff in time but in the end if you want to hold sov it is activity based
and nop i dont expect ccp will do anything like this or hell anything at all with sov the coming years since it would be admitting they horribly failed but one can hopein the end if this would be done people can obviously still blob the crap out of everyone else if they want if a small alliance lives somewhere they can bring the entire kitchensink to lock down the system and take the station the difference with now is they just got to do it 4 times now after which they install a horrible pet in this system they would still take the sov and lose it directly afterwards if they leave the horrible pet behind
hey it took ccp what 7 or 8 years to yank the learning skills they admittedly said was wrong so you have about 5 or so yet to goenjoy
good stuff
youd be shocked what you can learn about an alliance by doing this
nostop complaining about cloaking
no local no cloakers simple
who needs illegal buy isk whenyour corpalliance has bots and makes billions with no effortyour corpalliance does over 5 billionsmonthmoon with moon harvestingthere is a lot more shiny stuff like this so who needs to buy a t3 char for some billions just to afk cloak buffing his fleet  can you seriously find an example and a real onescanning players is already a 5 years old game difficulty so leave improbable t3s alone and change your tactics change to another system change your game or from this game play with people join some alliance etc etc
the most stupid game mechanic is being able to scan down every thing but t3s with special setups in less than 15secwhats the point gate camps arent enoughnow i entirely agree that fleet boosts should be on grid but its another discussionyou can cloak any command ship or battlecruiser yet you are asking for t3 ships to be nerfed i cant agree with thisyou can also make any battlecruiser or command ship become improbable without cloaking device if you use more than 00001 of your brainsso im asking again whats your point op
oh wow your sig really sets your post off nicely liang
thanks to everyone for the supportwe will be drawing the winners of everything on the 2nd of april in the wwwseriousinternetpoliticiancom ingame chat channelyours serious

is windy about to start crying cause other than in eveo forums no one likes him cares about him or even knows of him
i would hope sobut knowing windy as well as i do i guess he is grabbing another beer and phl at you lot posting here 
voting is over windy you can stop altposting
always a toss up when you read something like this either a delusion a delusional sycophant one of the mits alts or a trollwindjammer
okay i have to admit to a certain amount of admiration here the guy writes a blatant self promotion containing at least one really big omission and he gets paid for it wowthats like taking out an ad in a newspaper and having the newspaper pay you for your ad as well as throwing truth in journalism out the windowlets all write letters to the editors of tentonhammer and see just how much they care about the credibility or integrity of their publicationwindjammer
if any significant number of people complained then they would just publish an article about it because controversy means more page impressions which means more ad money basically tth cant lose
of course but they might also take greater care in who they allow to write for them and what is written hey maybe even tell the mits his services are no longer required also i believe if i were ccp id be a little miffed about the prejudice in mits article as well as the glaring omission ccp takes out advertising with tth dont theywindjammer
oh boy living in your fantasy world must be great
the funny part is this is far less selfcongratulatory and preening than usual you wretched filth are in for a bloodboiling year
fine mr picky throwing more truth in journalism out the window than is customary and doing it in an obvious way that better for youmost publications will at least pretend to have some integrity and like people to believe they have credibility the mits blog journalism in tentonhammers publication isnt even pretending windjammer
give me a minute to chug a few beers and catch up to you your post might make more sense to me if were both in the same condition either that or you could get a friend to ghost for you you seem to have something to say but darned if i can figure out what it iswindjammer
are you that concerned that people wont be able to see the text to the left of your post and wonder who made it
who is this mysterious stranger making these posts if only i knew his name
im beginning to realize this isnt a beer related problem if one of you gooners could loan me your weaselior to english dictionary id be grateful or maybe you could just translatewindjammer
are you a fox news viewer
given the usual goon rhetoric isnt that a clear case of the kettle calling the mirror blackno fox news is a waste of bandwidth for the same reason the mits articles are and murdock is an even larger ass at least mits does it for fun for the record i think the same of msnbc im npr bbc and cnn all the way though the last is obviously not so great anymore if it ever waswindjammer
if you had trouble with that you dont need a translator you need a first grade english book
see i knew you could do it good boy you succeeded in writing something that made sense that having been said your fu is seriously lacking some kungalso your previous posts still require a rewrite andor explanation to be understood of course thats entirely up to you perhaps you just wanted to be vaguely ominous and cryptic were you going for inscrutable cause that would be coolwindjammer
for those who wish to complain to tentonhammer about the mittanis article the address is supporttentonhammercomregardswindjammer
who the heck complains cause someone writes and self congradulatory articleno fan of goons but wowyou people need to get out more agree it was a terrible writen article but some of his stuff is decent to readreally you think this i worth complaining over or that they will care or find something disagreable

so finnally there were simplu more people voting early this year and thats all too bad 
ccpplease poast stats that is allkeep up the good posting

while it is understandable you would want a defence ccp has never given any indication that the csm was in game in fact the demand that participants have to provide their real name sign an agreement that effects the player and not the avatar see larkonis gate and pretty much all communication from ccp strongly indicates that the csm has nothing to do with in game at allof course if you or anybody else are breaking the eula is up to ccp to decide

you could always just make it so the first year autolinking the old name leads you to the same person keep it on a yearly system names shouldnt be that easy to change they should be changeable howeveras for blacklisting people and that sort of thing i really couldnt care less sure a corp thief should be watched but really they should be able to get away too no reason someone should have a noose hanging around their neck for that long or that amount of time until the incident is forgotten sometimes nevervendettas are generally stupid and childish quite often the fault of the person who pursues it sometimes completely imagined and possibly even outright slander something which a lot of players in eve should think about next time they choose to listen to someone regarding anothers character i hate the idea of having some anonymous unknown slander following me around not knowing even what it is or who is spreading it yet it would affect all my interactions in game with people who had heard and i wouldnt be able to argue or even defend myself regarding it that sort of thing happens in real life toomore than 10 of the population are psychopaths who never choose to kill people because they find it much more satisfying to ruin their relationships employability and ability to live a normal life  study by a professor at the university of british columbiablacklisting by employers is illegal in canada regardless it still happens and affects many peoples livesthat aside i do support this idea and think real currency is the way to go
yes pleasethis is actually the main reason that i might have to stop playing eve
i recently noticed that  has some lookalike issues as well
i support this ccp has been ingoing the blasterrail guns problem for far to longfix it now
for the love of god please fix hybrids
thanks for the support
yep i can dig thathowever i would support the idea only if it were to be taken even furtherhell as it is i do not even remotely consider fof missiles be it in pve or pvp i think they could use a significant boost so as to offset the lack of being able to focus on a target either a plain ol damage or rof bonus or a way that say a fleet commander could direct the missiles to a target some sort of missileoriented target painter not the tp module as we know it
all good ideas in principle but im going to make a very general suggestion which applies far more broadly than this single threadccp pays people to think of this stuff those people play the game too anytime you have a bright idea that has seemed obvious for years but was never implemented theres very likely to be an extremely good and well thoughtout reason for thatso why hasnt this been implemented well off the top of my head theres a balancing act going on here between pvp and pve lots of pvp happens in relatively open space where the vast majority of objects are ships pve on the other hand tends to happen in very crowded bubbles of lcos i put forward that this is by designfof missiles are used not often but they are used in pvp where lots of ecm is going on and they do provide at least some dps to the enemy while your alternative is to sit there doing nothing fof missiles are not used at all in pve because theyre useless in pve and theyre meant to bethe reason why is obvious bots any change that makes fof missiles at all useful in pve is more help to bots than to anyone elsethis doesnt just go for fof missiles by the way there are all sorts of elements of eve that could stand for vast improvement but cannot be implemented without making mission botting easier and anything that accomplishes that even tangentially is a nonstarter i can only conclude therefore that ccp has decided that the current implementation of fof missiles is the best of a bad situation pvpers can use them and pveers cantjust think of what could be accomplished in improvements to eve online if we didnt have to worry about bots and rtmers they truly are our worst enemy
also they should be named faf missiles which are in reality a type of missile still used today but its older tech from before the days of laserguidance oldstyle heatseeking missiles are faf launch and it seeks out the hottest target aroundfire and forgetsometimes those would come back to bite you in the rear too
not necessarily by experience some features can just never make it into software because of lack of time andor higherpriority stuff piling up on top funny as it sounds several hundred people can and will fail to think of a particular thing case in point the very very famous goonswarm stationflip storyalthough they can find some use in fights against sleepers or incursive sansha since those provide a more pvplike experience and therefore fof missiles might be a potentially fair tradeoff the actual problem i believe stems from said missiles being very situational  too much for them to be worth carrying in a gang battle i wont care much if i am jammed since my fleetmates will still be targeting and pounding the enemy away aoe jammer or lockbombs now were talking  but i dont think it happens often enough to give fofs a chance to shine the crux at hand is finding them a good niche and placing them into it somewhere i can think is it worth it to take missiles that dont need targeting at the expense of not being able to choose where they head that was why i was suggesting for a module that could maybe guide them somewhere some way to defof them a little bit at the expense of turning your targetman into a single point of failure ideas to kick aroundummmmmmmmmm no since people are so utterly convinced that every nullsec alliance ever is a buncha bots whats it gonna change to make them not need to target anything anymore oh great we gave an automatic transmission to a robot that could already drive manual whoopdeedoo
youre missing the fact that people make decisions based on perception which is not necessarily always wellgrounded in reality
the thing is though i would actually be happy with some kind of reduced attribute to compensate for more intelligent target selection damage is of course the obvious candidate but rof is another to consider let me give an example which is true for me in the use of fof missilesas an intrepid capsuleer i love exploration and regularly carry fof hydras with me in my tenguas well as being an intrepid capsuleer i am also incredibly lazy to that end i fit the good ol launchers with fof missiles in readiness for the mass of frigs and cruisers that populate highlow sec sitesthe to me lazy remember ability for the launchers to automatically decimate these tiny rats with reduced damage compared to regular scourge is a more than fair trade true i do a significantly smaller amount of damage compared to the regular missiles but its saved me having to bloody target millions of red crossestalking here about selecting rats not about the us military bombing friendlyneutral forcesngos etc lol as i think i mentioned before i dont want to be seen to be forcing this issue just for my own benefit lolim more than happy to accept a trade off 
i support this but its not likely to happenccp is making to much money having people pay for multi accounts most anyone who has been playing eve for a while can pay for one account with plexes the whole idea dont really make much logical sense to me because you still need two or more accounts to use more then one character in game you cant use two characters on the one account at the one time all this will do is hurt character for isk sales how ever if ccp changed the client so that only 2x toons were aloud on the one account instead of 3 and then allow them to train at the same time may not be as bad i like the idea but it just dont make any sense to me
this skill i think is one of those problem skills that cant be fixed without removing itthe idea of the skill is that you can buy things without having the full amount of isk right awayhowever this leaves a problem what happens if you dont have the isk when the item is being sold to youwell you cant get a negative balance as this would be exploited to hell and backso the other thing is to remove the buy order which seems simple enoughhowever far to many people do not use it as intended and use it for very very pointless scams that might work sometimes but all they do is mess with the market as they combine this with the minimum buy amount and try to scam peoplei know this could be fixed by removing the buy amount however some people use it for legitimate reasonsso i believe the skill should be removed as its just pointless you need the total amount of isk to buy x item then you should have it up frontso i say remove this useless skillposted ideasshow how many items buy can afford out of his requested amountfine the margin skill itself for each force cancelled ordered
noed ill be diplomatic
supported dont have the cash dont trade bringing in consequences of irl into eve jail would be unrealistic therefore bringing marginal trading into eve is unrealistic get rid of it
there is actually a pretty simple way to fix itbuy orders are only shown when the buyers wallet is able to make the trade for the asked minimum amount
ive just been reading the eve24 reports on the null sec discussion and what is apparent is the ccp are trying to dictate how the game should be played a classic example of this is1327dev why be blue to everyone around youreally what has that got to do with anyone else its a sandbox least thats what you keep telling us over and over again why ccp trying to dictate a particular style of game play sorry thats not your job the players are complaining about game mechanics while ccp seem obsessed with player behaviour ccp start listening to your customers and stop listening to your whiny devsif you want to improve access to 00 provide more npc regions like venal around the rest of 00 npc delve is laughably small and i dont think drones the largest area has any make them logistically reachable too again like venal
it seems to be a real problem in ccps developer culture and one that will have to be addressed before a tipping point is reached hopefully this csm will have a proper makeup that theyll be able to smack ccp on the nose with a rolled up newspaper and tell them to stop chewing on our slippers its an absurdity to run a sandbox game and then tell the playerbase that theyre sandboxing wrong ccp needs to decide if theyre really committed to the concept they started with of playercreated playerdriven content in a sandbox environment if they are then their own job is to make sure that game mechanics are functioning as intended and not that theyre getting the desired or stopping nondesired political behavior in game if its a sandbox then its up to players whether theyll fight solo or with a buddy or ten buddies or eight hundred dudes theyve never met who are in turn friends withenemies with whoever the  they want ccp advertises its game with massive fleet battles and talk of the butterfly effect if thats true they need to keep their damn hands off eves political landscape if not just divide the server up into shards assign alliances to alliance or horde and start instanced space dungeons to decide sov conflictspos bashingwhatever
i understand how you guys feel and all but ccp has to retain some control over what happens in eve or else the s will run rampant and unbalance everything sandbox or not
the problem is that without parents to watch and protect the sandbox children will  in it
the problem with eves sandbox is the same with anything else that lets thousands of players coagulate and fester bigger blobs make people do progressively dumber things like make bigger blobsi can understand why ccp would want to tackle napfesting 00 isnt supposed to be peaceful
you are both so foolishhaving consequences to napping a bunch of people is not only fair but it is completely 100 leaving the choice in your handsbut i think your issue isnt that you wont have a choice its that other people will and they wont choose to play your stupid game and youll be left alone bitter and defeatedhtfu ccps stated goal in 00 now is to make it more action packed and enjoyable only a fool or someone blinded by bias would post this much fear mongering
ccp have to consider the wider sandbox not just nullsec 00 stagnation has the potential to bork the entire economy its entirely within their remit to try and prevent such a situation from occurring
because huge blobs fights are harmful to the server there is no point in ccp fighting lag if blobs will expand to occupy all available space in a system until the game becomes unplayable againthey want to find a more permanent solution to the problem feel free to sandbox any way you want as long as you play with the sand not break the box
if they want to fix blobs they need to give an incentive not to bloba good start would be perhaps reintroducing the oldschool doomsday device but perhaps with a catch  it takes out the titan with it but can pop even a poorly tanked carrier essentially if you are on grid with that titan and it self destructs you die
you can not fight human nature or mathematics you simply can not and no the sever is not harmed situational server performance is degraded in specific environments but claiming server harm is absurdif you have a target i want to attack or i have an asset i want to defend being able to put more firepower on the able will mean i most likely win better sov objectives is a very good start but it wont eliminate the fact that 10 ships provide more dps than one people will cooperate if they think it increases their chances at victory its hypocritical to claim otherwise unless you never fly anything but solo playercreated playerdriven political content isnt supposed to be anything but what the players decide and please the no combat canard has been beaten to death even if that was true and everybody in 00 tomorrow decided that they hated pvp and wanted to mine veldspar until their eyes bleed ccp would have no grounds interfering none at all your position is also more than a little disingenuous what if tomorrow ccp decided that rather than letting players engage in sandbox gameplay that only large scale combat should be allowed and small scale combat should simply be removed as a viable possibility those of us arguing honestly and rationally would be able to point out its a sandbox game and smallgang pvpers should be able to play it however they want leave the game unchanged youd have to accept their changes since youve already accepted that ccp has the right to break sandbox play if they dont like how people are sandboxing its the old jokea man walks up to a woman in a bar and offers her 50 million dollars if shell sleep with him and she say yes then he offers her five dollars and she says you bastard what kind of a woman do you think i am he responds madam we already know what kind of a woman you are now were just haggling about the price no not true any political formation that occurs without cheating is by definition balanced because thats what people have created in the sandbox if tomorrow everybody ganged up and decided to blue each other except people whose characters names started with the latter a ccp would have absolutely nothing to say about that its not up to ccp to determine ingame politics in a game where political content is playercrated and playerdrivenbalanced doesnt mean fair im sure to people with a name that starts with a theyd hate being hunted by the rest of eve but its a sandbox and we get to determine how play goes 1 this is eve a game where scamming treachery betrayal unfair fights and generally being a bastard are not only allowed theyre encouraged saying that we need to be protected from the nature of the game is less than compelling 2 your analogy is telling were the ones who are supposed to be creating the content in this game about playercreated content rather obviously wanting someone to serve as our mommy and daddy somewhat misses the point one does not consider the sandbox by breaking sandbox play what if 00 play was the same but empire dwellers didnt feel like being industrialists anymore why that has the potential to bork the game ccp should force all empire residents to spent no less than 75 of their time on industrial production then right or just 50
strawmanit isnt about ccp forcing players to act in certain ways but changing the incentives to go with your analogy ccp could then increase the availability of manufacturing slots change the number of active jobs per character reduce corporation fees or the standings needed to negate them none of that is forcing a fundamental change in player activities simply encouraging it same idea with differentiating areas of nullsec in the hopes of increasing conflict and the consequent economic activity they cant force alliances to fight each other but simply encourage it
fyp
no its not honestly people here like to use that word without knowing what it means and its just silly ccp discovers that empire residents no longer want to perform industrial work and they decide that theyre sandboxing wrong so they remove all missions from empire and all asteroids and all exploration sites and prohibit anybody trading on the market too unless theyve built at least one module for every item theyre selling semantic gaming im not forcing you to act differently im compelling you im not compelling you im punishing noncompliance and rewarding acceptance im not punishing you if you dont do what i want and rewarding you if you do im providing incentives and disincentives im not setting up incentives and disincentives to make you play the game the way i want im altering the game to coerce a desired outcome im not trying to weight game mechanics in order to coerce your playercreated politics im altering game mechanics so that they are more likely to channel people into the playercreated path i want them in im not channeling allegedly playercreated content into devapproved politics im corralling the wild and chaotic nature of individual agents and providing for a unified nullsec experience governed by my desires im not corralling your play stale so as to create a nullsec experience for you thats governed by my desire for what playercreated content you should want to create im the fact remains either the game is a sandbox or its not if it is you the devs set up mechanics so that theyre working the way you intend then you let people do whatever you want with them if for example you set up the ability to put corpalliance tickers on the overview and people are able to do that then the game is working as intended if people do that and refuse to shoot at pilots with certain tickers because theyre cooperating with them and you dont like that then the game is still working as intended and you keep your damn hands off it same with sov or anything else if the system itself is broken sure fix it asap if the system is working as intended but people are sandboxing wrong then ffs go get a beer and smoke a cigarette and play some pool and then get back to fixing broken code in eve online after youve forgotten that you had the desire to break sandbox play look the simple fact is that no matter what people want nullsec to be it will be whatever its residents make it because the whole point of a sandbox game like eve is that its playercreated and playerdriven content that provides the context and the drive for events in nullsec you cant get around that arguments that i like smallmediumlarge fleet combat so thats the style that ccp should encourage while discouraging all others is simply absurd if people were being honest about this theyd realize that as theres functionally no difference between i like large fleet battles so ccp should do everything they can to provide incentives for that kind of play and disincentives for its opposite and make players migrate to large sov holding coalitions and i like small gang combat so ccp should do everything they can to provide incentives for that kind of play and disincentives for its opposite and make players migrate away from large sov holding coalitions were back to haggling over price and people have lost any leg to stand on once they admit that they just want to alter game mechanics to boost their subjective game preferences
you should have read it yourself before giving a tldr that is essentially but i want to run sanctums forever in my dreamlandexpected consequences some alliances will immediately start wanting to look for better space in the longer run therell be more conflicts going on with more localized goals newer alliances will have an easier time getting a foothold in nullsec coalitions will be marginally less stable alliances will have to choose more carefully what space they develop where their staging systems are and so on low truesec systems generally tend to be in strategically inconvenient places
facepalmsi did read the whole thing  if youd have actually read my post youd have realized i said and i quotethe bread and butter of my point is two fold1 the number of systems even worth claiming is going to drop dramatically2 the larger alliances are going to swoop into regions with those few systems kick everyone else out and settle inlong story short this change does nothing to help new alliances unless they are willing to settle for space that quite frankly sucks which there is already plenty of and in fact hurts more established alliances that had to work for their space additionally it helps botters as hey take a guess theyre already on 237 they dont really notice a change like this as all it does is mean they have to run an extra account however for people like myself who runs one primary account and one as a simple stuffmoving toon with limited playtime its a kick to the faceit makes rift look all the more enticing to be honest and ive played eve for years started back in 2005
how many people ccp do you think can share one systemif you knew what you were saying you wouldnt have asked this
running sanctums in gangs can be pretty lucrative iirc on a corp or alliance scale certainly far more so than one individual per anom and in fact it gives better isk than soloing unless the loner has a wellpimped setup
ccp went full  especially on those intended consequences if this was posted at 1 april it would have been funny
apparently you are having some comprehension issues here so let me clarifyhow many people do you think live in 00 space a few thousand for the sake of argument lets say its a flat 5000 people total lets assume a flat 1000 unique people so 5 accounts per personif they make this change instead of each system in 00 being able to have a haven or sanctum given the upgrades only a handful will so assume 100 systems totalthat means you must put 10 people in each of those systems spread across spacethat means 50 accounts in each systemand i believe its safe to say im seriously lowballing the number of people
i added this to the first post but anywaymake it so that you can improve the trusec status as in lower it with constant work  how you do this i dont know maybe make it so that its based on the military standing of a system each level subtracts 1 so with level 5 military your space gets a bonus 5 truesec statussomething to make it so you can upgrade your space which iirc was the initial plan would work
i really cant imagine why they want to implement this change it is going to cause a lot of problems for a lot of groups and probably no problem at all for certain large established groups
im confusedthis seems to me like 1 step forward 2 steps backthe whole point of system upgrades was to increase the usepopulation of less used systems and not to be do dependant on the actual security rating of the systemwith this new nerf you are now going back to the old system and making it alot harder to make isk unless your lucky enough to be in an alliance big enough to holdcontrol these low sec systemsit seems to me every time a new ccp member comes into this game they relook at this and invent there own method as they seem fitits about time ccp listen to there member base and stop messing with systemsi for one have played this game almost everyday for the last 8yrs so can speak slightly from experience when i say leave it the way it is if you remove sanctumshavens from the system weve all been upgrading then i can honestly say ccp has gone to far againi wonder how long it will take until a new member of staff decides to change it againgive with one hand and then take from the other  ccp mentalitykrool
well not just that but all that isk that was spent upgrading systems now means nothing simply because of truesec status
im p sure itll have mostly been recouped by now certainly by individual players if not by taxes
oh no doubt but that isnt the point now is it  the point is that all that work is essentially being undone
what my bet is what will happen when 00 cant support the number of people in it sanctums only are like 10 better than highsec level 4s btw they will invade a nearby lowsec system that has level 5 missions and keep it blobbed to  then run level 5s to make isk and when a tech moon comes under attack form up and titan bridge or what ever to the moon and blob the attackerso blobs and naps will stay but null will be very empty and its holders only interested in the good truesec systemsmoon systemsindustry systems and will blob anyone who tries to take sov near them but who would when you can make better isk in highsec for less riskpswe in test went to low sec for about a month a few months ago to fight in curse and after a week our lowsec staging system was very blue so clearing out low isnt hardfake edit i think level 5s may be more profitanle than sanctums so why dont we invade lowsec yet has me confused i guss grinding standing doesnt appeal to most when you can just jump right in and run sanctums if you got the tank and dps also in low you dont have bubbles so getting td on a non kickout station is unlikely and you just have to keep an eye on dscan for combate probes and of course keep an eye on intel
as if people needed more reasons to bot their way through terrible pve
i hope that this blog is a bad jokewhile the idea is not wrong the implementation is simply stupidwhat will happensince havens and sanctums are the only anos that give you a bit more money than l4 missions no one will live in space with bad true sec not even the small alliances you try to support the people will simply farm l4 missions instead the rest of 00 population will be squeezed in fewer systems so that blobbing becomes even easier how it would workleave the sanctumshavens as they are for systems with 00 to 02 and improve them for systems with lower true sec
in all fairness and despite my enjoyment of the bitter tears from the naplanders the minimum should be at least 1 haven
there are a lot of tears in this thread i personally think this is a great idea upgrades made all nullsec extremely profitable i spent lots of time running sanctums and havens and dear god did that rake in the isk but realistically it really did pacify many aspects of null sec because the grass was about the same on both sides of the fence and only moons made a difference which are typically corpalliance controlled and dont motivate individual members soo much now dynamic agent quality will reduce hisec mission rewards sov upgrades will be highly altered by system truesec sounds to me like lowsec and select nullsec will become the iskmakers bringing a bit more conflict back to our world hell i bet cva will be given provi back after this change
you do understand that everything below haven is not more profitable or even less profitable than lvl 4 missionsso why should someone move to lets say provi if missionruning in sasoutikh in high sec is more profitable and safer  you dont need to pay for sov 00 with bad true sec will simply become the new low sec where no one lives
and i bet cva says thanks but no thanks the income of provi predominion with sov costs of postdominion how would they pay for that
hardly any tears and if you think this is a good idea then you must have no idea about life in eve in generalas i said ive been here for nearly 6 years now 00 if this goes into effect will be empty save for a select few spots which will have a constant blob in them pvp is difficult enough due to lag and blob warfare this will just make it that much worse
its called belt rattingwe all did it
why should i belt rat in provi cloud ring and so on lvl 4 missions are more pofitable and safer
steps will be taken to break up the blobstepswillbetaken
using that kind of argument you can more or less justify anything that has ever been
obviously expecting people to live in useless 00 systems that pay 3x time less than hisec missions is a total fail
cva built and funded an outpost in half the systems in provi before dominion despite its crappy truesec even with these changes while the upgrades wont be the iskfaucet it is now it will still allow for many income increasing activities more sigs constant anomalies albeit lower quality more whs etc you people are acting like the sky is falling because you cant have an endless stream of havens and sanctums in every system but youll still have an endless stream of hubs and ports even in your lowest truesec they dont pay the 60100mhr of sanctums but they can still earn you 1020mhr comparable to mission running and you get to be close to home where you can pew pew build caps pi moonmine and the countless other activities that bring you to null sec most nullsec players arent there to maximize their iskhour and while this change will reduce their income it wont be so dramatic that theyll flee back to highsec mission running additionally it will create systems coveted for more than just their moongoo
my support
botting is sure a problem however i never seen any gm act when a bot is around all bots i seen are still out there worse yet trying to kill the bots yourself ends in getting concorded meaning you cant do anything about them nor anything is done to get them out of eve i suggest ccp should start banning the main accounts of those that use any bot may it be 1 now and then or using many bots all the time i dont care just ban the main accounts

thanks to gk for giving this thread the attention it needs and a thumbs up from me toosome things are not right and never were ppl get killed hours after their 15 min aggression timer is gone while logged off but the logs show nothing this is not a rare bug it happens pretty often  on very rare occasions even pvp petitions got a positive answer in the past if a gm in good mood took his time to investigate ship back then i asked and what is with the clone upgrade and the implants you just acknowledge something went wrong on server side gm we do not reimburse this the list could be continued this is bad costomer support everybody knows this nobody cares what you write in your reimbursement policy or petition answers if it is nonsense and lame excuses
ccp please reimburse my ship that i have lost because of lag even though i had a disconnect or logged yes i knew that jumping in a system with 2000 players can cause such mailfunctions and that you dont reimburse such losses but you say in ads that such fights are possible so they should be lag free and my loss reimbursedccp please reimburse my ship becaue ive lost it in a gate camp even though i had warp stabs fitted yes i knew this could happen but the description of the module says that it prevents others from warp scrambling youraise if your see any similarities
maybe no one asked them this beforeccp is the lag even fixableor are you running scared around the office trying to figure out something before the eggers realize it isnt
no the lag is not fixable for the situation 1000 players on a node and the calls made back to the server are just too damn much especially when augmented with drone and missile callsit cannot be fixed will not be fixed and complaining will only waste your own time the pl guy is right change your tactics to fit the situation if you cant get the situation to fit your tacticsthe driving analogy is correct you cant petition the state to straiten out a curvy road because you want to drive faster the road is going to stay curvy so if you dont want to fly off the road and crash slow the  down
you sir are a wise man
1completely unacceptable fix it or make the game free to play
heh i thought only the likes of fcon and own alliance bragged about holding sov amidst a blue list of 20 alliances i suppose its contagious
this is in regards to the latest dev blog about how systems will be losing their sanctums and havens and such you can read the blog heredev blogmy proposal is pretty simple why not make it so active corporations that hold sovereignty can lower the truesec of their systems over time this would allow for better spawn both in belts and via scanned anomalies maybe cap the maximum change at say 25 so you can take a 00 truesec system to 025 and a 05 to a 75 so on and so forth obviously the max of 10 remains the maxnow the catch  if someone comes in and kicks you out and claims your space they get your upgrades they still have to maintain them but they do not have to start from scratchthis accomplishes a few things1 active space becomes more valuable2 inactive space becomes less valuable3 this would entice alliances to fight over the lessvaluable space as now they can make it more valuable4 the truly crap 00 systems now can be made semivaluable5 upgradedimproved systems now become giant targets for hostiles to come take overboom more conflict and better 00  everyone is happyedit  yes i do realize this would also affect faction and officer spawns and potentially even the ore that spawns in the belts that is the point now im not saying this should be a simple 2 or 3 day process for these upgrades  make them take weeks or even months per level or make them take longer at each level even i wouldnt be opposed to it taking over a year to get to the 5th level upgrades  makes them all that much more valuable and worth taking over edit2  edited in the new values and made a few changes
i like it all space should have value
im all for it the whole idea behind the dominion sov changes was to get more ppl corps and alliances to igrate to nullsec with proposed changes a whole lot of alliances will retreat to highsec againi second the idea that hard work should make up for the bad realsec of the systemssham
1 and 2 totally agreei only fear great lag battles as it is these days with more than well not manyin systems when fighting but i like the idea thumbs up
not supported you should have to fight for better space not turtle up with your 50k friends and wait for your space to improve to avoid conflict
i think your suggestion is way overboard a 05 change borders on ridiculous and eventually negates the desired effect of making some space more valuable than other space why would your suggestion create conflict if you can turn a 2 system into a 7 system almost all of nullsec becomes highly profitable
thumbs up for this idea
it actually revert to the same point ccp is trying change  all equal space that is upgraded over timejust not gonna happen
yeah making them harder to use counts as love not supported
nonsense 5lvl and require drone spec to 5 liang
sentry drone dps is fine so reduce sentry drone dps by 91 and add 2 damagelevel of spec skill result  no change in sentry dps upon training racial drone spec v
you can beat him just takes a cepter or two we nailed one off of docking radius and he died in a few moments as reinforcements showed up because he was dumb and thought it would be fun to assign fighters to  mails the moment we got a damage note from the fighter hitting us we all warped to the station from where we were aggressing his friends on gate
confirming that grath is a moron
you are all moronssupported great idea
wouldnt a better fix be to simply make it so that undocking carriers have a pseudomwd effect on them greatly increased speed thrust and mass for a short period meaning the carrier effectively kicked out of redocking range ideally by 10km the upside is that a solution like this doesnt  over logistics cruisers
dont really see how my proposal screws over logistics ships i merely want logistics ships to be committed to the fight like any other ship involved in the fight logistics cruisers when repping should have to be in corpalliance with the pilot its repping in empire and it should also have a 60 second aggro timer like other ships involved in the fighting doi merely commented on this fact because particularly in empire wars which have all but died you have people with several neutral logistics cruisers in newb corps there to rep themselves essentially making them invulnerable
i think ccp needs to shelve incarna and start concentrating on really fixing all the various things which are rough or broken lag for large space battles whatever that entails needs to be eliminated t3 ships need to be expanded all the little things like fonts interface issues ect should be addressed in the next expansion to make the game work betterat some point we need them to take ownership of what theyve already accomplished and make it all work better because i dont feel its really worth the subscription price right now i certainly dont feel that way when i sit in a system for 2 hours and nothing cycles use the opportunity to add more pretty things too like formations and some ship redesigns
supportedbut its not going to happen as we all know ccps position regarding new features vs polished quality
not supported as we already know assigning more people to do the same task does not get the task accomplished any faster or better once youve already optimized the process
are we down to 12 months yet
stop being reasonable
you saw the troll topic about unity on general 
half supporting the opon the one hand i greatly appreciate on how ccp started to make more smaller hotfixes which improved the gameplay you dont need to wait 6 month to see some change and probably get disappointed when youre desired fix is not among the changes deleting waypoints while in space is such a changeon the other hand game design implementations like introducing new ships should remain for expansions in short stuff which was introduced with an expansion must be continued and implemented regulary with hotfixes new stuff can be introduced with an actual expansionthe important thing is that ccp must plan resources for the hotfixes and not only for the next expansion and then cry we have no people for that right now
well being as the idea seems to be somewhat difficult to grasp ive been spending some time fleshing it out and actually constructing the system thats really ccps job but i figure its the only way ill be able to properly represent it and get some feedback
bump this is a great idea i also feel it should be expanded to all pos structures i run 13 poses 10 with reactions at the moment and to be honest it all needs an overhaul i would settle for this little fix for now though i would also like to see what is in my corp hangars at the pos through corp assets but that may be asking to much
thanks for the bump guys been a while since this was at the top
lately i have been lagging a lot i think you are clearly being lazy and not upgrading the servers can you please do this so that i can bring even more people i dont see anything wrong with this do youif you can not do this please make the game free to play because it is not fun unless i can keep pouring limitless numbers of people into the same gridthank you
obvious troll is obvious
more fiber stronger coffee makes you pooprelieves lag
if its so ing obvious how stupid your exact opinions are why do you keep them
wtb your bs fleetsedit wh space live therereally is it such a bad thing a 10 second delay would do a fair bit to combat isk farming ops from macro programs or are that many people using these programs that makes this a terrible idea yeah it is setting up for a gank but it actually makes 00 somewhat dangerous to live in againto be fair it realistically does provide a chance for creating fights ever tackle a carrier running an anomaly chances are unless your gang is stupid big you will get a response fleet that will attempt to put together a fleet to save it that probably wouldnt have formed up otherwise hide and dock 10 seconds really isnt that long it just changes from hitting warp to pos to having to align out and doing it then
i already do edit bring back the old dscanner ccp
best way would be that covert ops ships do not appear in local at all until they decloak and give that a 2 second delay to allow for transition from gate cloaksurprise strikes need to be a valid tacticas far as ganking ratters goes why would you even need delayed local for that just get an alt in a random alliance and roam the area that is occupied by them and their blues can only recommend this approach it is hilariously easy to get the alt in and they have no chance to see it coming
so now not only do you get to afk cloak no one gets to know that you even entered system to afk cloak how bout when you jump though a gate a lil pop up box shows up and asks if you want a hulk or equivalent isk value pve bs km just added by the game when you click one your weapons disable permanently for your stay in system and there is no no thanks option not answering triggers unstoppable self destruct
duh if you dont see a cloakyship in local to begin with u dont have to worry about them afk cloakers now would u 
you would have to worry all of the time as it stands right now i at least get to go theres a neut in system and press dscan if nothing shows up thats out of place i live in a system where all celestials are within 145 i know that hes a cloaky if the method im speaking against gets implemented you could put together a 100 man bomber gang and pop everything in system simultaneously some how i see even pvp people complaining about that one all it would take is 1 cyno a titan and boom spike the 020 battles going on with a couple hundred bombers that the reds dont get to have any idea are there until they light up the sbu or whatever fcs would not have any defense i can think of against thisif you want to implement a system like that fine but then implement a counter such as a mod for the hub that makes you always visible or one that disables cloaks for non alliance you dont get to be invincible
i think thats the point you are not in hisec there is supposed to be a constant element of danger if there isnt then the whole risk vs reward argument goes out the window
a 510s delay allows a scout to load system and do a quick scan to find a target before they have a chance to initiate warp it wont cloak a fleet as the 30s session change timer will ensure everyone appears in local an aligned ratter will still be more than able to warp away to safety if an enemy lands on grid so you dont need to spam dscan all the time you just need to align also if you warp into the belts and anomalies at range itll be a lot harder for an enemy to tackle you this is not game breaking at the same time im not sure it will solve much accept punish the lazy ratters bots will employ the methods i just suggested and will typically stay safe
i havent been playing long but wanted to know has there been a khanidamarr civil war in the game mostly i want to know because i tend to fly the khanid ships when possible preferring the armor resists and rocketshamtorpedo ships it just seemed that a civil war would be a great way to introduce new ships and tech and all of the major factions would be involved the caldari dont want to lose an ally to the other two factions and minmartar and the gallante would welcome the opportunity for a new friend also i would love it if they introduced a laser that would push out therm as primary and em as secondary damage with the crystal only modifying the damage output
stopped reading right there have you taken the time to read any of the backstory chronicles
first off this is the wrong forum to post this insecond there is a crystal that does that heres an idea look at all the modules and ammo and weapons and whatnot through the market show info on each one then get back to the forums
1 wrong forum2 im an amarrian pilot as well and even im insulted by this post beyond all reason a laser that pushes therm and em are you joking i mean seriously you really dont know
yes i am aware that crystals do both but if you read carfuly you will find i reverced the order of damage and yes the con does do even therm and em the idea that this is the incorrect forum for this is valid how ever and i apologize for that
youre certainly something but more akin i fear to something i find on the sole of my shoe and try to sc off with a twig
itt people attempt to pass on their opinions as factlolin hard so who will be the first to call the op a troll today
supported
not supportedafk cloaking is a good strategic tactic for keeping your enemies on their toes denying them the simple pleasures of ratting mining etcit is also a good tactic for peeing of war targets fantakraut another alternative since the issue is not that someone is cloaked but rather that they are essentially playing the game while not being at the keyboard introduce a simple timeout on the eve client no mouse andor keyboard movement within say an hour ewarp and log the character out of the gameare you mad who the fk is going to pay for a game that logs them out after being afk for an hour
i could be wrong as i dont play it but doesnt wow kick after like 30 minutes and that has 10 million paid accountsnot as if that matters anyways because they are still in system anyways and a cov ops cloaker can just mash the cloak button the second they come out of login black screen so there is no way to catch them there either your only shot really is to do all of the stuff you do in system in the hidden belts and anoms so you can maybe catch them while they are dropping probes if you are lucky and they are dumb not to check dscan or just dont care as its a tad difficult to probe something that small that fast plus if they put themselves on a ballistic path if you do scan them when they see you leaving warp in their area they are just going to cloak and revector or warpim fine with that bit they are supposed to be hard to catch and im sure most of the forums will agree with me there its when they are impossible to catch is the issue at handanother way to fix this would to be to give the hulks and what not a decent chance against cov ops stuff as it stands there is no way short of having to burn a third account to fight this one i already pretty much have to have a main in a hulk and an alt in a hauler for it to be viabletake the arazu example now you want me to burn another 375 million or so per month 23 months of inactivity while the third guy trains and 57 times the isk per ship just to try and ward off your lil frigate even then if you have the chance to pop my 200 million isk hulk if it takes trading a 30 million isk bomber you are going to do it so that argument is invalidalso since people like to maybe mine more then one belt at a time you are asking that per belt you realize as if i happen to have an arazu the guy the next belt over does not you are just going to go pop him because he isnt blowing 375 per month too he will be dead before my arazu could respond when you uncloak 30 km away bomb and two volleyso if my corp  alliance has 3 belts going to defend against you we are dropping 125 billion per month or 416 million per day aka more then it cost me to cynojam jumpbridge cynogen and supercapital construct a systems ihub by 86 million per day as they cost 20 10 2 and 1 mil per day as i have no way of doing a pay by minute plan or anything like that to ccp suddenly the ihub mod to turn off cloaking doesnt seem that bad to people i bet when we take a non nerf option and look at it from an isk standpoint
you greedy little bears get some proper defencework together and grow some ballsand stop making afk cloaky whining threads ffsme cloaks up again and goes back to work
1 wow is also divided into hundreds of realms separate from each other because it wasnt designed to handle 10000 active players on one server2 wow is designed to be played while active because if u afk in a bg u get kicked same with an instance3 wow  eve4 if ure gonna compare it to wow like u think its so much better actually know what ure talking about first or better yet go to wow if u like it so much1 kinda hard to be doing all that while theyre afk somaybe theyre not2 its not impossibleu just dont wanna try because u think ure entitled to 100 safetyin 00the 100 safety that doesnt even exist in high secdont fly what u cant afford to lose this is 00 after allwowlemme get this straightu lost your hulk to only one bomber thats your fault because even the hulks hiding in high sec can take more damage than whats inflicted by a bomb so your argument is invalid because u assumed 00 is 100 safeyes its called picking your targets much like how your fc calls primaries im surprised ure not familiar with that by now in a fleet fight r u gonna shoot the drake that no one else is shooting and can outrecharge your damage completely or r u gonna focus fire on your fleets primary target get some perspective before u post cause news flashits not all about u
continued from last postomg 00 expenses with 00 rewards blasphemy seriously htfua blob shouldnt the endall to everything because it encourages the stupidity and laziness that ure exhibiting right now u still have your structures ure still cranking out 00level isk and im sure ure blobbing your way up the killboards riskfree too like any other alliance your issues r 1 u think 00 should be 100 safe when ure hiding behind your blob 2 u cant handle 1 loss and 3 someone else actually fighting back and winning and unlike u that someone uses his brain so he doesnt have to hide behind 100 to accomplish something deal with it and if u cant handle 00 then gtfo
im not going to post your kill board as it will probably get snipped but for people watching this thread suffice to say she has 88 exhumers racked up 22 battleship losses caused by concord and a whole 8 kills in 00 all of which were on gates like p3n ecp and mo this player lives in high sec and doesnt know what shes talking about her experience with blob warfare comes from omg i jumped into a gate campmy killboard i dont pvp that much i build things for my corp oh and if you are a sov holder your people blob too oh wait youre not your alliance has 19 members and according to your kb you have a whole 8 kills in 00 where you went into the camped high  low sec gate systems trying to get lucky come talk when you want to use your 00 mainto the part about wow i know how their server works that wasnt the point i was making he said who would pay for a game that has afk kicks i said 10 million people and gave an exampleto not flying what i cant afford to lose and the damage remark insurance payout on those bs must be nice to have t1 platinum its not that i cant afford to lose the hulk its more that should i have to pick up a third account to protect myself as the gankers say i should my argument is that i can not possibly stand a chance in a hulk so to belay you killing me i have to train another account and pay 375 mil for a plex or 15 bucks per monthmy hulk with all level five skills can lock at 285 km and at most can get a 13k tank on it and still fit strip miners and that is with using a 50 million isk pithi b type boosteryour bomber can bomb from thirty and shoot t2 damage torps from 54 for 600 dps the correct bomb will hit me for 8000 minus sig damage reduction which you have me target painted to avoid volley damage is 5164 from the torps so after the first shot you have done 13164 damage against my 13043 tank since you can be invisible while lining this up you warp in align to a celestial that i am between you and it and you get a worry free 200 mil isk kill the risk factor drops even more if you do this in a cloaky interdiction nullified tengu or other t3to the fc comment even with the small kb i posted ive been around the block and know how it works your solution is invalid since you are not picking say me at one side of a belt or the other hulk same belt 100 km away that i can respond to and switch targets when the mining director says to your argument is akin to a real pvp player going im not going to that system where i might die im going to this other system where there can be no response to my actionnot all players have the structures in 00 they are mostly controlled by the alliance leads to do things like pay out when a titan goes boom and things like that all i have is my mining laser the isk i make and the knowledge that my corp or alliance will pay out my loss when i protect it in a fleet fight
yet most of my kills especially the 00 ones were solo and as such took more time and effort even the ones that led to grinding sec status than any of your blob kills so exactly what gives u credibility to discredit my or anyone elses killboard when 1 u hide behind 50100 on their kills and 2 ure a selfproclaimed nullbear nothingure just trying to hide the fact that without everyone around u u couldnt accomplish anything especially your blob kills cause ure incapable of doing so u can drop the tough actno ones falling for it an example u knew nothing about yet u tried to pass it off as a valid one when its not ignorance ftl1 yes it is because t2 ships have risk to their added rewards if u cant handle that risk then dont use them2 or u can use own head for once and come up with your own solution instead of being an idiot by listening to the ones killing uyes cause risking a t3 drops the risk even further right and hows this any different than any blob gate camp that your alliance is more than capable of doing well other than the fact that hes going into the heart of enemy territory alone just for one target while your blob just sits at the gate and shoot fish in a barrel at everything that comes through oh right cause a blob should always win 100 of the time is that what ure getting at1 actually u dont know how it works because with pvp ure gonna take a loss sooner or laterdeal with it 2 and hows that quote any different than how u and your alliance functions ure scared of taking one loss so u blob up so to minimize the chance of a response against u in case u didnt notice uve just summed up yourself and your alliance in a nutshell
and yet u talk smack like ure an actual pvper instead of the nullbear that u r and u think that 100 vs 1 is pvp yet 1 vs 1 is not now ure just mad cause your hulk that u knew full well u were risking in 00 got blown up because ure under this ridiculous notion that a blob would and should guarantee 100 safety in 00 so no u dont know anything about what ure doing especially as a nullbearu just take your 00 rewards for granted as if u were back in high sec and assume that your blob is your concord guess what theyre not risk vs rewardif u cant handle 00 even with 100 babysitting u 237 then gtfo
i missed the bit about how they achieve this i am in a low sec corp and do l5s there regularly there are afk cloakers there and guess what they do not a ing thing apart from cloak and be afk oh and get killed when they do start something which is rare i might add if youre too scared to do stuff because someone is not even at their keyboard maybe low sec or 00 isnt for you
and ive successfully reduced the troll to a twelve year olds posting ability im not really talking smack here im just pointing out that i live in 00 you live in high sec and to come talk when you know what its like i dont do the big blobs unless i have to which is why im averaging about 2 kills a month the system that i mine in has maybe 15 people in it at any given time and guess what they are mining too the only times you see big 100 person groups is when someone comes to attack our sovereignty such as what is happening in 020 in geminate your style of 1 v 1 is battleship vs hulk which is really 1 v 0 from a pvp perspective it would be the same thing if i had our titan now dead because of 020 cloak outside the belt and wait for you then when you decloak he does too and doomsdays you i can take about as much damage in a anything vs my hulk fight as you can take the three million damage golden beam of pain and live though iteven if i have 100 guys sitting in the belt with me if you were to do it right with your bomber we could not catch you yet you could kill me ive actually seen this happen in those 100 v whatever blob fights you are saying not with hulks but against little things like interdictors that have approx the same amount of healththanks for the tears and when you want to argue about what goes on in big boy land maybe go live there for a while instead of believing everything you read here
1 and yet this whole time u have the listening skills of said 12year old2 ure pointing out that 00 should be safer than even high sec just for u just because u live in it as a carebear3 all of your kills were with blobs besides the pods but under your logic they dont count anyway so yeah its obvious u pretty much have to blob all the timefirst one is 1vs0 and u said its the same thing as a titan doomsday kill translation theyre both still pvp ignorance and stupidity ftloh right cause 100  100 winning right but go ahead keep crying about how your blob isnt the concord crutch u can always fall back on when u actually face the slightest amount of risk in 001 who wants 100 safety in big boy land u do2 whos crying about losses in big boy land u r3 whos crying because his expensive carebear ship was touched by a violence boat in big boy land u r4 who needs to spend tons of isk just so he wouldnt be touched again in big boy land u do5 who wants his blob to protect him in big boy land in the same way concord does in high sec u do6 so in actuality while u carebear it up in big boy land u want high sec brought to u7 translation u dont wanna feed the troll anymore cause uve lost but hey if hiding behind everyone else makes u feel big then go ahead just watch out for the soloerswe can really kick the crap out of your epeen but im sure u know that already but plz continue with the tears thoughid really love to hear it
in 00 people tend to spread out the lack of missions make it so we cant all ball into one system and have the profit margin be there like you guys can vale of the silent 24 hour npc kills if you look at the third and bottom half of the second quadrant of that map is majesta space there are 2700 people in which like any alliance probably 12 are alts so you have maybe 1500 actual members spread across about 45 utilized systems for a population density of 33 per system the alliance is about 60  40 euro to us which gives about 17 logged in in the morning and 15 or so in the evening this works as thats about all that you can support between sanctums havens and normal belt running the bigger difference though is ship fittings i dont know about now but when i ran level 5s you had to pretty much pvp fit with logi support because of the plethora of neut batteries this isnt the case with 00 stuff miners will tend to fit a racial tank to fit the rats that are going to try to kill them while ratters will do the same thing but trade the strong tank you have for more dpsso already our ships are weak like i explained above a hulk can be one volleyed by a bomber unless that bomber is the same type as the racial rat in the area and i know in gurista space the rats love to sensor jam and warp scramble so if you follow mr solo battleship around and wait until you see a couple rats with 3 word names attacking him theres a good chance he can not run away and can not attack you back when you pounce we are not fit for pvp in those ships its the equivalent of a level 4 mission runner fit for the most part optimized because we know that the rats will always do the same damage typesoh and bubbles in 00 happen on regular basiss in 3 places on the low sec gates which tend to be camped so people cant get in in big fights or on gates where we use them to give the hulks time to bail to station  pos if a fleet comes after them this is only done at the end where there is 1 door in
who is weexactly
im not saying that it should be safer im saying that cloaky guys only ever maul ships that cant fight back if you want to come visit in the dominixes you use to kill the guys in high sec to fight my hulk i assure you my alt will kill you single handedly and not even in a titan my kills were made in fleet fights against fleets of the same size for the most part so my blob was met with another equal blob this idea of blob vs 1 you and a lot of other high sec care bears have is conceitedis a 1 v 0 fight pvp when i cant possibly win or even force a draw its the same thing as running a mission where you cant die theres never 100 in a system cept for sov fights and the alliance staging system figure 10  30 topsoh and if you are going to say that i lost a hulk in 00 you might want to make sure that ive actually lost a hulk in 00 the only one ive lost was in ibura a 5 before i ever went to 00 people doing anom running in ships that arent capital sized
wtf was all that about all you had to do is answer the question simpleand as far as all the knee jerk over defensive diatribe wow just wow
translation come here and face me alone in this ship i can blob u with everyone else too cause im too lazyactually its sending the 00 and 10 alts back to where they belong as for your losses they were from small gangs and sometimes solo pilots so yeah might tone down that tough act cause face it ure anything but yes it is especially since u compared it to doomsday kills its just like any pve ship blown up anywhere and in any way doomsday gate camp blob suicide gank its player versus player derpmy point still stands ure still incapable of dealing with a loss and therefore want 00 to be safer than high sec and ure crying about it on an afk cloaking thread when your problem has nothing to do with afk cloakingthen why r u crying so much about something thats never happened to u cause this threads about afk cloaking not active cloaking oh wait i knowu lost them on an altu just wanna save face and not look even worse than u do right now by not posting with him hahaha
so long as i have some way any way to potentially flush out and chase a cloaker im inapproval go
really dumb suggestion the drake is balanced enough that you dont know how to fit something doesnt mean its overpowered or not balanced enough
how to balance the drake1 remove all med slots but one they need to have a mwd2 remove all low slotsfixed
nerf all tier 2 bcs they all have too many slots too much ehp and theyre too easy to fit they step on the toes of bs and cruisers too much while obsoleting closerange hacs and tier 1 bcs theyre too good at too many things
drones generate very little load on the servers aside from being launchedrecovereddestroyed they generate no inventory calls they merely need an orbit vector while cycle firing which requires no server calls from the client that need be processed even if you should attempt to command your drones in an effort to cause calls to the server since when do drones ever listen i wouldnt be surprised if in terms of load on the server a drone were equivalent to about a single missle
well perhaps what we need to work out here are ingenious ways to lessen this loadthen again we could always just remove drones from the game altogether imagine that  storm
blob will grow until lag is again achieved kill blob with aoe
soermforgive me if im being stupid but to take a system youd have to warp in and rat  miningyoud have nowhere to dock nowhere to rearm and repair nowhere to drop off any loot and absolutely no reason to actually fight
posting to confirm holding unlimited sov with a single fleet is stupidfix who knows
i agree with some of your points primarily the main one the sovereignity system as it stands is somewhat useless and overpowered im not saying sbus have too much ehp as ive already disagreed on that point already use fleets and dreadnoughts as intended and they will go down fast 112 hours is fast what is overpowered about sov is the mechanics that hold it in place the simplicity with which it is maintained this guarantees all large alliances have the ability to dominate sovereignity the fact that they maintain sov in more systems than they have the fleets to maintain only supports this and accentuates the point so activity based is goodheres a solution using your op as a basic foundation which i am quickly formulating as i postrather than remove sbus from the game make them smaller and more easily deployed while changing the impact they have on taking down sovereignity systems system activity by the sovereignity holding alliance would generate a point system which would be used as a timer against the sbus attempt at overriding system control the more points generated by the sovereignity holders alliance the longer it will take for the sbus to break the sov in an inactive system the sovereignity holder has less time to deploy forces to take down the sbus in this case sbus should be reduced in ehp and made destructible by a small fleet in a short timepreviously suggested changes to allow for sov renting contracts would be employed and affect the point system similar to treaties a treaty system would be developed as well and friendly neighbours could help you develop and maintain sov rent holders would generate less points than the sov holder and treaty holders would generate even less than the rentersupgraded systems would generate slightly more points with regard to the bonuses applied though they would be required to be fully upgraded to generate as much as a 10 bonus systems with stations would only recieve the benefit of generating points strictly related to the sov holders or renterstreaty holders use of the stations facilitiespoints generated would be for as suggested completing complexessites ratting and similar activities every downtime a check would be made for points generated that day the lack of which would cause the system to drop a certain percentage of points points generated by a renter or treaty holder could be used to contest the sov holders claim they would apply against currently generated points including their ownan example of a point generation system for ratting would be bounty claimed by xplayer of xalliance is flagged and generates 1 point of sov maintenance every point is assigned an attribute for xplayer of xalliance with multiple points stacking spawning a site would generate a point as would despawning it through completion each asteroid mined would also generate a point as it despawns for xplayer of xalliance individuals without alliances or rental contracts do not generate points one way or another treatys can only be applied to alliances which limits their use for sov system exploitationsov renter and treaty holder kills against sov holder enemy alliances similar to treaty system would also generate points for the holding of sovereignity to prevent sov takeover exploitation using this system only the sov holders executor corp directors and ceo will be able to see the point system attributesenemy alliances their renters and friendly treaty holders will be able to generate points against sov through use of an enemy system the sov holders renters and treaty holders can apply their generated points by becoming enemies they may then also generate additional points as enemies to help take down the current sov holders claimsupported with revisions and suggestions
read againif you want to take sov you can just move in with pvpers deny them ratting which causes fights if they want to keep the system but arround the clock instead of only at some timers where the goal is to bring biggest blob and take over their station if they cant do anything you get a bunch of pvp kills you fly arround in their space and got the station you get sov but if you just move out again they can get it back quite easy you can still attack sov by pooring in your blob but you cannot defend it by blobbing 4 timers
additions would befees applied on the declaration of enemy alliances and treaties which would be a monthly maintenance fee and require continual upkeep they would also have a 24 hour timer to take effect or to be dissolved points cannot be generated to counter sov without declaring the sov holder an enemy this would help small sov holding alliances sbus may be utilized to counter sov without declaring the sov holder an enemy but the points lost would not affect the attackers ability to claim sov they would also be greatly reduced in effectsbus would effectively kick in the 24hour cycle early and cycle it every 5 minutes for an enemy or every 20 minutes for a neutral attacker for the sake of the sov holder points will be generated when aggressing the attackers corp or alliance in system again prevent exploitation each kill would generate points to counter the loss generated by the sbus this would cause the sbus to become ineffective by preventing the cycling from reducing points points generated would be minimalthis would affect enemy attempts to counter sov claims on a system however the enemy attacker and treatyrenter allies would reduce the sov by killing sov holder and allies ships in combat points would be calculated every 24 hours awarding sov to the alliance with the highest points should the sov claim change the sbus would come down providing they have not already been destroyed in a battle sbus would also gain immunity to damage while sov is being actively contested this means that in a battle where sov is contested there is no need to deploy forces to defend themexample alliance a sov holder w6000 points lost 4500 points to sbus and 1500 points to ship losses in battle while gaining 1250 points through enemy kills in the same battle retains sovereignity with 1250 points at downtime the following day he or she encourages his alliance members to run sites to regenerate sov claim in that system during the day they manage to generate 1200 sov points through ratting mining and other means later in the day alliance b the attacker returns and redeploys sbus while simultaneously destroying alliance as mining fleet and gaining an additional 150 points alliance as ratting forces regroup and provide intel on the enemy fleet allowing alliance a to respond with an appropriate force of equal measure the ensuing battle causes the loss of 1600 points by alliance a and 1830 points in kills against alliance b the sbus were allowed to cycle for 20 minutes however while the alliance bs fleet prevented sov maintenance prior to battle maintenance prevention was done through the following means alliance bs fleet deployed gangs in all the belts and anomalies in system preventing ratting mining or other activities for that time while gaining 130 points through ratting and despawning sites in the process alliances as remaining forces in system were not strong enough to counter this and simply watched and assessed for the duration two of their ships were caught in the process and alliance b generated another 5 points to counter sov withcurrently that leaves alliance a with 1395 points not counting losses to the sbus cycling 4 times each cycle by an enemy sbu without contest causes the loss of 300 sovereignity claim points this means alliance a has only 195 points remainingalliance a proceeds to redistribute their forces to belts and anomalies while setting up defensive gate camps on all points of entry this takes 5 minutes more or less and is followed by 15 minutes of ratting generating 85 points for alliance a they now have 280 pointsalliance bs allies who were supposed to show up in the last battle also enemies have decided to wait and contest sov for themselves the ensuing battle and downtime grants them sovereignity
have sov be dynamic like incursionsfaction warfaremajor objective will still be ihubtcuoutposts but sov must be weakened by exploiting sites in nearby systems first chip away with many small gangs then coup de grace with cap fleets
you are not being stupid you just havent lived out of a pos yet most likely if you trust your corp you can pretty easily live out of a pos ours in scalding pass i was in cosmic vaccuum cleaners had 1 lab 2 ship maintence arrays a hangar array and a ammo assembly array just off hauler spawns we could make all the ammo we ever needed we had 1 jump freighter to move loot when the cha got full and the corp had like 20 carriers out of 35 pilots so it was never hard to find someone to move a ship down if you needed the corp even paid for the fuel with the taxesyou still would have to fight for the system as another alliance would want it what op is more proposing is that if say each system needed sustained mil 4 or something with a grace period of a few days for issues like wars to go help a friend or something the huge alliances such as razor or solar fleet would not be able to control as much space as they can now allowing little guys to come in and fill the voids instead of being forced to join a mega alliance or go homethere would have to be something like the old capital system system in play though if we were only going to give a few days grace from dropped levels solely so this doesnt accidentally nerf super constructionproblem with this is the defender will just wait for you to bring the cap fleet to the final battle and knock you out with supers if you are a small group trying to take a system from a big one

if you really want to mass mail them you need a form letter no i dont require any thanks im just helpful like that check those that apply
ah heres the cheese to go with all the whine posts thank you mittani
your character needs to be recustomized
so when do we get the results the csm section of the eveo site is useless as ever
i believe that this goon toon is the best csm candidate that is kind of painful since i believe his morale and the morale he speak to his goon fellows are far bellow my own still if one raises above these things and realize that this bad morale only relates to ingame issues and not game issues giving him my vote was the only reasonable thing to do we need csms to look at what the problems are with eveonline today and not play style this mittani toon seems like he got a very good idea on what really needs to be fixed with this game or rather what the horrible ideas that will ruin it is
and that is why babelfish will never replace human translators

i for one believe there should be more than 34 tactics that work in this great game vile rat gets my vote
supported for graphics changeon a side note this effect could be better achieved by adding a jerk and perhaps a snap constant 3rd and 4th order differentiation of position rather than changing the acceleration constant of warp

this is silly and would destroy an important skill for legitimate traders if you want to nerf the margin trading scam change the way escrow is handled such that even if the order is halffilled it remains backed by escrow to 23 of its value at which point the problem will become selfpolicingnot that scamming is illegitimate but you know what i mean
its even more simple force fulfill the order and let the buyer go into negative figures if necessary no other orders can be set up while the wallet isnt balanced out a legit trader want to have money on his accountwallet under every circumstance just have more liquid money to trade with not to go into negative figures
sigh two main issues with what you suggest first if your balance is in the negative you cant liquidate anything to cover the bill market actions have a cost so you would have to rely on alts charity selling gtcs or direct trading to gain money basicly you would  up the game for people using margin trading in order to protect a few s from a clever scam where they even get to keep the item they are trying to sellsecond if you force negative values you allow the creation of money from nothing people have alts and friends and you can buy a new account by a plex so your idea is just a huge exploit waiting to happen that can seriously unbalance the entire eve economy even if you dont allow biomassing of characters with negative wallet that is still 3 characters that i can use to exploit this and if i manage to create anything above the price of a plex i can keep doing it indefinitely in ever increasing amounts the funniest part of your solution is that kneejerkers like you are willing to risk ruining the entire economy and the fluid working of the market as a solution to a minor issue in the trading system that doesnt propably even have a measurable effect on the market as a wholeim actually supportive of a reasonable measure that would fix this sideeffect of the skill but your and ops solutions are just god awfully bad ones if i had to choose between them and keeping things as they are id keep things as they are and throw both of your horrible ideas to the garbagenot supported
not supported the skill is fine you just need to play smarter
funny how people who use stuff like  sigh  and retards behave in a manner which brings the same keywords or pictures to my mind about them thats the whole intention next to the intention not to screw the market prices with values which arent reflect real market prices nope you cant biomassing would be doable only with a wallet of at least 0 isk gosh how old are you 14 you are definately not mature if you use vocabulary like this have you been beaten alot on school breaks looks like it i am really feeling sorry for you at least you are admit that it is an issue go on  proof me and the readers wrong show us you are capeable of something constructive instead of behaving like a wow playershow us your solution to the issue that the skill is for scamming if you dont have one id suggest you go somewhere deep null instead of ing that you would loose your scamming abilities
highly not supported i use long running buy orders a lot and i dont like to have the isk all tied up and with the skill i can work with the capital before it is actually required
look everyone loves a sandbox but the fact is like all places with sand cats will poop in it and bullies will kick it in your face also ill get it in my butt crack even though i never actually sat down in the bloody stuffing sandwe should have had a playdough box insteadseriously though if you want blob control just adapt some of those system wide incursion protocols to fleet battles above a certain number of ships in a system start reducing the resistances and dps of all ships until numbers begin to hurt the battle instead of help
what he said
just so that its clear youre saying that people playing eve and making their own political ingame decisions are children and ccp is mommy and daddy and has to stop them from making the wrong ingame political decisions do you really not see anything wrong with that
couple of things ccp is a business theyre in business to make money turning control of their business over to customers is just about the most stupid idea ive ever heard of course ccp thinks they control the game they do and within certain parameters they should its the only way to prevent the game from becoming an unbalanced mess it literally is ccps job to do thisthe csms function is to act as a liaison between players and ccp if ccp sees a csm weighted with a certain type of player theyre not going to forget about the other players and what those other players want those players who arent represented by the csm and many of whom dont even come to these forums you know the people who just want to play the game instead of getting into politicssome are predicting csm6 will be heavily weighted with northern coalition candidates this would obviously be an unbalanced representation of the player base ccp would have to be crazy to take the perspective of such a group and give no thought to the majority of their player baseas far as such a csm snapping a paper over the nose of ccp if i were a ccp staffer id be indulgently smiling or just plain laughing my keester off any csm delegate who goes to iceland with that attitude had better take antacids with them its gonna be a bumpy ridewindjammer
as the sole purveyor of the sandbox it is well within their rights abilities and responsibilities to exchange the sand with gravel if they believe the users experience will improve by such changenull is broken vast majority realises this the status quo has failed in just about everything so something has to change
ive been watching the replies and im not surprised by them i am surprised that nobody has picked up on the lack of viable npc null sec with the exception of venal and stainsnot to surprising most nap complaint are made against the nc which currently controls 5 to 6 regions and is occupied by 10 sov holding alliances in contrast the drone russians control 14 regions with around 11 sov holding alliances it would be interesting to see which regions have the highest player occupancy after all didnt ccp want to get more people into null secpl have been able to successfully fight the major alliances with a far smaller alliance so it is naps that are the issue or is it game mechanics since the introduction of the new sov mechanics offensive warfare has become a nightmare the huge node breaking battles are a result of the sov system not naps whereas before ever moon in a system or in the case of sov 4 constellation had to be contested now its a case of attackerreinforce ihub shield wait 24hrs reinforce ihub armour wait 24hrs defenders blot out the sun for the final reinforcement attacker can jump in dies to laga bit simplistic perhaps but thats the new sov system and its the problem not naps its all or nothing in one big battle so to the dev that said why be blue to everyone around you i say join a null sec alliance and see the results of your sov systema couple of final points which others will probably disagree with there needs to be more viable npc nullsec all eve not just stains and venalfinally remote repping including carriers yes it can allows a smaller gang to fight a larger gang but its also why the lag doesnt clear because nothing dies personally id like to see it gone and ships dying in flames and local clearing after a few battles of annihilation blobs wont be a problem
no sov mechanics are broken but come on lets not play games here what people are really objecting to are not game mechanics but the metagame whereby certain people decide to cooperate with certain other people that cant be fixed because its not broken that cant be balanced because its not unbalanced thats the game youre playing in which players can create whatever political alliances and oppositions theyd like within the game or as ccp puts it eve is not the game for you if you cant deal with that fact well thats an interesting claim lets see what ccp has to say about it oh ccp says youre wrong sorry they also say that eve isnt the game for you sorry about that would you perhaps like to queue up to farm some epic purple loot
baw the rules and tools interfere with my adventure ccp need fix plox1111
youre selling marketing from people you dont trust finn youll have to try harder
what was that i couldnt hear ccps official description of what its game is designed to be over all the hand waving
00 is not a sandbox atm if you build a sandcastle it gets harder the largerhigher you build it right well considering there are 25 gigantic sandcastles owning almost all of 00 atm it clearly isnt that way the difficulty should be exponential ideally when youre having a 50 000 man coalition it should be 10 000 times harder or atleast a lot harder how you would measure difficulty is another question than having a 500 or 5000 alliancecoalition not the other way around this is the issue with 00 ccp not wanting all of 00 to be divided by 2 blobs is not the issue as you seem to believe
gl in wow to all the nc folks planning to ragequit over thisi hear malganis is a good server with a huge stagnant population too they even have their own goons youll be right at home
rather obviously it is players are allowed to enter or leave 00 as they see fit and to work with or against whoever they want while theyre there  please tell me that you didnt just compare sandbox gameplay in an mmo with physically building a structure made out of crushed rocks and if you think its not harder to manage a coalition of tens of thousands rather than a small corp youre simply not aware of what it takes to run an empire which is the problem right there either its a sandbox and ccp sets up the rules and then players play the game the way they see fit and cooperate with who they want and fight who they want or its a themepark game and ccp decides what the rides are supposed to be ccp cant have it both ways and neither can we this is simply an absurdity you might as well drag out the canard where you deliberately misstate what riskreward means and then state that having more people in your fleet is better than having fewer so riskreward is being violated your claim is also arbitrary and subjective theres no actual reason why it should be game mechanics wise harder for 5 people to cooperate than 3 or 100 than 10 or 50000 than 5000 i think we all get it some people in the game prefer small fleets small alliances small combat engagements thats cool do whatever makes you happy we also understand that some of those people who prefer small things not only hate large things but want to alter game mechanics to stop people sandboxing and choosing to go towards the large fleets large engagements large alliances side of the spectrum but as ccp has pointed out eve is not the game for them there are some lovely instanced dungeons in some other games they even have elves
ccp makes the rules and they want the rules to be have your coalition but its gonna be a little harder than cake
i think its cute you dont see the smug pouring out of that statement or if you do that you have the  to type it anyhowccp is interjecting because coalitions are deciding what the rides are supposed to beregadless of how you use analogy to describe the sandbox they ccp obviously dont like the way things are going and as developers its their prerogative to take whatever action they see fit to alter the games course
i cant help but notice that all the complainer are either none null sec players or alts unwilling to post on their mainslarge alliances and coalitions built null sec without them their would be nothing in null sec to fight over those outposts didnt build themselves and small alliance would not have had the resources or the kahunas to do so too much risk there have been huge changes in null sec over the last few years alliance rise and alliances fall coalition form and dissolve but the whining goes on when one group does it better than another instead of learning to play the game better they ask for the rules to be changed i wonder how many of the people lobbying for these changes are actually ccp employees
i havnt seen tinfoil like this for a long time thank you
yes thats right everyone who disagrees with you works for ccpyou point out that your opposition in this thread are all posting on alts ill point out that anyone in favor of your point is nc amid the ramblings i think though im not sure youre talking about endgame you want ccp to ramp up performance to enable you to roflstomp or allow to live the rest of nulllow sec as you see fit effectively replacing ccps sandbox with ncs sandboxif thats the case and again im not sure i for one would rather ccp run my game than you
blahhh blaah blaahhh whine and complain if op bothered to read earlier blogs he would have seen the mention that ccp is adding 510 610 710 810 910s and more to 00 space so while you might not be able to have your static farm sites you are getting a whole new list of other stuff to go carebear inso quit yer ing they are giving you more than they are taking away
meh i moved my post to the feedback thread
ill believe it when i see it i mean drones and hybrids have only been broken what 2 3 years now
heres a list of blasterdrone boatsdronemyrmishtarcursesentinaldramielrattlesnakeblastermegahypevindivigilantdiemosbrutixtaranisddbothdomiishkurand these are the ships you think need a buff what else are you wrong about
good change imo maybe you can fight for one of those good systems hmmlooking at your alliance i guess not
oh man i dont have the heart to tell this guy anyone want to bring him up to speed on the upcoming changes to agents
hardly think those ships need a buff what needs fixed is the followingdrone ai is simply ed you ever try using them half the time they dont want to attack the target you tell them to and swap to a random enemy even better they still refuse to mwd to and from targets most of the time and even worse is that they slowboat 34 of the way there then mwd to and around and around the target making them unable to land a blowi am and always have been a dominix fanboy the last few problems with drones have made them terrible though they require more micromanagement than your average starcraft gameas for hybrids rails have a better dps than artybeams until you realize that their faster rof means all in highlag situations they have less range less alpha and their damage type is almost always tanked what ship has a kintherm hole really and yet they use more cap than arty which uses none and track worse than beams then you have blasters large blasters are mostly okay medium and small theyre a joke take an enyo for example  throw some t2 neutrons on there now orbit a cruiser under its guns at your optimal range of roughly 1km and see the tracking issues crop up god help you if your target is moving the bigger issue with blasters is even more blatant  the ships they are mounted on are some of the slowest in the game aside from i believe caldari ships and with scrams disabling mwds using blasters is just asking to fail horribly not to mention they are totally useless in largescale warfare because again their high rof is totally mitigated by lag shieldtmbefore you try to open your pie hole and say they are fine please for the love of all that is intelligent consider all the angles and all the reasons why something might be borked to all hell oh and im sure youll claim theyre good for pve no they arent i dont know of a single worthwhile npc that orbits within blaster range and guess what some of the better npcs web you good luck ever getting into range now yes you could use a kronos and have a 40km blaster range but i dont think a single ship should have to carry an entire weapon system especially when you consider that pulse lasers do nearly equal dps get dps on target faster hit more accurately and at far better ranges and autocannons while having slightly less dps hit far further and are cap freeso no hybrids are definitely not okay atm when artymegas are more common than railmegas thats a problem
it seems like we have been asking ccp to mix things up they just decided to throw an act of nature into the mix unpredictable and sure to shake things up a bitit will be interesting to see how this changes things upsetting the current balance is the usual outcome from my experience with natural disasterswe asked them to stop ignoring nullsec and it looks like they kinda heard us
i literally cant believe you just said the enyo has tracking issuesdo you actually want people to take you seriouslyhey guys im having trouble fitting a good passive tank on my drake whats the dealdrones are easy to use you are just used to hitting the one button while playing and buffing blasters would  up ship ballance beyond anything youve ever seen beforethe greatest irony is you are here complaining about something which is ballanced and fair you just cant figure out how to use it then you cry your eyes out that people say encouraging coalition warefare by removing consequences for massive napfests stagnates the gameyou have no idea of the contadictions cropping up here do you
its not blasters themselves that need the major buff well rebalance is a better word but the gallente ships specifically in the speedagility area
bump because we can all dream for hope
as i recently stated in another thread perhaps what they need to do is give a discouragement to having too many players on the field to fit this into the driving analogy if you cant start slowing down the asshats driving on your curvy road start adding road bumps to make them slow down or ruin their driving experiencemake it so that once a certain amount of players are on the field certain system wide effects begin to occur such as lowering of dps so say every 100 players above 500 you take away 10 of dps from all vessels its not a game breaker and it doesnt keep blobs from occurring but it does make it so that too large of numbers can become detrimental to the fight above and beyond just simple lag
bumpincreasing the amount of players that can be functional in a system at the same time should be of highest priority
if the eve forever video is to be believed  thread mission accomplished
better than making 00 virtually devoid of life
umoki think this is a good idea but i am not sure if you made a mistake in your post or not10 is as low as it goes to allow upgrades to change sec status by as much as 05 is just too much i am thinking you maybe meant 005 since you said and so on after 10i think its a decent idea but maybe it should be more like a max change of 01 sec status make it so that anything 00  01 spawn no sanctums or havens but using the max upgrade of the sec status could make those systems spawn 1 sanctum and 1 haven and go up from there by 1 for each sanct and haven for each 01 sec status if a system has a truesec status of 10 as a few do make that system spawn a max of 11 fully upgraded as a bonusheck i would say for each level of military make a sec status change of 005 for a total of 025 in sec status change this would give a system of 001 the sec status to have the 2 sancts and 2 havens
obviously it would cap at 10  however rethinking things im thinking the maximum change should be 25 which would be 05  level yes
in that casesupportedoh and please support my no boobies left behind initiative in my sig p
nods first post edited to reflect changed values 
i dont understand how the most basic tenants of economics can escape yousupply and demandpricing is sometimes determined by intersecting supply and demand on a pretty simple graph it looks something like an xwhat this means is that the price or what people are ready to do for it is dependant both on how much of it there is and how many people want itif everyone wants it the price will go up but if literally everywhere has it the price will dropthe most horrifying thing about your ridiculous argument is you think sanctums are yours by right well they friggin arnt sanctums are such a stupid mechanic to begin with and theres other ways to make isk like oh say belt ratting which people have entirely stopped doing since sanctums popped upgrow up and realise the game is not yours to say whats fair and what isnt or tomorrow i will post a longwinded post about how i should be given a ship that can grind 400m isk an hour anywhere any time with literally no risk to me at all everwait what is it you asked for again
you are obviously completely missing the point if it wasnt 1 in the morning i would explain to you how you know a lot less about economics and supply and demand than you think you do as it isi am too tired and i just want to sleep so i can wake up and see the backlash of this dev blog during the fanfest tomorrow
horrible idea there should be some unchangeable geographical traits which give reason for place x to be better than place y not matter what you do this causes conflictshowever the way theyre trying to achieve this in dev blog does not work and most likely even hurts the small alliances more than helpsthere is certain threshold of income you need to achieve to make some territory worth of living in the way theyre nerfing anomalies makes just some places worthless for those who rely on anomalies for income its better to move to hi sec and do level 4s in raven etcif theres large power blocks in eve it isnt because of anomalies they existed before them like blob warfare
sounds like you want all space to be bot space what else would be able to keep up activity to maintain such a massive boost in potential incomebetter to introduce an advanced plexgenerator to allow for spawning based on next security banddownside could be that it interferes with bridges and jammers so holder has to choose
dear wikipediawhat happens when the supply curve shiftswell im glad you asked miniginsupply curve shiftsmain article supply economicsan outward rightward shift in supply reduces the equilibrium price but increases the equilibrium quantityplease visit your user settings to reenable imageswhen the suppliers unit input costs change or when technological progress occurs the supply curve shifts for example assume that someone invents a better way of growing wheat so that the cost of growing a given quantity of wheat decreases otherwise stated producers will be willing to supply more wheat at every price and this shifts the supply curve s1 outward to s2an increase in supply this increase in supply causes the equilibrium price to decrease from p1 to p2 the equilibrium quantity increases from q1 to q2 as consumers move along the demand curve to the new lower price as a result of a supply curve shift the price and the quantity move in opposite directionsif the quantity supplied decreases the opposite happens if the supply curve starts at s2 and shifts leftward to s1 the equilibrium price will increase and the equilibrium quantity will decrease as consumers move along the demand curve to the new higher price and associated lower quantity demanded the quantity demanded at each price is the same as before the supply shift reflecting the fact that the demand curve has not shifted but due to the change shift in supply the equilibrium quantity and price have changedthe movement of the supply curve in response to a change in a nonprice determinant of supply is caused by a change in the yintercept the constant term of the supply equation the supply curve shifts up and down the y axis as nonprice determinants of demand changebut what does that mean if im edwell you see this means that if ccp made it more rare to find space with sanctums the equilibrium price will go up this means the people ready to do more will have to as opposed to pay the current equilibrium price this will create the conflict desired in 00so go rest your head on your pillow and wait for backlash by the little children who refused to take their meds
supported ccp wth were you thinking when you announced this blog it already takes long enough to get the money to pvp with unless this was a way for you to boost plex sales the idea was not well thought out
supported 100 ccp wtf
well im all for things being different across space but  i agree completely with this assessment the only problem is that ccp is very hypocritical on their different space is better argumentexample when ccp nerfed bombing hordes they say different space is okay so the players there made their space better with game mechanics in place by ccps argument in the latest dev blog other alliances would go wow dr is worth more now  we should try and take that space instead people complained that they were able to make more iskhour not that much more honestly therefore ccp nerfed it making space the worse than anyone else so in reality this is ccp motto on thiswe like to make space unequal and we get to pick and choose whoms space is worth lessi really have a problem with the statement of essentially worthless space will give new alliances a foothold a foothold into space they cannot afford to holdccp seems to have problems with the mega alliances controlling much of 00  fair enough if they wanted to fix that they would make it so you can upgrade awesome things because of sov example gate guns  guns for outposts and then make having sov in system really damn expensive then huge alliances could not and would not survive that simple but in reality they don t want to get rid of the big alliances  thats why they dont do that  because most of their base of game fans are in those alliances
im afraid your logic is a little skewed why dont you go to a nullsec chartmap of alliance control then add up all the numbers as shown ingame for each alliance membership now compare those numbers against the total players in gameunfortunately this does not allow for alternate highsec accounts so multiply the original number by 35 and check againi think i might do this myself given im curious about the actual numbersjust because an alliance blobs 3500 ships doesnt make it the largest playerbase nullsec is virtually empty and mostly unused save for travel purposes to and from valuable systems
heres the problem with the supply and demand theory miniif your space is worth say 1 billion isk a week and it ends up costing you 6 billion isk a month in overall costs replacing pvp ships and fittings fuel costs sov costs et al would you bother to keep that spacelong answer short  hell noshort answer long  oh god noin other words  if they make 00 less profitable than highsec missions where are people going to goanswer  high sec missionsthe demand for good 00 is fine as it is thats why so many people fight over it already and why so many people group up to defend it
despite the tedious nature of the process i did somehow manage to get through it without having a stroke well maybe onecurrently there are 38 alliances which control the vast majority of nullsec these alliances have 73198 total members of which most of us know from experience roughly 5070 are alts that aside lets assume these are all different players on active accounts yea rightwell take my original number and modify it somewhat as the number of players to have more than 3 accounts is rather less than those who will have 1 or 2 so well make it 25 which is more realistic our calculation 7319825  182995this means that at most nullsecrs account for 182995 active players in eve im not sure of current numbers but i would assume thats somewhat less than 50now when we account for the fact that 5070 of alliance members are likely alternate characters on same or different accounts then we realize our true number is closer to this 7319804325  7868785 or 78788 actual accounts or roughly 31475 actual playersstill impressive but not nearly the number of people wed like to see playing eve
nods sadly i know a few people with 8 accounts 0o yeah
as a spacefaring corpalliance in eve you want your logo to be representative of you and your group of fellow pilots as it stands the corp logo creator is pretty crappy and the system for sumbitting alliance logos is absolutely terrible we should be able to create and upload our own corpalliance logo via a ingame or evegate based interface obviously with some limits as to picture and file size we can already create dynamic and 3d looking characters on the fly and the game saves all those portraits how hard could it be to implement a system for corpalliance logos the entire idea of submitting an alliance logo to ccps art department and waiting for the next patch to come out to get your logo in if its approved which is a whole nother story is something i expect from a browser based game with one developer who makes the game in his spare time not a multinational corporation like ccpi can see some issues that people might bring up already such asq what if someone uploads something inappropriatea people are already allowed to make thier own bios i dont see why the same system cannot be applied if you find a corporation or alliances logo to be inappropriate raise a petition to ccp if ccp agrees then the corpalliance must change thier logo if they upload something else inappropriate then they lose the right to have a custom logoq lag is bad enough wont this make it worsea no keep in mind that there are hundreds of thousands of players in eve when you jump into a system with people in it the eve client already has to load everyones character portrait and in most cases most of those characters will be in the same corpalliance if youre already loading 100 images whats 10 more even if it is a major issue they could wait to load the corpalliance logo until you hit show info on someoneill post any other questions anyone raises and my answer to that hereanyway thats my rant over hopefully this gets fixed hint this is a pretty easy fix
pushing back to the front page please read the edit in the op
you dont need to cap xfer without rr liang you know that it would pose a very minor inconvenience for roaming gcc gangs but tbh i dont have a problem with that go a few jumps park at a planetsafe for a minute to rep everyone up continue on its no big deal its only a problem for those who want to sit on a gate at 0 rr everyone jump out if they get shot and then jump right back in sure you can put tackle on the far side but you arent going to stop them from crashing the gate which is exactly what they planned to do even if you werent there
i would agree but cap transfer is so much cooler than just repping something that it shouldnt give aggro tbh
i am enjoying every single onei would like more dev blogs that cause more of these tears not only are they delicious but exposes who are the super lazy players who want to be in null sec and not have to put forth any effortmore please
i am supporting marconus orions position on thisthumbs up
yeah and being part of one of the blocks as a grunt not to even mention having any role is almost as easy as sitting in empire cause one of the blocks d your pathetic ass and posting on forumsi am waiting for you to grow up and exit puberty in order for us to have constructive discussions
no but its kind of sad that something that awesome is considered a troll
in fairness weve been getting quite a few very welcome polish patches these last few months team bff has really been deliveringid rather see the job of smoothing out those little rough edges be an ongoing process than a single oneoff expansionas for the bigger things that have long cried out for iteration like faction warfare wspace drone space yeah an update to those 3 alone would constitute an excellent expansion it would even fit nicely into the 3stage expansion model ccp seem to have adopted lately
bump to the topthe breakdown of intended changes can be found in the features and ideas forum here
heres a suggestion all shipimplantskill mods be displayed in the information windows small example when a bcu is installed the rof is changed in the launcher infomation window but in the charge window the dmg is not having to go shoot a structure to figure out what your dmg is is silly i understand that if a missile has 350 kinetic dmg that if i hit a player character thats prob not the dmg it will inflict resists and other external modifications to the dmg i am thinking all internal changes to all modifications be displayed
why not have the ability to rent out slots in your pos this could help pay for fuel and ease the shortage of slots in stations
i support the renaming of corp hangers and smas the rclickfittigs would be nice but is no where near as desperatly neededreally this post doesnt go far enough poss need some love im confident that anyone whos ever lived out of one or run a reaction chainreseachedrefinedmoonminedanything to do with poss really will agree
and i agree with you that more is needed what im hoping for here is that by getting the ball rolling on any change to them ccp will start incorporating other changes weve been asking for at the same time
i always loved the fact that poss take 810 hours to set up i think it should stay that way so we can always be tired of eve and irritable for two weeks after sarcasmi think ive supportedsuggested this before the first part anyway
your english my good sir it needs updated
yep
troll food
literally all ive done here is crosspost your coalitions last 45 threads here ive literally not added anything you havnt said pretty much word for wordperhaps it is not my english that needs updated bro
thread is locked for being off topic
simply changing all local to delayed even if only for a few seconds would be a terrible idea imo though the idea of more delayed local areas in the game is a good one perhaps a few new 00 areas that are unclaimable or less work make all unclaimed space into delayed local having an area were the forces are hidden could add a new layer to the strategic game if nothing else it would force all the droneland macro botters to actually spend isk claiming the sov
so basically this is yet one more idea that would make it easier for one group to do their thing while making it harder for another group to do theirsim sorry did i miss the part where pvprs were suddenly paying more for their eve subscriptions than pve players no then you dont get any damned help from ccp to make your playtime easier than anyone elseif you want to make suggestions try making suggestions that benefit the entire player base and not just the sub group you belong to
except for 237 cloakies they shouldnt have to face danger all of the time like the rest of us that wouldnt be fair to them
i was going to vote for you but it seems its too late nowoh well its the thought that counts
i support this product and or service
entire minigin is pleased
i hope so this time well i like some of them but goonies please and mittani is a guy who doesnt play eve much anyway from what i have read after i googled his real name he is a forum troll and a spymaster who admits to not playing much yeah we need a guy who doesnt even play eve much to be in the csm much less lead it lol
itt lol pubbies
goonies what a publord
who are these goonies you are talking about they sound scary
siren pro click zone
the new csm is composed of 6 nullsec players two of which are goons out of the remaining two there is a rooks  kings member so i suppose that speaks for lowseci however want to bring up the point that fw has received no attention by fanfest or the recent csm candidates over 20000 people play fw right now ccp spent all this development time on incursions why couldnt they make a similar mechanic for factional warfareanyway i request to the new csm that you take into the count this considerable section of the playerbase by passing on concerns of fw to ccp perhaps it could be a nullseclite in terms of territory control make occupancy matterall the same stuff that has been said since june 2008 when it was first introduced it is still 10cheers
for the most part were aware that faction warfare is basically terrible and lowsec generally needs a lot of work id love to see some changes made that would make lowsec more profitable for smaller alliances and corporations and making pvp easier to do in lowsec
i believe everyone will find that nullsec players are far more interested in the balance and long term health of lowsec then anyone else is as we have a much greater investment in the health of the entire game faction warfare is broken but there arent many solutions to the problem that arent exploitable ccp wont incentivize people to blow each other up because its easy to farm i agree with your assessment that occupancy must matter turn this idea over in your headconsider if ccp created a new belt resource used for something important new t3 stuff that isa only extractable from fw system beltsb specific to each faction based on system controlc only extractable by fw participantsthe second point being important that the success of one faction has an impact on the supply of the other factions resource whichever faction controls the system determines what spawns the market price of the resources encourages more people to participate in one factions side
im with ya mate i think factional warfare had the potential to be a great game mechanic but it was left to rot like so many personally i think the incursion ai and mechanics should have been wrapped up and put out as a type of fw2 along with some sort of low sec sov mechanics that resembled 00 stuff obviously adjusted for proper use in low sec too much pve not enough pvp and no real point holding space in fw doesnt appear to mean anythingim not a fw person and can not represent it 100 from personal exp but def willing to take feedback and present it during any relevant conversations

hahaha all that spamming and windy isnt even an alternate
clearly you dont get iti was joking
first point of order id like to propose jump bridges be given twice the jump range also all outposts will be armed with doomsday guns
disgraceful this kind of stacked result is what you get from bloc voting how is such a csm meant to be representative of the playerbase as a whole seriously only two europeans
i think this is the perfect mixture for some nice oldrama
supportedno disagreements registered so far it is done
congrats to all
at least you got your pubbie candidate in amirite brb im gonna go shove glass in my eyes while i do this level 4 for the fed navy again
as with any democracy the results are representative of the number of people who bother to voteguess what these results are perfectly representative of the people who bothered to vote
but so many dirty yanks 
congrats to the delegates and alts
slippin on those jackboots of democracy
mah chairman
the pubbie tears must flow
good to see people who actually give a  about the game got in also mah chairman
go get them mittens lolz xxxxx
gratz to all that won    this is gonna be a fun set of csms to watch one way or anotherm
 you i want this csm to be nothing but drama its the sole reason i voted for mittens
now goons be useful and start trolling people out of the csm
lookit dem gunes gettin chairman
you forgot the fighter bomber swarms on each gate sheeshdont worry i will take care of that
who ever said its supposed to be the csm is the representative of those who vote
well maybe if ccp bothered to do some more promotion on the csm more ppl would vote look at the csm section on the eveo site its terrible
they did alot more than they normally dofinn is right atleast the goons took the time to vote

whats that large groups of people working together in an effort to make the game they play betteri also remember an ad at the eve login screen for about two weeks several eve news websites advertising the need to vote and various devblogs and notices on the eve website telling me to vote as well as large numbers of characters flying through empire constantly spamming their campaign details i too am completely blind
man i was sure the whole no policies and saying that i didnt actually care if people voted for me thing was going to be a winner who knewsaid right from the start that wed end up with an ncgoon block vote stitch up and i only predicted two names incorrectlygood luck to trebor meissa and seleene as the only genuine candidates who didnt bribe or block vote their way in impressive stuff from the nc campaign organisation  would have been a miracle if i won against your isk and tactical voting but i had a blasti recorded this as its only through song i can express how much i hurt no im not actually black irl
this csm term is gonna be great  its a comedy show in the makingpity windy didnt get in ithe would have been the cherry on the csm comedy cake
typical loser attitude to move the goalposts
goons so desperate to see tears imagining jokes are seriouskeep trucking beep beep
holy crap i just logged on to no less than 32 emails from goons  testie players  chill lads tis just a game
perhaps if ccp added some sort of splash image when your client loads
its about time that nullsec gets some proper representation congrats to to the new csm members and alternates condolences to the empire s who failed to win
good luck to trebor meissa  seleene i am afraid you may need it
mah comrade chairman
pretty sure trebor paid pubbies to advertise for him might as well be bribery
something along the lines of a 6bil prize if i recall
lol yea only if guys ccp marketed this csm more than any other multiple dev blogs motd and adverts in the login page of the client for everyone to see multiple times could they have done more sure but more can always be done they did a lot
14 of votes cast by 30day old accounts so enforced block voting plex scamming and defrauding the results by new account creationgrats nc  goons i guess
and tormenting your tiny paranoiaravaged psyche is the best part of that game
im actually really interested in the broken down demographic of this to see who all the 30day old account votes went to ive not spoken to anyone who has spoke of making accounts just to make more votes for our candidates so maybe it didnt all go to usor i could be wrong wouldnt be the first time

thanks to everyone who voted for me i will work hard to live up to your expectations on csm 6 i am very gratified that thanks to your support i more than doubled my previous vote total moved from 8th to 4th and increased my  of the votethe billions of ballots lottery resultsas i received 3306 votes the grand prize was 3306000000 iskthe lottery drawing was supervised by ccp navigator at the fanfest poker table i made the final table ended up 6th a card was drawn from a shuffled deck then the rnd key on my iphone calculator was pressed the number of times indicated by the card denomination 9 in this case the random number between 0 and 1 was then multiplied by the number of entries 1344 and truncated resulting in a number from 0 to 1343 in this case 1116 a randomized list of entries ranked 01343 was consulted and the winning entry wasratacide vagranthowever the rules specified that the winning entry had to be a character eligible to vote in the election and ratacide vagrant was a noob who was ineligible to vote whoops therefore the next character on the list in position 1117 was selected as the winnerthe lucky winner now 33b richer is draco cephus congratulations
if you had put as much thought into your message as you did into that block of words maybe you would have done better then fourth
ignore the jealous sniping 3rd grade insults really and congrats trebor
well you got all of mine i understand development and i think its critical to have you on for someone to have worked at ccp then come back as a former employee then still want to be involved speaks a lot to your love of the game
congratulations you got second seat and with a good number of votes make us proud
your deimos and subsequent gallente vessels have already been fixed i work fast faster than you can realistically imagine hybrids are now also completely viable as a weapon i expect to see gallente fleets roaming in my homefountain immediately we won gallente pilots we won but seriously id like to thank everyone for their support i look forward to working alongside you and ccp to deliver your concerns to the doorstep of the company and to work tirelessly hand in hand with them to get resultscouldnt have done it without the support of the eve community 3

im glad you like some of the ideas posted the issue i take with scanning is not really all that important but i do think it slows the pvp action down a bit also having to scan for them all does not make sensethe fw complexes are not just npc ships they are compounds and bases that you enter through an acceleration gate inside there are npcs that spawn apparently from nothingness but the compounds do not move at least not for 24 hours that is why its actually odd to be in the amarr militia and have to go warping around scanning looking for our own military compounds so we can defend them who lost the mapas for the enemy compounds it is possible we would have to go looking for them but it would seem equally possible that someone else in the militia would have located an enemy outpost and simply let us know so that we can go capture it
errrno
i had no idea you could do this as you cant sd with cyno up its really annoying sitting there for 10 mins waiting to be blown upthanks op not supported sorry although i do like some of the other ideas in this threadps if your biggest problem with this mechanic is that people are getting supers into level v missions there is something seriously wrong
that would be great
i think i commented on this before but that could put them in a bad situation which i think would be great or it could put them out of harms way which would be rewarding them for the cyno guy dying this i think would be bad i think odds are that if there is a fight going on most pilots will be in the destination that the cyno guy was in or at least in the adjacent system so unless they land in one of those systems they would be in a safe system odds are if it was random it would be in a safe system for themcould be other penalties involved like if you dont compete the trip landing on grid with the cyno ship alive all of your cap is put to zero no matter if you were at 100 when you jumpedanyhow if the cyno ship dies before you load system it should put you in a bad situation of some kind either way i am still for the self destruct canceling the moment the ship lights a cyno
im amarr but fly caldari excellent idea
in shortin a democratic election such as the csm election the number of votes for each candidate can be transferred into actual seats in the council in many different ways the current voting system in eve is by no means the only possibility  many alternatives exists no voting system is withouts its faults and problems however i will argue that the current voting system for the csm is a particularly poor one and a better choice would be to change the voting system for the csm into the single transferable votewhat is the problems with the current system1 the current system is not proportional the proportion of votes for each candidate doesnt reflect on their proportion of the seats eg in the recent csm6 election the mittani got 5365 votes 109 while draco llasa got 1986 votes 40 both got one seat on the council many other candidates got slightly fewer votes than draco llaso but these got zero seats on the council2 many votes are wasted on candidates who are either sure winners or sure loosers in the csm6 election the mittani was a sure winner  in other words he got 1552 votes more than seleene in 2nd place for csm chairmanship those last 1551 people who cast their vote on the mittani were effectively wasting their vote  the impact their vote had on the final result was effectively zero on the other hand 21516 votes 438 were cast on candidates who never got elected in the csm6 election thats 21516 votes who translates into effectively zero influence in the csm council and this is by far the biggest problem with the current voting system3 the current system generates uncertainty and encourages tactical voting while discouraging honest votingthis follows from point 2 above wether you are a member of a large alliance or a solo player you do not want to waste your vote on a sure winner or a sure looser this discourages honest voting  that is voting for the candidate you genuinely prefer in the csm if such a candidate turns out to be a sure winner or sure looser then you have wasted your vote instead all voters have to consider wether a vote for a given candidate is a viable tactical choice  if they want to maximize the impact of their vote that isto counter at least partially some of these issues i propose a change of voting system to the single transferable vote stvhow does stv workfirst you calculate the number of votes required to win a seat in the election this is calculated as  total votes   number of seats  1    1in the csm6 election this turns out to be 49096   9  1    1  49106 this is the value of a seat on the csm council in this electioneach voter has only a single vote but rather than choosing just a single candidate each voter instead chooses a limited number of candidates for instance 3 or 5 and ranks them in his order of preference first choice second choice third choice etc the votes of all voters are then distributed to the candidates based on their most prefered candidate first choice  any candidate that reaches the required number of votes 49106 are declared elected and all excess votes on this candidate are redistributed based on the second choice of the voters the candidate with fewest votes are eliminated all votes for this candidate are redistributed based on the second choice of the votersthis process continues using second choice third choice etc until only nine candidates remain these are the elected candidateswhy is the single transferable vote a better system for the csm election1 the system is proportional  in the sense that the value of votes used to aquire a seat is the same for all elected candidates2 the system minimizes the ammount of votes wasted on sure winners or loosers 3 the system encourages honest voting and reduces incentives to tactical voting
continuedwhat are the potential drawback to the stv systemthe mechanics behind the actual transfer of votes are a bit complicated however for the individual the voter the system is intuitively understandable you simply rank your most prefered candidates from highest to lowest and then the voting system works behind the scene to ensure that each voter gets maximum influence out of his single voteother issuesimplementing this system will probably change the distribution of seats in the csm slightly because it reduces the advantage gained by large block tactical voting but there will allways be an advantage over unorganized voters large alliances and coalitions will get a number of seats that corresponds more proportional to their number of voters support where they are somewhat overrepresented in the current system i state this as a matter of fact  not to start any discussion about highsec vs 00 on the other hand large alliances will no longer have to fine tune tactical voting or make guesses about how many votes should be distributed so and so instead they can simply encourage their members to rank certain candidates in a certain orderyou can read more about the finer details of stv hereplease no trolling  this suggestion is about improving democracy in eve  please support it
supported no npc banks no npc credit either have the cold hard cash available or you dont get your buy orders up
not supported this skill is incredibly useful for the legitimate trader for example i may put up a buy order for 100 ruptures and i know it wont fill in a single transaction or in most cases a single day this skill allows me to keep moving assets around eve instead of tying up all 500 mil while i wait for an order to be filled protip in the buyers section there is a min volume column for a reason if it looks too good to be true its cause it is
dont remove the skill remove the buy orders that dont have enough isk to back them or allow people to sell to different buy orders than the top one

if you remove the buy orders that dont have the money to back them that is a more roundabout way to just remove margin trading a fyi thing if you try to fill an order that doesnt have the isk to back it the order disappears and no moneygoods are traded ie you may get stuck holding some worthless t2 rigs or whatever but if you bought them specifically to fullfill an outragious buy order thats your fault honestly it is super easy to spot this scam and not fall victim to it like in real life if it looks too good to be true it probably ishowever i would support a proposal similar to if your margin trades get nullified more than x times a month you get your margin trading priviladges revoked for the following amount of time or you have to pay an increased market taxpenalty to make new margin orders temporarily
omg yes and the annoying mail notifications insurance bla bla bla i dont need any more ibis please ccpsorry it had caps in my head too
yep that
im glad you mention that because its exactly why this thread is so ironic traditionally the havenots came to complain now its the other way around ive longed for the day i saw nc members crying about something this much its clearly going to force a lot of very comfortable alliances to htfu and that is a good thingmore conflict more localized conflict fewer revenue streams to fun supercap inflation all wins for most of us
yeah thats not true either i get it some people really just dont like eve they dont understand that in a sandbox 10 people can decide to gang up on one person should gms step in there too and thats no more a valid spot for the devs to intervene than 10000 ganging up on 100 some people just dont like a sandbox game they need fairness evenness equal numbers etc theyd be very happy in a game that has instanced dungeons where the participants are kept at equal numbers for each side and equal degree of power no blobs no being met with capital ships when you have cruisers luckily theres already a game just like that it even has elves you dont thats the whole point its telling that people need to resort to the fallacy of false analogy simply because of the name of the gaming style sandboxing means that you set up the rules and the items and then you let players use them any way they want to within the rules this means that any result is allowed from everybody for themselves to everybody against little petey because they think he smells to everybody mining veldspar and singing kumbaya yes if they want to ruin the game violate what they themselves set out to do and put paid to all their public announcements of what the game is sure otherwise not so much my wager would be that youre only supportive of it because you see them being in accord with your personal ingame politics if instead they made it impossible for your playstyle all of a sudden youd notice that its supposed to be a sandbox game and ccp should just set up the rules and then let you play the game however you want want to bet on how many of the grrr ccp must crush coalitions bandwagon would still support the same logic if tomorrow ccp decided that really they wanted large fleet battles and more of them and so anybody with who wasnt in a fleet of at least 100 people not only didnt get fleet bonuses but couldnt do fleet warps or warp to other fleet members ccp also has in their prerogative to take a fire axe to their servers grind up the bits and then eat them with lucky charms cereal that doesnt make it a good idea
i really think your inflated sense of importance to this game is getting in the way here they understand that in a sandbox a majority of the players can heap all the sand up in one place for themselves if they like they are taking steps to limit such gameplay because it negatively effects the experience of other players nothing about this change makes eve anything like wow and that insinuation is really just tired and overplayedyou did and you just did it again above like most labels used to describe very large social systems governments for example a generalization like sandbox or democracy is often misleading a pure democracy is simply irrational mob rule a pure sandbox is simply a reward to players who are currently in positions of power after all its purely player driven so why shouldnt they essentially dictate how everyone else can playthe abiding ruleset that outlines the theme of this game will change over time as ccp realizes the longterm impacts therein they see a longterm issue with the way nullsec currently operates and they are making changes to the game to head it off for someone who champions the sandbox term youve got a funny way of clinging to your playstyle everyone eats a nerf now and again but this time its somehow diffirent i dont know how to tell you this but your playstyle is not that important this change is for the good of the majority and im sure if you stick around to htfu youll be ok
trolling in my eve forumsas for taking steps to break the sandbox because people playing their game negatively effects the experience of other players as youre posting on a blatantly obvious 1 day old alt troll i assume you dont know much about the game every time you suicide gank someone gank a ratter scam someone etc youre negatively impacting their game those are all not only allowed but encouraged lying in my eve forumsnot only did i not use the fallacy of false analogy that youd even claim i did is laughable and you are again demonstrating that you dont really understand eve if you think that the coalitions can essentially dictate how everyone else can play then you either dont play eve or dont play in nullsec you are allowed to play the game however you want what you are not free to do is play the game anyway you want anywhere you want without opposition this is the basic fallacy that generally very young children cannot comprehend that is choice does not obviate consequences and again should ccp break the sandbox youd be hoisted by your own petard should they then decide that they dont like how youre playing the game the only logical defense in a sandbox game is that players create content as they see fit and fight along side or against whoever with they if your own personal style of gaming or running missions or whatever goes on the chopping block next well youve already argued for why ccp should do that and you dont have a leg to stand on im not sure if youre playing games or not but assuming that youre not of course this is different theres a massive difference between rockets seem to be underperforming so well fix them and we noticed that a bunch of folks we dont like are using rockets so lets break them breaking sandbox play via game mechanics is a hell of a lot different than altering game mechanics for their own sake i love it when you make things up by the way one of the two of us is fine playing a sandbox game where players are free to cooperate with or oppose whoever they want and understands that sometimes this means hell fight outnumbered and outgunned and thats just life the other wants ccp to save him from that give you one guess which person actually needs to htfu hint its the one who needs dev supportps talking about me sticking around when youre posting on a day old alt troll is amusing post with your main
ill skip the silly semantics and get to the pointproblem 1 youre obviously viewing this as a personal attack on your coalition by the devs i havent the foggiest idea why youd think they are interested in ruining your internet spacesip game for no possible gains but if thats your take on this i dont know what to tell you it makes no logical sense and i have absolutely no idea why you would think that was the case breaking sandbox play via game mechanics is a hell of a lot different than altering game mechanics for their own sake there you go again with the sandbox ill just leave that alone anyhow its really cute of you to mention outnumbered and outgunned since well you are famous for outnumbering and outgunning everyone else to the point that the server crashes most places you goccp has spoken greyscale has said the changes are coming down negative feedback or not if youre still under the illusion that this somehow wont happen simply because its not your idea of a sandbox youre clearly mistakenso once again htfu and deal with the changes alternatively just vote with your subs and quit the game now either way ill continue to enjoy living in 00 and posting with an alt
your main post with it if by obviously you mean not then yes otherwise not so much breaking sandbox play in order to alter playercreated politics is wrong no matter who is targeted you know thats my actual argument because ive pointed out to you twice now that other playstyles are equally vulnerable to preferential changes you also know that youre arguing nonsense since ive pointed out the basic problem is breaking sandbox play to force playercreated politics to follow devapproved patterns not that any specific coalition is targeted in other words the thing you made up that you know isnt true and has nothing to do with what ive actually said that thing doesnt make sense i wonder why you mean you wont pretend again that its an analogy rather than a name for a certain type of gaming okay if you insist ah and this nonsense believe it or not being in razor or the nc for that matter doesnt ensure that you never fight outnumbered it happens and believe it or not i dont feel the need to alter game mechanics every time it does shocking but true yet again one of us can play the game and doesnt need the devs to save them the other wants the devs to save him the one who needs to htfu is not in fact the one whos okay playing the game whod a thunk itright your alt troll account is really from a welltraveled 00 player thats why youre not posting with your main because it really does exist
did i miss the part where ccp said they are putting are hard cap on the number of blues you can have
ccp dissed the mittani even they think he has too much blues
nonononono my point was that a sandbox is a ing sandbox its full of sand which while being something you can have alot of fun with is not an infinite resource occasionally the parents need to tell their children to stfu and stop asking to turn the entire yard into a giant sandboxput simply htfu and stop ing
and a two and a half month alt in a noob corpgo figure
alt posting best posting
you should really post with your main before calling people out about alts
yeah its all so clear now i appreciate that ccp provides the rules and makes all the tools that can be used but its really the players who control the game why didnt i see that beforeits the players who design and implement the game mechanicsoh waitthats ccp bad exampleits the players who dictate what ships look like and what they can dodang that would be ccp again guess thats another bad exampleis it the players who create and release the updates ccp again this is annoyingi know its the players who decide where the resources are no thats ccp againohhhhhi knowyoull love this one zero it was the players who decided to increase the penalties for suicide ganking hey werent you against that zero well darned if that wasnt ccp again who do these guys think they are the owners of the game or somethingwell now you can tell your masters on the balanced csm what you think about that as theyre going to snap a paper over ccps naughty nose theyll be glad to include your requests for aid to griefers that all should work out real welllooking to the futurejump bridges wonder what will happen there who will make the final decision ccp the csm forum trolls such as yourself man im gonna get me some popcorn this is gonna be goodwindjammer
seeing as how i am ill just point out with my main that youre awful at trolling notice youre still wrong ccp does not control the political content they only control the mechanics which is why youve worked at aggressively missing the pointobviously game mechanics are mechanics and not political content ship models are not political content updates are not politicla content resources are not political content how concord deals with players in empire space as opposed to playercontrolled space also not political content rather obviously as youre trolling youve ignored that i just quoted the bits where ccp said that they only provide the tools and rules but that within that framework players create the content that means that rather obviously unless theyve decided that theyre no longer a sandbox game they cant deliberately alter game mechanics in order to stop players from creating playercreated content as the player see fit let alone force them into oxymoronic dev created playercreated content mmmm hmmm while trolling about masters its somewhat less than impressive for you to talk nonsense about how pointing out your factual and logical errors is somehow bad id ask how that works but as in a sandbox game the devs dont determine the political content in playercreated content space is something you dont grok im not sure its a profitable endeavor for me
jump bridges are not political content neither are maximum jump range cyno mechanics or other means of restricting force projection sanctums are not political content neither are the abilities of pilots flying certain ships to provide leadership boosts or assign drones to offgrid fleet matesi am certainly uncomfortable with the size that certain coalitions have reached but there are no possible game mechanics that would force you to fight each other without breaking the sandbox andor providing easily exploitable loopholesthere are game mechanics that can be introduced to impede the ability of any force to act all over the map in one daythere are also mechanisms that are being deployed to cut down on cheating such as sharing accounts containing valuable pilots using bots to generate the vast resources required to build hordes of supercaps and otherwise gain an unfair advantage over other playersnone of these is breaking the sandbox just changing the texture of the sand none of these is an example of ccp controlling the political landscapei look forward to the goon csm working productively to address the issues of broken sov faction warfare and unshakeable empire sovereignty more good fights and fewer features left to rot
bah
obviously they arent political content but changing them in order to change political content is whats at issue do you really not understand that guns are also not political content but if ccp decided that your guns simply do not work unless youre in a fleet with 101 members would you still be using the same argument the problems with this are multifold first the actual impact of jump bridges is vastly overstated by their opponents even going somewhere like the eastern tip of nc space to fountain core during the purging of it you were saved something like 15 minutes during the invasion of the drone regions jbs werent even used on one entire front of the war as alliances set up forward staging bases inaround uemon nor are jbs some magic iwin button coalitions with jbs have been defeated while fighting at home during the recent nc invasion of the drone regions we also saw that jbs were insufficient to allow the nc to fight both the drf and pandemic despite claims that they allow coalitions to do exactly that there have been large coalitions and large fleets before jbs etc there will be them afterwards and when it comes to rallying people to get together and get a fight an extra half hour getting there will not significantly stop force projection itll just mean that people need to rally up earlier andor form caravans to get people home after they log out inaround the target system when they get tired
what you are failing to realise is that the game has not always been this way there were not always jumpbridges and mass titan bridgeswhat this means is there used to be consequences for mass napping people  being inability to get far away quickly harder to keep people interested drowning in a sea of blues consequently harder to blob a 50 man corp with 400 guys at the drop of a hat i dont think ccp at all intended for the changes they introduced to remove these consequences nor to diminish the number of managable engagements the server can handle yet that has been the resultshould ccp decide to rectify those mistakes it should not be upsetting but something to rejoice about whether you chose to admit it or not ccps every action influences political decisions in eveyou might think you are being more clever than everyone else and adjusting to the changes but realistically you are abusing a sniper rifle that spams like a shotgun with super accuracy at range on cod and you dont want that to be nerfed so that the ballance of the game can be restored
but changing them in order to change political content is whats at issueany change could be interpretted as a political one notice that nc stacks a certain type of ship and it gets nerfed political shenanigansfact is that nullsec is a boring blob fest you know it ccp knows it hell even your mothers dog knows it he plays eve yknow but instead of letting people atleast try to make it fun you are determined to  in everyone elses sandbox for the sake of preserving your own power instead of fighting for it do what you claim every highsec player should do and htfu
this is not a matter of interpretation this is a matter of the devs talking about changes specifically in the context of causing friction within coalitions boosting small alliances and making them independent and opposing entities with more blues than theyd like facts have to be true that aint are a lot of fights particularly sov fights fights that draw a lot of participants sure they are sure are attacks on csaas and such can those be a hell of a lot of fun sure can is there also medium sized fleet action going on yep how about gate camping yep how about roaming gangs yep how about ultrasmall gank gangs yep how about again if your problem is that people are playing the game the way they like then thats certainly something you can be annoyed about but not something you have a right to demand change on at least not any more than the coalitions should demand that small fleets that camp their stations burn eden style or camp their jump bridges or roam their space or whatever should be nerfed thats the whole point of sandbox play everybody chooses how they play and as long as they dont break the rules of the game its all part of sandbox play conspiracy theories are not worth the electrons theyre written with online theyre just not i have an intellectually honest position and would oppose nerfs specifically made to hurt small gangs you have an intellectually dishonest position and could not honestly oppose nerfs specifically made to hurt small gangs because all you could say would be well i dont like it but ive already said that ccp can break sandbox play when they want to and if you think that the coalitions havent fought to get where they are youre rather obviously quite new to eve post with your main again one person thinks that the course of ingame politics should be decided by people flying ships and shooting at each other the other thinks that the course of ingame politics should be decided by the developers the person who needs to htfu is not the one who is happy to fight to determine the political order
but you dont want a sandbox you want a private club where you hold all the keysill level with you my main is in a renter alliance down in catchi have no problem with people playing how they want ive got problems when people demand ccp make changes to accomodate them wahh bigger servers to accomodate our infinitely expanding supercarrier force fact is that its their sandbox and we have to live with the changes we are guests we hold no ownership here and if you stop finding it fun leave dont get me wrong i would love a hybrid fix but thats clearly not happening and has been broken longer than sov and even if they nerf jbs etc if your coalitions are half as strong as you claim to be in caod all day lots of posting you will ride out the changes with barely any damage
actually just one what i want is a thread free of alt trolls of course i want a sandbox people go to 00 people choose who to fly along side and who to fly against people do that sandboxthis is not complicated itll be annoying but there were coalitions before jbs and there will be coalitions after jbs that of course isnt a reason to remove them the easiest example for things that have zero effect on ingame mechanics but are still a bad idea would be say allowing five years olds to replace all ship models with crayon drawings theres also the fact that even if removing jbs wasnt a bad idea and it is doing it specifically to alter ingame politics is a bad bad decision breaking sandbox is not a good idea if eve is going to continue as the kind of game it is now maybe it wont maybe itll be world of evecraft but thats not whats best for the game it would be whats best for ccps bottom line of course but one would hope that they have some integrity on that front
the problem suffered by you devoted nullsec types is that you cant see past your own position regardless of what you say is better for the game you really mean whats better for your current alliance and yourself and know nothing about the actual health of eve and the only reason im altposting is so my own alliance chums dont get butthurt that im supporting their precious sov getting nerfed and forcing us to fight people instead of blueing everyone around us and creating unholy coalitions of boredom i  you not the most combat we get is the occasional neut trying to run our ratting spacepersonally on the jb issue i want them to stay i just want them limited to alliancecorp only having an unholy set of blue nullsec highways which are open to a multiregion spanning empire sorta reduces the size of null for me
i love your belligerant shiptoastingthe only on here who needs to htfu is you ccp does not care about your prescious political order
no its without a doubt better for the health of the game for ccp to maintain a handsoff policy as long as the rules arent being violated and to allow players to work with or against whoever they want and to establish any sort of political order theyd like this would be the case if everybody decided to mine veldspar in 00 or if nobody would join a corp with more than 3 members and alliances were all empty the position of the let people play the game how they want its a sandbox game after all is intellectually consistent the position of the people should only play the game the way i like and we should alter game mechanics to ensure that is not that youre saying that on a two day old alt troll account while people who are demanding that the devs save them from ingame politics and im simply responding just sweetens the irony
so you would prefer if ccp stopped developing and supporting the gameservers because thats a handsoff policy
if 00 was an actual sandbox that went both ways with regards to kicking over sandcastles you would still be in this thread whining about somethingprotip  its hard to call it a sandbox if the sand castles only fall when people dont care enough to pay their sov bills and defend their space
ccp should not change supercaps or sov systems because that will inevitably have consequences politicallyyou cant admit you are wrong now though so by all means make up some new ed argument that proves your point
you havent got a leg to stand on there first off the age of my alt has absolutely nothing to do with the points were debating but thats a cute accusation secondly you are the only making demands of the devs here you they have an agenda that you disagree with you are demanding the devs save your prescious politics and empireirony indeed
yet again the problem isnt changes to game mechanics or what have you the problem is making those changes specifically in order to compel a political format from allegedly playercreated and playerdriven political content ah i see refuting your claims with facts and logic is bad must be whining those who are saying that they want the devs to save them from players creating playercreated content thats taciturn and virile i guess 1 youre lying space changes hands even these days 2 even if people are able to build up sufficient force that they can defend against anything but equal or greater numbers its still a sandbox sorry thats just factual imagine we have a fps game where we dump 100 people into a map and say cooperate with and kill whoever you want 99 dudes decide to hunt one other guy because i dont know hes got red hair or something they simply can not be beaten unless something outrageously weird happens its still sandbox play this is basic and leads to a question of why you dont grok it 3 the char youre posting with has been in a noob corp for 1 year has never been used for pve and appears to have no kills or losses anywhere post with your main not an alt troll no i do youre an obvious alt troll and more to the point youre obviously trolling some people are complaining that the devs need to save them from players creating playercreated content and telling those who want to actually have that content created by combat not by devs to htfu you then trolled me about how i was being belligerent yes its this obvious trolling that im talking about ive made no such demands you are lying what i have said is that if the devs break sandbox play to encouragediscourage the players creating playercreated politics they will have ruined what makes eve unique among games and it will set a very bad precedent but you knew that
the problem isnt the changes its the changes to see thats just halarious when you read it back to yourself stop right now and laugh at what you just typed you are so ing hypocritical not your sandbox anymore ccp is taking it back
actually more likely than not the problem is the blatant trolling from an obvious two day old alt troll account youre now actually reduced to trolling about how people taking and holding space based on fighting for it is arrogance and that ccp taking back control of 00 politics can in any way shape or form leave the the game a sandbox gameyoure providing some really awful trolling and its obvious that you cant address the actual arguments post with your main
arUFFFDroUFFFDgance   aruhguhns noun offensive display of superiority or selfimportance overbearing prideyeah that seems to fit you pretty well your entire line of reasoning is that ccp should say out of your beloved sandbox you loose sir good day
your main post with it yes thank you for demonstrating again that youre simply trolling anybody can take and hold space and numbers help them to do that that fact in your trolling means that someone has a sense of superiority and overbearing prideyour trolling really is awful
i dont see any others here defending their rule of sov space against ccps will to change their own gameyou want to keep this up
at this point you both are trolling to see who can shout the loudestof course that usually happens when someone argues with finn
nope im arguing the facts and logic and hes trolling you mean people cant rebut the actual arguments as theyre ya know correct so we see lots and lots of alt trolls yes that does generally happen
at this point finn all you are arguing is that the other person is an alt troll which may or may not be true i dont carewhich since it has no relation to the original topic nor has any purpose other than stroking your sense of self importance it is trollingthough by that equity what im doing now is trolling hmmm
nope post 62 rebutted peoples arguments and pointed out that some were misstating mine post 64 pointed out what my argument actually was and that an alttroll was deliberately misstating it in order to troll post 66 pointed out that my argument was being characterized and was actually egalitarian and it was being distorted by an alt troll in order to troll post 68 then i only pointed out that the alt troll was simply trolling and he is that hes an alt is obvious and beyond dispute its a two day old character in a noob corp that hes trolling is clear from well the fact that hes trolling pointing out what my actual argument is thats not trolling pointing out that someone is being dishonest thats not trolling pointing out that someone is trolling that too isnt trollingclaiming that factual refutations or objecting to someone trolling is just stroking your self importance seriously what do you even hope to accomplish with that bit of bull i argue the fact and point out dishonest conduct from others so you say thats about self importance what corner of trolllogic even makes that even begin to make sense but on edit you did notice the irony inherent in your last two posts now which have done nothing other than complain about alleged trolling while you say that complaining about trolling is in and of itself trolling its somewhat amusing
and anyone who is arguing with you must be a altposting empire pubbie troll amiritepost with a main that doesnt have scrubtastic kill statsowai do you even read or do you type up a generic answer when you see that someone disagrees with your terrible views i bolded the part that you seemed to have trouble with to make it easier for you somalis v rangers who wins oh righttoo bad you cant have similar results without fighting fconlevel baddies or using a gimmick like a triage archon this is a tired old broken record we keep hearing from you its pretty adorable when you think you are so sure of your pro 1800 kills too bad you cant even break 20000 on battle clinic bro next time try to kill the merlin without 50 drakes
kindly stop trolling on an obvious alt while complaining about altposting trolling do you even read or do you type up a generic answeryour lack of comprehension isnt my lack of elaboration my answer wasnt generic either space changes hands even when its being defended even these days as the last major failure due to not paying sov was some time ago your claim is false the point is not that 99 people dont have an advantage over 1 i stated very very clearly that they do the point is that despite people having an advantage its still a sandbox game you misspelled youre right finn there sure are a lot of obvious alt trolls in here i wonder why that iseasy typo could happen to anybody naturally you then go on to troll about the number of kills ive gotten rather obviously thats not at issue and you know it thats why youre trolling about it the fact that youre using an alt to troll is naturally different from how many kills you have ah the u mad bit played without any artistry at all no im not upset let alone really upset i recognize that lots of people cant actually deal with my arguments and so theyre reduced to trolling on alts yes i know theyre trolling and not debating honestly i was pretty clear when i pointed that out that some people are you claim still butthurt over factual claims i made about ank a year ago is well thats awesome
i tried gallente bss a while ago over a year ago at the time i had same skills in minmatar and gallente ships and large guns no matter which gallente bs i tried my turret dps was 13  14 of minmatars going by visual cues in pve how much dmg was done on npcs this was against guristas or serpentis first of all long range hybrids dont hit for much and if npcs were in any way off the optimal range guns just couldnt track them just no way hitting for sheet dmg at 45km anything comes closer than that cant hiti understand why people fly domis mostly anything else is like throwing rocks at a wall
how are you guys having trouble with drone boats all you do is launch drones press f select new target press f again until its all dead
it is called bugs nothing we can do about them drones attacking different targets even though focus fire is ticked and more
if they want null sec to be uneven boast the better true secs with more signatures which dont have the reduced bounty anoms haveif the current idea is implemented the jewel systems are going to the most established alliances along with moons and the rest will be a worthless desert that no one cares about new upstart corpsalliances are not going to get the one or two good systems that would permit any tangible reward with any chance in hell
my favorite drone bug is where you tell them to attack a target and then they just decide to all go attack someone else instead ive tried ordering a decimation but even after the four of them are standing over the corpse of their dead compatriot they dont get the message
that is not a bug you just havnt figured out drone aggression yet unsurprising
naturally minigin is trolling again id say im surprised but im not ill be surprised when minigin provides a post that isnt trolling
no there is no more only that problem exaggerating to get your point through might work in kindergarten but the moment you resort to obvious lies to make your argument it all falls apart even the valid partbesides no other weapon system in eve autoswitch onto a new target when the previous is dead so it would be completely fair to require a button press to have drones attacking something tooon topic i am in full support of ccp changes to the anomaly system where is the option to give this thread the thump down except the wonderful fof missiles
sounds very reasonable supported
this  the fighter bombers cant kill structures then yes
im just going to point out that tcus dont have a reinforce mode and silently move away from this thread
when did you sell your character vlade this doesnt sound like you at all buddyif you dont like looking at black screens try something else its not a secret that 2000 people in the same system causes lagwhat happened to you dude dont you remember those nice little dog fights with 10 in gang
i have to be versatile in my position i still run 10  20 man gangs all the time but at the moment we are contesting space with a larger number of pilots im simply raising the issue that there is a need for more power from the server someone suggested not sending so many pilots in any battle you need to send an amount of troops that is relative to what the enemy has you all speak like its a ridiculous suggestion however ccp has raised the amount of players a system can hold and manage several times in the past so its quite logical that this number would increase furtherim simply saying now is a good time and if you think otherwise i think you are lucky that you dont have to experience such lag and bugs
the pl guy is most likely right that it will never happen less lag  we put more people in system although multicore support might help however blaming us for it is easy but the actual problem is with ccps mechanics sure we can put 300 people in a system then we got drf owning our space within a month we have no choice for sov warfare besides cramming as many people as possible on a grid
the mechanics thread got bumped so i figured wtf
these allow you to kill people in high sec space without concord interventionwhat are wardecs alexcorrectthe rapists for 200 alex
thank you ill have to look that one up i assume that its something new at fanfest or is it something old that i missed
ah nice i worry that that bit at the end was just window dressing but if not thatd be ing awesome
the whole thing was eye candy therell be no server connection between dust and tq from what i heard in the panels
they mean no direct interaction theyve always planned it as one universe though those planetary mercs are going to be fighting around our planet installations after all and theyve said in the past well be hiring them and communicating with them but theyre never gonna be face to face with us and were never gonna be on the ground
never is too long to plan out lets take one step at the time and see where it gets us
i drink regular coke and pepsi so if the price of regular coke and pepsi rose past the price i am willing to pay i would then buy no frills soft drinkother people would still buy coke and pepsi and even tear out each others eyes for them sure not everyone will buy no frills but the fact that you dont want to does not mean economics does not work
i approve of the op as of this post it will still encourage conflict without making all the time people spend on things not wasted when taken over etc etc
thisits really cute the nc believe it has a right to reign over most of 00 and that any game changes to dispute that rule are retarted but this whole idea of everyone getting valuable space is exactly what ccp wants to get rid ofif you arent living in 00 for conflict and by that i dont mean gridloading 1000man blobs over resources youve completely missed the memo on what 00 was all about get back to highsec where you can pile up isk all day long if thats your goal the rest of us in 00 just want good fights with fewer blobs and thats exactly what ccp is trying to deliver by breaking up your little girls club
supported while the corp logos i think dont need a completely custom approach having more options that what we have would be nicealliance logos otoh need to be easier to submit and have accepted as is the art dept does not tell you what is wrong with your logo if they decline it they simply say its not in the spirit of eve or some such nonsense and are not held accountable enough to tell you why this is sosome rather sensible ones imo have been rejected and yet huzzah federation pot leaf and cult of wars a cow got approved
one of the major displays at fanfest was how cool all the new stuff getting put into eve looks while graphics can be a major selling point for a game the game still needs to be accessible to people using older hardwareone of the primary issues with any mmo is retaining a playerbase and by constantly increasing the system requirements ccp is essentially saying that you require a cuttingedge system to run our game at a visually pleasurable framerate this is not right additionally many things in eve require people to run multiple instances of the game and increasing requirements for running a single instance prevents this for many people by constantly increasing the system requirements on eve ccp is effectively alienating people who dont want tocant afford to upgrade to newer systems and preventing new players from starting if their system cant run it what im asking the csm to do is to confront ccp about the ever increasing minimum system requirements in order to play their game while i know nothing will come out of it due to the fact that ccp has already decided on a direction it would be nice to at least get acknowledgement that this is a serious issue
what a load of crap if you cant afford to upgrade your system once every 10 or so years then you cant afford to play eve i have a pc i built 5 years ago for 300 that still runs eve perfectly i also have a 2500 gaming rig the point is the requirements for eve are minimal at best incarna might change that but that is your problem the number of players running eve on less than satisfactory gaming rigs is very few there is no reason for ccp to destroy themselves by falling behind the times graphically just because of the few that are too cheap to upgrade if ccp wants to stay relavant they have to keep improving the game in both graphics and gameplay to do that you will have to upgrade why should everybody else suffer because you cant buy a new pcand if you come back saying graphics arent everything and its all about gameplay you are wrong if that were true we would still be playing muds and eve would still look like  and likely would not have the player base it does now and would not be making much money
you do realize that a new computer ignoring hard drive and os case and monitor that could play eve on nearly full settings is less than 300
looking forward to the day when the minimum requirement is sm 50  dx11
my proposalprevent stagnationkeep people moving exploring and fightingdepletiondepletionanddepletionpirate factions get sick of being vaporized so they move to areas where less npc killing happens truesec changes accordingly make 1 haven the bare minimum moons have more then one kind of goo and what ever you harvest should deplete and move to other moons so that the amount of any given moon product remains static but the location changes based on a depletion system this would make it more difficult to constantly control the static moons and would mean that more exploring for good moons is requiredbelts and mining sites deplete similarly heavily mined areas will have less high end ores and more low end oresstill always some high ends available but not so nice drug clouds should still be regional maybe no change requiredleave planets alone the local depletion mechanic is fine and sets pi aparttruesec status in null should be dynamic as pirate factions move to greener pastureswhybecause the least utilized space will become the most valued space the most crowded and built up areas will deplete people will have to move around its unlikely that an equilibrium will ever be reached because people will always prefer to consume resources in defensible pocketsthis creates a constant demand for moon scans it means that the little guy has a chance to sit on a good moon undetected for a while then epic politics would happen when someone does a moon scan and finds out what you are sitting on etc etcanother implication is that each type of 00 resource moon goo minerals pirates etc would be unrelated to each other so that in a system where nobody does anything but rat there is a good chance that mining will become more profitable and so onspecific can be changed tldr point is that a depletion mechanic or set of mechanics would keep 00 interesting
ummbutwhat about my powerblock sniff and tech moons sniff and not having to move sniff for reals though this pretty much fixes eve but the sheer simplicity of it makes me assume theres some inherent problem with it and because of that the devs refuse to implement it
agreed some form of depletion mechanic for all resources would actually stand a chance of achieving the goals that greyscales blog posited
at present the only way to get information about what wars another corporation or alliance is involved in is to go to neocom  corporation  wars  other wars this is a somewhat illogical place to put it from the point of view of new players since most of the corporation window is about your corporation and your alliance if youre in an alliancei do not propose removing this information from the corporation window however i do propose adding a wars tab to the show info window for a corporation or alliance also add a function to the api to call up war status who decced whom when and is it in warmup cooldown fully active or fully inactive this way corps and alliances can if they want to add war status to their web pages
yes
eminently sensible not something you expect from this subforum
lets say a frigate ship which can fit a covert and normal cynosaural fieldhas a bigger cargo hold cynos are 50 shorter than normally and the consumption levels decrese per level of spec
you are aware that recons are already specialized cyno ships 
would be nice to have a t1 option with reduced cycle time blasted recons are very specialised and come rather lateslap recon cyno bonuses on the probing frigates probe magnate imicus and heron reason for using them is that they are eggshells so begin with so would never be viable as combat cynos but merely serve as a light time saver for daytoday jumping
but for cyno charactors you dont really wanna spend the 50 days to get one
this is how i would do it maybe balance at level 4 but shrug the description for each spec skill does not limit itself to particular varieties of drones making things like this consistent across drone sizestypes makes things a lot more intuitive and less like it was thrown together in a rush without proofreading
forcing people to choose a racial drone spec is stupid changing which race of drone you are using is akin to changing the ammo in your gunslaunchers there is no reason to nerf drones
seeing as how you arent a pirate im going to ignore your claim that its a very minor inconvenience the truth is that it would be a really ing annoying inconvenience  to the point that i think wed simply stop using logistics but i guess thats your goal eh youve said it plenty of times youre tired of seeing all those flashy pirate logistics lianged like ive said before  fix station games if you want to dont care but the way gate aggression works is fine it has counters theyre still in space there are other aggression issues to contend with and frankly my 4 man corp handles it fine so your 50 man fw blob can too
ive never really had big problems dealing with things like this it just adds another dimension to the game you need to be that much more clever than those who own the space perhaps if this was true in all npc systems and not sov space either way im not that fussed but i could see the change not having a game breaking effect either way so thumbs up
first i propose getting rid of moon mining as we know it to do it up like pi every moon in high low and nullsec you can moon mine on installations like pi multiple people per moon but still only 1 pos per moon have the fuel for the new moon mining bases run off of ice help that market out as well since ice prices have plumeted most of the best  good moons are controlled by a few alliances  power blocks and they make a lot of isk off of it and with that isk comes resources they have to sustain and super long war that newer alliances that not have that isk flow from the moons just cant sustain the large alliances can just hire mercs or have 1000s of ship waiting in a corp hangar for a srp for the war them losing the monopoly on the moons would make the field more even 2nd idea is a way to get rid of some extra isk in the game a way for people to buy double training time say 250 million isk to buy 1 weeks wrth of double training time vet players dont really need it new players cant afford it unless they buy a lot of plexes or can just have it where you need a said number of sp before you can buy any of them biggest group it benefits in the middle sp players help them catch up more to the vet players and get into better grade ships  caps for that pvp but to me that would get rid of a lot of extra isk in the game that can straight to ccp and be destroyed just my 2 cents on it
wow youre an idiot this is amazingly stupidthe value of moons used to be fairly good then dominion hiti get it it really sucks that you dont get 7 billion a month because some big mean alliance wont let you have a technetium moon this is the way the game is supposed to work the playing field should in no way be equal for some small lowsecempire alliance with a major 00 alliance if you think your alliance is strong enough go take some moon from someone else go and do it most of the point of having a big strong alliance is so you can make money i understand it isnt fair because your ty alliance sucks deal wiz itthe real issue with moons is that they need to be rebalanced because the dominion nerf was a complete up instead of reducing the value of all moons a new system emerged with one regional r32 being worth more money than any other moon had ever been technetium is responsible for a lot of issues with the 00 game right now and the reality of the dominion changes is that alliances still depend on moons for money its just that any alliance without significant technetium holdings has serious money issuesthe additional issue with reducing the value of all moons is that small alliances can no longer take an r16 or r32 in lowsec and get enough isk off of a few of those to pay for alliance operations if all moons were more valuable it would be better for 00 alliances and small lowsec corpsalliancesin regards to your other point paying for increased training speed would probably be something just just helps the richest players in the game its stupid one option already available is purchasing a new character this costs about 200 isksp and you can probably find a character that fits what you want
well that is your opinion which of course i dont agree with it but im not going to resort to name calling to try to make a point the moons is what gives a few big alliances  coalitions a lot of power take that away and you make the playing field more even and more will be willing to take them on in big wars more big wars  a lot better for the market and economy of the game the idea of keeping them rich cause they can is just ludicrous i know some that have bought toons mainly as a utility toon to help out their main toons a lot want to see there main toons progress thru the game not want to spend years on a toon just to buy another and shelf your original toon but that can help close the gap between middle players and vet players while getting rid of extra isk from the game
dont make moon goon into farmville its bad enough that pi is all sorts of messed up
no alliance has power because of their moon mining empire they have power because of effective leadership and an active membership money is not the primary driver behind the strength of an alliance its the playerbase the money is just a bonusyour primary issue is that assuming by removing moons you will make more wars happen wars wont happen 00 space already has a load of issues the major one being that level 4 missions offer comparable income in a completely safe environment immensely valuable assets have to exist so that there is a motivator to take space and have fights loads of fights happen over moons because they are something valuable that people want if theres no prize people wont fightalso just get a new main character go no the character bazaar buy a new character sell your old one oh man your new main has 15mil more sp than your old character congratulations your new main has progressed a year ahead of your old one
supercaps would tend to disagree with that statement
while supercaps are a determining factor in alliance power and capability they arent magically spewed out from moons even though some alliances fund supercaps with moongoo others such as pl have funded a large fleet through alliance tournament wins and mercenary contracts also many supercaps are personal assets that have been obtained by wealthy individual players with no alliance help many players now have over 12 digits worth of assets thanks to the utter joke that was the implementation of tyrannis
im not even weighing in on the moon subject simply stating that money is very important in the sov game right now it might seem less important simply because the major powers are just ing it out left and right but it is very important
an alliance that can replace lost super caps  caps and tons of bss etc with no problem will always have a big advantage over an alliance that when they lose big takes a lot to replace them lost ships the said alliance that can replace them ships easily and fast will always have a big advantage over an alliance that cant the few alliances that control the moongoo can fight a prolonged war without really worrying about running out of isk compared to an alliance that now control any moons i know for me and a lot of others our toons are like a extension of ourselves we want to progess our own toons further in the game not buy someone elses toon and make it our own plus is a way to get at least hundreds of billions if not a lot more out of the game every month as im sure a lot would use that new service
op throw in the ability to disrupthijack mining operations on a moonplanet and you have a planomgmycashcow passive isk generation is bad no matter how you spin itpi may not be the optimal solution but suppose such a step was taken and appropriat
well have to think with still only 1 pos per moon have to be friendly to that pos owner or depending on what the setting are at a armed pos would kill non friendlies plus i could see a lot more pos bashing  wars over who has a pos at a said moon in a lot of places just for that and on a side note maybe to be able to put a pos at a planet as well then any ships coming to and from said planet or moon would have to be friendly to that pos or the pos would blow up your ship make it more interesting in running both then and once a installation goes inactive so a set period of time you can attack it and destroy it to make room for another of your choosing but also keep it simple kinda like poss have to set it up fuel it and empty the silos should be about as difficult for any facility on a moon without 1000000 clicks to get something done
the upcoming patch to nullsec wont help anyone it will make it harder for smaller alliances to compete in the nullsec arena and caters very well to the big alliances with lots of ships to attack and control systems dont implement the sec status changes it will only hurt the health of evetehroot
nc alt detectedseriously if the nerf affects your area of space stop paying nc rent and there is your lost profit
dont think of it as nerfing but more like a doctors prescribed exercise plannull has become excessively obese and lazy isk has never been easier to acquire than now which is a far greater health issue for eveunlimited isk means no risk assessment will ever be needed and the thrill of achieving anything evaporates be it killing a faction ship or conquering space
im not in nc and its not easy for an alliance to go out and claim more ratting space when it only has 7 systems and 99 of the systems are claimed by huge alliances
low sec status holder detected
this thread is not relevant to the assembly halllocked
given that some moons have abundance levels higher than 1 i would like to propose tech 2 moon harvestors be released to take advantage of these abundance levels i know they were originally planned but never released not sure why
good i posted this elsewhere and ill post it here as welllook the fact is that while the goons and nc may be ruthless bastards they actually do care about and have time and money invested in eve they want this game to be polished and fixed because that benefits them and in turn it benefits uspersonally i think theyll use this opportunity to gain some respect from the eve playerbase for their ability to get things done and be unified while doing it these people may be some of the most evil players in eve but in real life many of them are responsible and highly intelligent individuals they play the game like s because thats is the game however what they do in the csm is not the game its the technical workings of the game and i think that theyll bring to the table not the  characters they play but the truly intelligent and responsible people they are in real life since that is what theyll need if they wish to get things accomplishedyou want to call me names because i support them fine we shall see dont judge a real life book by its in game cover you bunch of whiners give them a chance to do what the other csms couldnt which is do more than blow hot airand if they do screw us all well that will be fun too so suck it up this isnt wow after all
agreed just because a lot of them are in the nc uaxdeath as a full member and krutoj as an alternate in the drf even doesnt mean theyre going to try and tailor the game towards them as many sensationalists think that they will do with a combined front also shared by seleene meissa and trebor i think this csm will be the most productive one ever
whos controlling your game now molle
i say we wait until theyve achieved something to begin lauding their achievements after 5 csms the only rational thing to expect is not muchthe biggest question on my mind is should that again happen will they blame their inability to work together and accomplish anything on evil ccp being evil like certain members of all those other csms have done or will they concede incompetence and unwillingness to compromise
i think you guys will be pleasantly surprised
dev why be blue to everyone around youmittani because friendship trumps the desire to fight this doesnt inspire a lot of confidence for us 00 players who want pvp and want it to be fun where skillstactics and thinking out the box can come into playnot boring massive blobs in the one single focal point with just pointclick llllaaaaagggg shoot primary  i want to be proven wrong but just now i just cant see you all leaving the ingame politics at the door and going into csm as eve customers like us who want to improve the game play for everyonei fully suspect youll all be having coalition meetings outside of normal csm ones to work out the changes that will affect your coalition not the player base as a wholesince youll have prior advance notice ahead of the rest of uswill you really push for things that balance the game but are bad for your coalition  but like i said i do want to be wrong and if you do a great job ill be the first to vote for you next timewell not you as west brits should be banned from any and all politics tbh
i am sorry that you hate friendships having experienced many friendships in my life i thoroughly recommend you have a jolly good go at it but an act of intervention to create social barriers that dont exist or have been broken down would contradict much of the sort of ideology that is set down in ccps white papers however that doesnt mean there shouldnt be real and genuine conflict drivers i have personal suggestions ive yet to write down but i assure you theyre in my head and i need to sit down and flesh it out with other csms and get feedback so that we can operate and influence structures and ideas within our field of controlinfluence
you think we like the massive laggy blobsthe only reason they are used is because they are the best tool for the job the job being smashing a multimillion ehp brick wall tcuihubstation before the enemies bash down your ehp brick wall sbu or vice versaif there were small gang objectives that couldnt be done any faster with a large blob they blobs wouldnt need to exist
under current game mechanics there is nothing your alliance can do in period basis to stand against an attack by any serious block alliances like yours are the one that have the most to gain by having serious business internet spaceship pilots at the csm tablehow do you think that vera cruz alliance would do in period basis with no beacons no jump bridges and no local channel that is just some of the stuff that stupid people have suggest for fixing 00 spaceohh and skills get you nowhere in eve online you have 2 things that work supercaps  carriers  hics  dics or loads of logistic ships and enough firepower to kill 1 primary every 30 or so seconds those are the only 2 versions that work
strictly speaking this is not exaaaaactly true improving sov objectives would reduce the need for massive fleets but there will still be points of conflict that call for them if for instance you are badguy alliance a and i am white hat alliance b and i decide to reinforce six of your csaa poss when it comes time to knock them down im probably going to throw the kitchen sink at you and youre probably going to bring everything you have to defend the core problem is simply an issue of both mathematics and human nature people like winning they dont like losing 10 dps is more than 2 dps a defender who ship has 100 dps will die more quickly to 10 dps than to 2 dps that will in turn take dps off the fleet thats attacking him well always see fleets large enough to grant an advance quantity after all has a quality all its own
this is the kinda reponce i suspected and it just confirms my current thoughts on the csmnowhere in my post did i say i was against coalitions friends as you call them in fact i think we need coalitions to a certain degreeto have the end game situation of two big groups of people fighting eachotherwhat i dont like is the way the game drags people into one focal pointi would love to see battle lines getting drawn up where there could be some sort of war front where you could have multipul objectives with multipul battles all alone the war frontwhere things like guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines can come into playbig battles that are really decoys for one side or the other to do another objective etcetc and if you really do think we should just go about wearing flowers in our hair and making loads of love buddies in 00 and not fight like mittani seems to wantare you lot really the best people for the csm 
i wholeheartedly agree with you there should be dramatic conflict drivers which may bring the desire to invade up to the same level as the desire to befriend but as for a means to accomplish that goal right this second im keeping my cards close to my chest with my suggestionsbecause i havent discussed them with my fellow csmsactual reason i am very insecure
you were so much more chill when we rented free trade zone space to you
i have always wanted to see both minigin and vuk lau on csm that would have been more entertaining having some sociopath and bacteria on the csm this term is a little mehbut yeh like you said thankfully ccp wont listen to csm you should have heard mittani in his lets once again talk about how i obsess about molle vid when talking about the disband he goes well we decided to disband bob sacrifice 10 regions and invade delvehahaha oh and the best part is goons agreedanyway eventually ccp will nerf number warfare like they said it is sooner than you think once that happens nc will implode
ayieee
i do not hang out with the blobfleets much instead i sit back and take part in plexing ive done this since september 2009 and thus have extensive experience in it that i can share in depth with you at some point but ill do a quick ramble about it hereplexing is a fantastic method for smallgroup or solo pvp ive had the best fights ever in these plexes its basically the same as belts no station docks no gate jumping no escape with gallente npcs the blaster range of which suck making them nonexistent you literally have this open area of space to shoot around in and manuever really fantastic fights that demand a lot of skill that i cannot stress enough this is the one good thing about the fw mechanic i can point outbut then these plexes mean nothing other than kudos take caldari npcs they jam so you cant have these fantastic fights in caldari plexes you have to warp out moreover you have to fit for pve i also hear minmatar web and amarr tracking disrupt all this form of ewar makes plexfighting a lot more difficult compared to gallentes weak dampingwith tyrannis ccp missed an opportunity to integrate planetary interaction with factional warfare i as a gallente can go build pins on new caldari prime i can build it on worlds in caldari lowsec apparently in nullsec you cant build pins in planets you dont have sov in why does this not apply to fwccp could have in the interim of providing a fw 20 altered the npcs exclusively used for fw remove ewar for all factions for example they did not howeveri will pose one thing i would like to take you to ccp will dust and fw be connected imo it has to be there is no way around this in terms of creating their believable universe what is the point of the minmatar controlling an amarr system if the planets are all controlled by nonaligned mercenariesthanks for showing interest quick edit  ccp has also stated they want players to affect the storyline by talking about live events and incursions fw did this with the gallente and caldari during 200910 so why are they ignoring it now
i hope thats just meant to be a troll and not a sample of a typical nullsec players understanding of fw because jesus christ the militia dosent need belt miners there are enough stealth bomber mission runners that avoid all pvp as it is did we mention faction warfare is just fine isk incentivewise and you can make a fortune out of fw lpswhat occupancy should give is something like systemwide bonuses to one factions ships or anothers or even having fw militia stations change sides to the occupying force eg a tlf station becomes a 24th crusade station on amarr occupancy and it now gives missions for that faction instead and the standings adjust accordinglyin addition they need to fix the plexes already so t2 and the new faction ships are in the same plex size and dramiels dont  on every newbies plexing fun having plexes spawn at other times except downtime would be nice as wellbtw theres been one small fw iteration back in 2009 devb which was pretty decent actually but their promise of that being the first step of many to put its implementation back into the original vision that was ours during the empyrean age release never materialised surpriseif any of you csm people is actually seriously interested about representing fw warfare you should probably contact the leaders of some of the major fw corps dont listen to me i just poke around every once in a while but theres plenty of bitter fw vets rather than do the same thing you accused the previous csm of doing and thinking you can give feedback based on what you imagine fw might be like
i actually did talk about this in my election campaignnotwithstanding the alt spies that are rampant in caldari militia would love to see some type of bonus other than standing for fwwhatcha say there csm fly safe guysbutch
both lowsec and factionwarfare desperately need iteration according to elvenlord who im having coffee with in this reyk cafe theres a pile of fwrelated items languishing in the backlog already from past csms that backlog in general is the primary issue confronting the whole playerbase
1 faction warfare needs a hug
i dont think anyone disagrees that fw needs lovethe problem is that there are so many areas of the game that need love and the challenge for csm is making the best possible representations to ccp about where they are going to get the most bang for the buck with their limited development resourcesi personally would like to see some work done on fw and lowsec  but i also think that fixing lowsec in particular with regard to making piracy less marginal as an occupation is probably the hardest game design challenge in evewith respect to getting fw love in the short term probably the most likely way to do it is to identify a menu of small changes to the current system that would eliminate the biggest problems so that they could be attacked in whole or in part by a group like team bff
thats easy1 there is no compelling economic reason for people to be there2 there arent many economic incentives ccp can grant for activity in lowsec that arent2a easily exploited pvp kill rewardsor2b at risk of being monopolized by nullsec alliancesthere is a compelling socioeconomic reason which compels nullsec alliances our space is literally ours we own the stations and can build them where we will we decide who gets to dock and use services we decide what systems we connect with bridges we control the income from our moons none of this is the case in lowsec there is no really apparent gain or loss in controlling or losing space for your factionthe faction warfare players fight for their respective empire alliances but they receive absolutely none of the benefits that they would be afforded as par for the course in anything but own alliance the paltry faction lp rewards are hilariously pitiful compared to the ship reimbursement programs offered by every serious spaceholding entity if i lose a drake or a maelstrom in a system ive been told to be in on a sanctioned op i get a new drake or maelstrom that simple end of story because i was present when my alliance needed numbers in location x at time tif a faction warfare player loses his ship in a faction warfare system what does he get for his troublesan ibis and 1 unit of tritanium

thats a nice icon you got there
well i guess i wont be needing these alts anymore 
weak sauce and not even a passing acquaintance with logic he knows the words but lacks any comprehension of the meaning zero doesnt actually have to act confused hes in that state perpetually now dont stare too much at the little troll folks its not good mannerssupporttentonhammercom write them and let them know the level of journalism you want to read who wants to read slanted bigotry lets see if we cant convince them to have some better talent from their contributors do they really want their site used as a platform for a selfserving hackwindjammer
you are now actually accusing an internet paper of condoning bigotry because they ran a column about an internet spaceship election your trolling is so awful that if it was in school it would have to stay late after class just to fail bigotry for an election article about internet spaceships on an internet newspaper bigotry seriously yet again lets see if windy can spot the massive logical and procedural fail in this letter writing campaign eh
you arent as witty as you think you are
you know your own kalle v
it would be nice to see how much votes all other candidates got

candidates eliminated by method of thunderdomeno more bloc stacking and nullsec advantage we all know that nullseccers cant solo worth a  blobtastic is all they know
calm down have some dip
without chip are you mad woman
i propose selection is made via russian roulette played with an an automatic pistol
candidate a places firearm to headclickcandidate b places firearm to headclickcandidate c mittani picks up firearm loads each chamber and ensures total victorycsm is dead long live the csmalthough playing russian roulette with an automatic pistol isnt exciting yes i saw what you did there
bahh who really cares ccp dont listen to what the csm say anyway this term would be no different it just is a shame all the drama and fun is over last few weeks were pretty entertaining now this forum will turn into a graveyard with the occasional i am obsessed with molle thread oh wait mittani usually does that on caod
i can understand your disappointment as the csm should be about putting ingame politics aside and joining together as a customer base to make the game better for all of uswhat we have now is a little clique whos only interest is to change the game to suit themselves  sadly because of this the csm will never be given any real kind of powermaking it more a show case for ccp and a free holiday for someinstead of a proper way for us to be heard and improve the game in all its different aspects and styles of game play as a 00 player im even more let down after seeing some of the comments at the recent 00 round table at fanfestdev why be blue to everyone around youmittani because friendship trumps the desire to fight and this is the fool who was voted chair 
link vid you know since ccp are aware of this nap protection it will change making it useless to nap lets see if they stay friends when naping is pointless
of course everything russian in eve has to be automated
preelection we have to band together to stop the evil nullsec block from ruining our gamepostelection didnt want that csm anywayquality stuffwhat you guys dont seem to understand is that the nullsec candidates are far more concerned about the overall health of the game than even you are of course they are they have far more invested in its continuance and preservation i heard an interview on one of the eve podcasts with a ccp employee i dont remember which one and he described the csm as a group of expert users thats absolutely the correct way to look at them theyre users who are familiar with every aspect of the game that describes the new csm lineup very well the sky is not actually falling you can relax
i have to disagree with ya jonathanbased on what is splattered all over the place i am of the opinion that null sec players only give a rats ass about null sec while i do not live in high sec i will use high sec as an example it appears that most null sec dwellers despise high sec especially anyone who pvps in high sec but the whining about the dev blog throwing out some future changes to 00 sure has said null sec dwellers whailing like little girls about nerf high sec lvl 4 missions concluding when any other day of the week is ffffffuu high sec then there should be no ing or say about high sec anything by null players if its so horribad any other time then stfu about the missions therethere should be a change to the voting for csm null blocks can completely control the csm every year if they want to that leaves out a lot of the players not being represented this is why in the us popular vote is not used all the smaller populated places between the coasts would have absolutely no voice as the large metro areas would pack the gov with their candidates there has to be a line somewhere
you do realise that this is democracy in action turns out that a large proportion of the game is in 00 and a large proportion of them votewho would of thunk itthe csm is elected based on the general concencus of the playerbase if that concencus is 00 based then were going to have a 00 based csmits fair there is no fairer way if you want a concencus thats not 00 based then get support for lowsec and highsec matters and next year get people to vote more for them
to address the second point first there are far more people in empire than in 00 the idea that we should change the voting system because a majority decided to abstain is ridiculous it was important to me that people who knew what the  was going on got on the csm so i voted for them no one has been victimized here people just didnt participate im not going to put words in someone elses mouth but the contempt for empire dwellers seems at least from my perspective to stem from the fact that people in empire are knowingly and willingly taking advantage of the skewed riskreward ratio available there im sure the argument will be made that same imbalance is present in northern 00 but a its not 420 loose ratting carriers errday and even if it were people in northern 00 are safe because weve built that safety ourselves with home defense fleets gate camps et cetera as opposed to being safe by virtue of artificial rules the developers put into place
will you guys stop seriousing up my troll thread there is one option and i stick by it thunderdome if eve is everyone vs everyone online then surely the best way to decide our representatives would be a battle royale it makes sense politics have nothing to do with shooty spaceships
go here for a serious attack of seriousnessand now back to battle royalecrash boom zang
damn
congratulations smug
make methnaught real thx
so mittens gonna put the chair position up for election
21516 votes equals zero influence in the csm we can do betterplease support this proposal for a better voting system in future csm electionsthis is not about grief or tears regarding the current election  i wish the newly elected csm all the best but it is a fact that the current voting system is flawed1 the current system is not proportional2 many votes are wasted on candidates who are either sure winners or sure loosers3 the current system generates uncertainty and encourages tactical voting while discouraging honest votingdo you want to know more
im not sure if its against the rules to create a 3rd party exit poll you can do that if you really wanted to track how the count is going but youd need to work hard to get it out there and get it used 
sorryid obviously have to run faster than santa if i were making an exit poll im basing my numbers on this dev blog49096 votes were castthe nine elected csm members represents a total of 27580 votes 562 and these get 100 of the influencethe remaining 21516 votes 438 translates into zero influencethis is the democratic problem in a presidential election it is obvious that there will be a lot of wasted votes but in a election to a multiple member council like the csm this number is much higher than it need to be please read my thread in the assembly hall  and support it oh  and congratulations on your election white tree 
exit polls are used to measure the votes for candidates by asking the person after theyve voted who they voted for this can happen during the voting processe thankyouee eng101 effectively what youre referring too is a system of primaries but youd prefer the playerbase had more influence the csm primaries i think that would basically be forcing subgroups to poke around in eachothers subgroups however you can already do this nonintrusively by discussing the viewpoints of the csm candidates in this very forum and lobbying either for or against them if you want to imitate real democracy you effectively allow everyone to pick their desired representatives and hash it out in whatever way you can and traditionally for thousands of years in human history believe it or not weve used a forum system this is how democracies work groups of people come together to form parties whose concerns are similar and theyve used their collective might to ensure their chosen candidates are electedcan you truly state that the voters of last years csm elections werent entirely capable rationalizing their votes by voting for their own interests and why would they have to think about trying to rationalize it no one has questioned it until now and no one has really questioned it for a long time because its a functional part of a democratic process and for the most part it works
no my proposal has nothing to do with primariesand this is exactly what isnUFFFDt supported in the current voting system which has absolutely no incentives to forming a party since votes cannot be transferred between two different candidates basically you can solve the problem of vote wasting and proportionality in two ways a by allowing parties to transfer votes between party candidates this is what you find in multiparty systemsb or by allowing voters to transfer their single vote between different candidates they prefer and this is what i propose in my post in the assembly hallboth options would be a huge improvement to the current voting systemif eve were a real democracy with real issues at stake i would allways argue for option a since such a system encurages the formation of political parties and some meassure of political stabilityoption b on the other hand is ideal to the player democracy of eve since it leaves room for individual candidates with a fresh idea and since political stability is really not an issue of much concern in this setting im stating no such thing but id like people to be able to vote for the candidate they genuinely prefer  without having to take tactical considerations into account
tactical voting occurs everywhere its stunning how often it occurs im neither endorsing nor frowning upon its use but what im saying is that it may be an inherent part of the system
and im not frowning upon tactical voting either as you say it is an inherent part of the system im merely proposing a voting system that will reduce but not eliminate the impact of tactical voting and allow more voters to have a real impact on the composition of the csmif there is no support for the idea i can live it just as well  but as a real life student of electoral systems and their de facto political consequences i just thought id let you know that there are in fact better alternatives than the current voting system for the csmand now ill go and blow up some ships yaarrg
thisstill by far the best choice that was presented i hope you keep blogging and run again think recognizability hurt you as well as being both jester and rippardreally glad you ran and really hope the csm tap you as a valuable resource
hope you will run again in the future rip
ended up being 33b or so apparently vov
now whos controlling your game 
sir molle
i giggled because its true
sheeit this csm will surely make the game better enable coalitions ingame add 9000 internets for making all 00 a single coalition
results were obvious surprised to not see krutoj on there but the biggest lmfao was  that imigo guy not getting in even nc hate him hahahaminus those two everyone else as expected was in shame only one of the people i voted for got inah well now that the fun is over back to caod for me oh and dont think your status means anything jump bridges are getting nerfed your supercarriers wont be powerful and level 4s will remain as they arebut do enjoy the free trip and csm ticker have fun and dont forget to break the nda 
when i saw mittens get chair it was exactly the same feeling as what i felt when ankh managed to get in on csm
congratulations to the csm winnersok back to fw see you out there
congratulations to the new csm and good luck in the coming year looks like therell be a lot of work to do and it will be very different from what many of you will expect
will it become the muppetshow or a working councilthats the questionwell be watching 
hahalook at kalle dumbos thinking goons care about level 4 missions
lol the troll got trolled
even if they did their communication is still terrible its not that hard to make a consistent website about the csm yet after all those years there still isnt any
ad only showed once here most ppl dont bother reading anything out of game i do but i for instance could not even find when the polls would close without wading through the news archivesthink about it for a minute there is an election ongoing and there is no fast way to look up when it closes something simple like that should be listed at the csm section of the main eveo page but that section much like large other parts of the site is a complete joke
congratulations to the new csm and alternatesnice campaign effort from many candidates this time  its good to see how the status of the csm has improved during the last few years kudos to csm 5 for all their hard work the new team will have their work cut out for them 
grats to alltbh i think the alarmism is a little bit over the topi am happy that 00 decided to represent and is now represented although i do not really beleive that this will have such a huge impact on the csm activity as most seem to think it willwork hard work smart and use the time you have to help ccp make this better for us allps  i really am not an alt of windypoop we just have the same colour hair i just found his campaign the most amusing and games are for fun right 
thank you for your endorsement of my elite gamedesign skills
the above is pretty standard technique in programming something anyone with a couple of classes in computer science should know by heart
congrats on csm seat
grats good luck fighting the nc
thank you very much everyone i was surprised to see where i came out in the standings and im looking forward to the next year i will write up a proper postcampaign dev blog and fanfest review when i get home from iceland on tuesday
congratulations sel you will do us proud
congrats if you could give a summary of the points they though about changing and on which order that were imposisble to read on the free stream would be cool 
i think you should be able to buy clones for your fish as well but kelly would work too
wingdings it has to be please for one day only  itll be cryptic but just as intelligible local rants as before so carry onfailing that how about a little programme that randomizes the key output when ever an alphanumerical key is pressed if anyone has a programme that will do that let me know as that would seriously mess up a few peoples head and would be a right laughfor a few minutes
im offended by white tree what about black treesalways keeping the brother tree down
if you want to do fw occupancy you are by far best served by being online right after downtime if you cant be online at that time you will have a very limited effect compared to those who can
question how would this effect hybrid pos batteries 
wy do you even use those for some extra power get laser ones no ammo needed and they hitdps fine
yes indeed
boast hybrids helps caldari and gallente ships that use them that are underpoweredmake sig radius close to that of other races for same class ship
absobloodylutely
would love to see the missile silos on my scorp actually used
i just want them to hit enemy targets not the npc convoy ship i needed to protect during a mission because it happened to be the closest in range i mean what use is the distinction of a friend or foe missile when it cant even distinguish friend from foe
other than that i didnt read your proposal at all
due to the size of csm and the fact theres actually limited seating not based on the number of voters for a given districtstv is a horrid choice for the csm electionspolisci tinfoil hat
honestly id say that the election should be related to geography in the game  each region gets to vote for their delegate what constitutes regional habitation is of course debatable since many players move around often but the same method should be used for whose vote gets counted for which regions own electionthis way the representation is relatively fair between 00 and empireif this would lead to too many people on the csm maybe group the regions together and have several share the election like domain could be grouped into the amarr empire district and cloud ring into the ore districti never liked the popularity contest style of the csm
the main problem is that there is too few or better said none accessible information about the candidates there are their electional topics in the forum but you need to read them all entirely to get a slight idea about the candidate and even if you do read them you will probably miss some important thing about the candidate that other posters already know for example which party of players the candidate belongs toto get a really good idea you need to actually dig into the candidates posts which is tremendous workand again there are too many candidates sure some people know that this candidate is actually electable that one is some guy who nobody knows about and stuff like that but if the mere player who has no insight into eve politics and does not spend 50 of time in the forums comes to vote he chooses based on the text each candidate presents in the candidates page and that text says absolutely nothing important about himtherefore 40 of all votes get wastedso i think the ops idea is good but not enough since even if a random person chooses a few candidates with acceptable electoral message chances are that all the choices are not electable anywayso i think maybe there should be a two rounds in the voting like take some number of candidates that gained the most votes in the first round and only present them in the second this way at least laymen can choose the one candidate that represents his interest best and has any chances to win of course the minorities wont like this idea since this will make the real views of majority of eve players represented and the majorities are what they particularly hate in this game yes i am talking about carebears
would you care to elaborate on this point
i agree  this is a major issue but lets just imagine that a voter actually finds two candidates that he likes  we could call them a and b just to be creative so our voter is left with the choice of candidate a and b  he likes both of them so which should he vote for heUFFFDs got a sense that candidate a is quite popular and b is sligtly less popular this is where the election turns into tactical voting speculation and pure lotteryif he votes for a and a allready has enough support then he wastes his vote but if all potential voters for a think like this then a is not elected at allif he votes for b and b doesnt get enough support then he allso wastes his voteour voter will have to speculate about the final support for the candidatesnow lets imagine that the election ends up with candidate a having 1000 excess votes to get elected while b lacks 500 votes to get elected if the csm election allowed candidates to run as a political party  then candidate a could transfer enough of his surplus votes to b to get him elected as wellor if we used stv in the election voters who prefer to have both a and b on the council wouldnt have to speculate which they should vote for with stv they could get both candidates electedno mather how you put it the current voting system is very much a gamble  and less about transfering voter preferences into actual seats on the csm council
if there is no specified number of preferances you have to have it wont make voting any harder for those that dont want to have to think about preferancesthey just vote 1 for one person then their vote counts as per nowif abstain is alowed as a preferance it would be interesting to see how may votes end up there
i think your vote system needs some more workredistribution of unused votes sounds intresting but i see some problems with your implementationyou make no allowances for how the unused votes are to be redistributed and especially if there is more than 2 preferences this becomes more and more complexif the redistribution is not based on the original distribution of the secondairy choises but uses some other arbitrairy redistribution protocol then any preferred result can be atained simply by influencing what votes progress to their secondary choises and wich ones remain sticky with their first choiseso perhaps it would be better if all votes on a candidate with excess votes progressed to the next cadidate but as a fractional vote calculated on the number of votes in excess of the required amountbut even this becomes quickly complex as people may have secondairy votes on an already elected candidate causing even more fractional votes to be redistributedin all it still sounds intresting though
a change to make the csm as diverse as possible is very much order a uniform board is of absolutely no use to players or ccpnot based on blocs though as they in the perfect world should shift continuously but on occupationlocationempire lowhighnull pvpmisccarebear have candidates declare their primary focusoccupation and location when applying divide them into the six pools and aim at getting one from each at least with overflow votes being distributed within pool remaining seats are filled by most votes regardless of pool subterfuge during application process to be treated as breach of nda kick from council and gameis it democratic doesnt matter humanity is too damn ed to make that system work anyway and forced representation is used more often than not in the real world  especially in fledgling states iraq afghanistan etc
just for the record it isnt my voting system and different variations of stv are being used in elections around the world my rough sketch of the stv system above doesnt cover all the finer details but i thought my post was long and technical enough as it was i believe that your description on how to redistribute a fraction of all votes is known as the gregory method  and this is also the way i would prefer to do itas other have stated the inner workings of the stv system is very complex  however the complexity is hidden behind the scenes and not really something the voters have to worry about when they state their preferences this contrasts with our current system for the csm election which is very simple to understand but gives the voters a lot to worry about 
ahahahahaha this thread
the gregory method only calculates fractions once and deals differently with subsequent votes for candidates with an elect statusi think i would prefer the wright method intresting link btw if multible preferences were an option for this electionbut i do not see the need for such a complex voting system in an election that only has a 14 participation perhaps this becomes importand once we pass 30
or index war dec cost to the corp standing make standings actually mean something
ive always said it was too cheap to wardecbut then the other side of the coin can get quite alot of isk to do a wardec anywaycost change wont be enough i figure
this thread just sounds like another carebears unite whine thread this has always and will always be a pvp game problem solving any issue that may arrise in corp opposing corp or griefer corp is the very charm of this game i understand people just want to be in their own little eve universe but alas youre in a great big sand box and things can and will happen beyond your control i do admit that a proper surrender terms should always be an option as stated above terms of surrender should be provided from the war dec initiator in contract form of isk or items paid that would enforce peace for a certain set in terms by the initiator length of time of course ceos should be able to have a negotiation table to further adjustacceptdecline terms cooldown could then be set to immediate or a standard 24 hours peace time could be 1 month min to a year or indefinite this feature would enhance gameplay from the helpless feeling of a griefed corp and also assure the surrendering corp that the aggressor wont pull a fast one and continue killing anyways plus the aggressing corp can validly claim victory for their purpose this would also help reduce the need for corp jumping of course there cant always be an agreement on terms but at least there should be a legitimate option
love the idea supported
partially supported for this much money they should also allow logging in of that much characters at the same time i would not pay extra 15 for only training id rather have another account which i can also login
throw a couple of plexs on a character so i can refine its skills without pausing my main awesome
get negative on 3 chars make new account rinse and repeat
no this means free mineral if you reprocess the free ship you already get the 1 free tritanium also shuttles are a kind of a business nowadays judging from the sales historiesas of the proposal  the only thing this is needed is for total newbies who cant use the market or some obscure button they wont find i think this should work while any of the tutorials are active or maybe during the first month of playing
this all started with your troll post like it or not ccp confirmed that they dislikes the way you stacked the sandbox in your favor they have stated expressed interest in changing mechanics to end this playstyle regardless of what you think ccp advertised regardless of what you desire personally and regardless of what you post here its going to happen
i say we all just stop replying to finns multiquote responses and just let this silly little thread die back to the op brieflyyour dev quote was phrased as a question as a question it was phrased i fail to see how you respond to it as a statementthe way the lot of you respond like someones out to antagonize you is entirely all to paranoid and completely without reason you narrow minded silly fools dont have any thought outside your selfish little bubbles when you say sandbox you think that means a game where you dictate the rules 10 of the game population determining how everybody else should play is more than a little silly and frankly a waste of my time if it was your game i wouldnt play it and neither would 70 of the rest of the players i dont want 237 conflict and pvp and if i did id play bfbc2 all the time or until i got sick of hackers usually that takes about 15 minutes to an hour which is why i dont play bfbc2 much jerkoffs that use hacks bots and macros ruin games for everybody just like rmtswhy be blue to everyone around you good question because then you wont have to worry so much about losing sov or having to fight battles close to home as a result youll have virtual immunity to any loss of sov under the current system and can be carebears with better than empire iskhour which is what you all really want lots of isk with no one to contest it or get it before you do so you can do whatever you want and never worry about losing ships including titans its easy to pay for isnt it with all that free isk out in secure 00sure its a sandbox and you should be able to make youer own decisions but if thats how it works all space should be equal iskhour should be the same everywhere shouldnt itthe devs dont want to take away the sandbox theyre simply trying to find a way to make it work its not working right now as anyone with eyes can seemorsus mihi sucks btw bunch of euni alts and graduates what euni really does and why i dont like it freely recruit using alts in rookie chat and direct new players to live under nullsec alliance rule specifically their nullsec alliance if i had to guess who the alts leading euni really were id have to say it was the leaders of morsus mihi or a combination of alliances the whole graduate thing is realy just a test to see if players can function as a member of one of their large alliances the result of this is of course that euni gets the majority of newer players indoctinating them and making them alliance pets to do their biddingever asked yourself why ubercado happens to own a 40 billion isk mimir before pandemic legion started selling them if euni doesnt make isk and uses all its wealth to pay for training how does a director manage to pull that off highsec mission running not likely theyre full of it and are completely pulling the wool over peoples eyes pretending to be some super group of philanthropic tutors and nice guys they far from nice in fact theyre complete jerks irdalth delrar for example is scamming new and graduate students out of their hardearned isk with his plex a month because im a poor immigrant crap i read his multiple posts regarding his life sob story in the euni forums and i saw all the helpful responses and helpful handouts reading all the threads i found they lack consistency its a big lie thats assisted by euni directors philathropists yeah right bunch of scam artists running a dictatorshipmorsus mihi the white gloves of nullsec i feel somewhat similar with regards to that having experienced your antipirate methods first hand gank anyone is what you really do the whole lot of you lack integrity and rationalize your methods with its eve and experiencepersonally i hope the devs take your isk euni is run by rmt
who has a count of how many different people zero has called a troll in this thread alonewindjammer
echo chambers are much more efficacious without pesky facts getting in the way yeah thats not whats happening but you are right eve is not a game for everybody it would just be best if for those who dont like eve they left instead of trying to ruin it non sequitor also nonsensical as having different areas that differ in value is an essential conflictdriver its working perfectly right now its dishonest to claim that the metric for it working is getting a political arrangement that you personally like already covered ccp says youre wrong and they only provide the tools and rules but dont control game content beyond that yes but truth is no defense for your lying and trolling about my masters just like its no defense for your trolling about brown nosinggo figure a much more interesting count is the number of people who have been trolling i understand why that would be less sanguine with you of course
apparently the guy doesnt recognize sarcasm
funny how the same person will flip flop depending the argumentdont nerf sanctums because then there will be no point in claiming sov  the most important part they want you to pay attention to being its all about the isk as the reason to go into null secthe fact you dont even own space automatically means you dont know what your talking about and should be ignored  the most important part being owning space as the reason to go into null secso why are you in null sec you say that it is more profitable to run high sec level 4 missions already yet there you are in null sec is it possibly because owning space is your drive factor some are there for the isk and some are there for the glory of planting a flag and having their ticket show on the mapso your argument that with the anomaly change space that cant support sanctums andhavens will be empty is total and utter bull true you wont be there because you were there for the isk but the moment you leave someone will replace you who will be there for the sov ticker on the mapyour just bitter because you want your sov and sanctums too this is still possible you might have to take it from someone else first though
the lastest dev blog about sov changes shows that ccp doesnt have a desire to the fix the number one problem instead stall as long as they can and put shiney things up to say they are improving things at this point i dont want to see anymore changes none not until the main issue with this game is fixed fix the stupid lag this effects small gang warfare and large gang warefare this seems to be a move to try to drop down these numbers so theres not so many lag issues the problem with this is there is no counter to a mass super fleet without sub cap numbers if you get the numbers system lags down people get knocked offline and cant log back in reinforcing nods is fail i want to see a 2000 people in local battle that actually runs like the game intended no cycling guns no black screen this even happens with smaller fights people are leaving the game its getting boring dumb down the graphics if you have too but fix it you cant even use the tatics of bonuses right in game or logis cause it lags out spend the money now to fix the game before you talk about dust walking in stations changing spawns etc im truely tired of seeing tatics based off lag instead of actually fighting give us a reason to jump into that system with tons of people and lose our ships not jump in get disconnected and cant log in for 7 hours and get some lame duck excuse give us the reason to fight those caps give us the reason to hot drop that carebear give us a reason to continue to log in everyday before there is no reason anymore fdix the basic game plan before you do anything else fix the stupid lag give us back our sandbox
im betting its just about as many as the number of people who are persistently and accurately telling him he doesnt know what hes talking about on this subjectwindjammer
ccp controls its own game its really that simple zeros inability to see this simple fact has even driven him to have the delusional impression that his masters are going to go to iceland smack ccp on the nose with a rolled up newspaper and tell ccp how to run its own game he actually believes this approach has a chance of success personally if such a thing comes to pass id love to see the video of itunfortunately i do not believe zeros heroes are going to do something that unbelievably stupid the results would be hilariousccp has a vested interest in pleasing the entire player base not just a noisy minority if they have to reform the games framework to protect their financial interest they will do it no forum campaign and no player special interest group can or will stop them from doing whatever they want to do and what ccp can do is change the foundations of the game in such a way as to change what players do in the gameto argue that ccp does not control the eve environment at its very roots is absurd players play within what the foundation and framework allow nothing morewindjammer
so why does it matter if people post with altsbecause we dont know about their vested intereststhey could actually all be the same personthey could be multiple players but from the same allianceso why are people paranoid about ccps motivationwell experience im afraid ccp does not have a very clean record contrary to some earlier post the csm was not setup to provide player feedback but to provide independent scrutiny after some highly dubious gm activitiesif you needed proof of the need for the original csm you might like to know that o2o station was on its last timer and this time was changed by a gm so that the station came out early dt i think the first we knew of this was when we started forming to kill it and found it had come out and been repped so yes im a little paranoid perhaps but with good cause it should be noted that the core of the old band of developers have now joined the isk bank allianceit was said that bob kept null sec interesting ill challenge that view without the nc null sec would be very boring when bob launched the max campaigns they fought the nc drf wiped atlas out and looked like they would do the same to aaa who stopped them the nc if it wasnt for the nc everyone in null sec would be renting from isk bank by nowhow many other alliances have nurtured new alliances and players into null sec and then allowed themselves to find their own path the nc are the eve uni of null sec but of cause the elitists dont want to share null sec do theyand yet nobody in the thread has been willing to discuss genuine issues like sov mechanics and null sec structures i wonder why is it because they really dont care about the game
employing people not schooled in psychiatry and sociology says nothing about motivation  unless that is the primary field one works ingms are regular people and can be manipulated just as easily as the clerk at the hardware store i wouldnt be surprised if the hardcore has made a list of preferred gms and their approximate work schedules i would if i gave a crapas for nc being oh so good for eve wasnt the whole moon exploit thing primarily done by northernersin the northsure the majority might have been out of the loop but the illgotten gains most likely benefited them
actual no it wasnt it was bob and their allies if i remember correctlyedit checked and it was ev0ke who were banned they were allied with bob at the time but to be fair i cant find any reference to other alliances being involved although i thinks its likely as players move around the game
yes you proceed to provide a fine example of thatjust as synonyms often have similar meanings rather than identical so your chain of rewording the original statement until you get the meaning you want is fallacious no matter the sophistry you employ it is a fact that encouragement of a behaviour is fundamentally different from forcing a behaviour an ingame example is that incursion ship penalties do not force you to fight an inconvenient incursion despite what some mouthbreathers have claimed instead of trying to remove them one can temporarily relocate or change ones activities for the duration if one is missionrunning in a pimped enough ship you could even ignore the penalties completely and continue even if they are more difficult and less lucrative while the incursion is present the point is ccp tend to make adjustments that dont force a change in sandbox play but change the costbenefit of different activities since players arent machines costbenefit is always weighed with personal preferences in mind people dont all play optimally constantly because it is a sandbox any balanced change ccp do make will have diluted consequences on behaviourif ccp do introduce changes making nullsec conflict a bit more attractive and being blue with too many others a bit less attractive it wont turn brother against brother but it may cause some ropey marriages of convenience to finally fall apart in bitter acrimony except different types of gameplay are interlinked and have far reaching consequences which can come back to the originator nullsec wars have historically been a major mineral sink and source of demand and as such are hugely important to have the economy work like i said youre focusing on your one corner of the sandbox ccp have to watch over the entire gameoh and before you hurf and blurf your analogy about industry again ill say that its far easier to tweak the supplyside mechanics without any consequence on player behaviour than it is to fix shortfalls in demand
loltoo funnyseriously though how many times will nc dig up the dead horse that is t20 and blame it for every mistake they make a dead alliance is still pwning you even nowalso my favorite part is how you go out of your way and claim that nc is responsible for young alliances ability to grow and out in the cold cruel environment that is null sec all of this is totally not possible without ncs guiding handawww they care so much tearoh yeah and apparently if your not part of the nc it means your a cheating dev who does rmt with russians v0v
actually none of that matters the points and arguments made are what matter not the mouth or mouthpiece they come from otherwise its just ad hominem
well i mentioned that ccp devs are still behaving inappropriately it true so what is wrong with thatas for support new players and alliances into nul sec did i say it would not happen without the nc or did i say the nc had a positive influencedid i say that if you werent part of the nc you were a rmter no but i did warn that if it wasnt for the nc you might find the servers dominated in that way as is currently the case in china
actually it does matter because there is very little being said by these people further if for arguments sack they were all one player with multiple alts it might appear as if there was an issue rather than one player with an axe to grindso sorry i tend to pay scant regard to alt posters
to the alts why arent you supporting the idea of more npc regions of a viable size similar to venal all over eve to allow pvp corps and alliance to raid or launch attacks against established alliances
its telling that you can only troll about the facts and call them a rant equally obvious is that even when i provide ccps own words showing that youre wrong youll still argue dishonestly to try to claim youre right yet again ccp creates the rules and the tools and players control how the nullsec game actually evolves you are using the fallacy of composition to pretend that because ccp controls certain aspects of the game they control it in toto you are using the fallacy of division to work from that fallacious conclusion to a claim about ccp controlling playercreated content you are also using the fallacy of equivocation to shift a discussion from controlling game mechanics themselves to controlling what players do within the constraints of those game mechanics its interesting that certain posters are either unwilling or actually unable to make their own points without trolling windys fascination with a masterservant dynamic is somewhat odd as well not that theres anything wrong with the bdsm crowd of course its just odd to see internet spaceship politics cast in that perceptual mold and the fallacy of equivocation again saying that ccp controls how the game is played is a little bit like saying that because car manufacturers can choose to include cruise control or not that they can control whether you go for a leisurely drive or plow your suv into a crowd of people and of course it ignores the fact that by ccps own statement theyve designed the game so that players create the actual content in playercontrolled space windys rationalization that the bottom line is all important is more than a bit selfserving obviously who thinks that the argument would be the same from him if ccp decided it could build revenue by selling his personal details to every datamining informationcollection and advertising firm on the planet no you were engaged in semantic gaming and tried to claim that looking at the logical implications of your argument was a strawman too okay seriously please learn the terms youre using there were neither any logical or rhetorical fallacies present even if you like the sound of the word fallacious and yes that is forcing someone just like if someone puts a gun to your head and says do what i tell you theyre just providing incentives and disincentives etc and breaking sandbox play so you can effect the entirety of eve doesnt change matters again players are free to for instance all go into nullsec together sing hippy songs and mine veldspar in peace and brotherhood thats part of sandbox gameplay ccp would not then be justified in saying that the economy has to move along a certain way and teleporting random pilots to jove space where they have to thunderdome it to the death or both pilots lose their ships
no thats an ultimatum not an incentive youre deliberately confusing the two there is some overlap with extreme incentives but they are not the same thinghow about an example im sure youll forgive my use of ad absurdum youve used it enough yourselflets say ccp for some reason want people to run lvl 4 missions more and nullsec sanctums less they decide to do this by nerfing sanctum bounties and increasing lvl 4 rat bountiesis this an ultimatum forcing you to run missions instead what if they change both sets of bounties by 1 is that forcing you to change your behaviour breaking the sandbox according to some statements youve made in this thread perhaps it is most would disagree even you would if you were being honest rather than conflating two different terms to try and make a point what about 3 15the other major factor to take into account when weighing the two options is risk an area where personal preference is very important some are very averse to risk some prefer it most are in between so for a risk averse player perhaps a 3 change in the bounties is enough to make them abandon sanctums and turn to empire missions for someone whos happy to take a bit of risk perhaps itd be 8 for those who much prefer to be ratting with a bit of danger to keep things interesting and to be operating in their sovereign space maybe a 15 change in bounties is still acceptable even if not ideali think everyone would agree that a change of say 80 is so extreme a difference in incentives that its essentially an ultimatum forcing players to act differently the problem with your position is that you have been decrying any interference out of principle no matter the magnitudeone final note i am also rather skeptical of the that you would object so strenuously to ccp interfering in the sandbox based on principle if it was a change you liked say halving the fuel costs of jbs implementing a treaty system or further buffing the isk fountain that are anoms perhaps its alright if ccp change the sandbox to increase the incentive for players to operate in nullsec as opposed to empire
more semantic gaming im just providing you an incentive for compliance you get to keep on breathing now the disincentive for disobedience by denotation an ultimatum is an enforced disincentiveyoure also now confusing the issue of being able to force a change in behavior with trying to force a change in behavior just because an attempt isnt successful doesnt mean its not an attempt thats not a problem thats intellectual consistency ah well
so it is a specific subtype of incentivisation im glad we agreemost mechanics ccp implement have nonenforced incentives i point you again to the example of incursions not at all i was showing that not all players will make the same decision when reevaluating their activities after ccp make changes we arent a hivemind after all here it is both
im a drake and i agree that npc 00 is too difficult to accessi too understand that even if there was more reasonable step from low sec to npc 00 warp bubbles combined with blobs are real problem thereive many times suggested making npc 00 more like low sec so its easier to move around without having alt to scout every gate etc and give easier access to more profitable npc 00 like stainvenalfountaindelve also npc 00 areas are too small well at least those which are actually interesting
how is it possible to tell the alts from nonalts within this context corporate tags mean little in fact corporate tags may be used to obscure the nature of the poster say you have a guy that has alts in multiple corpsalliances or has multiple alts in one corpalliance vested interests abound and are denied in the face of obvious and clear evidence to the contrary the reasoning must be examined in each case and the reasoning is the measure by which you can judge the merit of the position that is taken you must also examine who the position will benefit not who appears to be supporting the positionwindjammer
ccps primary motivation is to stay in business and make money real life money not in game money all other issues overridden by the primary motivation indiscretions have been committed by ccp staff and if i recall correctly the guilty parties have universally met with dismissal at least in the case of the most prominent indiscretions there is not a company or government in the world that can 100 guard against such thingsfor the record the catalyst for the original concept of the csm was not solely gm indiscretion the primary catalyst was due to a developer indiscretion by comparison the gm problem was mild though still something that needed to be dealt withthe csm was originally conceived as a player based oversight committee with limited investigative powers it was never established or setup as such after considering the problems ccp decided to form their own internal investigation and security division this group of people have far more mobility and investigative power within the ccp organization than could ever be sanely given to an outside group additionally ccp is better able to handle serious indiscretions quietly and quickly and therefore minimize damage to ccp the company and eve the game in the end its a better solution than the original concept for the csmat the same time ccp saw that the csm could be used in a slightly different way by players and ccp itself thus the finalized concept of the csm was that of a player based lobby and advisory group privy to some details within ccp that arent dispensed to the general publicwindjammer
the reasons people post with altsthey are banned on their mainsthey are being paid to tehehe damn right waddupthey are in a serious buisness alliance that fines them for posting stupidly in other words their opinions rather than what their alliance wants them to think most of these being blob alliances btwthey are highsec carebears who want to destroy 00 for youi mean really which of these is the likely answerit is already obvious to anyone who finished highschool that the real vested interest here comes from coalition grunts trying to turn that back on anyone who supports these changes and ccps new stance is completely absurdccp hi guys we want to make the game more funplayer 1  yessfellraven you are god damned bias wanna wreck our game post with your main you biassed got
the ignorance hypocrisy and dishonesty of this troller are amazing he knows the names of a variety of logical fallacies and thats it he knows the names he has little understanding of them other than that he simply injects them into his rationalized post in hopes of convincing someone he has a level of intelligence he does not and probably never will possess at the same time he accuses others of not understanding the terms they very clearly do understandits amazing to watch him commit the same logical fallacy that hes inaccurately accusing someone else of making and all in the same paragraph he does this not just to me but to everyone and not just in this thread but in virtually every thread he posts in what else is there to do except laugh at his incompetence hes built so many straw men to argue against that he could easily afford to spare enough to feed the horses on a moderately sized ranchenvironment drives the formation of social dynamics political or otherwise the very universe of eve is controlled by ccp the freedom players have within the framework of that universe is completely at ccps discretion through use of rules and tools and changes to these ccp has the ability to exert pressures which change the way players play change the framework and the player interaction changes change the framework in the right way and you obtain a modification to player interaction that you may desirearguing to the contrary is illogical irrational dishonest and the very picture of sticking your head in the sand to make a reality youre not happy with go awaywindjammer
quoting awesome
the whole point of nullsec is very easyits called risk vs reward high sec carebears should not be making more isk running their level 4 missions there is no risk to running missions in high sec and running around to the neighboring systems low sec has more risk so you earn more per mission as opposed to running high sec missionsso the next obvious statemment would be this the risk in nullsec is much higher then either lowsec or highsec drag bubbles dichics passing through controlled systems full of jb networks making nullsecs rewards below that of highseclowsec mission running means people wont go into nullsec not all of us keep a neutral alt in highsec running lvl 4s all day while we pvp in nullsec
ive made it fairly clear in the past that i dont really trust csm members there are two reasons for this1 csm have access to dev information and nda stuff which makes it easier for them to exploit the game system effectively a csm with programming experience can encourage changes that make it easier for himher to program invisible hacks bots and macros to exploit the game it also gives the opportunity for them to be forewarned about changes that would make it easier to catch botters hackers and rmts2 csm members account for a very small percentage of the playerbase and generally pursue their own goals and seldom care about the rest of the communities opinion any one of us might agree with csm on some points but really do we agree with any on all points no i dont believe thats possible and those that do are likely just followingplayerbase voting centers in game with the coming incarna features would be a far better mean s to poll the community on upcoming changes dock at any station unpod and walk into the voting center a brief interaction with the agent there and you recieve a poll sheet to fill out news of new votes being cast could be relayed on billboards and in the login screeni think this would be far more comprehensive and return greater results than bouncing ideas off a handful of peoplekeep the csm if you want but limit their access use them only as an addition to the playerbase polling while presenting them with majority votes as received through that venue this would be more practical and achieve greater results from which to determine the best course for future developmentalso remove the assembly hall  speakers corner or limit it make it so players can only click support in speakers corner and limit new topics to one post per week per player in assembly hall limit assembly hall responses to 2 supports per day and remove posting responsesleave that to the ideas forum
hands cassus his tinfoil hatdude really okfirst of all we are not ebil creatures out to ruin your internet spaceships we are actual here to make it better csm represents the player base that voted i m sure most of us would def not be using this huge overlaod of work to just get dev hax or exploit we care about this community and game enough to dedicate a minimum of 1 year to this council and what it meansnow to your actual point on opening things up to player votes ccp cant effectively run if they had to turn every discussion point into polls each one would be its own circus with half the population not voting and powerblocs rallying votes in an even more skewed way to influence outcomes believe it or not while many of the csm delegates represent large groups it doesnt mean we dont want to try and make everything better for everyone
hey charlie sheen i think the op found your missing cokeanyway tbh this is the first time in the 7 almost 8 years that i have any confidence in anything that ccp does also the first time ever that i have even taken an interest in the csm i have spent the last 4 years fighting mittens and his riff raff in this game it is the only thing that gives me pleasure really in this game and i have done everything this game has to offer except devthis game is severely broken i am almoast always on the edge of selling everything and doing something incredibly dumb yet exciting like buying that rev bpc and gate camping in it till it dies kinda be a cyvok in my own right but for now i am going to hold on and play instead of joining the ranks of bitter vets so sincerely thanks mittens and cofor some reason mittens gives me a bit of hope that some attention will be given to this game and the broken parts of ittime will tell but i for one will be watching this csm closely and with interest
direct democracy is a terrible idea
dude thats original ccp cant function if a playerbase polling system is introduced really what is so difficult about asking the playerbase a question red hats or blue i imagine its far more trouble to gather csm and put the questions out that wayi voted but i dont hold much confidence in those i voted for i live in a democratic country and recognize how much bull it is democracy by proxy is absolute garbagepowerblocs rallying votes from the playerbase what would you call the last voting session for csm then right powerblocs manipulating votes by pushing their alliance members to vote for them all whats in an individuals best interests isnt it and you all get a free trip to iceland too niceso please explain to me how the powerblocs are going to persuade and manipulate votes out of the vast majority of eve players free chewtoys i know some of them are rabid but i expect they can find their ownsee how impressed i am with your being csm shows the respect youve all earned doesnt itheres the truth since csm has been implemented the vast majority of eve has become disatisfied with changes made to the game pure success right there in the last 34 years alone the game has been in a downward spiral this is what happens when you rely on ten people to provide opinions for over 400000i wont say some of you dont care as i know that is not true some do in every election and some of those may actually chair in a csm the fact is i find most of your business utter nonsense and cant believe were all relying on you to provide our voice to ccpi am by the way quite convinced that access to that material is of interest to some lets face it were talking about real money here by your logic rmt dont even exist yet they do and what better way to refine ones code than accessing ccps very own codebase seems pretty simple to me i think youre wearing a tinfoil hat which is to say youre entirely blind to reality it must be nice to live under the delusion that everything is tea and cupcakes and people are only bad in a game the world doesnt work that waysure maybe im wrong about trebor and ive considered the alternative hes really just a giddy little kid who cant keep his hands out of the butter he loves butter butter is the most important thing in the worldmaybe im wrong about euni too but i am entitled to my opinion and suspicion even if im wrong about that it doesnt change the fact that they are utter reprehensible jerks i havent found anybody who wasnt a lapdog that disagreed with me on that point at all everybody agrees on this though dont challenge them and leave them alone they have the ability to completely screw up your game and make it so its not even worth playing anymore why is thati could speculate and have isds gms etc better for who
so ccp can directly ignore all the players directly sure why notit would save on a few flights to iceland that we have to pay for to be ignored
my god the horror please please please stop butchering the english language learn how to type properly for all our sakes should only be used when you wish to continue a sentence that naturally should be split into two and you dont need a comma after every 3 wordsas for the crap between the bad grammar stop being so paranoid csm actually has brought about some good changes they bring the best of our ideas to ccp
because you still need someone online for that with the method i described you dont need anyone online you can just open a screen and click a button to copy them

there are any number of mechanics that could be enabled to allow situational murder
well the way the video presents it is kinda neat you have troops working on the ground to do the bidding of capsuleers in space and fleets fighting it out to prevent orbital bombardments going on against planets and pod pilots assassinating each other in stations over conflicts going on on the ground thatd be cool
i support ganking in stations if i can gun down the mittani
horrible idea why bother going to take someone elses good sector when you can just defend your own and wait for it to upgrade at much lower cost in lost ships this would remove intensives to fight over territory not increase them your logic is flawed
nopeople active in a nul sec system should have a civilising affect on itpopping all those rats and installing order should improve the sec to high sec status safe spaceit certainly is not any riskierbasically fight for good spots crap space should remain crap space in relation to good space otherwise people have zero incentive to move and seek out better systems

were going to see an endless array of these  threads from nc authors supported mostly by nc sycophants why because the truesec in the north is not so great you nc pilots have been up to your armpits in the richest moons in the game for a long time now and youve been fine with this monopoly on t2 construction materials throughout your new found egalitarianism is so much transparent tripe
i admit im fairly ignorant of nullsec but wouldnt the ops suggestion mean that the larger power blocs would just eat up systems after other people did the work to upgrade them otoh if the sec status was reset surely thered be no value in taking them which would keep things pretty stagnant
to those saying no because there would be no incentive to take better space sthis would allow you to make bad space okay okay space good and good space great however great space cant get any betternow why are you wrong simple  on the whole there is simply put not enough great space in eve to fit the playerbase that is willing to fight for it skirmishes and invasions are great  they keep gameplay interesting however if its physically impossible for you to take and hold an area of space because a larger population wants it than can physically fit in it well then you have an area of dead space that cannot be utilizedadditionally this would help smaller alliances out  they can take some lessthanprime space and make it worth their while where as now theyre simply stuck either renting or being a pet or in empirefinally this makes upgraded areas an area of potentially greater conflict  what would be better than seeing someone spend time and effort upgrading space only to get fat and lazy and kicked out by a smaller more organized group as it is there are some areas of space that are simply not worth fighting over
all im hearing is poor me the only way i know how to make isk is farming sanctums in a carrier in a cyno jammed system
1 i hope i have found the right spot that being said i would like to ask any art is on player side if this is the case then why can we not use logos or even paint our own ships

supported if only because ccp failed to provide adequate notice of the last 2 changesno notice at all for requiring sse2 and less than a months notice for requiring sm3their upgrade offer with evga was then a kick in the teeth for players on agp motherboards or laptopsccp your customers deserve better
no notice on the sse2 since no one uses computers that dont have the capability so naturally the normal testing didnt encounter the problem seriously the whineage about that was nonexistant for a good reasonon the sm3 you are right if by less than a months notice you mean over 2 years notice devblog1 laying out the planfollowup explaining why it wasnt adopted as planned another blog warning about the changes that was going to come in the second quarter of 2011 the latest blog was only to remind people about it and to announce the exact date of the change the fact that you dont read devblogs and it became as a surprise to you can hardly be considered a failing of ccp
welcome to the 21st century enjoy your stay
the minimum specs are already old old technology  i have a 5 year old laptop that can run things easily on low settingsnew rigs are not expensive compare how often you use it to get an average costif people are unwilling or unable to upgrade such old technology  well you have bigger issues to worry abouteve is supposed to be a premier online game it therefore needs to keep with modern technology
ccp showed off a dx10 incarna client i cant wait my 6870 will love iti have several pieces of hardware here and even the low end onboard hd3300 can run eve on low while i understand some people are poor and poverty is only getting worse and worse there is a limit to how much developers should and can limit themselves at some point in time they have to move forwardif you really dont have the money you dont even need to buy new a second hand motherboard cpu and video card that can run eve doesnt cost muchif you cant afford that you shouldnt be playing eve you should stop grazing and go out on the streets and demonstrate against the corporatocracy whore bleeding us dry and turning humanity into their slaves1 ggo to thezeitgeistmovementcom2 learn about the venus project and educate yourself3 4 profit prepare for the inevitability of martial law yes its coming
killing bot users one system at a time i approve of cutting out support for ancient systems
if they dont want to upgrade they obviously dont want to play the game eitherif they cant afford to upgrade to technology thats already four or five years old then they need to take a hard look at their finances  a change of priorities may be in orderas for new players they fall into one of the above categories  they will either choose to upgrade and play or not and as ccps subscriber count keeps climbing id say theyre falling into the will upgrade category
lets not forget ccp wants customers to have multiple accounts and people want to run them on a single system there are not many other mmos where someone would want to run 35 clients so ccp needs to maintain a very lean client take away the ability to run multiple clients because of a bloated client could hurt ccps business
while i agree with the consensus i do have to say this muchccp is making a terrible mistake in making such movestheres been an ever increasing bloatware affect when it comes to their clientsused to be i could run this game easily on my macbook pro now the damn thing pushes the core temps to 90c wtf used to never crack 75on the pc i should be able to run 2 clients without flinching well should being the key wordwith these new and awesome changes that changed once againas proof in the pudding i accidentally left eve online up and was playing other games and didnt even notice the hesitation in the slightestwhen i launched 2 clients the system nearly crashedsomethings missing hereill say this much while everyone assumes its easy to shell out 2 to 500 bucks for upgrades i say eff you peopleseriouslyi have bills to pay and a large stack of games to get too eve is not the center of my world and i well not buy a single pcmac unit to just play eve onlinethey need to slow the progression down and i mean way downits time they start concentrating on fixing the game glitches and bugs and less on improving things such as graphicsagain i agree with the majority the actual advancements have been forewarned and preannouncedbut i will not just sit here and call it par for the course when i can see very easily what the handwriting on the wall really saysi love the game but not enough to be forced into a major hardware upgradeno thanks ill pass on that onemy biggest pet peeve today is ccp favors the new accounts and the new subscribers all the while completely ignoring us 2 to 5 year pilotstheir retention focus is completely and utterly trashed these dayshope they have enough money to advertise like hell cause we are their advertisers and we are the ones bringing people to the gameits getting to the point where i have to nod and grin when talking about this game i feel like im the one fooling myself here anymore
do you really think that sov holding alliances care about sanctums and havens they have just been introduced they managed damn well without them before these are just goodies for the players to make isk that is all alliances do not depend one single bit on theseinfact the care that much that they rent almost all systems out at even more silly prices and they will continue to do so even if they get a little nerfedalliances do not fight over true sec of systems never have never willthey fight over moons yes thats it moons and this is where all the money comes from for alliances mainly you have to nerf moongold not bloody anomolies thats for 00 players to make isk for ships and stuffalso do you not realise that doing this doesnt help small alliances or corps you have done absolutley nothing to help small alliances get into 00 at all the large entities still hold the region and the stations small alliances cannot hold sov because the larger alliances with thier 200 super cap fleet comes in and removes them in an instant they cannot form logistics because they cant get through 00 without getting slaughtered and they cant make jbs cos they cant get sov seriously do you have even a little clueunless you drastically change how 00 works small alliances will never have the chance in 00 ever without either paying stupid amounts of rent or getting killed constantlyso onto moongold you have to do something about this and one solution is randomise the moons on a monthly basis stop having constant flow of moongold every month the minerals change so the powerblocs dont just have massive income and become invincible where they can build super after super after super and lose without any consquence its ridiculousthis means that they will have to go out and search for those moons and of course this will cause more of the pvp you want in 00 because everyone will want to find those moons even smaller alliances will then have a chance to make some isk for at least a monthyou have to removechange the constant isk making machine that is moonsthe same alliances have controlled eve 00 for years now and will continue to do so for ever because they have a massive advantage over all others i see eve just becoming a chinese server again i mean its pretty much russian server as it isand yes some alliances have died but only to other big alliances or fail cascade but the same old people just get recycled into the other big alliances anywayyou must do something about this constant isk making machine that is moonsps  make supers uninsureableeek
the rebalance of nullsec anomalies is about reducing isk faucetsmoon goo is not an isk faucetclosing some isk faucets will help stem the tide of super carrier proliferation increasing the possibility of meaningful conflict over the static point source incomes of moons
signed this is the true problem with the game at the moment static sources of income are not good for eve anymore they were in the beginning of the game but we need to move past this and evolve a new era of everemovemoon minersstatic anoms upgradesbeltsaddt2 dynamic mineral moons that can be scanned with a ships on board scanner and mined with mining shipsboost anoms with normal rats and make them spawn on a lvl that belt rats spawn now more ded belts in every system in the game that would fix most of eves current problems over night imo
yeah could make things interesting
truesec should absolutely be dynamic and if depeletion is good for pi its good for moons
while i do enjoy what we have now this would be a much better approach then the current drive ccp seems to be going forsupported
agreed
the more ratting being done the higher the sec status should goso after a couple months of turbo ratting sanctums etc the system should loose spawns significantly and the alliance will have to move on and will eventually be forced to fight over new better territory
i support a dynamic security status systemsupported
signed i want to have your babes now
not supported heres a better idea how about concord the navy etc respond quicker and stronger based on the attacked players standing to what ever faction of space you are in it would make your standings worth something other than bragging rights
ive been trying to analyze combat logs today and have run into the problem of how hard they are to work with to collect datamy proposal is to adjust the way combat logs are written so they can be easily imported into a spreadsheet as comma delineated txt filesi know not an exciting proposal but it would make postcombat analysis feasible and make combat logs useful instead of just epeen

this has been an issue for ages and seriously needs sorting out because its annoying as hellreally should i be stuck on an asteroid when i am nowhere near it really i can look to be at least 20km from a roid and still get bounced around should i ever get stuck on a station really is that even possible there is a serious clipping issue in eve which needs addressing
agreedit is rather annoying to be stuck on a roid that is just nowhere near you

in its current state fof missiles are beyond unreliable i took out my rattlesnake and loaded it up with hunters to test them out i went on a quest to check up on a colony and protect a convoy ship or somethinglots of enemies around me so i let it rip only to find out that all my missiles happily zoned in on the nonhostile npc convoy ship i needed to protect just because it was the closest target in range while the 8 enemy ships were banging away at my shields asking for free sugar so if anything i hope it gets fixed so these fof missiles actually work as they are supposed to ie engage hostile targets
i agree with removing their tendency to attack friendly logisticsbut i honestly do not mind them attacking npc structuresfof misiles are curretly ment to be used when you are being jammedhaving them prefer targets that are projecting ecm seems reasoneble but having them ignore structures completely would just lead to even more afk mission runningalso a more complex targeting formula would be much more difficult to predict for the user than closest hostile first besides possibly leading to drone like targeting misbehaviourso all things said and done i think i disagree with your proposal
dig it eveside need a way for a dawg to be not a dawg what another dawgs can shot maybe a thing what a top dawg diplomant can click or a thin what a dawg can put on he ship so a dawg can be all about safe recyclien in they space dignow wit a dawgs idea a dawg be safe when him be recyclien no dawg can even shot him if him wit a posse or gang whats been given immunity from by another posse or gang better for reconomics kuz now a dawg dont get busted when him got a cart of sweet rock recyclien or recovery goods to in him trunk but not agains a dawg what dont got no diplomancy goin on digit only works on like 1 or 2 dawgs so a dawg get painted red but aint gettin no targets by no dawg and aint gettin no shotswordbe safe

no he never does its amusing in cp in the assembly hall its asinine if you expect people to take your seriouslywhich i am pretty sure he doesnt so no harm done
no
you do realize that any stealth bomber frigate can fit cyno or covert cynos right
by that thinking then all race drone specializations should be removed so there is less skill involved in launching t2 dronesare you serious
except that drones have different tracking speed optimal and fall off depending on race its akin to completely swapping your weapon systems
you can always spot the drake pilot as soon as he opens his mouth
its not rocket science guys
if you honestly think this is a drone nerf youre ed anyone thats spent the time to train sentries has already gotten the racial drone specialization skills up to at least threeits a nice appropriate buff for a class of ships that needs a moderate boost supported
this otherwise i support this topic
youre a roaming gang lawful if people play docking games roam elsewhere and find other kills as is there is nothing wrong with people playing station games you came to them asking for a fight    they didnt come to you so you play by their rules not the other way around stop whining and move on to other targets
absolutely not it is literally impossible for logistics ships to survive for an entire aggression timer without receiving reps a battleship can deaggress because he can rely upon logistics ships to keep him up while hes not shooting a logistics ship cannot simply halt cap transfer on his partner for 30 seconds theyll both get blown out of the skyuntil youve actually flown a logistics ship keep your nose out of aggression mechanics you obviously dont understand themoh and by the way blue pill cyclonemaelstromvargur with an xlarge shield booster say theres no difference between cap and shield transfer you cannot make that distinctionnot supported and i hope the csm is smart enough to know its a stupid idea too
 this is hownerf carrier undock games if you like but in some way that doesnt have stupid knockon effects as i suggested
if you had paid attention to what was talked about at fanfest you would realise that what your talking about is part of what dust 514  having forces that can infiltrate fight forcapture opponents instalations presently only planetary but maybe long term poss giving more important life to the enemy from within senario that ccp likes so much  incarna is going to be about in the long term eventually being able to walk in stations ships and poss giving one the ability to covertly wheel and deal and plot to their hearts content possibly bring down a corp or alliance along the way however your problem is still with moons and how they havent been balanced some have suggested that this be fixed by having a depletion mechanic tied into it but this would also require reduction changes to the mechanics of poss  their modules regard anchoring  unanchoring times to compensate for the constant need to be more mobile perhaps a better solution is to tie r16  r24 moons more into the requirements for ship production not just for t2 production inconjuction with minerals this would give a wider spread of valuable moons across the board  stop technium moons from being the sole moons of any great value hence even small alliances or corps would also be able to get a slice of the isk pie
your ideas suckthe only thing you kinda hit on that everyone knows is an issue is tech moon vs other moons need to be rebalanced your idea regarding paying isk for double training is horribad 1st people with a ton of isk would just create toons and basically fastforward them to supers in half the time it takes to currently train them it would also get rid of the feeling of accomplishment currently enjoyed after monthsyears of skilling in realtime toward max skills in one ship or another go back to wow and your double xp weekends and im a baby carebear fairness routines
which is why i also stated that people with certain amount of sp can do it say 20 mill sp to use the double sp so people cant do just that and exploit it and on a side note i never played wow and never will
itt nerds copy pasting a phrase for free isk op left butthurt  out of pocket after not being elected
im just glad that this csm doesnt appear to have any interpersonal issues
yet
i would like to point out that really what you have is3  goonstest nc bffs2  nc1  drf3  non powerbloci will agree that the csm is power bloc heavy but is not nc controlled but yes ncgoontest is 59 of the seatsadditionally i think the op is right in the gist of the message you may not like our in game position but those of us who are here are not hear to screw everyone else we are here to make the game we love better for all i do hope we get the chance to do so properly together as 1 team
death does get along better with mittens then with the nc as a whole
ncs idea of better for everyone is maintaining the status quo and eventually changing the server name from tranquility to trammel

look weve been given got paranoia smears and fallacies on top of you want cites too have you no shame
what a load of bull goons and test fall right under the nc dictated standings and have been for a while now so please stop trying to spin it like they are not part of the nc5  nc1  drf3  non powerblocthat is the list
culturally the clusterfck coalition and the nc are very different resources and manpower are also managed differently
what we really have is5  cheeseburger inhaling yanks1  milk bagger1  dropbear farmer1  chocolatier 1  upstanding individual from a glorious countryi worry
you cant expect peoples respect when you have any for others and the only opinion that counts its yours this is a factmaybe start by avoiding pubbie and gay pride comments in a game forum it should be a good start and this is for all the starting block goonies waiting posts like mine to add not english native i answer thank god im not
the nc basically consists of a dozen alliances that constantly snipe moons from each other at every opportunity they are not friends in the sense that gsf and test are
i was unaware goons and test had reset the rest of the nc apologies thenwhen did you reset your standings with them how does it feel to be independent and able to stand on your own for once without the other alliances in nc to prop you up
it surprises me more that people still think that the csm will have some kind of major influence on ccps goals or currently lack ofthe only thing that i want this csm to do is place spycams around the ccp headquarters so that we can see that ccp is usually just busy sticking their fingers up their asses pretending to know what actually goes on in this game and i would like to get a backdoor into their logging system because i would really love to see those nonshowing logs
dont say ive never done nuthin for ya
hey finn we can add racist to your list nowwow he mad
fatcats whose sole interest is in maintaining the flawed status quo can blob the few common sense votes on the councilit will be the first csm cycle where the council has absolutely no impact on the game csm1 doesnt count because it was a media stunt one can only hope it is too little too late and that ccp already has an outline for sov mkiii in place plus the balls to flip the fingersinear csm the birdbeing glad for not being a native english speaker is not racist it is very rational indeed western world has eaten itself to death and is drowning in its own refuse and corruptionlong live the east
it sounds like to me that you have issues separating real life from fantasy the characters that the goons and nc play in eve are not who they are in real life and its the real life people who are going to be manning this csm they have a large stake in both repairing and maintaining integrity in eveget your heads out of your asses people and wake upgrow up for once we have a csm comprised of members who really play this game for all its worth and very much want to see this game succeed let them try and give them some damn encouragement i for one will laugh out ing loud when its the nc that finally succeeds where all others have failed and ill be laughing at the nay sayers
thank god you all didnt vote that guy with aspergers onto the csm that is the last thing we need
being blue and being friends are far from the same thingyour alliance claims they trolled own out of the nc or something i dont even know when i was in the nc the constant excuse given to us for being blue to goons was we hate goons but we hate bob more now days most people dont know most of their friends and most likely never willso tell us again why would you be blue to everyone around you and if you can do that why would you be blue to everyone around you in free pvp area of evei have a feeling this isnt about singing songs by a campfirealthough i do look forward to your suggestions for conflict drivers and how to manage the lagfests occuring through sheer numbers atm

can you please start posting song lyrics again those were more interesting than these posts of yours
step 1 in forging an effective csm create a monoculture that can trivially be sidelined and dismissed by ccp as being unrepresentative of the playerbase as a whole and useless as a source of unbiased feedback
most of us expect epic failure youve got one year to valiantly prove us wrong do not waste it
generally people try not to be so brazen about their utter lack of understanding but i guess we all have to have something to be proud of
yeah first when i saw the csm voting results i was like wtf goons and nc control the csm its time to ragequit but then i was like who cares ccp isnt listening to csm anywayi thus wish nice vacations in iceland to all the new csm delegates send me a post card btw may i still petition mittani for insulting me in local

if youre tired of seeing articles of the type the mittani wrote if you want to see something better write supporttentonhammercom give them your honest opinion of the mittanis article theyll appreciate the inputwindjammer
how witty do you think i think i am please provide examples and show your workwindjammer
just wondering but have you considered not trolling maybe just as a change of pace to switch things up a bit do you perhaps have some sort of fetish about masters that youre trying to work out on the internet you seem quite fixated on the masterservant dynamic you are aware that there are some private clubs that cater to that sort of thing yes do you perhaps really not understand the points i made beyond the fact that they were mordant here since sarcasm and logic seem not to get the point throughthis presupposes that either you are a reader of tentonhammer which will make them question why someone was so dense as to read their site for an extended period of time and not realize than an opinion column was an opinion column and will then change their editorial standards for such brain donors or that youre not a reader and they particularly care what random folks on the internet who arent even giving them traffic think these are both deeply flawed assumptions likewise if you are not a reader and you tell them i dont like you having opinions in your opinion columns they have no reason to take you seriously if you are a reader they have even less reason to take you seriously however if you arent even a reader the hollowness of your threats becomes even more apparent after all if youre not a reader how do you know what vibe and tone theyre going for random uninformed angry people are dime a dozen on the internet why would they take you seriously youre not helping them attract advertisers youre not helping them build their sites statistics and most of all they have no reason to believe an uninformed angry internet person is really going to read their site if the reason that angry internet person is writing in is obviously because theyve been greatly upset by an internet spaceship editorial i dont read your site never have and i obviously dont get it but if you change how you do things ill totally read it scouts honor and in either case you are helping spread word of mouth and attract readers to see the controversy since nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd you are quite frankly irrelevant at worst and a source of comedy to their editorial staff at best thats the only appreciating theyll do or as pointed out in fewer words
supporttentonhammercom write them and give them your opinion of the mittanis article its as easy as posting on the forums you have nothing to lose publications who let their writers hand out misinformation do not as a rule retain a followingwindjammer
so thats a no then you refuse to stop trolling and i suppose as an addendum you refuse to get any better at it hint one of the two of us is emotional and irrational one of us is pointing out the facts and logical errors inherent in and angry internet letter writing campaign one of us is hoping to organize an angry internet letter writing campaign in order to get an online publication to fire one of its writers because he wrote an internet spaceship opinion piece that he didnt like three guesses as to who is who
one of us is disproportionately worried guess whichwrite to supporttentonhammercom help tentonhammer become a better site an opinionated article is one thing intentional omissions designed to lie to the reader are another stop the misinformation give tentonhammer the gift of your opinionwindjammer
well seeing as how im pointing out that your angry internet letter writing campaign is ineffectual id have to say its not me is there something worrying you windy would you like to talk about it
just to make you that much more upset windythey pay him for that column
windjammer appears to be that rare brand of aspie literally too dumb to troll its like trolling a brick
if you believe the so called campaign is ineffectual why are you wasting your time trying to convince people not to pursue it ie if theres nothing to worry about why are you worriedthats supporttentonhammercom theyre waiting to hear from you your opinion matterswindjammer
im aware of that dang youre doing it again the words are there and i understand them all but youve put them together in way as to create minor gibberish its like youre using a translation program to translate from another language and then posting the result or like one of those nigerian phishing letters please work on this problem i sense and see hints of an intellect that deserves to be properly expressedwindjammer
theyll pay him more because of the extra traffic generated by your angry email writing campaignim supposed to put a twisted here somewhere i guess
ive tried sarcasm logic and beating him over the head with this it all appears to have no effect at allgood lord im not trying to convince people ive been mocking your absurd campaign of angry email net justice then i tried to use facts and reason since obviously the rest was going over your head as for your u r so skerred an analogy hey im going to start eating dirt i think thatd be a good ideadude thats pretty stupidno im going to eat dirt and itll give me super powersdid you ever see superman eat a whole plate of mud before he tried to flynookay did batman ever gobble up tufts of grass before he fought crimenosowhat are you so scared of why are you so worried
this will never workgoons would just enter in 500 people in the elections test 300 razor a few hundred and so on with a carrier blob of 500 carriers it would be doable to keep the titans alive long enough to have the blob of super carriers chew through the opposition until there where no hostiles left at witch time everyone but the once they agreed upon getting a seat was left on the gridthis would have granted the nc and a couple of other pilots like seleene all the seats
based on the campaign info posted and the votematch questionnaire none of the elected csm6 share my views very closely a few the ones with the most votes unfortunately have opposing viewpoints to mine in most areasare you going to rise up to the position and represent the playerbase regardless of your personal beliefs for eve or will you press forward your own agendas thinking the election validated your positionsim not a n00b ive been playing as long as any of you ive sampled pretty much everything eve can offer so telling me i dont get it or lack experience wont fly but clearly most of you will disagree with what i think eve needs just as i disagree with what you thinkbut youve been elected to represent me will you
that very likely depends on what you want if you have a rational understanding of what you think is wrong and what should be done about it then likely yesif youre in the windypops hurf nerf bridges to stick it to nullsec crowd this is not a rational platform and unlikely to get much of a response i say rational not necessarily fair the bridge idea that united nullsec wasnt unfair it flat out did not connect with the reason that was given to explain it rational ideas will find an audience even if theyre unfair
no

if you had ran for csm you would have made it inyour part of the delve war are epic
dear mittani i like what you have done with thing in fact i really want thing for myself however i do not want to put in the years of work you and your friends have contributed to building thing if you look at my skills in unrelatedthing you will see that i am clearly a superior player of eve online and therefore deserve to be handed thing on a silver platter you should also take thing away from the people who already have it because they are not as good as me at unrelatedthing and therefore shouldnt have thing despite the work they put in
thanks to everyone that showed support depending on what happens in the coming year i may decide to run again next term with a more elaborate campaign let it be sure however that the current csm lacks independent candidates 
maybe you and they should have voted for someone who had chance
stv doesnt really suffer from tactical voting issues i think
those votes were not wasted those people still picked who they thought would be a good choice or they may not have you never know
are you asking for proportional representation because that wont work with a system where each representative has to be flown to iceland twice a year
the only wasted votes are those in excess of what was needed to win with the exception of any candidate who blows away the field  then having excessive votes provides an argument of having a mandate just because your candidate didnt win doesnt mean that you wasted your vote sometimes voting for a candidate you suspect will lose can provide leverage for the policies they supported
alternates have often played a role in the csm process and post on the internal forums and stuff so you should include those votesand anyway the issue with your system is that people barely know one person they want to vote for if you force them to vote for 3 or even 5 half of csm really  than a lot of those choices will be random and people would get undeserved votes when they got no real support
this is exactly my point the csm election is more about tactical voting  selecting a candidate who is likely to get elected but not too likely cause then youUFFFDll be wasting your vote on a sure winner  than it is about honest voting  selecting the candidate you actually prefer to have on the councilyou might want to take a look at this post
in multiparty elections the percentage of wasted votes is very rarely above 10 due to the transfer of votes among party candidateswith single transferable vote the percentage of wasted votes would also be considerably less than the current 43 in the recent electionmy main issue with the current system is thus that it performs very poorly it wastes many votes with regards to tranfer voter preferences into actual seats on the council
i am not asking for an expansion of the number of seats on the csm if that is what you are askingi am lobbying for proportional representation in the sense that each seat on the council will be worth the same amount of votesplease read my post in the assembly hall for the finer details and thanks for the feedback everybody my proposal isnt the only way to solve the issues with our current voting system but i think that it is a relevant issue for the csm to consider prior to the election next year
exactly thats why we need 2 rounds of voting first to check which candidates have any support at all elect 2x3x the amount of csm delegates then choose among them the actual delegates based on the principle of lesser evilcurrently there is no way for nonalliance player to know which candidate has any chances of winning since most are voted by closed groups so the information about certain candidates electability is essentially closed to the general public
i have to admit your proposed voting system seems a little complicatedi dont believe any vote is wasted as in every election there are always going to be clear winners and clear losers the fact that official results arent published until after voting is closed means that a single vote has the potential to be a swing vote between a csm seat and an alternate seat or an alternate seat and no seat at all
what you actually need is preferential voting
the votes werent wastedthey were blood for the blood godkhorne is pleased
youre right that the inner workings of the single transferable voting system are very complex indeed but for the individual voter it isnt difficult to rank a few candidates in order of preference then the system works behind the scenes to ensure that every voters gets maximum influence for their votein contrast our current system for csm election is very easy to understand but it gives the voters a lot to worry about and turns the election into a pokergameso do you want a complicated system that is good at transferring preferences for all voters into seats or do you want a simple system that ignores the input of nearly half the voters
and this is actually what i propose the single transferable vote is a form of preferential voting
well you really need to take into account the votes given to alternates you can bet ur sweet arse they are going to be needed again
this
hii would like to thank you all for your support even though i didnt make it on the board ive learned alot and will definitely try again for next term cyerus

fix please
for those saying the vindicator is great therefor blasters are fine are missing the point the vindicator is what a blaster ship should look like no other race needs to get up to a two race skill pirate battle ship to function like its supposed toccp may be right in saying that blasters are just how they want them but gallente ships are not suited for useing them
supported
totally supported dear lord but we so badly need this
supported a 4th to enhance whatever niche it has in combat
i am of the opinion that any kind of boosting whether it be armour shield eccm etc etc should be classed as an act of aggressionif people want to boost ships then they should be in the same gangcorpalliance what everthe primary use case for using a neutral to boost is to give the booster an element of immunity and for this reason it is simply trying to push the game mechanics beyond what was intended in my opinion i cannot see any use case where you would need to have a neutral boost you where you could not do this with a gangcorp or alliance member other than trying to exploit the mechanics of boostingso i support this but actually think this does not go far enough and i would prefer to see it classed as an act of aggression
supported better damage better tracking a touch better range and add some speed to blaster boats gallcaldamarr minnies always have speedagility advantage

as i was watching fanfest feed one of devs said they will go for it they will not soon but in a long run try to implement something like this

exactly your heart just sinks when you realise that this is the best technology that the 23rd millenium can offer i think that the lack of somehow differentiating targets would be of help you can understand them targeting lcos and whatnot though you may seethe inwardly but attacking friendly npcs and logisitic drones no way
why would this ever be implementedif you can only run one account on your pos rig sup at a time having a second set of credentials doesnt really hamper you and ccp wouldent be in their right mind to provide a feature to train all three characters on one account for merely double the subscription costin fact the only iteration of this function that might be considered to simply increase the the number of characters on an account by 3 and number trainable by one but this limits the flexability of alts and altogether seems pointlessnow if eve supported running multiple accounts from one instance of the client that the player could easily switch between then the resulting client would run more efficiently and the client might even queue data better multithreading each client instance would be pretty awesome too the question that the developers would then face is is it worth the extra labour when players can simply run two instances of the clientbut i think ccp would be dumb to encourage players to pay less they also set a precedent when they phased out 30 and 90 day time codes and effectively increased the price of 60 day codes by 33 they will not listen to the csm on issues of billing and its naive to assume that they willsorry 
there is no startup cost associated with a second account and only two months worth of plex required to transfer a character for one month training of an alt on the same account simply stop training the mainthe choices are quite simple the game should not be changed for sake of convenience if the rules are changed for sake of convenience wed have jumpcapable ships that need no fuel or cyno beacon in order to jump into remote star systemsinconveniences require you to make strategic decisions and think about your goals in the game
due to the outcome of the elections of csm6 i and several fellow eve podpilots can not support the elected members of csm6it is obvious the mittani is chosen not because of his view on eve but just because of the mere fact that he is a goongoons voted blindly for their representative hoping that his election into csm6 will benefit just goonsfriends in the near futurethis csmcouncil is a farce and became nothing more then a platform of big alliances and their representativesthe independant csm applicants stand little or no chance of becoming a csm member if and when a big alliances urges their members to vote for an alliance member this has to changei call upon all eve podpilots to petition for a new election of csm6 and new election mechanicshowmaybe only 1 vote per alliance andor corporation discussalso it would be nice to see and hear ccps view on this matter
so your idea is for everyone to form 1 man alt corps to vote for their alliance person
lol
not supportedits been like this ever since the beginning of democracy the guy with most supporters gets elected as opposed to the best guy which may vary depends on how you define bestwhile i agree that the current csm and many of the previous are dominated by 00 people it has most to do with involvement 00 guys care enough to vote most high sec guys not really if more people voted i bet the csms composition would be quite differentone vote per corpalliance is an extremely bad idea goonwaffe is a 25k man corp i run a research alt corp in hisec that has 3 men in it should 2500 ppl have exact the same say as my 3 altsalso just for the record imho mittens is a pretty cool guy with a very indepth knowledge of the game
this goes for most of the new csm i actually have some hope this time not because im a 00 player but because these guys love this game and know it intimiately it will be good for the core game play ie internet spaceships
even by caodcp standards this would be ridiculoustbh who cares look at anomaly changes ccp did never talk with csm about it and published dev blog directly after 00 fanfest discussions in order to make sure csm also couldnt ask there about it sure ccp might make nice dev blogs how much they care about csm but face it they dont
ive never been a fan of the electoral college but it is coming to a point where establising one in eve sounds like a good idea to me elect electors which in turn elect the csm limit the amount of electors an alliance can have and voila problem solved
this is democracy direct your complaints to un
what the  is this  proposali dont like the fact that five out of the nine seats has a ncs ass plopped in it but they were voted into them so there you have it the people who did vote have spokenwhat you should be going after is what can be done to get more people to give a  to vote even though this election has the most votes than the past elections it is a joke at what percentage of accounts votedthe mittani was elected to chair and that is where he should be according to the votes now if he breaks the nda or does nothing but try to reverse any progress other csms have done to build on the relationship between players and ccp then he should be removedso in closingthis
so you are saying that goons are less clever than atlas people apparantly they were clever enough to get a representative that lives under the same conditions as themself in a 00 that undergoes large changes if ccp executes their current plansthose plans might give eve a great future but at least mittani will question them and make sure that ccp isnt represented by a minority of playersanyway its not like the chairman will be in position to decide over ccp anyway and i actually found his views on eve pretty good even if i might have voted in another direction
the chair has no power whatsoever so you could appoint a chimp if you wanted tobiggest problem this cycle is the homogeneous composition of the council as a whole
well this is democracy  the largest interest group gets their way one way or the other i understand your concern but to be frank i do not see what this will all change really i look forward too good improvements to the game regardless of who is on the csm
the voters have spoken the candidates took the time and effort to campaign and to organize supportersif those elected perform well and choose to run again odds are that they will be reelectedsystem working as intended
yeah because that wouldnt have the exact same effect
confirming that we would get mittens elected no matter what measures are put in place
mmmm yes this is a vintage crop of tears bottle this 
the mittani sends his regards
that picture is full of win
and if you had been elected it would be no different
the same effect no would it be 100 effective no
do you perhaps feel like posting without trolling does it not suggest something that you that you troll about honesty while lying and having to routinely having to create fictitious arguments and ascribe them to me perhaps the fact that you cannot address what ive actually said and repeatedly claim you simply cannot comprehend it perhaps that while doing all this trolling youre accusing me of trolling does this not strike you as odd as you are lying in order to troll yet again its obvious why you cant point out any actual such error and have to instead replace my words with your trolling but please show youre not lying and trolling and cite those errors any time now this for instance is a blatant lie which is of course why you cant actually cite such a strawman as youre making it up to troll now if you werent you could do something like say windjammer is lying and trolling by claiming that for instance anybody has denied that ccp can alter game mechanics in order to force a change in player behavior thats what this thread is in fact about with people arguing over whether or not such an action is good or bad windys lie and his bit of trolling is that he claims anybody has disputed this and uses that strawman to troll about irrationality and such he knows hes wrong which is why he has to lie in order to support trollingsee how easy that is when youre actually addressing someones argument and not trolling yes weve already addressed the fact that this is a lie as ccp have themselves stated aside from creating the rules and tools they are supposed to be hands off as its not a themepark game they are by their own statement uninterested in forcing players to go about creating devapproved playercreated content this is why their contemplation of new changes designed to alter how players createcontent and not a disinterested breaks sandbox play and sets a dangerous precedentdo you really not understand that yes thats been the entire point that ccp has not been doing that because its a sandbox game and doing so will break sandbox play honestly have you considered not trolling perhaps just as a change of pace notice of course that while youre trolling and inventing fictional claims and cutesy lies to replace my actual words with i can show how your actual claims are wrong thats because im not trolling youre unable to honestly respond because youre not doing anything but trolling go figure eh
what i dont understand is how the impact of jbs can be vastly overstated yet the moment ccp suggests removing them the nc mobilizes to take control of the csm apparently jbs are a sensitive enough issue that 5000odd goons and their care bear alts were motivated to do something to protectvthem
windjammer and minigin you continue to post put still have posted nothing of substances trolling post for trolling sack perhaps but come on i think this will be the 3 or 4th time ive asked the same questionwhere do you stand on the current sov mechanicswhere do you stand on my suggestion that null sec needs more regions like venal and stains large enough to allow alliances to grow and raid established coalitions
the answer to your question is right above this in the text you quoted the issue isnt so much that its a silly change but that its being done to break sandbox play again the best example of changes that arent huge in impacting gameplay but would be a bad idea would be letting five year old children submit crayon drawings to replace ship models obviously most people would object to that yes what then would you think about someones argument if they said ahhah but crayondrawn ships doesnt effect actual gameplay at all whats your agendasubstitute any other obnoxious but not gamebreaking change obviously without a scientific study we can only spitball about statistics but my guess would be that it wasnt jbs in specific as it was a combination of ccp wanting to break sandbox play and their utter cluelessness about 00 space remember these are the same people who were surprised to learn that there was module lag in fleet fights
i am not nc and i dislike the proposed changes because as a small person not in the blob it makes my life very hard these changes make me want to join the blob because as a little guy i cant take good space and i cant hurt big people so i have to join them or i leave under proposed rulesthese changes do not effect the blob not one bit not an iota of a skerric people who think these changes will have a splitting effect on the blob do not know how these coalitions are funded or kept togetherccp has an agenda i presume that given the new 00 changes the agenda they are posting less blobs smaller alliances more conflict is not the agenda they want because these changes have the direct opposite to what their stated objectives are the alternative is that ccp have no real idea what the hell is going to happen and are pressing buttons blindlylook at all the things that people think are broken with nullsec nowbotstech moon unbalancejump bridgessupercaps onlinedominion oppressive sov grindingall these changes were ones implemented in 00 to make 00 more accessible to the little guy and introduce conflict or in the case of bots ignored and tacitly encouragedthe general agreement in this thread is that these are a sources of the continued problem why on earth do you guys continue to support ccps rule changes cant you see that either theyre lying or they have no idea what their changes will do everyone in nullsec says these changes will make it worse not better ccps track record of game mechanics changes should indicate you should think twice before believing anything they say with regards to probable outcomes on their changestldr  ccp put all the things you hate about nullsec into the game to do what they say they are trying to do now why continue to trust them
its not peaceful its all out war just some people played politics like youre supposed to in eve and made some space safe it still gets invaded and occasionally two large power blocs go at it its fun its eve and no other game offers this
how do you figure any of those were fore the little guy  and im sure youll be providing us with a link to the devblog asserting that they were no not really if you pay attention to whos posting youll see most everyone outside of the nc is for the changes i live in sov 00 and stand to loose as much as the next guy in bad truesec this does not alarm me in the least i realize im one of many who are going to be looking around for better space this reads positively for me more local conflict for the best regional spaceyou dont have to believe them but you will take part in the human experiment that follows when the changes go live wether it goes as planned or not largely depends on the human unpredictable elements involved if youre really unhappy with the change get out of nullsec simple as that if youre of the opinion nullsec has been getting progressively worse over the years stop participating vote with your location and move elsewhere like lowsec or vote with your wallet and cancel your sub
you were there when tri lived in venal how did that work out from memory or did you forget the 900 man blob you brought to camp in 70 guys for 3 weeksi guess another example would be npc delve having more npc space will not change anything the real issue here is that there is no longer since the introduction and prevelance of jbs  jfs  titan bridges a substantial downside to forming a coalition spanning the entire verse back in the day the most people any alliance wanted to nap was 3 because beyond that was largely boring and didnt make things much easier now we have a situation where you get none of the negative side effects and exponential benefits for napping more and more people to give an example its like playing mw2 on domination mode and out of a field of 10 you slowly start to recruit the other teams players until it is 9 vs 1 at which point the outcome is already decided and its no fun for anyone theres also no chance the one person is ever going to tempt back more people to his side to make a difference this is obviously occuring because of an accidental side effect of trying to make players lives a little easier but instead of doing that all the changes  mechanics have done is made logistics more boring and mind numbing encouraged stagnency in 00 destroyed small gang pvp compared to old eve and in general bread a generation of eve players who have a sense of entitlement to what ccp should be giving them eg sanctums jbs moonsits time to wake up and realise that this game is not here to be your sandbox it is ccps sandbox you are just playing in it if ccp thinks you should be playing in clay rather than in cement then thats what you play in you dont like it get out of the box
the problem with the proposed change to sanctums is that it doesnt address the issue of large alliances and coalitions it actually hurts small alliances who are just trying to get established because while the large alliances and thus the naps they form are funded through highvalue moon mining the smaller alliances need to depend on farming anomalies to afford the strategic upgrades to allow them to become bigger and they use those upgraded systems to attract new corporations from high sec which they then turn into pvp pilots to help them hold that spacei speak from the experience of someone who has just gone through that process of being in a small alliance in null and growing it by killing rats and using that money to buy cooler stuff and recruit new dudesand honestly i dont really understand why large coalitions would be something that would be addressed on a mechanical level anyway they are political entities they will be torn apart by politics rome fell people dont actually want to be blue to the entire universe the people in the nc want to engage in combat just like everyone else but they will band together as long as they have something to fight against if you really dont like the massive political entities i suggest that attacking them politically will be much more effective than taking the blob head on
it seems to me that the problem you arguing folks have with finn is not actually with what he says but that he is an arrogant ass about it doesnt make him wrongof all the times people have called him out on stuff no one has actually quoted anything of his and said this is the part you are wrong on heres why and until someone puts the effort into doing that he will have the upper hand no matter how correct or incorrect he may be
except his entire thesis up there is ccp has no right to intervene in our pretense being his coalition sandbox and that ccp is somehow on the warpath against the nc personally neither of those things makes a shred of sensealso again this doesnt just punish small alliances in bad space the number of oasis systems with iskspouts will not cover all the powerhouse alliances out there and they will have to decide between playing secondfiddle or stabbing their buddies in the back just like you will theyll also be missing out on a huge amount of sanctumfarmed rent and will have underfed pets to buffer themselves from powerful neighbors who want that amazing space in short the changes look like they will cause exactly what they wanted destabalization in larger groups of 00 players wari suggest heading to the war room with your friends if youre in bad space ive been talking with my corp and alliance leadership about it since the announcement because the chaos will make for a perfect time to revolt
firstly thank you for addressing the point while tri may have been camped into venal i may have been their but wasnt if you see what i mean they did live there very successfully for some time and on several occasions before that also i think white noise and several other successful alliance grew stronger if not started out in venal regarding delve npc couldnt agree with you more and this is actually the point im making it is far too small an area to be a viable badlands to hide out in delve npc needs to be regions size like venal and there needs to be more around the eve universe so that alliance can move around without having to hold sovregarding your last point about naps they are about security if the reds have 10 alliances blue need 10 or better still 11 but isnt that the foundation of the game its that what ccp have been advertising for the last 5 years i take your point that this leads inevitably to a situation where the entry costs in this case numbers becomes too high but and this is a big but there are far more people in 00 no than ever before further it isnt the size of the alliance that squeezes out new alliances its the amount of space they hold or control prior to the original bob being disbanded red alliance and goons controlled half of the eve universe not as a coalition but as individual alliances at the moment the drone russian control twice the territory of the nc so i think the argument that breaking up naps is the solution is fatally flawedgreed is the issue mm controls tribute and i think has two other alliances living here with us and a number of overnight guests attacking naps wont weaken mm it will mean that they cant have guest so its the young alliances that will sufferin contrast red alliance and legion of death are sitting on 4 regions each they may have guests or renters but you see my point naps arent the issue its how much space is being claimed my argument is that this space can only be held because of poor sov mechanics and the inability to reach it which brings me back to my points
the problem is you are saying a lot of stuff which is true but not relevant and you arnt saying it from any experience other than your own very one dimensionalised povsaying something like more npc space is good is true im not going to say thats a bad idea but it doesnt mean anything in this context it doesnt solve any of the problems we have now and in the past it hasnt either i refer to initiative back when they were nc puppets being told to go live in venal and camp stations with dreads to cheese out tri thanks to bluemajere for that term coalitions arnt interested in fair fights or fights at all in my experience nor are they happy to watch people gain strength in an area that is close to them and easy to completely blob people down ineven when i was in the nc i remember dmc and oxide being blue after weeks of us campaigning to have them reset so that we could go find any pvp within 40 jumps they finaly were do you know what happend after our initial success against them our 10 man gangs vs their 70 our alliance decided to go blob them out and take their spaceno one is intersted in the fun  challenging part of this game they are all interested in bandwagoning onto success and this is caused almost entirely by the poor mechanics which you nc types are defending because you dont know any other way to play  as an aside you dont need to worry eve is actually literally one of the easiest games to get really really good at the shock for me is that you are all so bad at it i guess hiding under skirt syndrome shrugthe only relevant discussion about fixing this game atm should revolve around fair ways to provide insentives to limit nap listsone such is never going to be add more npc space
i guess my post made to much sense to be argued with
glad you have an opinion and all but thats not ccps take on itthey want conflict thats the entire point of the change no matter what they do the established players are going to have a leg up but youre completely wrong to assume that they are going to benefit from this they gain far more from the stability inherent in the current system happy renters in upgraded space farming anoms than the perk of being the only ones in good space making those renters less happy and more jealous of their landlords hence all the tears you see from the likes of finnagain and co
bump to the top
a supercap should be able to survive a pos attack without much problems and i dont think pos ewar modules should effect supers however but a pos tackle mod that supers cant quickly dispose of would be a good addition to the game it would need to have a higher cpupg requirement than a typical pos scramdisruptor and it should have more hp and a smaller sig radius to make it harder for a fleet of 60 fighters to incap it the problem would be will it cycle to nonsuper ships
 edited for poor punctuation and grammatical errors just to cheese you offill admit i had a few typos but my sentence structure was fine im not sure if its an american usa thing but making long strings of words with commas and periods
democracy only works in very small populations when the population exceeds that limit a representative democracy works better
the csm allows ccp to engage in meaningful dialogue with the representatives of the player base do you expect all players to sign  and be held to  an nda how would any players make meaningful contributions if they are not aware of issues beyond the endless requests for ccp to fix assault frigates add a hello kitty kestrel make boobs jiggle or improve ratting income for nullsec care bearsit is up to the players to vote for people to represent them all it takes for goons to prevail is fir enough hisec care bears to do nothingwhile that may be the truth the facts speak differently more people voted in csm5 than ever before more people participated in discussion than ever before  this implies that more people thought csm was worth paying attention tocan you provide any evidence to support your fears trawl through the copious minutes and crowd sourcing projects to show us just how bad trebor really is
 thiswhile player input is good you cant have all players suggestions taken and voted on it would become a constant voting system and people would disagree on stuff left to right then you also have to take trolls into consideration if we didnt have csm people would form something similar to csm except be lobbyists for you to vote on something anyways as far as the security stuff no someone was caught doing that before and was removed im sure ccp keeps an eye on csm activities and im pretty sure if they were caught taking the code of eve or whatever to make invisibots or whatever you called it it would be in violation of the nda and depending on the legal department it may be possible to seek lawsuits against that person eve is intellectual property therefore any damages done to it can result in prosecution so no getting rid of csm wouldnt fix anything just make things worse
supported  more substantial feature than incarna
supported
so as the topic states why do we as paying customers continue to post on these forums i for one get excited at seeing im not the only one who thinks blastes arent working as intended and that nerfing nullsec sucks and to bring back the old cyno effects etc buti take a look at the original post and see that it was over 2 years ago and guess what no change so why do we waste out time ccp good job creating a forum that you dont read or maintain i applaud you for crushing our dreams
i agree delete the assembly hall
we have obsidian hawk to thank for that topics used to recycle so people wouldnt see that others have been complaining about poss for the last 5 years and hybrids for a year and a half projectiles were complained about for about twothree years before the fix neutral repping for two years faction warfare since the day it showed up in the gameccp used to not have to worry about new players having the soul crushing realization that the thing that started bugging them a week into playing has been a known issue for a long time but these topics now stay in the public eye as well as the point in time they were first raised
this forum is for the bringing forward of issues you believe to be important the problem is the vast majority of issues brought forward are illthought or just simply wrongyou provided one just because you think blasters dont work how they were intended to does not mean they dont i have flown probably one of the widest ranges of ships of all people playing this game by virtue of having played for a long time and maxing one of my chars in pretty much everything sub cap i can tell you with absolute confidence that blasters are well ballanced and not hard to use the problem is you sit there and look at a drake and say well thats unfair it can shoot 80km why cant i do that in a brutix in my experience there are ballance issues in eve but not particularlly many the foremost that comes up is ecm vs other ewars particularly ecm drones vs dampneut dronesif you are pushing for blasters to get buffed its most likely because you havnt figured out their strengths and weaknesses yet and this does not mean ccp is ignoring your voice they are ignoring your poor opinions which i think is much better and i am thankful they dont just blindly say oh well people dont want us to nerf supers i guess we wont
assembly hall should be for serious discussion only virtually everything in this forum should be moved to features and ideas then only csm members should be allowed to start threads in here based on stuff in fi
i agree ah suffers from many proposals that dont belong there but your suggestion goes a tad too far im one of the strongest proponents of better ah forum tools which would enable much better selfregulation organization and some powers to csm members
supportedwhat i find funny is the fact that some of these trolls actually suggest if you dont like the lag then quit less lag for us which makes absolutely no sense because ccp 3s  and if 2k or 5k or 10k people just all stop resubbing what do you think will happen either a it will get their attention and voila the lag magically is fixed in a short amount of time or b they say meh and shrug it off compensating for loss of funds by firing people resulting in less devs and gms which means even crappier customer service and slower  less updatespatches for the game telling people they should quit is extremely counterproductive but whatever i used to want to fly a titan now i just spend billions overpimping t1 frigates because ill actually be able to use itheres an idea how about when a system reaches a certain amount of pilots the game then goes to like a 2d mode or hell even a text based game thats what this game is anyway right spreadsheet online im fairly certain in the end the only thing that matters is being able to defend the system or overtake it when the numbers get that high graphics seem to not be too relevant anymore considering players prep for the lag by lowering the graphics settings to lowest possible anyway and would lower it even more to basic outlines of their ships if they had to even if it meant it looked like the game was being played in mspaintidk just saying
graphics lag is not an issue the issue is server lag not to mention ccp managed to make brackets 2d the most heavy part for your computer
i think ultimately ccp is going to have to cap system allowances no matter how much they dont want to its the only obvious choice unless either theres some sort of revolution in the eve server side administration and on a technical side i dont think theyll ever catch up to the amount of stress the player base can muster or some one figures out a way to incentive not blobbingultimately i would see that a cap is set to what would produce acceptable and manageable amounts of lag say alliance with sov gets 5560defenders advantage perhaps starts at 50 and is upgradeable to a pre ordained level of max system capacity and the rest is for the attack side to prevent gaming of the system by filling with 3rd party players the fleet battle notification gets server priority to the sov and listed attacking alliance letting everyone else lag out if neededif you can field more than the servers allow you can swap out people now that you know you can actually move instead of lagging or you can form a second group to find another system to contest to try to split the defenders and lessen the defenders advantage
funny you say that cause my main income isnt through ratting ironic that you would attempt to peg me completely utterly and so incredibly wrongnone the lessthe idea of mucking with sanctum spawns is utterly stupid for the fact that you are quite simply undoing your changes from last patch as well as the work and hundreds of millions up to billions of isk put into upgrading a systemif you really want to break up large alliances scatter moongold around make it so you need things from opposite ends of the universe to make stuff do something with the moons hit the alliances themselves not the players
agree 1
no doubt
if people can upload anything someone will upload goatsy guaranteedwhy alliances that have been in the game for years dont have logos on the other hand is a bit silly
i agree insofar as the sse2 requirement goes it dropped with little notice players pay a subscription fee to access the game and to add a major platform change to a 1 update because a third party library didnt compile with binary support for older systems is terrible form and if i were in ccps position id be screaming for a more elegant interm solution while providing the subscribers who help pay my bills at least a full months notice that theyd better upgradeits unreasonable for people to expect never to need upgrades its also unreasonable for 1 releases to make sudden unannounced changes to their basic requirements at the very least players caught in the midst of this should have been offered a prorated refund rather than have their spaceships set adrift
macbooks have terrible gpu cooling and laptops often get very hot regardlessan eve client uses anywhere between 400800mb of ram 2 will use 8001600mb of ram this is a lot especially for laptops and systems with modern os installed on them a radeon 5770 costs UFFFD100 and thatll play eve at maximum at 1920x1080 for yearsits been very slow the progressiona graphics team can work independently to a programming team and with ccp using an agile software development method this is exactly what happens and if you have ever tested even slightly complex software youll know how difficult it is to fix bugs also bug reportsse2 was near 10 years old ccp werent asking you the slow advancement of time was asking you to upgrade
if your going to respond and pick apart my posts read themotherwise go away and troll someone elseif you think im kidding ill start with your first bit of your postyou said macbook pros have terrible gpu coolingnice cop outread my post againi said i used to be able to run this game on my macbook pro on cooler temperaturesive been running eve on my macbook pro for nearly over a yearthink about that for a second before you open that mouth of yours againoh and by the way im a credentialed apple tech i even have the tech manuals for repairing these things even replaced the motherboard in a few as an apple care techwasnt for over heat either although im surprised it dont happen very oftenfact is my point stands every time they add a new major package to the game it jumps 10 to 15cguaranteedi can play portal half life 2 no problemevedont even dare go therelike i said your obviously full of it and thats just the first initial part of your iceberg of a troll
they have been pushing it a bit hard lately i would agree after incarna releases i hope they will slow things down a notch or twofor some reason one of the last updates about halved my framerate with aa enabled optimize much ccphaving said that i can still run eve at 80100 fps in full hd without aa on my overclocked q9550 and radeon 5770 not really the most awesome hardware around if this can run it on high quality sans the aa then a hell of a lot of older hardware should be able to run eve too with some tweaked settings my more than 3 year old laptop can still crank out 5060 fps with some lowered settings which i dont even noticejust for the fact that i think and hope they should slow done a bit after incarna im going to support this one
two off those things mentioned have no effect on true incomea person only makes money off of moon mining if someone wants to buy what he gets same with belts
it was at this point that i knew this was either a really bad troll threador the op has no clue about most of this stuff
no while i agree the upcoming changes to combat sites isnt good but the changes to moon goo is not neededalliances dont want to spend the time or effort moving poss to keep an income this would require an enormous amount of time and people to scan for moons each month or whatever cycle players want to blow stuff up also take into consideration during the time of scanning and moving that would be less amount of materials moon mined per month which would drive supply down and prices would go up thank you but t2 stuff is already getting expensive as ishaving a dynamic moon goo would not let the smaller guys make money as once they are spotted they go boom by the guys with the scsevery month the minerals change so the powerblocs dont just have massive income and become invincible where they can build super after super after super and lose without any consquence its ridiculous  supers dont come from moon goo people do have to still mine for the materials so if your changes did go in affect industrialists would complain as they would have less business and everyone would complain as t2 would become even more absurdly expensive and just to go ahead and answer your counter arguement no you cant put a pos on every moon the sov changes main purpose was to get rid of having all the moons covered with towers
ok get rid of belts and no more minerals thats awesome you know you cant upgrade a system without having to start ratting in the belts or mining in the belts right who is going to want to mine moons ice and roid mining is already boring enough we dont need the game to be more boring we need it to give us isk and let miners build stuff for pvpers so the pvpers can have fun and blow  up
point sources of income like moons are the best driver of conflict in this game and removing them is the sort of ed thing a worthless empire pubbie wantsit shouldnt be tech though even though our 40 technetium moons are wonderful
moon depletion wouldnt helpiterating on alchemy or tweaking t2 manufacturing requirements might though
what moon depletion and subsequent replenishment of unmined moons would do is create a lot more conflicts and a lot more competition prices of moon related stuff may rise or fall depending on how inflated their current values are
hellonoticeable are the extremely high prices of some minerals such as neodymium  tecto counter this i resort to an already existing technology  alchemyso far only six simple reactions are replaced by alchemy i tried for 9 more simple reactions to calculate an alchemy reaction i leave 4 simple reactions on the sidelines as they result from gasesbelow is the table of my alchemycalculations for reactions that leave 95 units of one of the two moonmierals unused i specified the requirements with 5 unitsi have tried to use the moons as follows 1x r64  r32 2x  2x r16  r8 23xits only an example you have to change the reactionoutput or the input of the used materialsplease visit your user settings to reenable imageselectricsix
i have no idea if the numbers are reasonable ill leave the calculations on that to akita but doing alchemy for tech would ofc be the easiest thing to do for some balance
much too sense make you
yes
i like it
locusts online youd need to balance it so that depletion is considerably faster than restoration or youll have powerblocs cycling regions like farmers do arable landmuch better to make the crap land industrial powerhouses so their income is from selling to the rich ratters
i really think this is a good idea probably thats why ccp will never do it
fully supported anything to make things more interesting without resorting to nerfing the individual players ability to make isk cough dev blog cough
are you suggesting that people could possibly log out one day and log in the next to find they are now in a lowsec system if they implemented this then they would have to either get rid of lowsec kill rights or let newbies get podded left and right who never wanted to enter lowsec would nullsecs change as well well established corps in nullsec would be ed if they had to move every few days to a new system tearing down and setting everything up again their other option is to not kill any npcs in the 00 system so as to keep it 00 it would also screw up the economy with crazy fluctuations in the prices at major trade hubs the majority of which are in hisec also for hisec trade hubs how would the sec status decrease there are barely any rats to begin with so any ratting would keep them at hisec status while any ratting in the systems around it would cause them to become hisec semipermanent as well you would not be able to have ratting decide the outcome of systems changing there would have to be a system put in place to choose at random 2 solar systems they would have to morph at the same speed from hisec to lowsec also where does it stop if a 03 and a 10 are trading places do they move all the way to the opposing sec status or just halfway or does the 10 become a 01 the mechanics you suggest just arent possible with ratting being the trigger especially if you imagine a 05 mining system most hulks keep mining and light drones on board if they use the light drones to kill the rats then the sec status will raise higher causing the rarer ore types to spawn less miners wouldnt unnecessarily throw money down the drain like that
please learn how to use english this reads like a 13 yo made itbtw i like this idea but dont make things change too fast would suck if every week the whole region changes should be gradual so we can see the trend and adjust
rag on my english all you want i was rushed i still believe that it is a valid argument for not implementing what he says
i would support a depletion mechanic although it would need to be slow much slower than pi depletion rates a tec moon should be around for 36 months before depletion shuts down the operation the truesec of a system probably shouldnt change faster than 001 per week for truesec there probably should be a system minimum limit ie null sec remains null secthe average regional truesec should probably remain about the same with the farther from empire you are typically the lower the sec the rate of change of truesec should be based on the target number of players that a system should theoretically support if the activity is well below this threshold its security might decrease and vice versa upgraded space should have a higher target number and systems with more belts should have a higher target number this way there would be an optimal level of activitysystem and if a corpalliance grows too big for the area they would be economically encouraged to expand or move but if they remain the right size they can make it their base if they are too small itll become profitable enough to encourage conflict i have no idea on any mechanics to dynamically change moon minerals
since we have a new csm i would like to put forward the issue regarding the bookmark system while i dont doubt this has been discussed i would like to put this forward to our newly elected representatives for their attentionat the moment bookmarks being treated like any other in game item in the sense that they are a physical object provides for a basic functionality however since the implementation of wormhole space this functionality has been insufficient to the needs of those who live in wormhole space an example is that in a wormhole system you have five different sites you do what most corps who live in a wormhole do and you put a copy of the bookmarks in a can in the cases of kspace this would be fine since you dont have to use them only in wormhole space they are vital this current system has several issues firstly the physical presence of the bookmarks themselves that its hard to organize them without having to rename each and every bookmark with a date secondly the actual time and effort spent probing out sites only to have a forgetful corp member not replace the bookmarks in the case of static sites we start seeing upwards of 20 different bookmarks trying to distribute them between dozens of players becomes a tiresome and unnecessary taskwhile many will respond that it just requires some organisation and effort its the case that a relatively old mechanic has expanded and thus is becoming a major issue for those of us with there have been several threads requesting that bookmarks be moved to a mail based item these proposals seem to make sense however i simply wish to raise the issue with the csm in the hope that they can bring awareness to ccp with regards this
supported conditionallyits a bit hard to follow what youre saying specifically im not seeing a clearlystated specific proposal but it sounds like youre advocating the ability to give someone a bookmark by chat or evemail if this is what you mean then i support if not then i need clarification
pretty much its just a request that the issue of the current bookmark system is overly complex and hard to use for large numbers of bookmarks and people be raised by the csm with ccp not suggesting any solutions search the threads there are plenty of those just wanting the issue brought up
i have a simple requestwhen setting lots of waypoints for autopilot like you bought something regionwide and you need to pick it all up make it so it picks the most efficient least jumps possible currently the system is orginized such that you add waypoints and it goes to them in that order even if the first is all the way across eve and the 2nd one is right next doorit would most likely be a pritty simple fix thats been bugging me for a whileeregorn81
the optimize button doesnt do that for you
still working for me so im guessing the op is another guy suggesting a feature that has been in the game for ages already
when ccp decided to bring in the sov bills their intention was to make larger alliances shrink down in terms of territory size and open up space for smaller alliances to emerge it hasnt worked as large alliances are still maintaining large regions of spacei do propose a sov bill multiplier for example if you hold only 1 system the sov multiplier is at x10 and only costs 80mill isk per system if you have 2 systems the multiplier goes to x12 making it cost 96mill per system and increasing by x02 for each system that the alliance holds under their controlhaving this idea in effect will make alliances think more about where they will expand to and weighing the benefits of how much the system will cost and how profitable the system can besee what you guys think of this idea and hopefully it passescheerssamson
the only effect that would have is that the alliances wouldnt claim systems just patrol themexample ittest debacle a few months ago i would say that the current system is fine but when you look at alliances like shadows of xxdeathxx 146 systems and legion of xxdeathxx 125 systems the first non russian alliance to be in the top sov holders is test at 69 systems there is something going on here but i am making no accusations
when the current sov system was implemented there were supposed to be a few things fixedfirst of all sov bills were meant to act as an isk sink second they were pitched towards reducing the logistics overhead  large alliances would otherwise need to set up complex fueling regimens in order to satisfy the fueling needs of control towers which could climb to over 40 large in some systems the limit of 5 towers dropped per alliance also made the process difficult to manage and it created an environment where attacks and defenses were usually done on terms set by the opponentthe intention of the new system was to simplify sovereignty management while also removing isk from the game ccp pitched it also as a way of making it easier for smaller corps and alliances to gain a foothold in 00 space the reality is that sovereignty rarely changes hands now because its easier to set it to a clock the home defender gets the advantage and theyve eliminated stront timing mechanics which generated instabilitythe cost of sovereignty of a few systems is also high enough to scare off small corps larger alliances need only a tax rate to cover their needs plus the manpower to wrangle a few moons larger alliances and better organized alliances always win the day and the few systems that slip past those basic truths arent worth the harassment that follows by unaligned pirates and bored denizens of nullsec who happen to crash your partyin short the sov system changes didnt really tackle the goals set out by ccp and removed certain chaotic human elements and a second rethink needs to be doneif you want to level the playing field a bit consider a poswarfarelite system i cant provide exact answers but heres one ive got kicking around require no more than 5 sovclaiming control towers with a new tcupower module this would exist in addition to the tcuihub limit alliances to onlining tcupower module per day make the ihubtcu invulnerable until the towers are down the tcuihubstations dont get a reinforced timera system based on a few towers would require manpower to maintain which is really the currency that will hit even larger alliances and this is what will test the measure of alliance dedication add to that reduced maintenance costs and remove notifications of tcustowers getting dropped and you create an environment where players will need to keep a closer eye on their assetssneak attacks would suddenly drop on peacetime alliances after a few weeks of carefully prepared incursions into the space by invading alliances spies become a necessity towards the ends of preserving their primary alliances space while also reporting on the actions of hostile alliances and information becomes a valued currency and of course manpower by the alliance who has a lot of spacebut they needed that space right thats why they have so much to patrolthats my idea but it hasnt gone through the filter of public opinion
some sort of inefficiency modifier would be awesome the bigger one gets the more there is dragging one downthink roman empire british empire persia mongol empire etc they all had the perfect setup until they got greedy and ran into escalating maintenancetroop costs which is where changes to force projection comes in besides whats the point of denying someone from using empty space when one can collect tithe from them instead support pending number crunching
iirc the original idea was that sov would work something like this but that got dropped because well loldominionyour basic concept is sound but rather than a simple linear progression i suggest a logarithmic one this would mean that for a few systems the difference would be imperceptible but eventually the total amount would start climbing very steeplyso each system costs x isk per month each system added increases the total sov bill by y to nx1y
the only result of such changes would be that alliances will only drop tcus in key sistems jbs stations etcthe rest of the systems will remain unclaimed but as soon as anyone does anything in there in order to make anything in a system you need to put down at least some structures like poses or ihub they will either be forced to pay rent or get evicteddepending what that alliance needs more at the time isk or killmails you cant really move into conquerable space thats within strike range of a major alliance unless they agree or you can take them in a fightso nothing would really change
sounds like a problem that you can fix with a simple findreplace or at most a regex
interesting direction for a change to null sec do you think this would be a more viable option than just nerfing the hell out of null making a bunch of changes and crossing your fingers
supported as long as any blue awoxer can walk in that station and shoot the agent in the head like in that evefuture video
the agents are in space in their ships you can fly into the system and blow them to smithereens 
they and their npc friends may shoot you back though 
heh do be sure to enjoy watching your representatives howling impotently about the anomaly changes and the forthcoming rebalancing of jbs and nullsec logistics in general
i live in fountain and dont fly a capital none of that really affects me vovbut you can always tell that changes are both balanced and healthy when people use them as a weapon against other people
regarding anomaly changes i recommend checking dotlan on the truesec of dekleinregarding jbs and nullsec logistics i recommend checking the titan tracker in caod and northern jb map thats widely disseminated
people whined and got taunted about the nano nerf as such it was clearly unhealthy and unwarranted and should be reverted posthasteso you are upholding the anomaly change as an example of the new csms power influence and effectiveness as for the rest you may want to look up the meaning of the word forthcoming
saying a clichUFFFD meme soo cool lets see what i do in eve1 whine on forums2 spam  in gamewhat does the average goon do in eve1 convinces himself that mittani is sarah palin2 brown noses day in and day out3 says the same memes that have been said for the past 40 years4 stays up late to play internet spaceships5 spends alot of time indoors just so he can fit in6 ignores rl for alarm clock ctas7 boasts and brags about having space which was given freely to them8 replies to rl criticisms with well at least we have spacewho really takes eve too seriouslybecause well i would hate to play a game that is like having a full time job with no pay isnt really what i would consider cool or fun dont get me wrong everyone who plays a game and talks on forums is pretty much a nerd but theres a limit perhaps you should see a shrink to discuss the issues that are making eve your realityit really isnt healthy taking a game too serious
oh noesi am a nerd  we all are i thought i am the cool kid
you should be less pleased about how games like eve poker are keeping rmt in business where do you think gamblers get all that isk
here herehow about a militia store where we can get faction goodies
well yeah we have been screaming for ccp to address it almost since beginning and gotten bugs and later fix for bugs in return problem is that for a meaningful fwlow fix to be made an obscene amount of manhours has to be allocated which translates into a full expansion or morei would much prefer that my home be properly renovated rather than having putty thrown in the obvious crackslag is draining server and developer resources sort out dominion as originally envisioned small scale pewflux so that the blobbage ebbs and send the freed up devs our way  we dont bite honest
honest question to the csm here can you guys actually explain what is wrong with fw i mean its like you guys are saying fw is broken hell even during the campaigning mittani and other goons said faction warfare wasnt lucrative wtfdo any of the csm even have a clue what is wrong with fw and why people  about it
so are you saying that you disagree and that fa is fine as is or are you merely trying to equate lack of a definition with insincerity
you dont get it the whole point of the null bloc getting elected was to forestall any nerfs to null space thats why they spammed voting with their botting alts dont expect them to do anything but that
im glad to hear this csm is of the mind that fw is worth ccp time i can certainly agree with seriphyn that the small scale fights that happen in plexes are a real boon to eve as a whole and i really think ccp could greatly increase the subscriptions if they done some well thought out fine tuning here i also agree that npcs in plexes work to prevent pvp on many different levels realistically i dont expect much for fw until incarna is nailed down and they finish up some dominion mechanics i just hope incarna doesnt linger on sucking resources past the 18 months december of 2011 a couple of general points about fw as has been mentioned fw is sort of a unique situation it never really ends and players can choose whatever militia they want the problem is if you make the winning side get direct advantages people will tend to join the winning side i mean do you want to join the side that has unique or better resources and maybe even a boost to shields and armor or the side without these benefits other than the odd role player people will continue to pile on the winning side making the war more and more lopsided right now players may actually join the losing side so that they have more targets thats really a pretty good thing that said i do think they can make some consequences for occupancy but they would need to be more of the indirect variety
what do you expect from a blithering idiot who attacks mittani just because mittani is a goon a good post ha when pigs fly
to bad people did not vote for rippard teg as he was actually an fc is faction warfare fairly recently
theyve been in less than a week and the servers already crashing in the middle of the day this csm will surely be the end of eve111cd
this is our game get out
awwwcan i play i voted for mittens
lookit the sore losers like minigin and windy even noname empirebears got more votes
i blame mittani
that would have been an awesome iceburn if only id actually posted anything cheer up cy bear you can always abuse me again next year
1 run for csm2 come in twentieth3 
i notice your original post that you edited fast was i see you recovered from that soul crushing loss fast im glad you changed it as i couldnt even understand what you were talking aboutthanks for taking the time to write a second very different postim actually fairly pleased that i didnt win i was starting to worry what my wife would say when i told her that i am a secret internet spaceship pilot and needed to suddenly go all the way to iceland to talk to other internet spaceship pilots several times because internet spaceships are seriousedit holy crap you edited it a third time while i was replying good work fella quality posts take time and need to be refined
you know how you get to carnegie hall dont ya practice
if there is extra traffic and that results in him the mittani being paid more then i would think you would be encouraging people to write you want him to get paid more dont youwindjammer
heres an analogy for you if it looks like a worried duck walks like a worried duck and quacks like a worried duck its probably a worried duckfor some reason this reminds me of a time i was out duck hunting it was very foggy and a bad day for it but we could hear a single duck in the distance giving out a quack every now and then the duck was on the move and i started calling it it would quack and id use my call to respond with a quack and the duck kept getting closer homing in on my call in the end the duck came in for a landing and hung there in the air about two feet from the muzzle of my 12 gauge it just hovered there for the longest time like it couldnt believe what had just happened then i killed it it was a very tasty duck its a true story but i do not believe youll understand why i told it zerothe only way tentonhammer will know how you feel about being lied to is if you tell them write to supporttentonhammercom let them know every single persons opinion matterswindjammer
not that anything will come of it im sure but libeling tth and claiming that theyre lying to anybody while youre trying to start a letter writing campaign and cause negative press for them is probably not the smartest moveandim gonna do it im going to eat dirtdont do that it makes no senseyou cant stop me im eating dirt right nowits still not a good ideayoure terrifiednahim batmannot that eitheryoure a duck
write to supporttentonhammercom help tentonhammer become a better site by giving them your valuable feedback too few bother to do this these dayswindjammer
not only is there no strawman your lack of comprehension is not a lack of clarity on my part youre obviously very very upset because someone wrote an internet spaceship opinion piece does this seem normal to youlikewise does it seem normal to you to call your own words a lie especially when you havent even edited your post to hide them who exactly do you believe you will fool

wow candidates like windy and evetruth really stole away the chance for candidates like ripard teg and roc wieler to make it into the csmi am loving this
possible to also have voting stats of the candidates who cancelled after the begining and you forgot to update the voting statistics of the others thread with last day
only one candidate withdrew after the election opened kalrand who is listed abovewell release a blog with voting over time statistics hopefully soonish
you should probably look into the guys that used the direct link to voting to trick people into voting for themme looks at the mittani
not like theres a vote confirm page before you actually vote though right
you still had to click the vote button
i will not stand by whilst you slander the good goon name we worked very hard infiltrating corps and holding there ships ransom under the conditions they voted and we would never stoop so low as this trick clickery you speak ofyou seeplease do not throw such dishonourable words around again with out 1st proper research
but but they hacked the page and replaced the button text with close pagewatch   i swear if it wasnt for the spam campaign conducted by pretty much all the elected seats the turnout would have been as anaemic as previous csms  so that is somethingonly sad thing is that it is the least representative gathering yet with nothing but null more or less
i almost would have preferred not knowing remind me to get you an appropriate christmas gift this year diagoras a puppy with projectile diarrhea perhaps
perhaps for csm 7 ccp might consider instant runoff voting or similar systems

can we have the corporation and alliance of which those guys belong to 
you understood wrong alternates have never had csm delegate badges on the forums maybe if you ask nicely webcell will do a csm alternate badge for you on the new forums
actually its because electors were the only practical means of conveying vote data from the states two hundred and thirty years age that and madison wasnt nearly as proplebeian as jefferson was
this smacks of a flippant sarcastic response but ill answer anyway my biggest concern is orphaned or leftover content especially pve when the static complexes were removed and replaced with exploration content this was great i think the cosmos missions need something similar theyre very static a linear chain with no variations theyre also not repeatable with a single character which doesnt make sense from a resource standpoint and leads to recycling alts to farm them more variety in missions would be great id love to see 34x the current number of missions at every level id also like to see variety within a level depending on security lowsec missions pay more but it would be nice if some missions were only available in lowsec or perhaps were much more likely to come up in lowsecfaction warfare needs help antiblobbing measures in any area will help here as well at the moment fw has many drawbacks but few reasons to participate pve content for fw would help as would making flipping a system actually mean something and have consequencesi dont think eve is broken im happy with ccps direction and vision so far not everything in the game needs to interest me and i expect a good portion of various expansions to contain content i may not see for months if ever due to lack of interest but there are some areas id like to see focused upon and csm is the organization that should help facilitate that also as a note i dont think nullsec is broken jump bridges seem fine to me theyre useful but also somewhat fragile i think the new sov mechanics work well huge blobfleets are still a problem i dont think thatll ever go away something that helps smaller fleets be more effective and possibly even counter a blob of up to twice its size would be great but not just in nullseclast note if id been able to get my passport processed in time i wouldve run for csm myself i no doubt will next year i am that engaged with eve
the votematch questionnaire was junk read peoples actual threads
hi terghonyou may or may not have noticed that your concerns have been represented in the past by yours truly among others and will continue to benow a few answers all of which youll find in the previous csm minutes but given here from memory for your convenience cosmos missions we asked them to be added to answer was that the amount of time needed to do cosmos stuff was so big ccp preferred to devote resources to other things which is a fair point chance of them being built upon for the time being is minimal more in csm 3 meeting minutes fw does need a lot of assistance not just a bit the fundamentals dont work very well other than shooting at one another in order to turn fw into what it should be wed need to ask ccp to devote at least a team exclusively to that for 6 months considering theres only 2 not busy with incarna i cant in good conscience request that until incarna is out of the door ie 2nd end of the year that said there can be improvements requests not specifically targetted at fw that will improve fw ie lowsec changes more in csm 4 and 5 meeting minutes
this it was a poorly contrived scam hence why we didnt do it ourselves
you dont get it my problem is with ccp for allowing it not with darius good for him for thinking of this scam and getting away with it darius may or may not take the csm position seriously with or without assurances i dont careallowing scammed votes is a big sign of we dont care from ccps part i already explained why
how many politicians deliver false promises in order to be elected all of themjust politics to me
1 cant wait for the like button in the new forumsfor all of the hopefulls this year we need to know how many votes each of them got and for all the close ones a starting point for there csm7 run
post a linki need this rage guys
congratulations meissayour return is a ray of light to the few of us that enjoy the challenge of doing it the hard way on our own i dont know if this is the csm to be overly diplomatic with but i trust your perception of the politics this group may be a bit inclined to wheel and deal behind the scenes so i ask you to be vigilant on the transpancy and openess of communications with the communitygood luck on what i see as a very busy year for you

not supportedwhat doesnt kill you makes you stronger maybe at some point you might want to train for combat or industrial skills and it would be a waste to delete skills you have already trained
i would say fof always hits enemy targets but when ecmd they just hit somethingit seems like a fair tradeoff lower dps but no target required can work even when jammed but you might hit alliesthe only reason i dont like the idea myself is essentially being jammed while using fof is the same as current but i do think it makes sense to have some effect since a fof does use electronics perhaps changing it to reduced effectiveness while jammed would do italso if fof technology becomes more implemented properly and balanced it puts hacking as a possible pvp subskill mess with ff codes fake ally ff etc

would definitely like to see grid and drone nerf but rather drop the tracking bonus than the falloff since that is after all the angel flavour i quite like the idea to move the falloff bonus to gallente frigate and put speed as the minmatar bonus though
dramiels need to be fixedpersonally im okay with the speed the way it is if the idea behind the ship was to create something exceptionally fast and agile that is able to disengage at will well thats fine its very minmatar in flavorthe problem is that it can have this amazing mobility and do a lot of damage and have nice ehp and have fantastic tracking and have fantastic projection then drones on top of it all its just too much of a good thingi personally refuse to fly them because of this but this does limit what i can reasonably engage because dramiels are so popular go dramiel or go home  it shouldnt be this way
bump
thing is though im not oh sure i point out bull and i certainly dont suffer fools gladly but as koszybski once said i have a blasphemous certainty about certain things because i am factually accurate and logically correct i dont feel the need to coddle people or make allowances for those who just know that theyre right those who can discuss the issues intelligently and honestly have nothing to worry about for instanceliterally every single claim made is a blatant strawman and a lie every single one without exception further folks reading along can notice easily who actually tries to make these discussions about the nc even when ostensibly talking about all 00 politicsive spoken about bedrock principles and explicity said that they hold true regardless of playstyle others respond with variations on its all about the nc which is again the point in a sandbox game the rules and tools are set up and then the devs rest on the seventh day in a sandbox game you dont say okay now go cooperate with or fight against whoever you want waitamminute youre doing what you want all wrong you should do what you want the way i wantto say nothing of the fact that the proposed changes are myopic and almost certainly ineffectual well see small alliances and independent alliances hurt and i doubt well see much if any increased internecine violence
you obviously have not seen the eve tribune which finn has a hand in running and writing probably explains his ability to write walls of text that are still readable most people get their null sec news from evenews24 nowadays but i remember the times when i would wait on the next issue of the tribune its somewhat irregular  to read about a conflict that affected me only to see that finn had omitted it because he felt like writing an essay about ccp o finn hope to see you again in curse sometime soon and no i wont warp into your 20 man gang respect never stop posting this thread kept me entertained at work the whole day to the alts if you are going to post serious arguments then stop hiding behind alts or if there is a valid reason you are posting with an alt as one has stated at least state it if you want to be taken seriouslyps eric stop renting from russians
heh been them eic for about five years now although im currently on vacation with one of my managing editors running the circus id say though that thats more of a symptom of me being able to sling the lingo than the cause my undergrad work in english lit and my med gave me more practice than strictly speaking i wantedand yeah en24 is awesome and we just ran an interview with riverini they run a very different system than we do even during our peak we had a writer maybe two dedicated to providing a broad overview of nullsec or individual conflicts they were engaged in en24s setup allows them a log more flexability and when we were working heavily at it finding good information still took hour upon hour if scouring scrapheap were back actuallysee you on the field
problem is the players are idiots a lot of times what players want is a lot of shinies and easy facerolling wins longterm thats not healthy because they get bored and start to whine because they were given exactly what they wanted player conservatism is a huge problem and eventually it chases fun out of the gamei mean look at all the supercap threads this is players doing what they want look at all the cries for dramiel nerfs or botting players will always act in their own interest to the detriment of the gameif anything the themepark genre arose because players have a bad tendency to screw up sandboxes and eve is pretty screwed up they got pvp right but nothing else
there has been very little discussion on the public forums about why napfests are a good thing my suggestion is that napfests are turds in the sandbox and it is ccps responsibility to remove themhow is being blue to everyone in any way good for this pvp oriented gamesince you have been busy licking butt in nullsec instead of kicking it you missed the deviantart spaceship design competition there were in fact crayon drawings and worse submitted which the player base did in fact object to most vehementlythankfully the folks at ccp are actually quite smart and know how to discern good designcrayon drawn ships do affect gameplay since they break the theme that ccp is trying to establish which is a harsh cold world with conflict between capsuleers being the motivator for activity when the gameplay devolved into care bears online the devs will want to change the sand in the sandbox this isnt about politics it is about the current design for nullsec being broken because the motivation shoot people isnt as strong as the motivation to napfestsome people will argue quite rightly that ccp should be fixing broken sov mechanics first but the counter is that there are a few small things that can be fixed while other teams are working on the new sov modelthese were the people who had not seen a reproducible bug is what you mean the problem lies in the bug filtering process not the devs themselves what alliance has room in fleet fights for people who show up for a couple of hours a week how does a bug hunter participate in nullsec with their anonymous alt without triggering more claims of t20 style favoritismthankfully there was someone on the csm at the time motivated to help ccp fix lag
yet again your personal preference is nice and all but in a sandbox game people get to decide how they play yes even people you dont like napfests dont have to be good or bad or wombat they just have to be what players freely decide to do of their own accord just like everything else in the sandbox you cannot claim that people are sandboxing wrong proven by the fact that youd make different choices than they do ive snipped your trolling at the front of this quote anyways no i didnt miss the contest in fact i wrote about it but thank you for arguing my point for me even changes that do not effect game play at all can be objected to cogently and convincingly of course that point is used to rebut the traditional strawman but if jbs dont radically alter the gamedont do what the naysayers claimwhatever then you should support removing themits a nifty trick if someone agrees with your arguments then they agree with them if someone disagrees with your arguments why then they really agree with them too gampeplay  theme you cant say its not about politics and then talk about politics youve also just elaborated on the justification for a neverending cycle of failure you institute your first changes and people still play the game the way they want so instead of deciding that your initiative was wrongheaded in the first place you decide you just didnt go far enough so you try again and people still play the game the way they want so youi have said what i have said i have not said what i have not said they were surprised to learn that there was module lag in fleet fights it was not an issue of whether or not they had personally seen that in action
sorry to disappoint but actual i have answered that question several times i guess the issue is small gang pvp verses large fleet pvp the reality is that null sec has been anything but peaceful from my personal perspective we have been at almost constant warkos vs aaa teneriffe  lost 010nc vs insurgency branch  won 21nc vs tri mk1 deklein  won 50hydra vs kia vale  rain stopped play 11nc vs gbc deklein  lost 13nc vs tri mk2  gbc vale  lost 03nc vs gbc tribute  won 32 won in extra timenc vs goodfellastri mk2atlas deklein  won 50nc vs tri mk2 vale  forfeited nc vs aaa curse  no score draw 00nc  goons vs gbc queriousdelve  bob disbandednc  goons vs kenny queriousdelve  won 32nc vs tri mk3 venal  forfeitednc  goons vs stain wagon period basin  won 20nc vs pl  evoke cloud ring  won 21nc vs atlas and friends geminate  lost 13 at ft first legnc vs tri evoke wn co2 rol aaa iac init atlas hydra r cry havoc ra solar  won 31nc vs sc it rol init atlas cow gc evoke solar etc etc etc won 21 everyone got bored and went homeso there was war there was turmoil but then the sov system was changed and that is when everything change
the soc mechanic has been broken in some form since it was introducedversion 1 involved pos spam to the point that alliances would schedule alarm clock pos operations to ensure that they got as many poses erected as humanly possible players in general liked the amountnof combat involved but hated the endless pos bashingversion 2 involved sitting in capital ships shooting big hp buffers a few times over a period of days at predictable times so ccp effectively replaced pos bashing with something even less exciting while taking away the part of sov warfare that was marginally interestingalong with sov 2 came the homogenization of claimable nullsec spaceif we look through the features and ideas forum there is a dearth of workable ideas for replacing sov 2 with something workable and interesting there is one by doctor invictus for examplethe folks who think they have ideas on how to fix sov andor motivate more fighting should have a go at expressing themselves start with deciding whether or not you feel sov is broken and work from there
why do people set everyone around them blue why do they decide to avoid pvp in a pvp gameis it incorrect to assume that people should be motivated to pvp in a game intended to be a cruel harsh world where pvp is intended to occur is it incorrect to assume that given enough motivation one player will engage in combat with someone else explore what motivates people to napfest instead of blowing the living crap out each otheris it the mechanics of the game can we engage in simple experiments such as increasing the reward is it deeper than that and requires some sort of recreation of the millikan shock experiments has naping been institutionalized along the lines of the stanford prison experiment
we didnt avoid pvp we brought more friends than the other guy and we won why do you seem to think that this requires mechanical intervention to stop it is a pvp game and everyone wants pvp looking at killboards there seems to be plenty of it going on the critical point is that as soon as pvp dries up resets and backstabbing will happen but for whatever reason there is a strong impulse in this instance to not wait for that but to force the naps apart through some mechaniceve is a political game as much as it is a pvp one if the game company interferes in the politics then why not just reset everything periodically like every year six months day if you want constant pvp which is not subject to the overwhelming strength which is evidenced in a political union then perhaps you might be happier playing something like world of tanksthe continuing lure of eve lies in the persistence of the relationships you can form and their effect on the game if you force them to become meaningless then what is the point
bit of a contradiction there if you stop to consider the outcome of your victory you quite literally force other massive coalitions into existence by virtue of your own policies which was not actually a choice of your own but an extension of what the game mechanics require of you to succeedccp isnt forcing decisions any more than they did when they changed sov mechanics in dominion theyre simply stirring the pot to see if they can generate more dynamic nullspace through very steep and notable diffirences in the value of systems theres nothing political about it ccp didnt go out of its way to trustbust 00 because the big bad nc and drf went and killed it they went in with the intention of making nullsec more interesting for everyone coalition members included believe it or notif you arent sold on their ideas thats fine and youve every right to post all the feedback you like however there is a fine line between constructive feedback and simply opposing something on the basis of conservatism i dont think most of the opposition here realizes it but they almost unilaterally come off as very conservative for the sake of their own ambitions this is why presumably greyscale made it a point to say the changes will be made without regard to negative feedback they are keenly aware of just how political the players make the game and they do not want politics to become a part of their reason to change or not change the game
we conquered this game so thoroughly that ccp is now attempting to break it to stop us winning so much and give a chance to allow the inferior groups a chance to keep upim pretty smug right about now
finn let me make sure i understand thisyour problem for the most part is not that they are making the change but why they are making the changeam i correct
dictating player game style is critical for controlling hardware resource demands and staying ahead of player with new applicable software and events and rpg gamemaster can tell you why it is quick disaster to let players do what they want without slose guidance tehy quick decide to go in directions for which you havent developed game material or its still has not been fully debugged  often several factions go in totally different directions bottomline in the real world game providers have limited resources and time with which to provide new game material and stay ahead of lag while still remaining profitable so they must herd the cats players in the general direction of new development since this must be done anyway and a certain percentage of players will be irked no matter what  why not go in the direction developerplayer find most interesting sure they can be wrong but no more likely than any faction of players who want to be in control of game directionplus players on their own tend to guide the game get into unimaginative and boring ruts and quit i played my fantasy and proved i could be the best time to move to a game i have less control over to prove i can conquer that too
on the carebear sidemaybe ccp needs to invoke automatic player ejection if you refuse a certain number of combat challenges in a row lol  i think ccp has it right the game is far from 100 pvp if you want a pure pvp ladder sandbox  go to another game
actaully its very easy for ccp to tap into regular player streams and see what you see no ccp player in fleets required ccp would just rather wait until they can play lol  essentially like any staunch game player they want the bugs that effected them personally fixed firstof course more often it has to do with how big the problem is and how many people it effects and how often to be right down blunt the amount of code to be studied and optimized is huge involving potential almost all ship and combat coding plus very few people spend a high percentage of eve time actually in fleet battle so most 98 game play was not effected so ccp delayed and tried to make sure that changes where done effectively and right rather than just quicklyyes the outcome of battles was critical to alliances and corps yes big battles was supposed to be a centerpiece of eve game play but ccp saw that the problem was not biased toward either side and both sides had an option to avoid larger combats frankly those who complain are just impatient people lol  that includes meand for those intermittent bugs  well we just need more of those folk who like to record their battles to post the video and the time hack when problems occur to the bug reports site that sort of seeing would make quick believers of devs of course the reproducibility issue still plays when the devs are trying to figure out what factors are causing the issue that is devs need to reproduce errors to be able to capture debug data even after they are convinced there is a problem so issue where they have no idea of the source or conditions to reproduce can take many scores of hours playing to capture debug info
i totally agree that pos need an overhaul given the strength of scs having witness pos going down in no time with no chance for the pos gunners to do any damage to a fleet of scs this needs attention

why are you supporting thisits already happening
because its a great idea   lets have nice ship with a corp design or a solo design even with predefined skins it doesnt matter if there is a lot of combinations
why not 
not supported will add to lag due to having extra stuff to load on grid plus i dont care to see what bad taste in ship design u all have
you dont know that for certain especially now that ccp are actively working on it i mean they must have made some kind of breakthrough in that area because we all know the one thing they really hate is lagand its not going to allow freely designed paint jobs just a different texture or two and a corpalliance logo on the hull
love the idea a lot but the trick is going to be getting this implemented without falling under microtransactions this is the kind of thing that worries me most that something cool but cosmetic will become pay to play instead of just something that enriches your existing game experience
just think how much happier wed be with this provided no impact on lag than incarna and i see this as a much easier task and much more anticipated by all players than wis supported
i think it would be great to be able to remove rigs from ships
then they wouldnt be rigs theyd be modules
no
you already can remove rigs from your ships
yes  but without destroying them
agreed rigs are commitment to a specific hull and its builtin functionality good as its ismaybe ccp could make it clearer that rigs are really hull customizations with refinements worked into the fabric over wide areas perhaps some sort of hull etchings or growths ecm rigs might add xmas lighting over hull drive modifications might have some sort of spoiler or drive emission spikesnot a high priority to do that of course since most people dont spend much of their time staring at one target close up
i suppose an alternative that still supports the idea of hull modifications but allows the idea of removal without damage would beallow the proposal but make rigs have a long installation and removal time plus a good sized fee for laborsay 15 of rig material cost to install or remove  and 515 of base hull construction time to addremove a specific rig some rigs could be a bit faster to installremove than othersheck there is even an argument for even longer install times as modifications are not standardize part of hull blueprint and thus not 100 suitable for unsupervised robotic installation i am sure that install times lasting hours for frigates to days for larger ships would tend to damp out most game balance considerations but there would be economic impact at the higher end as people could swap rigs instead making major purchases that drive local mining etcin any case this alternative would preserve the idea that rigs do not show up intact as part of loot whether ccp wants to have rigs contribute minor amounts to salvage is up to ccp but doing so should probably also open up the idea that structural damage could result in rig damage similar to thermal damage to modules after all rigs should not be part of normal repair nor should they be as well protected as systems in the original bpo
just one problem big boy the first year and a half i dedicated myself to gallente ships and the hybrid platform i know how to use themyes they take some skill to use but they still suck then i cross trained to try all the other races hybridsgallente boats have a serious problem when compared to other gun platforms and this isnt the point of the postim just saying that not once does a csm or a dev comment on the topics and that in 2 years of complaining about blasters even if its been wrongly worded its still a problem at hand some insight to how it should be worded would be nice
heh and people wonder why there are those of us who wont ever touch or have the desire to go into 00 space other than main market hubs theres no lag in hisec i agree though a self proclaimed grand sandbox of a mmo can hardly brag as much with such insane lag supported
bumptotally agree with vladebut on the brightside at least we will be able to lounge in our private quarters this summerreally ccp do we really need this when the lag is this much of a problem
too bad ccp cant setup up an overload server too handel big engagements so it makes playing well possible 
half life 2 was released 7 years ago pcie graphics started becoming the standard 6 years ago roughly the same time sm3 cards were released why should a modern game run on your 6 year old pc assuming you have a casepsumonitor you can upgrade to the minimum spec for eve for less than UFFFD100 in those 6 years youll have spent 610 times that amount on subscription feesand if your answer to that is abloobloo but i have a laptop then youve hopefully learned an important lesson about gaming laptops you dont see me complaining that my single core atom netbook wont run eve after they removed support for the classic client
this is what i say to people who have issues running eve eve is 9 years old and has only recently been upgraded other game engines like source unreal etc are 5 years oldyou have to eventually get a new computer whether it is eventual hardware failure or standard support being dropped which is how computers got where they are today to play the newest games and with something like an mmo they do change over time
eves requirements are a joke just like those of all other mmos mmos are designed to be run on office computers not high end gaming rigs the updated system requirements dont change that they just require a computer built sometime within the past 58 years thats really not asking too much
tldr  i started eve after someone else did and its not fair they have an advantage
no what youd see is reduced incentives towards territorial conquest why bother fighting to take those tech moons by the time we secure the region theyll be about ready to despawn and go somewhere else megablocs encouraged to hold larger areas of unused space so that the next random respawn is more likely to be in their territory and a secondary advantage to larger alliances who have the manpower resources to carry out regular coordinated moonscans the underlying problem that should be resolved is the hilarious disparity between tech and to a lesser extent neo and everything else not static deposits
lets take a closer look at whats changed in 00 only recentlyatlas  dead not dead and dying some moreaaa  lost all their space and then gets it backbobit  dead to rise againnc losing space gains it back losing some morethis is all in the last 6 months or less in the last 3 years ive lived in 00 you can watch this video to see what ive lived through dominion came out dec 2009 enjoy the 2010 00 explosion fast forward to 145 to skip nothing changing for about a year and a half
razer and mm have remained untouched mostly because they have been so far away from the frontlines of coalition conflicts for the last 34 years ive pointed this out before i will point it out again if ccp wants to break up the coalitions they have to extend the distance caps can jump to break up a coalition an invader needs to be able to hit different parts of the coalition to keep defenders bouncing around as it is coalition fights end up being static line defense for the most part this leads to little more than wars of attrition where the littlenew guys always lose
moons do not pa for plexs anomalies do why do u think plex price start raising this anomaly nerf is here because most people in 00 have several account with anomalies they can make enough iskies to pay with plex for them they wernt able to do that before this hurts ccps wallet this effect is much worse than l4s in high sec because most l4 dwellers have only 1 account miority of steady eve players are the 00 ones
first time ive seen the argument that more active accounts is bad for ccps financesyoure pretty stupid
something has to be done about the technetium spike we are already at 100k how high has it to go befor ccp is reacting to something that clear alchemy would be i also think the best way to go as it already exist moons are still good to mine
well ya see the region with the highest concentration of tech moons is currently fighting off a drfraiden invasion moons are being reinforced logistics to and from empire are being harassed and super caps are dying at an unprecedented rate in eve historytech spike ya deal with it or join the fight on either side to make your own change1 supporttake away moon goo and why have 00 at all
technetium is only an examplei try to approximate the prices of the moonmins in every group r64  r32  r16  r8in every direction would be good moonmins
i think ccp should give us the option to use token keys like we use for internet banking for logging into eveyes they cost money but im sure a lot of people would pay the 1525 for thisi know i would
these are already cominggiven to attendees at fanfest to test out
i would pay no more than 7 for this and not pay shipping
i propose replacing market averages and price percentage warnings with the recycle value of an item based on average eve mineral prices this is more useful to casual market users especially missioners it implies nothing about proper sell order prices the current composite market average generally implies that sell order prices should drop to be the same as buy ordersmissioner might actually get treated more fairly in market transactions during loot disposal without spending extra time or burning out their two marketoriented brain cellswarnings based market averages are unrealistic in that they often do no reflect scarcity supply and demand in fact i have seen very scarce and high demand item prices fall due to the mission dumping and trader buy order purchases moving items to higher profit regionsi am not sure what is represented by the average of completed sell orders available retail product on market and completed buy orders mostly missioners dumping loot without looking  liquidation auction  while the composite has been around forever i suggest that ccp ask its economist why similar averages are not the primary indicators used in stock market and futures market
alot of the larger blocks are using jabber for 2 main reasons1 it can alert users to eve events over a wide rarity of platforms2 its easy to get someones attention on jabbereve can mimic at least one of these great features by alerting users when either their name is dragged into a channel they have open or is linked in the channel by another user  except local channel ofc 
what might be even more epic would be to change the chat system over to the jabber protocol in general  which would then allow people to connect to chat outside of the client
signed
i think its a good idea in general
spoken like someone who has never had to setup a pos ihub jump bridge network built a station and then spend countless hours defending all this from the other 50k people playing evesounds like you want no capitol ships small scale pvp and shifting resources that vary day to day wormhole space is just a probe scan away my friend go getm
supported op isnt exactly chaucer but i understand what hes driving at and its definitely what 00 needsspoken like someone who spent one too many days setting up jb networks and infrastrcture for his coalition instead of having funsounds like you want supercaps naping and blackscreen pvp that goes on without variation youve done well for youself thus far unfortunately ccp doesnt like those blackscreens and 60 jumps of bff as much as you so might wanna try something more hardcore and boring like collecting stamps
supported every resource should be depletable moons rats roids and missions the static nature of these resources is why eve is so horribly static as a whole
from another thread
quotedagreed but on couple conditions1 mining any roids in high sec should come with a refining ban in all of that factions space  after all youre stealing their natural resources2 as a thief you should be attacked by all navy and customs patrols as well as station guns3 0 insurance for any loses  after all which insurance company would insure someone going into combat at 20  1 odds or taking industrial ships into dangerous pirate infested asteroid belts4 a realistic income and vat tax 10  50 range on all production and trade after all those station managers and gate operators have to make a living somehowwhy such worthless replys its so low its grossganking is pathetic and extremely annoying and gets old quick and for mining ships its not our fault that ccp cant give us enough cpu or power grid to properly use the mid slots on the bargesafter all we dont want to ruin the 4 main empires and make them go out of business because of all the carebear free riders

thissupported explorers selling bookmarks are incredibly courageous
partly agree bookmarks need an overhaul they have too many current limitations eg id like a to see a function where you can make a copy of a boomark that you have keeping the one you have in your people  places  handing the other one over to a corp mate

recently we have seen incidences we have seen alliances being disbanded by one person that shouldnt happen any disbandment should be put to the vote and not have a one click disbandment
due to abysmal voting results theres alot of extra plex which will be donated to plex for japanany plex prizes that arent won from the signature bonus draw will also be included in this contractsoe shares will nolonger be paid out nor will they be worth anything and this character will no longer be played im not at all upset about not getting a seat i am however extremely ed that i didnt get my csm tool released i spent alot of time on it and took many days off work to design it i hope to have it out some time soon peace
soyou are doing it wrong imo just trying to help out all you really need to do is promise plex not deliver plex just skin the saps and give them courier box renamed plex it is easy fun and makes you most infamous candidate overnight but mad props to you for donating plex to japan i would donate plex to them but i have like 140misk to my name well at least till this domination control tower i ganked form some sap actually sells

i ate a bucket full of icelandic lobsters last night and what came out of my ass this morning looked like the end of eve
how is the local food im curious
the restaurants here own if youre a pro and stay in old reyk and avoid all the crappy places by the fanfest venue
confirming there are some excellent restaurants here expect to pay at least 1800 isk for a meal tho not including drinksyou can find some recommendations here
so i went on an 8 day bender in reyk win the csm election and come back to find some angry dude who signs every post he makes is starting a petition to tentonhammer because hes so upset with megod damn my life owns
sorry trebor finally figured out why i dont like you and why you have such an obsession over the character generatori never liked people who love
john i ms pacman did not make use of dierdras vote matchi believe 7 others also didnt make use of thatit would be an interesting issue for your blog to find out how much influence votematch may have hadperhaps dierdra can provide you some numbers 
ive heard a lot about how csm6 doesnt represent the eve populace since csm6 is heavily stocked with nullsec members i know that most nullsec issues dont represent my concerns as a mostly highsec player but what is the breakdown of players in eve i havent seen one lately what are the percentages of players in null low and highsec i know itll be somewhat ambiguous since theres a lot of overlap even in a given day let alone over weeks or monthsit seems like the csm should have this kind of information available to help them choose which issues to champion
you do have the issue of removing mining bots in empire from the censusi know between places like nakugard kamio arshat and other quiet systems you find 520 bots a day i cant see them counting then you have missioning bots gag  how to come up real numbers is a trick most people in null are real from my experience though most also have 310 accounts again should you could characters or actual account owners
id suggest you reach out to some reps with your core issues and see their thoughts on it just because somebody is currently in a 00 alliance doesnt mean that defines their voting pattern nor does it impact their desire to see eve fixed for everybody if you find a rep who doesnt share your enjoyment for a particular playing style this would be a perfect time to reach out and teach them a bit so they can represent you betteras for the breakdown of reps this is extremely foreseeable 00 is by definition made up of voting blocs where empire candidates will never have that benefit your job is going to be to make sure that all reps are as read up on your important issues as possible so we can better lobby on your behalf
the breakdown of eve population is visible in the qensnow theres always been delegates to support every play style in each csm sometimes more sometimes less and a couple like me who have had experience in all of play styles and dont favour one over the otherthat being said some 00 candidates have historically been positive advocates of highsec specific measures and others havent been hindrances so you may want to check out each candidate individuallyalso were checking the csm section of the forum for interesting proposals to raise anyway so dont be too scared not to be represented unless you have terrible ideas theyll get attention
i just want to echo the other two herejust because some of us are 00 or empire residence does not mean we cant step in to represent the other areas i would imagine that each of the delegates has a firm grasp of most areas while we may care more put issues that affect one area or another we will not ignore other areas because we dont live them every day i can tell you i specifically do care about high sec and how things work there even though my main character doesnt live there as noted the qen has a lot of the details i think you are looking forat this point the 2 recommendations already give are very good ones determine if one of the candidates aligned to represent you the best and reach out to him and dont hesitate to post your ideas they are reviewed
cosmos missions  they are like other missions they offer nothing other than different texts and other brackets to tank and shoot incursions are kind of new missionsfaction warfare anti blobbing how will you do that then what ever they manage to fix for making 00 pvp work for small groups will work for fw good luck coming up with anything for this that is not exploitableanyway the 00 reps will have no issues with supporting your wishes
i represent my voters not random dudes with entitlement complexes who assume that the playerbase means ignoring everyone who voted for candidates who they personally dont like
my chairman
this is why the csm in its current form isnt as effective as it should bewe as a customer base have a great opportunity here to really make the csm a valuable addition to the gameto make it betterccp wont ever give the csm any real power as long as people like yourself bring your ingame politics to the table and are only interested in representing a certain group of peoplewether people voted for you or not you are supposed to represent us all and help improve the gamethis csm so far is off to a really bad start and it looks like itll be as useful as a chocolate teapot little reminder of what youre suppose to dothe purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player basenot the greatest good for the small numbers who voted for you or the greatest good for your coalition 
you had all my three votes thought you shouldve been nr 1 shame still hope you can get something done in the alternate spoti fully support your look on game improvement and realy think ccp should work this game out before destroying its great potential 
i will violence your boatto get your vote additional content removed request to moderator remove chatlogs on page 1 please as they are lies all lies d
and may be a little more cpu since moon reactions take up a hole pos truly terrible
yo we want a pos mod onlining queue poses make me want to stab myself in the eye just thinking about them holy ok peace out im thinkin bout you pos dudes gonna pour out a 40 in your honor
do want

supportedfirst get current game on a higher level before we can even think of the presented eve future
yes please
so logically speaking this would be like your character getting bashed upside the head and selectively getting amnesia so you would then unlearn what you never knew you had oh wait what the hell is mining laser oh damnit i didnt wanna know that go on bash me upside the head again wait so whats this thing again dunno dude sounds like i could care less
i totally support thisthe drone sub needs workand an extra slot would be urgently needed
supported legion needs some love
the legion feels restrictedinstead of a specific buff i would rather ccp add more subsystems to all t3 ships and make the legion one pretty ing amazing compared to the others
1 for nerfbat
ffs people a dram is elite faction its cost is 10x or more of t1s and 34xs more than afs i would definitely expect for it to be better risk vs reward thats what eve is cause if i fly one and fup then i pay a high price for it there have been a number of threads on this debate already it comes down to people whining cause they are ill prepared and dont want to have to adjust tactics well hell adjust or die they have a dram come out in a daredevil or even a sentinel could work so why not use whats commonly know as tactics and planning and quit whinning heh not to mention the ship is available to everyone whether you choose to invest in the dram eliterisk is up to you but stop being babies because others choose to use the shipbtw drams have been killed by a well fitted badger mk ii so the idea of its impossibly difficult to kill and it can gtfo whenever it decides is total crap use your brains for once and make that dram pilot cry over his loss
of course supported in a big way
all hybrids boasthave fleets not be all abbadons and malestorms
yup supported its well overdue to update the hybrids overall but i dont know about your spike range reduction arent they suppose to be the longest range weapon in eve also lightest damage perhaps better tracking instead over supported though
yo anyone who thinks they can get in the way of out of game social bonds forged over alcohol is a dummyi wouldnUFFFDt worry about it just chill out even if they do something silly like try to make a standings limit folks will just use jabber to metagame around it and the dev in question will look dumb vovnbdpeace out chairman lmao signing off
this is the first time ive ever seen someone backpedal before getting on a bikewhat happened to they want to nerf us what i am running for csm to stop this insanitynot to introduce actual substance to this post either  but i dont think the point of ccps stance is to hard counter blobbing by saying nope sorry you can only have 8 friends im fairly sure the point is to introduce incentives for conflict and to breed a climate in 00 where it is more practical to have smaller localised wars not small btw just small enough to be handled by the serverbut go ahead keep claiming the reason you are blue to all these people most of who you dont know is because you are such good friends
hey hey hey all 50000 of them are bloodbrothers for life yo if any of them were to have a child that kid would become world record holder for most godfathers
if this thread isnt a reason for an ignore button in the forums i dont know what it would bezero is sooo annoyingwould have been a good discussion without his pap  why even the chairman blessed us with a snide remark
i know someone whose arguments are logically sound must drive people absolutely wild when they just know that theyre right but somehow cant actually prove it take arms against a sea of troubles
i absolutely know that ccp should not be messing with stuff because i saw a trailer for a patch 2 years agoour logic is undeniable you will be assimilated in the face of such an argument i would most likely start sperging like mad about trolling my own sophisticationsuperiority and how clearly handsome my portrait is
actually the fact that our arguments are correct is the reason why we see so much trolling like yours reasons x y and z show why the changes wont produce the desires effects and reasons a b and c are why ccp should not be manipulating things in such a fashion anywaysyoure crying tears tears there are tears
actually its like thisyou  bawww they are taking our sanctums i read it in a dev blogus   but look your getting a whole grip of new complexes to do it says it in this dev blogyou   that dev blog doesnt count it could never happenmaybe now you can see why we all think all of you are mentally unstable
heres a list of blasterdrone boatsdronemyrmishtarcursesentinaldramielrattlesnakeblastermegahypevindivigilantdiemosbrutixtaranisddbothdomiishkurand these are the ships you think need a buff what else are you wrong aboutyoure right theyre awesome and i should add overpowerd thats wy im training minie stuff now i like challenge
you mean to say i cant make isk solo anymore i dont like having to find someone to run the site with for my isk let alone the chance to get a ty drop again its called risk vs reward nullsec is the riskist eve environment it should have the largest payout so the static havensanctums should be present everywhere with the new complexes following the new true sec proposaland for those of you who are whining nullsec is boring and theres no pvp bc of all the napfest well id say its bc a large alliance like pl comes in and forces smaller alliances to blue up everyone and their mother to survive
you are literally just wrong im not going to sit here and explain drone agro to you because you are too stupid to figure it out for yourselfneedless to say ive been using droneboats for years and the last time it was buggy was when training the drone movement speed higher than the drone tracking speed would cause the drones not to track anything and that was about 4 years agoask yourself why it is that i could use drones about 700 times in my most used weapons and have never had an issue with them while you have used them for less than half that and you seem to think theres an issue with themi mean really look at your most used ships
thatd be you lying in order to engage in some fail trolling naturally likewise thatd you lying in order to engage in some more fail trolling because youre hallucinating things i didnt say and having delusions of multiplicity in which a handfull of trolls are all people do you not find it odd that you can only base your trolling on blatant lies what do you think it says about your argument that the only possible way to support it is by making things up minigin trolling again and demonstrating that he doesnt know how killboards tally up weapons used and ignoring all other instances in which drones are used so that hes hoisted by his own petard to boot ignorant angry unintelligent and trolling whatre the odds of course coupled with kbbased epeen flailing i cant explain it because of you pedagogy and ranting about how someone else is supposed to be stupid when he cant spell the word convinced and thinks that it has an s in it its like being brutally savaged by a very angry chipmunk
why do you say this it takes the role of a dread while a dread fears a deathstar pos a bit op no i think so pyou dont siege a lone dread on a pos bc it will die the same should hold true for the sc
in some fanfest presentation there was talk about an xlarge pos able to fend off supercapsbut thats just talk atm
supported to counter the 50 bonus to damage to capitals give dreads in siege mode a 50 reduction in damage from pos modules 
now that would be viable to bring back utility to dreads again while giving a real reason to anchor a pos
supers are overpowered 1
no because one of the major rules in eve is never underestimate the stupidity of other playersi dont want majority voting of the player base to have that sort of effect on the game
pretty much thisno matter how much the csm decide to vote in their personalalliance interests at least most of the have some kind of a clue about the gamealso the biggest problem with player based voting would be the lack of dialog no troll infested forums dont count

i think it would be good if when you destroy a character on your account you could reimburse the skillpoints that were on that character on another character in the same account the same part is key so someone cant have 4 accounts and just kill the chars on 3 of them to superboost one of them this keeps it so that you only gain the skillpoints you paid for on that accountseems fair to me wouldnt you all like to be able to do this
no
my solution did state that it would need a stationpos interface i know having it on the fly so you could update it from anywhere would be too powerful
the problem is that rigs have pretty much become like modules leaving a rig slot empty is like leaving a module slot empty rigs should be changed to correctly fulfill their original vision option semipermanent ship customizations to specialize a hull ie meaningful and significant drawbacks 5 velocity decrease or sig increase is not a meaningful drawback that would prevent people from using rigs slots as additional damage mod tank mod velocity mod or etc maybe rigs can change a ships bonuses or do drastic changes such as halfing a ships hp and in exchange doubling its turret optimal and targeting range ie turning a thorax from a close range blasterboat into a sniper platform just throwing out some ideas but yea back to the topic making rigs freely removable would be taking a step in the opposite direction rigs should not be another tier of modules
if your ships are cheap enough that the rigs are a significant portion of the cost buy another one and rig it now you have two shipsif the ship is expensive enough that you cant afford another one why is the cost of the rig an issue at all
im sad that rigs are in the t3 hull and not the t3 subsystems but this thing youre proposing i dont see the value in
the only rig change id like is a rig subsystem for t3s rather than having to own a separate hull for every rig setup you want
how about a modular rigging skill for t3s that increases the successful chance of disengaging a rig success means you get the rig back and unsuccessfully means it is destroyed
personal information removed zymurgisti had 2 chars on this account and i had began a trade with xxgrim reaperxx the orininal add he posted on the forums was for a char with positive sec and wallet the second the char was transferd to me my whole account got banned for buying isk all of my toons still have healthy wallets my 7day ban is now up which i have lost from my gaming time and the new char i had transfered to me now has a wallet balance of 445billthis is highly unfair to me and i would like my wallet setting back to 0 with xxgrim reaper please tell me what can be done as it is eating away at my game time and also 7 days have already been taken away from my other two characters on this account because of the previous owners illminded behaviourkind regardsdeep
you should seriously edit your op a bit if you dont want to get hit worse buying accounts is against the eula you are only allowed to buy characters
rotflmaothank you so much i seriously needed a good laugh
ah so your an alt then
pretty sure there is a petition system already in place to handle such problems pretty sure ah isnt the place for this post pretty sure this thread will soon be lockedin before lock
i propose an addition to the courier contract application that would allow you to set a specific time you want a courier contract completed by if its delivered by that time the courier gets a bonus which you also set if the contract is completed after the scheduled time the bonus is not paid outthat simple this way the bonus is secured by the contract itself
do it
yes love it
i think this is a very nice idea but if it will ever happeni am afraid it is more about ccp not being able to make something like this as it is about them not wanting to make itbut if they could they should
i really like your idea of security decks and the semibased security  per system security level thats very logical i dont know about personal shielding but different styles and levels of armor both discreet under clothes or underarmor if u will or more exterior armor would be cool also dont know if this has been suggested yet tldr all thread but i would imagine that deck security 10 would have hiend weapon detectors to prevent anything but a brawl from happening to which ofcourse could imprison or fine you this little bit of give for the common carebear or noob should be implemented imagine being in an airport in the us the day after 911 good luck even passing security with so much as a pointed comb or a paperclip the goal here is to make this immersive and playable with choice risk and limited no choice risk decisions should there be pvp in stations absolutely should it be in the spirit of the eve we have now ofcourse we just need to keep that balance of risk vs reward system and things should be fine and enjoyable for everyone btw i would say that 10 deck security levels be a very small percentage reserved for banking market trading insurance the very basic of services barsgamblinggames below 10 with said police response time may the ninjaing begin
and in the process drive the prices of t2 gear through the roof think before you post please

my estimation of running anomalies based on personal and corpmate experience in a 007 truesec systemsanctums 30100mhrhavens 2060mhrhubs 1030mhr ports 615mhrbelt ratting 48mhr imo the nerf to system upgrades is highly desirable dominion made all of nullsec extremely profitable way tooo much soo when it takes the average player only a few days to replace a dread loss there is a problem besides with the proposed changes there will be plenty of hubs to do in a 007 system which are better than mission running because a they are in your home systems and b faction spawns the changes will also make 09 systems highly desirable with more sanctums and havens  better isk more targets and more conflict conflict happens because the grass is greener on the other side nullsec atm is too fertile and needs some spermicide before every newb is flying a supercarrier
someone could post ascii goatse in thier bio and it would get reported why should this be any different

ships and bpcs in fw lp stores are half the cost compared to empire lp storescombined with stupidly easy missions lolbomber and lowsec level lp rewards whoring fw missions is one of the most lucrative things in eveif anything it should be nerfed to reduce income 90 of the militias are mission runners who never actually participate in the warsmoving lp gain to killing and plexing after plexes are fixed makes a lot more sense  fw should be pvprp first and isk second
ccp isnt really responsible for what evga puts on the table that being said those cards are on the inexpensive side mostly and a new motherboard which will support them is less than a hundred dollars about 5057 usdcad itll even last a few years and be in keeping with most of your old hardware depending on the board you get and current system specs pcie is highly availableheres some options1155 socketddr3 601155 i3 125775 socketddr2 60775 socketddr3 55am2am2 amd1066 ddr2 35and i skipped 1156a few changes can be pretty cheap for a desktop pc cant help you much on the laptops as the only ones i like are 1000ie sample of pure awesome
this would like the poor gameplay being improved but if i had to choose id rather like awesome graphics
oh please eve is not really demanding on hardwareive been running on lowest settings on a athlon64 rig w 1g ram not because i have to because i value frame rate above everything else since i started playingi dont even remember how old that thing is just recently found out it must be really ancient when they dropped support for sse2 incapable cpus and it turned out it came out shortly after sse2 did have been running two clients just fine until incursion with itsince my similarly ancient gpu burned out recently i was forced to pick up a new one for 90 cheapest i could readily pick up over the weekend and now running without everything on max settings seems like a wasteabout 500 invested in hardware in the last 9 years was enough i could have made that much by begging on the streets in that time without any problem

solution1 buy a 300400 desktop pc it will last for another few years2  dont use a mac laptop for gaming i have a macbook and its perfomance is subpar due to lack of driver  design support macbooks are not made for gaming you will be better off with a desktop
i totally get the ongoing childish need for eye candy imaginations have all but been destroyed by a constant multimedia blitz on all our sensesanyway rather than just keep on blindly increasing eves graphical technology and complexity why not introduce a reason beyond fapping for doing itsubsystem targetting geological surveying drill mining anything really some sort of mechanic that would actually need the graphics you keep pointlessly drawing and adding
what slow it down even more cause you dont want to upgrade or are too cheap to spend 80 for a graphics card upgrade really seriously just how ancient is you pc im sure the myans had better tech seriously though you must be doing it wrong cause i use only a dual core 27 ghz w an old 500 mb ram graphics card and can run 3 clients on a dual monitor pretty much flawlessly granted i dont have everything cranked up on graphics but everything is on medium or low settings with all but the shader on heh and my pc has to be 56 years old and guess what i have plenty of bills and two young kids to feed yet somehow i manage to put aside cash here and there to save up towards my new pc for sometime this year and i dont upgrade because i have too i want to upgrade cause im not a lazy a and i want to have some kick a graphics and performance because i love to play eve so youll have to excuse me for having zero compassion for your pity party if you truly cant keep up from 6  10 years ago then you have greater problems and you have priority failure and should just stop putting money into a games take care of you stuff save up and upgrade you wouldnt fit a hac with t1 weapons would you samething here dont play it until you have the skill or rescources to do it right dont playfly what you cant afford to lose wise words both in and out of game btw there are plenty of wholesale pc websites that have great deals on hardware neweggcom and tigerdirectcom come to mind those are us companies but if youre overseas im sure they can ship or theres probably a euro solution like them as well dont hate the game hate your crappy hardware
when i married ccp it was til death do us part that was back in october of 2005 ive since obliterated many player controlled and puter run pixels and met many a good human from across the planet as well as some morons mainly goodly peeps even in the piratey world after playing mmos the majority of my adult life shiot i forgot what i was saying enjoy urselves too many beers have my brain currently clouded party hard
indeed
several weeks ago eve client decided to crash on my machineafter several months of stable work that happened when i was warping to 0 m to the station as soon as i saw the station it crashedresult  i found out my pod when i relogged into the game minute latermy pod was on some distance from station so game automatically warped my pod to the station again but as soon as i saw it againboomcrashedwhen started the game and logged in againno more podkilled as well by pirate gangi opened petition but after more than a month of writing  nothing is returned and ccp is declining to reimburse my lost ship and implants which costs close to 2 bil isk i offered to provide access to my machine where in windows even log i found those 2 crashes and detailed information i sent them that log file but they do not want to do anythingit seems that after playing eve for 8 years time to stop because i am sure that when next time client will crash and i will loose my last money or something else ccp will also decline to return itgood job ccp loose customers instead of gaining them 
bolded the reason you are wrong suck it up and stop spamming whines about this everywhere software issues on your machine have never been cause for reimbursementtake your lumps and stop crying about pixels its embarrassing
this was posted by analcoholicanonymousscum sry malcanis it was too easy
this has been posted in 2 other forums already i would think making your point once is enough but that is just my opinioneve new citizens qageneral discussion
when you open the information window for any corporation there is an agent list tab this tab lists all the agents by type of agent such as intelligence or administration when you open one of these folders a list of agents for that type drops down the information provided includes agent name location and level perhaps this is a small thing but is it too much to ask to have the number of jumps added to this information isnt the reason why you look at this list of agents is because you want to find an agent for this corporation it would be very useful to know which level 4 agent is the closest to your location proposal  add the number of jumps to the information listed for agents in the agent list for corporations
op all isk faucets needs to be addressed and reading the blog it looks like they may well be plexes were just first because it was the easiest to dothere is way too much isk and it is way too easy to get at  even without botsmacros the infinite is

it will be fun to watch the goons and buddies go emorage when ccp decides to make large coalitions not viable anymore despite all of their candidates in csm though

the law of unintended consequences is a mega especially as systems approach the upper bounds for complexity my how well the sovereignty revamp worked in dominion or the moon mining revamp works to get us away from the dyspro bottleneck boy howdy what we need is another change just like that
i crashed it so what it was all a test
the best thing about the csm being smug was what grayscale did at fanfest mittani was all like yo dude im pro ccp aint got nothing on me we can blob and do everything we want ccp wont do anything to 00grayscale was like ok well this seems like an interesting discussion nothing more to see here and bam blog about nerfing nc pets oops i mean anomsjust shows that ccp are in charge not nc no matter how important you think you arepure genius from ccp
i dont think thats how that conversation went at all
just like kalles claims that the nc only has 20 titans and 8 supercarriers its generally best to take her claims with a watermelon sized grain of salt the anom change is rather than a serious assault on anything odd that kalle focuses one might say obsesses about the nc just another example of ccp being hamfisted when subtlety and well thought out action is called for there were coalitions and massive fleets before anomalies there still will be after them
heard you were crying over the anom changes too your life does own indeed btw understanding body language isnt hard just saying

thanks for the suggestions i have and am following up on them for those watching at home the raw breakdown of eve population is about 55 empire 35 nullsec with the rest split between wormholes and lowsec leaning mostly toward wormholes given the prevalence of bots and the like it is possible that nullsec accounts for 4045 of actual players just guessing so a nullsec living csm isnt as unrepresentative as instinct would suggestas for marshaling my concerns and choosing a rep to bring them to that seems an excellent suggestion at the very worst ill pick the wrong rep at best i may find someone likeminded on the csmthanks for your time both in this thread and in the coming year
youd be surprised on how many of the empire players are actually alts of 00 players
i guess the thing i find interesting about this null sec controlling the csm concept is that we all mostly started out in the same place and have a decent appreciation of how interconnected eve is due to the restrictive nature of certain aspects of 00 the alliances simply have to deal with empire players on a day to day basis alliances have empirebased production corps logistics etc i mean even mittani knows he needs people in empire to build ammo for his alliances maelstroms and i once watched him give an inspired presentation about lowsec iteration at an eve meet in vegasplayers dont end up leading alliances or playing eve for 67 years without understanding these nuances very well in that respect i believe csm 6 might be much more representative than some would like to realize
fixed that for ya sorry couldnt resist
the reason i asked was that this is the first time to my knowledge there has been an organized effort by a coalition toward candidates did mittani and company use their null alliances to get seats on csm sure the question is what was the intention beyond getting seats wasis there any overall strategy by the nullsec people to control csm seems unlikely but then i wouldve said the same about alliances banding together behind candidates tooperhaps i gained a false perspective from the vote match site i used it as one of the tools to research my vote i also read all the summaries and read a lot of the jita speakers posts as welledit as a side note mittani using his alliance contacts to organize a voting bloc to get a seat even the chair is perfectly reasonable it only becomes suspect if theres an evil hidden agenda emperor palpatine style of course even then one needs to recall the perspective that csm isnt a ruling body but an advisory council with only as much authority access and audience as ccp allowsi know my concerns for eve wont be totally unrepresented but i do wonder if ccps outlook on what the players want will be skewed by a biased csm with an agenda though theres no evidence that csm6 is biased or has an agenda
im basically a walking talking posting hidden agenda hth
i stole page 12 of the hidden agenda document before i left iceland but apparently the whole thing is just pictures of your puppy what shenanigans is this
its its a cookbook
the guacamole recipe is particularly inspired who would have ever thought to put roasted garlic in
that just goes to show how deep the corruption is in ccp everybody knows that fresh garlic is what you put in guacamole
this should be an interesting csm judging from this thread also this thread made my day
what youve actually got there is mittanis hidden gender document the two are easily confused
im really really really obsessed with trying whale steak now
