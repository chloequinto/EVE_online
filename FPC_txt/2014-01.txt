so one gets a supplementary force of drones and yet gets a extra slot while the one with the supplementary force of guns and gets 1 lessconsider also the instant damage of guns less for missiles and rockets of course compared to drones which a lot of the time have to travel to range of their target add also the range of missile and turret damage rigs while drone boats have noneregarding ammo i think that ammo can indeed be used to engage different class sizes you switch to void in a small ship to engage cruisers and above while nullantimatter is for small stuff
it sounds like you want a more open court system this has failed terribly in real life  in ca ans us  and i cant imagine if you asked the internet to play juryi very much doubt that gms go around with a ban hammer and start swinging at anything that moves they likely have proof and just cause however if they start revealing how they ban people then the ones being banned will know how to avoid  fight it this is how our real life system got so messedi feel bad f you got banned and are 100 in the clear i say fight it go to the csm members directly email ccp directly but do not put it up here even if you had the best and most clean evidence of your actions once it goes public ccp cannot reverse it it sets a precedence for others to follow and soon the system if flooded with players who did something stupid got banned but can follow formula abc to try and get the ban reversed
yes gms can arrive at different conclusions but then you can always ask to escalate the petition to a senior gm if you feel the decision was wrong or unjustbut i disagree with allowing the discussion of gm actions on the forum in any waydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
its a basic rule for internet forum admingmetc decisdion are not a topic for pubblic discussionwhen not so i think anyone with experiense in sitesforum managment could confirm this the whole forum is floodded with circular selfreferential discussions damaging the real forum topics and purpose
1 wrong the titan aoe doomsday was removed because it provided an insurmountable wall to any large fleet 2 titans on a gate and no fc would dare jump in or cyno in or even get on grid with if your premise were true smartbombs would be removed as well as stealth bomber bombs 2 thats war things change i actually like this proposal to a certain degree the current line on caldari dreads is get a real dread perhaps if the caldari created a smartbomb effect on detonation this would become a viable counter to the bootcat drone assist psudo exploit and return a dread to a viable fleet participant instead of a source for capital components for other ships
both of you have limited experiences with what can doas pointed out by my post the bomber doesnt have niches we bring it along for every gank because the instapoint is uncounterableany ship with a flight of light drones can get rid of a solo stealth bomber but ive still killed plenty of battlecruisers with one to three there is a world outside blopsing we fly bombers all the time without recons even if theyre glass cannons the cost of the is just too low for what theyre ganking theres no risk to bringing a covops frig that craps out damage the fact that it guarantees that you will point your target makes it even betterwhile most kills show that the rats have dealt the most damage the ratting ships tend to be at nearly full hp  otherwise they wouldnt be effective ratting ships work because the ratting ships have no buffer and cant rep the burst damageutter rubbish you say as you can see the engagement profile is just too wide
what a terrible terrible ideaboils down to lets force people out of hisec in order to make them play the game how i want them to playop has not given this any thought whatsoever about how this would affect eve as a wholejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
which drone boat needs another slot seriously lets compare the ships you just listed algos  12catalyst  13 algos is already the highset damage dessie in the game and it has range over the catalyst myrmidon  16brutix  17 both of these are very powerful ships on par with each other do you really think the myrm needs an extra highslot to be competitive arbitrator  13omen  14 granted these are different types of cruisers but the arby can easily compete here without need for another highslot dominix 18hyperion  19 again the domi is very potent compared to the hyperion andor mega it doesnt need another highslot and giving it one is too much none of the listed shortslotted ships are hurting in the metagame despite being short one slot this is because drone boats are very versatile and very powerful why do they need that extra slot
let him have the slot but take away the ability to fit offensive weaponry in the highslots one should be careful what one asks for around here never know which dev is the next to snap and push the wrong button for the right reasons
estimated csmi have been in eve since 2008 by choice paying my monthly fee to support the community i am also a premium supporter of eve radio and of several other fan sitesi call to your attention the total lack of respect i have received from isd ezwal by freezing my posts and not letting me spread the voice of my new website ive been working for months the whole purpose of it is to support the community and eve radio specificallycan you please intercede to make my posts available again and make isd ezwal publicly apologisethanks and regardsprin depranroldanuszaokdi menomvalora nuuksisola nuukwwwnovaprimemyshopifycomnovaprimetcgmailcom
estimated prin depranyou broke the rules
its amazing how void of good will eve people areabove from the fact that its free to play on everyones waysome ppl seem to be focused in making others life miserableas well as many other sites supported directly by eve nova prime doesnt break or intend to break in the foreseeable future any ruleposting the topic in 2 different rooms because it is related to both of them is not breaking the rulesor at least was not the intentionmy apologise to anyone i have offended with thisi wish there was a forum for grownups only
your threads were locked for investigation once the investigation is done you would either get the ok a warning or your account will be bannedwhy because you are charging people real money for eve related stuff via your myshopify site which is against the rules
based on what you have said you are doing something the isd deems wrongnow if they have been disrespectful thats another matterit is not a matter of respect if they are doing their job
look at his myshopify site charging people 10 to have stuff done or created for eve which is against the rules
and want a wonderful thing it is
wether you dont know how to read or you havent paid attention to the sitei encourage you to read it thoroughlythere is a very clear passage in the landing page that saysall advertisement spaces bought here will only be paid in isk currency in game virtual currency the shopping cart is only for donations purposesso if you dont wish to donate dont use itall donations will be sent to eve radio
thanksi am a personal fan of agony tutorials since 2008 i learned to play thanks to you guysmy respects
check carefully guysyou positively know that if you dont help me i will fall into nothing as happens to many players with initiativei am far from intending to break any rule and i know them by heartas mentioned before i play eve since 2008 and half no interest in losing my accountsas many other sites do my intention is to provide extra metagaming features to this community while supporting eve radio if by any chance someone decides to donate onlyi am charging isk 10 mill isk per month for each advertisementhow is it possible that a venture so clean like this one is not allowed and almost pursued like a witch hunt when we have dozens of eve online gambling sites aroundwhere is reasoni beg you intercede this is harmless
what actions did isd ezwal take that show a lack of respect 
yes but you can still buy the items so instead of setting up a proper donate section on static site for donation with the isk values for the stuff your doing for people you went and created a site as if you are selling them for real money you added a cost of 10 per item and a shopping cart so how will ccp know your not actually getting real money for thisstating that you dont take real money on a site that makes it available in any event means what you stated on the landing page means nothing your playing in a really grey area and in this case i would say you are in the wrong do it properly with a static site adding a paypal donate function to it what you are doing via myshopify is extremely questionabledonating it to eve radio is moot you could have just adding the donation link from eve radio to your site but did notnotice how easy it is for me to poke holes in everything you have done there i like what your offering i just think your doing it wrong with these kind of these of things there should be no yes but what about this kind of questions
am i being accused of something
yes and you should feel ashamed of it whatever it isi still like you though if that matters destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
in my province the teachers disciplinary board publishes decisions often with the name redacted it is a sign that they are active and if you cross certain lines you are gonna lose your teaching ticket however the decisions are not up for discussion or debate they have been madewould the op accept the occasional reporting of bans of the month as a dev blog no names just indicators in general terms    personally i understand that a the gms do not want to have to justify their actions over and over again b rules announced just seem to bring out the worst in internet lawyeringbut c the players would like a bit more insight as to what was done and whymmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
apply neut use warrior iis stealth bomber is dead you cant get more than 3000 ehp out of themsighas anyone could with one or three assault frigates your pointso you found another niche for it then congrats but that is more a testament to your skill and the lack of it in most other players than the ship itself i personally have never had issues swatting away in large ships in lowsec and have torn them apart using small shipsand judging the effectiveness of a ship based on how well they kill gimped minmaxfits that carebears use is about as good a barometer for overpowered as using a lollipop to find tornados hint it isntrattinganomaly ships that have been specifically designed to kill a certain type of npc will die to anything else just happen to be better than most at it because of cloakingtell you what take a trip down to lowsec and start hunting the native pvpers down there in your using the same tactics as you are now come back after a bit and then tell me they are overpowered
why is the stealth bomber in neut rangeassault frigates either dont have the range to avoid neuts or dont do the damage to take down battleshipstheyre also not cloaky so its much harder to gank things in themagain my point here is that theyre good at too many things im saying that the engagement profile is too wide not that they fulfill their niche too wellwe use it to hunt everything because regardless of your fleet the stealth bomber is the only one that can guarantee point since it has no decloak delay a gank fleet is always better with a stealth bomber
you see in those kills you linked 90 are kills against non combat targets industrials pods exploration frigates mobile depots against targets able to fight back are more the loss theres also some loss against venture
raylu with al l due respect those links are pretty irrelevant i believe shah and the others have answered most of your points well
thisyoure not fighting a wide range of targets you are shooting things that have limited to no capacity to fight back again if cloaking was not a factor then any other tech 2 frigate could pull off the same trick or more
were getting a bit offtopic here i cant really prove the viability of a ship for solo since there are too many factors in those sorts of engagementsregardless of whether solo are a thing are still too generally useful at other thingsand if all the other things the stealth bomber engaged couldnt be engaged by a stealth bomber i wouldnt be here complaining you will note that one of my suggestions was to remove the cloak and just make it a bomber
ughokand were done here
all that means is that the f1 monkeys need to pound that button to make their reimbursement
the just released csm8 minutes have some fascinating stuff in them but most of which as a relatively new player i am unqualified to even touch on however one area i think i am qualified to comment on is the concept of the social wall that was discussed with dr eyjogthe basic idea is that new players coming into the game who do not discover the social aspects or who do not engage with it will quickly leave the game essentially mining and shooting little red crosses or hauling stuff around gets boring fast in the absence of a social interaction to make it meaningfuli can attest to that i quickly figured out that mining in hisec was pretty boring hauling stuff only a bit less so and ratting only a tiny bit less than that my thought process was something like wow what a gorgeous detailed interesting gamebut like a gorgeous wedding cake that taste bland and cardboardy i hadnt gotten to the tasty part which was joining a corp interacting with other players and having funso i think if i had not joined a player corp i would have run smack into the social wall and eve would have remained a mildly interesting curiosity but nothing morethis brings us to the title of this post overcoming that social wall the minutes offered a suggestion of mentors but i dont think thats going to be viable apparently neither did the csmccprather i suggest a more radical solution limit new players to 1 month of npc corp membership i think those who find eve is totally unsuitable for them will not renew the subscription whereas those who are at least somewhat engaged will and at the end of their subscription they will be informed that the school republic university war college etc has graduated them and they have to get a job a menu box containing a choice of interests pvp exploration mining fleet ops salvage pi would then open up and the characters would be transferred to a player corp which has agreed to accept new applicants from the system at that point a degree of mentoring takes over welcome to acme mining messages and the opportunity for the corp members to mentortrainwoo their draftees corps who do well at it will thrive those who dont will lose the character to other corps or drive them from the game altogether which while unfortunate is likely what will happen to people who dont overcome the social wall anywayfor players who decide they need to be in an npc corp due to wardecs and such you can always go back to graduate school after say 23 months in the game or alternatively join npc corps that are not default newplayer corpsi realize this is a rather radical change but i think its worth consideringthe minutes also briefly touched on the issue of the gender disparity ive given that a bit of thought and while i dont have any really good answers one thing i think needs to be considered iswhat are female players doing in the gamefrom my admittedly limited experience it seems like the females tend to congregate in carebear corps salvaging mining hauling pi as opposed to pvp corps marketing these activities might bear ccp some fruit be an elven warrior princess seems to attract women to games like wow so be a rich powerful femme fatal starship pilot might attract women to eve
while i agree with your sentiments and do not doubt the sincerity behind your idea there is one critical flaw that i must point outyou cant force players to do anythingearly mmos discovered this early on you simply cannot engineer a situation to force people to behave a certain way in this case to be social they will simply do whatever they want to do and work around the rules to support that objectivehell there are a plethora of cases right here in eve that prove this pointthe real trick is to convince them that performing a certain action see being more sociable is in their interest and given that most people who play video games tend to be rather stubborn you need a rather extreme way to convince themexample the confusing gameplay of eveplus this would be a boon for spies
counter proposalhow about instead of ccp using the stick to drive players where they want them to go we let fellow players use the carrothow about a list of all new characters that ceos and directors can access that way we the players can reach out to these newbies before they ever strike that social wallkeep in mind im still a bit of a newbie myself and was fortunate that a veteran reached out to me and brought me into bni so this proposal may be riddled with holes but from my perspective it seems like a good idea
missions where you fly into the structuresso it looks more like the inside of stations  ship spinning while moving brilliant where player vs npc bumps do damage see more ships and less xs from the npcs as they are trying to ram you mixed with strip poker in station with bars that serve drinks that give 30 min 1 buffs  in low sec only followed by raising npc corporation taxes to 13 would have far more impact on player retaining and social interactionalso bring back the juke box we need it next to the poker table
i would counter that the nature of games always force players to do something the issue is how well how subtly they do it how extensively and how the players react to itbut you have a point i honestly do not know if this is something thats too overthetop or could be modifiednerfed in some way i would think ccp would have to take a cold hard look at their data and decide whether they dont have much to lose in that players who dont get into corps early on will leave the game vs toomuchsticknotenoughcarrotalso i am coming at this from a nonmmo players perspective so i get that more veteran mmo players may have different opinionsbut i dont see the boon for spies so much if youre a spyparanoid corp dont opt into accepting new players spies would be randomly dropped into one of several corps that meets whatever interest they clicked so theyd probably be better off leaving right away and joining their target corpwhich is basically the current status quo
agreed the best solution from ccps end is definitely going to look at providing more tools for established players to reach out to newbies rather than demanding that the newbies find a place for themselves on their own ive talked about this before reposting the suggestion i made last time there was a thread up about this
in an open sandbox pvp game should not be scripted expecting a certain outcome or directly influenced telling capsuleers which path to take by ccp anymorewhen a live event is taking place it should encourage the organisational skills of the new eden denizensa live event should be a cumulating results of players interacting with each other in an open environment coolthe live event that will take place should be a result of an avalanche of intrigue role playing and use of the meta gamewhere the team should not regulate the conditions but only monitor its progress and use social media to incite itto start such an avalanche that might or might not result in a player base created live event ccp should rethink its strategy on how to start one with the help of the csm or cpm even to involve the dust side of new edenwhat does the csm think of the use of by ccp more as an eve online promotional tool for expansions or gaming conventions and less as persistent pvepvp content for its current costumers 
not a fan of the wow analogy but whats so bad about instant pvp i thought this game was about making your own fun and play stylealso calling it instant wow style pvp seems like an exaggeration and a reach for attention
yepplus drone boats get a much larger drone bay to store spares and other types of drones that can do different things eg my dominix can use sentries then heavies then lights and finally light ecm drones with plenty of room for spares on the other hand my megathron is limited to using only 3 heavysentry drones or 5 mediums with a backup of lightsi have considered it and counter with drones requiring no cpu powergrid or capacitor power from the mothership itself there are also sentry drones for ranged tactics they apply their damage just like a turret doesi will agree though that more diverse options in drone rigs and implants are needed assuming we are using a light electron blaster for reference switching to void ammo from faction antimatter would be akin to swapping an acolyte for a hobgoblin your damage goes up a bit but you are still technically using a light weapona vexor can use medium and light drones with equal proficiency that would be akin to a thorax being able to switch between light electron blasters and heavy electron blasters at will and apply its hull bonuses to both
i think that would be incredibly fair i agree completely with a and b any insight would be helpful i get the feeling that ultimately the gms are fair and punishments are uniform but an occasional blog like this would help players understand that the gms are in fact out there being uniform and fair even quarterly would be sufficient if monthly would be too much of a burden
not going to cut it the overview needs ripped out and replaced with a completely fresh concept if ccp wastes time fiddling with the overview as it is now then they will not really make all the changes the overview needs as they will do their standard we worked on that dont expect to see any more improvements for 10 yearsyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
want to change eve to a larger sandbox simple in theory get rid of the gates period no more bubbles for bath anyway i have to agree with the no cynos in whs tooch
cynos arent coming to wspace i said that to illustrate a point
is becoming an overloaded system even with the dedicated node player numbers have been reaching 25k which is causing an unreasonable amount of lag while in system especially while in or around 44i have 2 simple suggestions to help with this1 fixed grid around 44 stationplayers drag out the grid on 44 causing a great deal of lag on undock fix the grid to a lower than normal range say 200klm to reduce the gridload lag when undockingthere is an existing case for something like this with gms removing excessive cans on gate camps due to the additional lag it causes when players jump in 2 logoff timer for  reduce the sever load by applying an inactivity logoff timer in that systema reasonable length of time perhaps 1 hour of inactivity will result in you being disconnected from the server reducing load on that node i would imagine the system numbers would be reduced considerably by this feature
i actually have no real problem with the idea of the training implants to supplement the training program obviously each system has to have a way of levelling up a character and while there could be arguments made for the different methodologies this one isnt so bad the opportunity to speed up ones training by purchasing said implants is fine along with the risk associated with losing them i dont think this system has ever really been responsible for losing clients  as a sole reason  but perhaps in association with both the steep learning curve and the fact that new pilots are pretty much left to their own devices once in game combine to overwhelm those too used to being coddled spoonfed and otherwise not used to facing a challengesince its unlikely that the method of character advancement is to change in any grandiose way i would suggest two thingsfirst if you look at what the implants are supposed to do raise certain attributes of mental acuity then why cant these same bonuses work towards the characters activities as well if you were to give any real person such a boost to perception hes naturally become better at spotting movement etc boost intelligence hed become smarter and so on so why shouldnt each character no be able to apply these gains in attributes to the ships mods rigs andor activities heshes involved withmakes sense no lets say a character would gain a 1 advantage for each level implant he puts in  and this would apply universally across all items that require that implants attribute adjustment in some way or other yet to be determinedalso youd tie the hardwiring to these implants too buy a l1 implant and you can plug in a l2 hardwire and so on up to a l5 implant for a l6 hardwiresecond how about making them plug and play do away with the remap and you plug in what you want when you want itwhy not in a sandbox were supposed to be determining our own future anyway why not remove this stumbling block training time still takes the time it doeswe do it with ships mods subsystems etc anywaysetting up a whole new skill system for making them so they become player made sounds like a good idea tooanyway a couple ideas to put out there good discussions herecheers

quotewhy should i be the one to raise the level of this terrible whinethreadin essence the complaint is that organised invested groups of players are able to kill a semiafk oblivious ratter wherefore then should i have the motivation to change any mechanicthe ratter can join an active invested purposeful group and rat with impunity with existing game mechanicsquotewhile i agree there is a lot of whining a lot of trolling you are simply missing the point and or have not taken the time to actually read everything in the threadgoal change mechanic so that those who are active can do stuff  those who are not dieif i am a semi afk oblivious ratter or miner  then yes i should dieif i am a semi afk oblivious cloaked scoutganker  then yes i should die  current mechanics do not allow for this to happenif i am an active purposeful pilot with and active and purposeful group or solo then i should have a reasonable chance of survival i believe nobody should have impunity  so do many many who have both posted here and have noti do appreciate that a member of the csm has comment on my thread however i would hope that a good explanation or an elevation of this concern could be made rather than an offhand comment as to it being a terrible whine thread i have made many attempts to make the motivation clear both sides of the issue have been discussed if you weed out the whines pines trolls there is a lot of good suggestions in this thread
why is an afk cloaked player of any concern to you youre in no danger whatsoeverlets be honest here your chief concern is that youre unable to tell the difference between an afk cloaked player and a nonafk cloaked player which is what causes your anxiety when you say you want a method for dealing with afk cloaky players you really just want a method for telling the difference between afk and non afk so far no one has come up with a reasonable compromise between players who lurk around a system cloaked and players who fear getting ganked
and if such a tool was implemented then you can simply go dock up go afk and return once in a while to see if the cloaky ship is afk or not then isnt that pretty much the same thing in reverse now were giving the one hiding with no intention to engage a tool to further be able to hide at least the cloaky will attack by whatever means
ccp gave all the t1 industrials 2 high slots because it was necessitated by wormhole life they decided it was important for them to be able to fit both a cloak and a probe launcherwe still have 3 out of 4 blockade runners that have only 1 high slot this means that in reality they always have a cloak and cannot use any other module including covert cyno generatorsignoring the other issues with their ship bonuses please add a second high slot to all the blockade runners so that they can fit both a cloak and a covert cyno generator like the prowler
ive told ccp a couple times now that when blockade runners are up for balance they need this as well as the across the board ability to hit 10km3 cargo
you think mining is dull  dont mine tired of having to defend a play style meh the more threads i read the more pointless it all seems change seems to be the constant in these discussionsi seriously wonder if eve will be around in 10 years 
seems people wana drive ore prices up and drive solo miners out of the game  bring on the next gen space mmos wont take much for me to cancel my accounts im sure im not alone 
you are a csm member and this is your response your problem seems to be mainly that youre not very good at the things youre tryingis it possible at all that you could enter into a somewhat rational discussion of game mechanics and the direction that ccp andor others have pushed this gamei recently returned and im beginning to see that the game is now worse than when i left if i want a dramaqueen game then i can play hello kittyccp  wake up your game subscriptions are stagnant and you have pushed the game into the hands of a few people and ignored game mechanics for the sake of holding on to these big fishps ive scanned a few of the forums and find that the responses to legitimate questions as indicative of how people feel they can act are less than juvenile sophomoric or rude intelligence wise bestial comes to mind this is not a problem of moderation but of the kind of mindset that ccp is encouraging in its players
next time dont call out completely random things that are not true to illustrate a point youre a csm and theres always people who will believe you use your brain a little little man

if yourship goes into an emergency warp while a structure is in the way you will never enter warp your ship will endlessly bump into the structure and you will never be able to cancel warp because emergency warps cannot be cancelledin low sec and nullsec this can be a very big problem as any one who happens by will then end the life of your infinitely stuck clonethis can be a problem in hi sec as well no matter what ship your in or what your doing im sure your imaginations can go from therei was told by a gm that this is a normal intended game mechanic snip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwal this intended game mechanic is a mechanic that im sure every one can agree needs changedhere is a chat transcriptsnip please refrain from posting gm correspondence isd ezwal

inb4 thread locked  posts deletedalso note the difference between ewarp and regular warping ewarp only involves either logging in or out if youre in a capital ship or something and you somehow get bumped repeatedly on logging into the game and die before you can act thats an exploit on the other end if youre trying to log out and youve got an aggression timer or something that stops you from safe logging and then you also have something big and clunky in your way like a pos that stops you from warping off to a random safe thats your own faulteven so that doesnt follow from what was posted regarding the situation since you were aligning to a gate not a random safe the implication is that you got caught warping away from a pos and died shortly thereafter which sucks sure but whining about it on the forums doesnt help your case especially not while breaking the rules about it
so you were not even in the same system as the pos when you got destroyedholy fail batmanseriously cancel sub because you are not going to get a reimbursementjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
why does how long its been a rule matter its still stupid and i still dont agree with itnope once tackled i was able to run for a whilethe point is there is a time period where my ship was stuck due to emergency warp not being able to be canceled as the gm stated it is a normal intended game mechanic that you be stuck next to a structure while in an emergency warp unable to manually pilot eject self destruct or issue any commands to your ship it is intended that your character be rendered useless until destroyed by hostile pilotsthis is a supremely  mechanic and this post is a proposal to change thatquoteendovioreven so that doesnt follow from what was posted regarding the situation since you were aligning to a gate not a random safe the implication is that you got caught warping away from a pos and died shortly thereafterquotei wish you guys would readmy ship was aligning to an emergency warp point not a gate i got caught while stuck in an emergency warp that would never initiate and i couldnt cancel
okay we im not sure this applies to the conversation but thanksthe tackle happened at the pos first we fought all the way to the gate and and through to the next system its one fight
disregarding the fact that you shouldnt have posted what you posted anyways the material that you posted didnt support that assertion unless what youre trying to say is that you logged on in a pos that you used to have access to and somehow that spawned you in a glitched position or something which would be more reasonable but isnt implied by your statements thus far

happy new year to all fans of my ideas dont forget to like thumb up and comment thanks
its not implied by my statements because thats not what happened what happened is stated in the original postthe removed content was proof that it is an intended game mechanic that i think should be changed
okay then i maintain that the sequence of events as youve presented them is incoherentemergency warp again only triggers on logon and logoff if you didnt login to an ewarp in which you somehow got caught you wouldnt have been online for the ewarp if you logged off for an ewarp then its your own fault if there was someone in position to catch you because you didnt safe either way that wouldnt have led to the sequence of events you described which leads me to conclude that youre using the term emergency warp incorrectly
pretty much thisyou dont ewarp unless you log off  disconnect i suppose if you had an alt monitoring the character who logged off you could watch them get stuck on a gate attempted to ewarp is this what happened or did you log off and log immediately back in to discover your ship attempting to ewarp while stuck on the gate this is akin to what happens to many highsec freighters that attempt to log out to save themselves from getting suicide ganked the gankers the just bump the ship to prevent it from ewarping out and give it an aggro timer with a noobship until they get their gank squad together for the gank note if you initiated warp somewhere bounced off the gate as you aligned to your destination and were thereby unable to get to safety before getting tackled this isnt called an ewarp furthermore this warp could be canceled by hitting ctrlspace
yes i agree please devolve oh disgruntled player perhaps back to the trees with thee would be less stressful an environment as clearly your attempt to evolve from was indeed a mistake
as stated several times in this thread i am not opposed to that either however to avoid obvious abuses and level the playing field another form of intelligence gathering needs to be implemented as well the ability to automate d scan similar to what you do when you first enter a system for instance that is only one example but there are many good ideas on the subject
there really doesnt please show us the experience you have flying bomberscov ops on this or whatever alt you may have because right now all i see is a renter complaining about not being safe during his farming
from what i can gather his domi arrived at the pos33 seconds later a hostile engaged his ship while he was aligning to the gate he used his mjd moved out of tackle range and got to the gatehe jumped into the next system 2 minutes 57 seconds after that first engagement where he was tackled and killedso at what point was he stuckhe was either trying to get away from them and warped to the pos or he logged out and in there but as the time he arrived to when he was first engaged at the pos is only 33 seconds its hard to fathom what he was doing he may have been running and tried to log then realised he had a timer that meant his ship wouldnt disappearwho knows well he does but hes rather vague about it all one thing we know for sure he does whine a great dealdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
actually i am reading a scifi novel dealing with a huge spaceshipbattle there also the time it is mentioned that the fight lasts thats how i got the idea of slowing down eveUFFFDs battlespeed at the moment the time period of the battle seems like in an egoshooter eve is no egoshooter is it we move extremly huge ships how is it poostble to destroy or get destroyed in miliseconds there is no time to call friends for help like it is shown in the trailers the only sense is to contact them for revenge not for help this would raise the gaming experience wouldnUFFFDt iton sisi i tried flying capitals moros those are hard to destroy what gives you enough time to call for help and turn the combat the amount of fun is immense and you get addicted to pvppreparing your fitting for 2 hours getting killed in 30sec is not that fun i think having time to understand whatUFFFDs going on in the fight would animate a lot more people to do pvpi hope you understand what i mean and think about my suggestionthx k
given tidi huge fleet battles are plenty slow as is no need to make them slower
do you only fly in fleets in which tidi is working how log did a fight goes in rl between two frigates what if just the tank shield armor and hull is 2 times bigger not the shield recharge or repair amountps i think this is the wrong section please move to features  ideas discussion
people complained about fights being too short years ago so ccp gave all ships a 50 buff to all ships hpthe result people died just as quickly because people fitted more gank andor brought more people to compensatethe lesson we all learned unless you radically nerf damage never going to happen or the ability to team up with others against one person also not going to happen there is no way to make fights last for hours
so your idea for making mining more interesting is to not make it more interesting but just buff it more isk for the same risk noin the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move  d adams
being a resident of null sec is the only place i like to play the game ccp wanted industry to be enhanced in nullsec but put asteroid sights on the scanner window for easy access to pirates then interceptors warp faster while mining barges get into warp slower not to mention the larger ships that do pve being slower to get to a safe spot result is less industry and fewer pve playersrebalancing was conceived under the idea of bringing new players a fair chance to continue to play but in fact it is reducing the number of older players that have had their joy taken out of the gameplease do not renew my membership several members of our corp are not renewing either this rebalancing has taken the fun of a great game well done fozzy put industry back into nullsec and enough with fern tactics
i think i speak for literally every literate intelligent player in eve when i sayseriouslyharden the omitted up your in nullsec home of vast empires and coalitions and your telling me out of all the people you should have in your alliance in order to holddefend your cozy little hole in the backwaters of space none of them are willing or just blatantly assigned to watch your pve systems for gankersgangsnullsec is about cooperation if no one in your alliance is willing to either a pve with you for some additional security or b watch you and the tohers in local while you pve then you should find a new group to play with because obviously they dont care about their members anyways and if your alone in system in nullsec doing pve you deserve to get gankedsorry your 0scurity space isnt safer than highsec i eprsonally love the new changes there was no reason before that a battleship should be able to notice someone entering system and be halfway into warp to their pos by the time the hostile loaded grid on the gate now at least you nullbears have to fight for your safety
can i haz your stuff
damnit asuka beat me too it seriously have patience and industry will get its boosts too

i never hear wormholers complaining about afk cloaking maybe if they changed how local works in null sec you wouldnt know anyone was afk cloaking problem solved
from the killmail it seems as if this guy legitimately flew into a legitimate gate campqq some more
a couple of weeks ago we had a fight with our nados vs some russian ravens over a pos they outnumbered usthey maintained fire on our fc while our fc called for frequent target switches until we had killed enough logi to break the ravens all the time keeping a bubble on their triaged carrier it was one of the most enjoyable fights ever so that would support the op however in fact op is wrong and you are correct it is the rapidly changing battlefield that makes eve pvp hard and fun it would be too easy to make logistics op in small scale fights if any more buffer was given to ships still those fights where nothing will break without good fleet coordination and clever switching are still to be treasuredmoney at its root is a form of rationing when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 35 billion 50 of humanity it is clear where the source of poverty is

the responses to this thread arent terribly constructive because well the op wasnt terribly well thought outpsyue even hinted at the answer but didnt realise the significance since you cant really make a profit on invention or manufacturing due to costs of materials why bother having the skills if a project isnt profitable players wont take part in it when players stop taking part in it supply falls when supply falls owing to the supplydemand mantra prices rise when prices rise such that the item becomes profitable again players begin menufacturing againas always the complaints regarding an activity being too difficult does not lie in a flaw in the game it lies in a flaw in the player psyue has reacted too slowly to new profitable deals doesnt react in time when deals become unprofitable and generally expects too much for very little effort hes losing out because other players sare simply doing a better job than him end of story

hello csm as you guys can talk to ccp more often then we doplease point their mac guys to winemuch lovethe lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels  the scriptures book ii apocalypse 101 npclivesmatter freetheboobs
what specifically is wrong with the mac client i play fairly often and see no discernible difference
macs are awesome macs are hip macs dont get virusesheh macs cant play eve
of course youre missing the fact that doing a winebased client does nothing for mac users when the ciderbased client and its updates are handled by a transgaming who is dedicated to providing quality releases to the mac client doing it via wine includes no support via the appropriate internal channels at ccp or transgamingyoure more than able to do things in a similar fashion to a linux installation on your shiny overpriced paper weight but thats no reasons to ask ccp to drop a much more costeffective client for mac and devote extra resources to building a winebased client for a small portion of the playerbase

as much as i would like the industrial side of eve worked on i know there are multiple teams doing work on different aspects of the gamerebalancing is needed just as much for overall gameplay as industry but rebalancing is modifying existing assets using a predefined method editing major mechanics like industrial could result in new mechanics code or a restructure of the entire idea of what industry is in eve let the 4 or so people do the rebalancing and let the teams of 68 people do the major mechanics work at the same time
that would make nullsec as dangerous as wormholes or at least seem dangerousupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
isnt more danger more exciting when i am gassing in a c5 i get my jimmies rustled everytime i see someone trying to scan me down
eve is a popular game due to the risk involved people should go play on the test server if they just want to amount stuff
this is a great idea we do need to make all blockade runners identical in eve after that proceed with all other ship classesnext step will be to homogenize the skill points so that every player should have the average skill points per member in evewe will have ourselves a great game to play may the best whiner win 
many has the time been when i have a contract assigned to me by someone that they want me to move with my freighter alt if you are like me then you have assets all over eve so when you accept said contract as say jita you then have to sort through the stuff and private contract it to your freighter alt as often times they are not docked at the same placei imagine this being an additional button on the contract page accept and forward you then go through the standard contract creation process so you can select the toon to transfer to modify the conditions of the contract if need be and complete questions ability to add additional items to
the question i raise up to your comments  is it more cost effectiveccp probably has to pay transgaming for the rights to use cider cider im sorry to say is just a shell on top of a wine program yeah you have people who at transgaming wake up go to work and work on fixing bugs in their software but as far as i can tell a large chunk of their software is freeware that they go and modify to make it easier for other companies to add support for windows apps to macccp already has a mac devision that maintains the updates to the mac and provides the polish to the ui problem many of the cool extra features are not on mac twitch not there i know that on the corp info panel i cant click the little e settings icon to provide function for corporation benefits yeah these you might say are small things and not worth the headache of making such a big change but lets look at it this way for the last hundreds of years people fought bled and died for equal rights these minority groups fought mac is a minority group among pcs but there is no rightful cause to exclude them just bc their os is different you might think im being extreme but it would be the same if ccp said that redskinned people couldnt play eve only white people or even yellowskinned peopleand then your whole poke about my shiny overpriced paper weight sounds like you profiling at least my os doesnt change so much from version to version i have to get a windows for dummies to understand what these so called blocks are for or even disable most of the new ui features so i can figure out what my great and wonderful microsoft diddthe lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels  the scriptures book ii apocalypse 101 npclivesmatter freetheboobs
on what do you base that outpouring of bile all ships classes have a slew of common areas where they identical but i havent heard complaints about frigs bs cruisers et al being identical and ushering in the death of eveeven if they were all to have a comparable minimum size hold and twin highs which are actually needed not just idly craved youd still have low  mid rack as well as all the stats to differentiate themif smuggling is overhauled they might have a purpose but since that is unlikely i could see them operate like minijumpfreighters with ability to lock onto covert cynos  doesnt even have to be a builtin jump drive add it as a rare fuel hungry highslot module  an alternative to either cloak or cynogen assuming they all get two highs
1 to this one of the few actually good and useful ideas that ive found so far in this forum section the dscan interface begs for improvements for a better gaming experience
hahahah i have no idea who malcanis is but the troll is strong with that one play on playersecondly you guys are so damn sensitive just relax besides all your ideas to fix eve are behind my idea to get all titans to warp and fire cloaked
no they dont thats all handled by transgaming as part of the maintenance of the mac eve client major production changes that occur that need changes to cider to run are handled by transgaming all other elements that involve directx or win32 binaries are supported by the cider engine or handled by transgamings bug division this was all detailed hereit is more costeffective as ccp doesnt have to devote developer resources on their part to maintaining the mac client instead they release to transgaming and let transgaming handle the mac build concurrent to the development of the windows version in the end this saves ccp the costs of a single mac division and investing in a separate build environment for the mac client plus the usual hoodads of translating directx and the win32 api to a nonnative system with a pure wine distribution ccp would lose the farmedout aspect of the code would have to significantly invest in developing a stable winebased distribution system and would then lose hundreds of man hours that could be more effectively used to just developing the game normally
the logical conclusion is to make blockade runners nonracial ships since theyll be functionally identical

ccp would probably need to do some vetting of the corps that get access to newbie npc corps to make sure they are newbie friendly corps instead of corps just inflating their member count for taxes or corps that will take anyone but dont provide the help that new players need
hard to get over the social walls when your own corps will kill you for doing things like missions or because your expensive ship would look good on their kb
of course there are always people who take seriously and literally what is obviously meant to be a metaphor or ironic thats what makes doing it so much fun as an additional benefit allowing stupid people to selfidentify saves other people from accidentally taking their seriously meant opinions seriously
after having read through this post and all the links a situation with bumping does need to be evaluated by ccpactual event you load your charon with 923000 m3 of material to transport to hek along the way you exit a gate and are singled out by a bumper for the next 45 minutes while you are trying to escape the bumper continues to hold you from going to warp since a charon can not be fit and has such a great top speed it is easy to see where this is going the bumper receives no damage to his ship and is not flagged for this activity when the gank crew arrives you die you can not get away go to another location etc you would like to do that very thing so in the end you loose the 16 billion isk ship and the 45 billion isk collateral for the loadbumping had been in the game for a long time however it is now being used instead of a trigger this is also very wide spread and spreading wider i can see a day when no one will use capital freighters to move material you have an economist on staff ask him the effect on the eve economy when goods are no longer transported once freighters are extinct the industrials will be next and they dont need as many in the gank squad to kill it so the high points are bumping to keep a slow defenseless ship in high sec from warping no concord attention miners and freighters classed together totally different activitiesgame mechanics andor recognizing the aggression exhibited need a serious look
omg this thread again please ccp do it for 48 hours only enable suspect flag for bumping so maybe theyll get the point
45 minutes thats a long time if this is such a widespread problem youd think that freighter pilots would start hiring escorts to protect them or alternately that theyd have guys oncall in their corpalliance to come bail them out when they get caught heck if youre actively trying to escape during that time youd probably have time to hire ingame mercenaries to come save you but any of that would require you to interact with other players so i can see where it holds a difficulty for yougiven that as a freighter pilot you probably could use someone to web you anyways its really not much of a stretch to have that same guy fit for suicide ganking so that in an emergency he can trade himself for a bumper to let you escape a trap
from the minutes the most significant predictor of whether a new player was retained wasthe activities she engaged incsm 8 august 2013 minutesdr eyjog said that the data wasnt able to prove that it was in fact a social wall thatwas the hypothesis and they were working on itthe csm clarified that engagement was measured by doing things in game withsomeone who only ever did missions being measured as less engaged than someonewho missioned and had a trader character and roamed on lowsec on anothercharacter or even the same one for all three independent of how social eithercharacter wasaffinity and rise noted that the recent study showed some very interesting andcounterintuitive results related to this issue  preferred activities and sociality were notcorrelated and the most significant predictor of whether a new player was retained wasthe activities she engaged inaffinity novices that follow the traditional path tend to churn out of the game thosethat follow the pvebuilder path retain at a higher rate players who go from novice toaggressor pure pvp tend to filter out of the game
it would be nice if the player run corps wanted to do this but most dont or cant csm 8 august 2013 minutes dr eyjog said that the other possibility for the barrier was a knowledge wall whichcan be addressed by social but that isnt rooted in a social connectiondr eyjog suggested that the group which jumped to expert was just more interestedand able to learn by themselves thus bringing them over a knowledge barrierdr eyjog said they asked surveys about why people quit and asked if they knew aboutthe sandbox plenty of people said they didnt and didnt want to be in it
a more likely example is a ceo of a griefer corp logs on cons newbies into trusting them deceives them and then ruins the game for them
sure because its completely possible to bail someone out when you have 20 ships throwing a oneshot alpha at a freighterwell ignore your stupid post for todayneed stuff moved push industries will handle it serving highsec lowsec and nullsec  and we do it faster and more reliably than anyone else ingame channel pushx
i found your problemif you were dumb enough to carry that much in a freighter you deserve what you got
firstly notice that my point was specifically in regards to the implausible situation of a bumper holding a freighter in place for 45 minutes if you cant figure out some way to deal with a little bumpy frigate in that amount of time you deserve whats coming to you obviously if youre alone in space unable to flee and the gank squad is already on top of your defenceless freighter your losing mistake was made a long time ago but the story is different if youre caught by an opportunistic bumper who doesnt have a gank squad present and is trying to call one in to deal with you much like with a tackled capital that is a window of time in which it is possible to respondsecondly oneshot alpha freighter usually not no sure there is a numbercomposition of ships which can pull off the feat but that tends to be a losing proposition remember gankers rely on that window of time between initial aggression and concords arrival to kill harder targets at the very least you could presummon concord read have your buddy shoot their bumper hopefully killing him before dying to concord in turn which changes the ganking equation pretty unfavorably since with concord on the field gankers will more or less instantly die after aggressing sure its possible that they brought enough dps to win anyways but the numbers are worse than even a gank in 10 not perfect protection but if youve been at all sensible with your cargo value youve just guaranteed a loss to the gankers
look since the number of subscribers in eve has been dropping off dramatically i thought that what eve really needs is a real hook to reel in the new players the best i could come up with is a new take on your first 5 minutes of eve and then i looked into the other games i play to build up my character well how about a harsh take on reality with a game like need for speed underground example player n just clicked the ok button on character selection player n is whisked away to a random spot in nullsec not a part of the full tranquility server so no other players in the system with you armed with a battleship and the everpresent aura guiding with tutorials ie warp off station go to sun go to planet dock at station join fleet player n joins fleet npcs and is greeted by scripted greetings and rowdy banter typical to their chosen faction aura guiding on ins and outs of what your ship is what fittingsrigs are and such player n finally gets through the last tutorial and fleet chat starts flashing opening it theres a convo about an enemy fleet approaching a fleet member tells everyone to undock aura guides player n to undock a fleet member tells everyone to warp to gate and engage hostiles once again aura guides player n to activate modules to help with tanking explaining a difference in shield armor and hull tanking coming out of warp its pure devastation theres wrecks everywhere heavy losses on both sides aura is helping slightly aim at this target click or use a button for this module once player n scores a kill scripted the hostiles engage player n and succeeds in not only killing his ship but podding him as well clone activation aura appears during the black screen with a tutorial about clones skills and various other tips on what to do player n upon reaching the end of this tutorial has to purchase his first alpha clone as well as purchasing on auras market a noobship thats all the money they have for it and various fittings like mining lasers and shield boosters and skillbooks are still given freely through tutorialswhat do you thinkoderint dum metuant let them hate so long as they fear accius
brilliant suggestion
theres also the whole problem of well how do you get the player in a bs when newbies dont start with all that easy you start them with all that pod them back to station and theyve lost it all whats that if you undock in an unupgraded clone you lose skillpoints good to know thanks tutorialbasically this would teach a lot of the really niche parts of pvp all in one go using the traditional rpg trope of give the player a lot of power then take it away see assassins creed iirc the beginning of mass effect 2 others people want to get it back so boom youve already got an idea of progress and progression you can still even be a new capsuleer woken up specifically for that battle when suddenly oops you get sent back to your newbie institution to relearn some things because of pod death
i like and alis suggestion except there has to be a way to keep the fool from running away from the podding so he can keep the skill listmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
whats that some sort of bubble that spits out of a ship preventing warp d
i saw your comment on the post on the mittani i love it its an instant hook and you would learn so much more the main advertising of eve is the awesome fleet fights if people come to eve because of the market or some of the other niche stuff they have heard about they are already hooked its the people that ccp gets from the adverts that we need to convincecapsuleers have to graduate from a school before they can be qualified to step in a pod im almost imagining a final exam type deal this way we dont have to worry about poddinggetting out of the simulationanything else when they start they are given the skills to fly the ships needed when they are done they go back to normal and aura tells them thisin a fleet fight almost every aspect of the game comes into play you have logi boats ecm cap warfare etc have a npc logi rep the player up from low armorshield use a frigate neutralizer to cap the hell out of the player until he is useless  unable to hit the small frigate with his large guns then a pair of npc destroyers can come in and save him the tutorial should be about establishing relationships between things big vs small capacitor and mods ecm vs dps etc the player doesnt need to know everything about these things by the end of the tutorial he merely needs to know that they exist that cap warfare is a thing logistics can save a ship ecm is a  and big guns cant shoot small targets a tutorial like this will emphasize what can be gained from flying with other people how different ship types can compliment each other and friends can come in and save the day another thing to add though  i think a plug to eve university is needed in game yes its favoring a group of players get over it the amount of help they will be able to give is significantly more than they are ever going to get from the starter corp and help channel
not a problem if its a random spot in nullsec all you need is a dictorhey they can learn about bubbles too i love this ideaedit ninjad by csm
csm 7 i think suggested exactly this sort of thing at one of the summits now you are going to make me go back and look at summit minutescsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
yeah here it is
wow that is some serious trial by firebut this fleet thing would it be like an npc fleet i mean as much as i would like it to be a player fleet its unlikely going to be that how would aura know undock now warp to xxxx bridge via titani mean it would be one thing if it a weekly thing planned ahead by ccp
itd be an npc fleet and aura would know because the entire thing was scripted sure it wouldnt be as amazing as a real thing but if its the first thing the player sees the sense of bigness would still be theretwo step thats awesome
many games actually try this fast forward introduction but its easy to get it wrong esp in complex games to pick an example the introduction chapter of witcher 2 where you start with fairly high skills got the most criticism
dont allow people to skip the mission on their first character every other character can skip it want to skip it on a new account create a throwaway character biomass it you can now skip it
what makes those games failuresedit if its not clear i say this not because im questioning your assessment or cant use google but just because its sometimes useful to think about what parts of a thing work and what dont by looking at other examples
we used to be closer to this when you started the game in space being shot at by 2 rats it wasnt much but it was in space and there was shooting
hmmm to get the actual size of it a you would want capitals involved probably some doomsday animations
this sounds like a great idea itd be great to tweak it so it still fits in the universe so as to not hurt the rp players worst case its a training simulation as you graduate from capsuleer training or whatevergetting players over the dying is fun even though you have to buy a new ship spacesuit is key were immortal people
or give them a fuel hold and only able to hold their racial fuel type as well as a fleet hangar that will hold ammo and nanite paste
why would they need a fuel bay they dont have jump driveswhy would they need a fleet hangar theyre a small cloaked industrialgripe about being functionally identical all you want then go look at the t1 scanning frigates or covops frigates all brs need 2 hislots to perform their role correctly
fuel truck for blops fleetsbomb truck for blops fleets and i agree all of them need 2 high slots i was just trying to provide a way to differentiate them and provide a reason for them to be separate instead of just one ore vessel
have to agree just as an fyi to the csm member mentioned the player behind psyue mi has been in game design and was computer gaming long before there even was an internet  so have i weve got enough crap in our hangers to sell off to plex these accounts for years  but to what end weve made a few suggestions over the years mostly ignored and have pretty much come to the conclusion that ccp is just clueless and the csm is a jokein the end ccp  the game actually has to remain fun to bring in and retain players
i like the idea no sec status restriction needs to apply why would it matter what the toons sec status is i didnt expect to play past the 21 day trial so i just typed my gamer tag as one wordlazy and stuff
although i am generally against this in principle im not above making suggestions so if it does happen its a bit more palatable one requirement to me would be that any past names appear on your profile say in a clear colour between where your character name and your titles appear and that the old name is still linked to your character so for example any eve gate search of your old name or even something close to it would bring up your new character name as a possible result and noone else can ever reuse the name i might even argue that a symbol appear against your name in any chat channel windows in particular local that signifies you are known by other names so more cautious people can be warned it might be worth checking your profile to make sure you arent known to them in another form  although depending how easycheap this service would be to use this might be pointless if a large percentage of pilots use it if half the pilots in the local window in any given system is showing the icon people will stop taking it as a warning so rendering in pointless

you could also build into the small ships vs big ships into this too just have a segment where you have to try and shoot a frigate but cant a play in like this isnt there to teach the new person everything its to show the new character that these relationships are there so they can go learn more about them ship types in a battle ammo resistances optimal and falloff capacitor warfare ewar logistics cynos overheating shield tank vs armor tank you dont need to say this is a falcon falcons use ecm this is what ecm does and how it works no instead the intro can put you through a short jam cycle point out the ship that is doing it and have you blap it you dont know how ecm works but you do know it exists which is far better than the average pilot ends up after the tutorial mission
okay so first things first i would like to thank members of the csm who have taken time out of their busy schedules to take a look into my mind for a bit as well as thanks for the comments into the behindthescenes ideassecondly i did not realize that the fanbase of both this forum and mittanis would suddenly be into this as they have this idea and as frank as i can explain was more of a bit of flowcharting a bit of fanfiction im currently working on added to the idea of new subscribers not finding a reason to stay past their first yearso what would drive a new player into doing anything other than flying noobships and shooting rocksit got me thinking why do i eve   not a typothen why should others eve   also not a typoit made me think of every hook that makes me want to play games but eves new player startup missions were severely lacking have you gone back to your roots and tried the newbie missions as a highskilled player its as bad as trying to sit through the entire music video of rebecca blacks fridayswhat do i find in wow yes i play stfuthe grind is horrible but the storyline is beautiful as are the landscapeswhat do i play borderlands foronce again the grind is horrible but the camaraderie with a group is amusing at timeswhat makes minecraft fun well imaginationand the grind is horrible once you get past the big picture you start seeing this idea start to pester the players who always seem to have the best stance on the topic half the subscribed players think the other half is cannon fodder waiting to be exploited but the smaller half have mixed ideas about what to think some are nullseccers are evil so stay in highsec some are pirates and scams are terribad but itll never happen to me and lastly some are as long as i can safely shoot these rocks and make isk i dont careforcing new players into euni sounds like a good idea in the long run but it would require a corporation rebalancing to take place you dont believe me how big can a corporation be how many players is ccp looking to sign upa few hundred no problem a few thousand little difficult tens of thousands um things are getting out of hand a million please sto tens of millionswell were not wow so i think trying to break half a million subs should be a main focus but if eve can somehow break the bank and we can login to find that theres now 100k people on almost all the time things will perk up economics will see greater fluctuations nations not really alliances anymore will rise to power or fade from existence ccp would have to increase their war server shards by 300 for new bouts of combat springing up all overalso im out of good vodka koolaid is keeping me going thoughoderint dum metuant let them hate so long as they fear accius
this would be fantastic i cannot put into words just how cool of an introduction to eve this would have been i was lucky to have friends who could guide me through all the things someone needs to be successful in eve but what a great way to get a glimmer of what eve is capable of
also at the end aura should saynow you felt how real eve looks like its up to you to decide whether you want to experience that feeling again or you would rather spend your eve career as a cowardly highsec carebear whose only purpose is to grind for isk
i like the general idea butdont put a new player in a battleship a bc or cruiser will do the job too and will deter from the idea biggerbetter and teasing him with the ability to fly a bs when he cant speed up skill progress much may lead up to frustration
awesomesauce idea 1
i will try to be constructive no after completing the new player introduction they will find that a battleship is 34 months away with fair skills a ship they should not be trying to get into that fast anyway stick with a t1 frigate quick to train into and fairly cheap to replace also while i have never done it myself faction warfare i am told is possible and profitable for a newish pilot in a t1
i like the idea but you should make it a simulation a training for new pod pilots while their first clone is being prepared there would be too much stretch from the reality and it could really drive away people by making them think they will go back to a rookie character if they diealso a lot of people that tried other mmos with personal stories are tired of starting as someone powerful  a hero  someone with a great destiny  etcso yeah a smiluation would do the trick perfectlyby the way three points 1 the whole thing of having your original body terminated and waking up in your first clone when you start a character is not exploited at all whereas it could be an easy and interesting way of introducting people with the harshness of new eden and eve storyline2 any form of epic introduction should see a rewamp of the whole tutoriel to ensure that players are not dissapointed by what they see next and the lack of action they might get while learning stuff3 there is no need to commit on making the most epic scripted experience possible just make something realistic that gives a teaser of what is eve one you are not a rookie anymore more would bring dissapointment and the feeling that ccp is lying to its new subscribers
great idea but i would not shuffle the person off in a frigate start them big in a battleshipif you want to get both standards done well start them in a battleship when it dies and they are in their pod do a tiny tutorial about boarding a floating abandoned cruiser or battlecruiser floating on field and then they can continue the fight a little longer that way you get both perspectives you could potentially put a fit ship on contract and make the person buy it i would do that for the battleshipdont overdo this concept though its meant as a 10 to 20 minute introduction not a 3 hour extravaganza programming that much ai takes time
starting them off in a battleship is a terrible idea because then they will want to race for one and will lose it because they lack the skills
the exact story and ships chosen are the kind of design thing that ccp employing professional designers and having more data would likely be more able to doim interested still in ways this could fail one that came up was the problem where theres a big time to train into the ship youre testdriving thats a good point a lot of times this kind of start ends up taking you to endgame power which is similar in concept but those games dont have multiple real months to get to where youre going
since its a scripted fight civilian modules could be used to simulate different activities modules that are effectively useless but work for the intro the pilots ship could also be civilianesque ccp could easily create a battle cruiser with no prereqs but has about 1000 ehp this could also open up the option of letting a new pilot choose a role for the fight like logistics or tackleranother point of failure would be the real corporations and how to connect to them new players wont have a clue on how to get connected with the coalitions and null sec alliances if the tutorial linked to rvb or eve uni that might help some

i like this concept a loti am not sure how is it feasible from technical standpoint i but it would be great if something like that was implemented this scenarios can be also used to teach players about tackling ewar logi and all kind of stuff
there is no reason why this fleet that the new player flies in should just go somewhere and die it could give himher the tour first a la oh look a hauler of another faction lets shoot it oh noes one of our miners is being attacked by someone or there is this guy in that anomly we have to scan first and each time the fleet almost get that guy and he jumps you follow and you land in a trap and each time the new player loses some sp and isk and the ship he or she is flying forcing the new player to take smaller ships with different tasksthe last time could be that you fly a tackle so that time he doesnt get away but his friends come and youre no longer flying something that does dpsbut this is really nothing you guys couldnt come up with by yourself right
well has anyone looked at world of warcraft latelythe first races representing the vanilla  2nd expansions were played normally we can attribute this to eves first decade such as showing off player models factions and warfarethe third expansion to world of warcraft and every expansion after hooked players with characters that went on a miniquest of epic proportions basically their first ten levels were a giant epic moving storyline before they entered the full world of the game using a phasing technology they blizzard allowed players on different parts of the missions line not to interact with each other but you could still chat if someone out there was willing to talk i mean youre doing a quest of unbelievable size the visuals can stay with you long after youre done we can view this as where ccp would like to go with eve in the second decade sure the capsuleers are taking over but if things in eve are represented by an overhanging cliff on the skills chart we not just the nullseccers are going to need help from new players with a desire to strive for bigger and better but also has actually flown large fleet encounterswhy not have both remember that one eve sandbox video start like that1  helping the miner fight off rats brings up a new avenue a small gang warps in and convos you to join them on patrol2  killing the miner brings up a smaller avenue a pirate gang approaches and invites you to go explore a wormhole with them3  warping away brings up a different avenue an exploration ship contacts you as it warps into your next location theres money to be made on exploration sites1  on patrol your gang defends space shoot some rats here a npc frigate cruiser there new tutorial on gunship types and resistances your gang meets up with other patrols and suddenly something happens that escalates quickly asakai2  while in the wormhole your choices affect what the pirates do killing others and setting up mobile extraction units a fight in the wormhole escalates out of control and you start seeing t3 cruisers entering the brawl player is told to escape through the wormhole marked on the hud unfortunately the wh exit leads to the fight in player 1s route3  your exploration is well attempted as you learn some ins and outs of probes a tutorial of using and setting up probes not launched by you is used to show how to probe out things player n is able to play around with the probing until they have found a relic site a sanctumhaven and an asteroid field local spikes and the player is told to use the probes to scan out the ships a tooltip can be used to show the difference between probe types upon scanning down these new ships player is asked to warp1  war is hell the fight is escalating quickly but the player is shown tooltips on shooting the primarys called by others ships are cynoing in slowly from frigates to cruisers and up base hulls only dont want veterans getting any ideas player is told to help take down the cynoing ship taking it down is fun but another cyno starts bringing in capital ships player can either join in or fly around these giant monsters until something laser gun missle smartbomb takes them down2  same as above only as a pirate gang the player is told to stay calm and shoot everyone3 same as player 1 only as a noncombattant player can fly around the battle but a random ship targets and blows them awaywake up with a fake killmail telling the player what happened and explains the outcome of the fight tutorial about difference between caps and subcaps can be used but tooltips can suffice congrats you can now eveoderint dum metuant let them hate so long as they fear accius
when i started my first character in eve i think was 2006 the tutorial was something like hello capsuleer this is a rookie ship this is a mining laser undock and gtfo end of tutorial the gui was terrible and everything was not intuintive the game was harder and less forgivingeven so with such a bad new player experience the game was steady growing attracting new players and retaining them growing game  growing playerbaseimproved tutorials more scripted events aimed to new players are all good things and always welcomebut thinking that current demographic stagnation is a mere matter of improving tutorials is naivepeople approaching mmorpg search for the feeling to be part of a breathing alive universe a scifi simulator in our case now since several years probably ccp is unable to transmit this feeling or to translate it in a proper game framework if we want a growing playerbase then the game itself have to grow fix strategic areas left unattended and extend his borders limiting the work on eve to weaking and recycllyng lead to stagnation and to recycle always the same pool of players until it lastsits an option too
i like this idea alot and i agree with those that said to let the person try different thingsmaybe start out in a frig and kill some small rats get picked up by a gang and go roaming then someone batphones your group so you reship to a bsbc and are jumped into a huge fight
ok to clear things up i might have to post this ideathe title makes eve a verbwhy would a new player eveits an open ended questionstatement im letting new players fill that inoderint dum metuant let them hate so long as they fear accius
why think singularif the battleship tutorial did well you could have an option of other ones in the same battlehere is a tacklerhere is a logietcthey would not pay off in grind type benefits but could offer an array of possibilities the reason i think it would be better than a video is the interactivity people learn better by doing than by listening and or watchingkeep each experience short so that the person may do another or move on if you wanted to really make it special tie it to famous or infamous battles of eve lore or player loreasakai luminaire the early incursions live eventsmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i do like thisdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i still think that after a few months toons should be auto kicked from normal npc corpsthere are 2 ways i think it could work well1 you are automatically given a corp name and dropped in a one man corp that can be changed once from defaultso one day you wake up and find yourself in evecorp454237289 you may leave it for another player corp or name it and build it or just sit in it all by yourself forever leaving you very vunerable to war decs this would require a change in how the corporate skill works as they would need to allow a one man corp while unskilled training the corp skills would be required to build it past that2 4 new high sec factions are added and you are dropped into them depending on toons race after a few monthsthese corps would be a stripped downbasic version of fw so maybe not open war but navy npcs etc etc hassle you in the opposite factions spaceso you can then either join a proper player corp or lose easy access to 12 of high secadmittedly i am someone who thinks navy npcs have no place in eve no one deserves npc protection while at war but while ever ccp have such a stupid mechanic in place  why not use it for some goodi also admit  any move to force people into player corps would break the sandbox a bit as once people are forced into joining player corps  recruitment scamming would have to be a ban offense or result in a negative wallet for the scammerit is not a big loss if recruitment scams ended as they are only done against new players by weak people who can not gain advantage over older players
why
the problem with that is  the people most likely to participate in a live event do not know the game mechanics and tactics needed to do this yetwhen you look at the player base ccp is trying to engage with the events it would be better to provide them with more help and guidance rather then lesshow would 100 x lev 4 mission runners go about organizing a low or null sec roam if none of them have ever had the experience themselves beforeit better for everyone in eve overall if ccp babysit them all the way and provide a solid adventure for the participants if they have some good times in low sec or null sec during one of these events  there is more chance those player may take the next step all by themselvesi read about how the last event was ruined by gate campers leet pvp lol i was not there and do not take part in the events but anyone who goes to that kind of effort to destroy an event for others instead of encouraging them to permanently leave the safety of high sec is short sighted and likely very  anyone with over 12 brain would have helped them and used it as a powerful way to recruit but it is null bears we are talking about here so 12 a brain is a big ask does it really hurt the sandbox if it is broken to engage a few players in new game play stylesareas for an hour every 6 months i think not
part of the lore of eve is that we have all graduated from a university to become capsuleers maybe it can be our final exam
it would be eves kobayashi maru
yes more good ideas from other games plz eve shouldnt exist in a bubble
that sounds great 1 from mewhat i would probably like to see when going through thisstart undocking a battleship and heading to battleshort battle start get players through logi shield repping local armor repping and structural damage that way people get clear views on the different types of life bars tanks and how only shield regenerates by itself slowly have the player escape the battlefieldboom player is trapped in a bubble or tackled followed by a small gang of frigates and subjected to different types of ewfight goes on for a little bit more introducing drones tracking and so ondrones get killed player is defeated and podded by frigates suddenly realizes bigger is not better conceptsp loss clones and so oni also think that a battleship may be too much of a long term goal and get players frustrated and biased towards that size of ship but mayber getting them killed by the smaller ships in the game may have the opposite effect and make them realize what they can achieve with cooperation and more accessible equipment
we want to start off big because you get to showcase big ship combat and when it does as it should you can showcase smaller ship combatwill it give people an expectation that battleships are what you should do probably but most people have that expectation that bigger is better this introduction does not have to teach a person about economics in eve just what a battle could look likeso start them in a battleship then tweak it down as the fight goes onas this is mostly a simulation there is no real need to say yes these are good but you should not touch them for a year so were going to give you this ship and this is what you do and have to ram it down their throat as this suggestion is a method to hook players lets hook the player
ive always been in favor of leaving the existing bombers alone i would love to see ships that can also fit bomb launchers perhaps a destroyer or cruiser that can fit 23 bomb launchers but no covert ops cloak a battleship or battlecruiser that can fit 8 bomb launchers and a larger stealth bomber that can also fire multiple bombs and cloak but be more expensive
we need smth like radar or smth similar to iti hate this damned clickfest paranoya press scan each 5 sec like botwhy you cant make smth like this  radar
youll never get much constructive feedback on here for the same reason people usually cant change their governments without torches and pitchforks the entrenched big players like things exactly the way they are  completely skewed towards serving ccp and its crony alliances who are usually one and the same the dominate the forums the same way they dominate the game itself never forget that ccp made the game they wanted to play one big problem has always been the complete lack of competitiontheres no other aaa space mmos out there but that will be changing soon so once the trickle of lost subs becomes a raging torrent perhaps ccp will finally start getting serious about fixing and balancing their game who knows maybe well see many of those veteran exploiters quitting in droves once they have to start working for their isk andor griefing then we can ask if we can haz their stuff 
thats right buttercup im not mr rogers the op isnt special to me and i dont think hes fine just the way he istens of thousands of players manage just fine making their income from invention manufacturing and so forth the op is the whiny fat kid complaining that athletics arent fair because he doesnt get to winwhat he needs to do is metaphorically speaking cut out the snickers and skittles and run his fat ass around the block a few times instead of bawwing for special treatmentluckily what he actually needs to do is considerably less energetic and he can actually keep right on troughing the skittles all he needs to actually do is play a competitive game just like those tens of other thousands of players did
you forgot to put in the bits about rmt and botting but otherwise a credible effortoh and this kind of post traditionally includes at least one ellipsisoverall i give you a b
who cares about the new players this should be how all missions are built
not precisely not all missions should have a big battle culminating on what skills you know although light bulb a battle to show off your skills before you gradumate to the next level of missions would be an idea for the novice players to start looking into grouped missions or how to correctly fit your shipoderint dum metuant let them hate so long as they fear accius
make it an optional introduction to eve online because i dont see myself or anyone else wanting to play it more than once youd probably want it in a deadspace system or something so you dont stumble upon real nullbears and get hotdropped by half a dozen supers
one of the better ideas ive seen is damage mitigation as it works in sins of a solar empire the more damage you take the more damage you mitigate idea for module think an invuln field for every x amount of dps you take it increases with y resistance perhaps this would further promote alpha blapping  meta or perhaps it would promote split damage exciting meta i cant tell the future
im still reading through 21 and it makes me happy to see that theres even a 30 in the making
i just wanted to popin and thank unforgiven storm and everyone involved once again for this effort we are always appreciative of community efforts such as this and are looking at it as an additional piece to our recently released survey which you should all fill out btw ccp spends a lot of time looking at player feedback and initiatives like these are a godsend for us
i would like to endorse this suggestion i still remember the first few minutes in eve when i undocked and tried to shoot the gate guards concord kill record 1 stupid noob ccps sand box is eve online the sand is owned by ccp we pay them a monthly fee to throw the sand at each other that is all that is here so move along nothing more to be seen
actually that wouldnt be a bad idea at all ill miss t2 colors on racial industrials but ore established a precedent in speedy industrial effectiveness with the ventureabout the idea proposed by the op i agree as a recent wormholer i never though about that with blockade runners cloakprobes launcher is quite a requeriment in order to make them fully viable in this environment at least if were refering to the smaller cloaky t2 industrials
sort of like the reactive armor hardener then yeah i can get behind more mods of that type
todays events in hed gp are just another example in a long line of fights where the outcome is determined by lag and by ccps continuing refusal to supply proper hardware on which to run these nodes when will this stop when is enough enough when will ccp finally bring some new hardware to the table that will allow fleet battles to occur without one side or another having to deal with infinite warp tunnels preventing hardeners from being activated lag causing dreads to cycle but not actually do anything and these fleet fights getting determined by who got their first rather than which side shows up in force with the right shipsim not one saying i have the answer like just about everyone here in this community i dont have behind the scenes access to see what pieces of hardware are being used to run these reinforced nodes but the fact that 100 server load and 10 tidi are becoming the norm for fleet battles shows that whatever ccp is doing about this is too little too late this battle didnt pop up in some unknown place this wasnt some stealth attack out of nowhere this battle was telegraphed in advance so ccp should have been able to handle it so ccp what is the problem what is the bottleneck you are in a unique position to have many thousands of vested individuals in the eve online community who do this stuff for a living if amazon can keep its servers up and responsive during black friday and cyber monday and laugh off hackers attempts to ddos them with the low orbit ion cannon why cant ccp build a meganode im guessing that the jita supernode is still inadequate for this task that will actually be able to hang with this level of traffic or use if there is a technical problem then reach out to the community talk to people who work for groups used to crunching endless amounts of data id be willing to bet there is at least one person very familiar with the innerworkings of supercomputers who could provide some very positive insight right here in this community so ccp instead of giving us vague replies when we complain like were working on it please trust in the community that supports you and reach out to us or at least give us some idea of what youre actually doing to solve a game breaking problem that we are facing on a regular basis
i like the idea of getting into action quickly but not giving skills only to take them away through forced poddinga lot of people like to feel like theyre moving forward with things starting things off by making them go backwards would discourage a lot of people wwwgamerchicknet gamerchick42
i am pretty sure there is no such thing as hardware capable of handling that kind of fight you can beg and scream and whine about servers as much as you want but the hardware is simply not the issue here
there is no better hardwarethe problem with eve isnt its hardware its the 2004 software that doesnt properly scale to 2014 hardwaresource
that reply contains nice buzzwords and all but wtf does that even mean its like a us politician promising changeand at this moment ccp has about as much credibility
it means that they are working on it and you need to be patient changing the way an existing system operates especially one as large and complex as eve without completely scrapping and starting from square one which takes almost as much time and results in any further improvements on the old system being wasted is a pain in the ass fix one thing and another thing which may not be related to the change in any way will breaktldr anyone who tells you that will be easy to code and implement is lying through their teethediteve code is single threaded which means that it cant really take advantage of multicore systems part of the reason it is this way is because multicore cpus did not really exist at the time the base architecture for eve was created circa 1998  2003 actions that players take cannot be randomly processed and spat out they have to follow a clear line of progression based on who started what first that means that even with multithreading you cannot process and execute an action further down the que until the ones before have been executed so if one action is taking longer than the others to process and execute the rest of the actions behind it have to wait that is where the bottleneck isone of their solutions that they are working on is to separate parts of the system like the database from the main server so there will less to process they call it brain in a boxhowever this is no silver bullet realistically it will just raise the threshold for when things get fubar
all the easy changes were made years ago before tidithe only obvious improvements i can see are  making the server code multithreaded then they can take advantage of the current direction server hardware is improving in sticking more cores into the server  change sov mechanics to entourage fleets to split up across multiple systems instead of piling people into a single system then the fight can be spread across multiple nodesnote that i said obvious not easy multithreading is going to be a lot of work if its even possible ive got no idea where to start with changing sov mechanics
if i were to mine in real life i would do it somewhere that laws of personal property and police enforcement exist ie empire space if i wanted to kill miners and make a buck off it i would go to empire space and shoot and ransom miners
i was an industrialist in null running markets out there which is quite hard to do in the multiple null alliance ive been in either requiring cta mandatory every day where ive offer spent 15 hrs just sitting in a system guarding goonswarm space at things that never came while home space was failing due to the no one stays behind or you get kicked methods including miners to being over in yulia federation of being camped by blues i see no reason i should side with either side there is also alliances that run mining in high sec and than ship to their null since code has come out ive stopped mining and now i stopped missions in anything relatively expensive due to new groups targeting missions now i use 142m to rely on market trades in station as i have no luck in pvp and dont see a point in skill less ganking although i would like to see the market wiped with a set amount and all of eve have a tempory ban so to speak of all industry and lets see how far people get with out the resourceful people that are often frowned down upon
the battle in hedgp proved one simple undeniable factccp is unable to provide a credible solution to the problems created by drone fleets in nullsec warfareccps advertising includes choose your ship  pick the ships you want to fly from hundreds of widely varying modelscustomize and tune  each ship is highly customizable using modular equipment rigs and subsystemswhat they should say is only archons nyx and interceptors are worth having in nullsec now days everything else forget it and forget nullsec industry too its gone thanks to odyessey making grav sites instantly pop up without scanning and rubicon making interceptors warping to a grav site faster than a barge can get to warp 700 dreads killed 7 archons that says it all rediculously unbalanced defeated by tidi and server instability so noone should bother with dreads any more as a class they are invalid being the conceptual counter to carriers  but they cant do that and nyx are better for sov grinding because you dont have siege cycles to get caught in by interceptorsand speaking of ship rebalancing and ccps current love of drone ships  given the utter inability of ccp to have stable subservers even on a reinforced node unless you have drones that fight at server speed or are allocated to someone who actually does have the ability to play forget it yes the pinnacle of nullsec pvp is currently assign drones go have a coffee done it is skillless mindless and boring for everyone concerned and there is zero place for new players in it  if you cant fly a slowcat archon go back to highsec where 99 of the game is and apparently where 100 of the design effort is that is simply not acceptable if this game is to survive as anything more than a wow in spaceccp needs to stop pretending that nullsec systems do not have a hard cap for players and write a better protocol for how admission to the battle is handled hedgp proved it does where the server loaded in 700 dreadnaughts one after the other  without their pilots having a chance to do anything  because it would not load a new one until the previous pilot was dead they couldnt put their hardners on couldnt target and couldnt well  anything other than die 50 minutes in a jump tunnel to load in dead is an insult to players and a gift to the 10 mmos out there under development who are looking to take customers off eveso yes hat should have been an epic battle has become a litmus test of eve online people have been complaining that star citizens design is bad because it has capped rooms for pvp to ensure quality of game play but that is now beginning to look like a much better option than what eve offers where unlimited also means unplayable past 600 players they are being honest and ccp is notthere has been a lot of rubbish added in recent expansions that does nothing but make nullsec less stable than it was instant action interceptors do not help when the server cant even handle working out how to not crash so yay the server did not crash  but the fix of leaving pilots stuck in warp until they were dead is no fix at all it is simply a bad joke on the community who actually play what passes for pvp these days for real make dreads do double damage against archons and make drone assist limited by double the bandwidth of the ship assigned to not to mention stop lying about epic warfare hundreds of ships to choose from and new players being able to participate if you dont buy a character who can fly an archon you cant simple as that and yes i cant wait for star citizen i love eve online and have played since 2005 but guess what ccp is spending all the developer time making fluffy junk for highsec carebears and has ground nullsec industry into the mud with cloaky campers because gee we needed more covert ships for campers to use to stop all play in null and left archon blob fleets win by crashing servers and attacking fleets not good enough not nearly good enough so yes id rather spend my money on something new

i think the problem new players have is having too many options thrown at them the phenomenon is called analysis paralysis which is in fact my favorite term in the universe see wikipedia about it having a way to make the billion choices new players have now to fewer more obvious choices is the key so they have lets say 34 choices at first then each choice leads to 34 choices which each leads to 34 choices etc so that they do not react to it all with realizing the problem is so complex because the choices are so many that they choose none of the options presented they opt out if you will the phenomenon shows itself in all walks of life for example when you as a business offer your employees pension plans the more options you offer them the lower the participation rate is new players are offered the choice of a smattering of skills and are not told which skills they require for a research career or what skills they require for a shooting career etc then they are pushed into a world with hundreds of corps and alliances and hundreds of solar systems and lots of ships the new isis system makes the ship stuff less paralyzing and a huge number of them choose to opt out and not choose any player corporations at all i think walking in station would have some room for making choices less paralyzing you could have rooms with lots of things in them that allow players to see what is ahead of them and each thing could have a simple visual interface that guides them through each process by only giving them 23 options at a time
let me guess someone gave you some spreadsheets that were terrifically profitable at the time they stopped being profitable and now instead of actually learning where you can make a profit you decide to whine insteadif you cant see where the money is you dont deserve it
im sure many people agree that something is not right about drones in their current form and this was still the case before all the wonderful drone mods ccp has added in the more recent patchesi will clarify i am an avid lover of drones so i dont want them to be hit with the nerf bat just because they arent working and if i seem a bit biased i amso lets startdrone limitsthe current drone limits are slightly problematic as they cause a higher server load as they change 1 ship into 6 or so id guessccp added weapon grouping to reduce load this but since drones still randomly split fire id assume this isnt applied to themso the next step would be to force drones to group and act as a single unit or alternatively reduce them to 2 actual units and spread their stats from 5 units within those unitsthese would hopefully reduce any server load issuedrone and shipsit has always been a problem in my view that nearly every ship in eve can use drones and this shouldnt be the caseso setting aside drone boats or drone based ships as they should be able to use the maximum amount of drones all other ships should be heavily limited in the amount of drones they can use from 02now while this would be annoying to start with it would define drone ships more proudly and at the same time they should be also limited in the high slot weapons they can usecarriers and supercarriersremove the ability for them to use drones and replace them with 4 fighter classeslight fighters  14 the damage hp size of normal fighters keeps the bandwidthmedium fighters  12 he damage hp size of normal fighters keeps the bandwidthheavy fighters  what normal fighters are nowfighter bombers  what they are nowthe reason for the above is that carriers should be limited in how many drones they can carry this also cuts into the ratting elements of carriers but doesnt leave them vulnerable missing lighter dronesa secondary change id like to see is a reduction of the actual units with grouping or with merging and spreading of stats carrier and supercarriers should still be scary with their extreme numbers but not so much that they can fll up your overview completely with several of themdrone groupingi mentioned drone grouping and i now want to go into more detail about how it could work firstly it should probably be called squads or something but it doesnt matter too muchso the idea behind this is the same as how the group windows currently work with drones but instead of them being a way to just organise your drones they are become a linked unit as it were meaning they all suffer from ewar affects and damage equally but they also act as a single bigger dronethey would be locked to 5 per group and would have to be the same unitaoe affects such as smartbombs and bombs would have a multiplier of 5 against themwhile this has many downsides in terms of solo players i believe that in huge fleet fights this would be very useful in reducing the drone lag that is related to ittldr reduce drone number or their affect on the serverreduce the amount of ships that can use drones while in term making drone ships less able to use other weaponsremove normal drones from carriers replace them with fighter based counterpartsimplement a way to group drones
was that drones or was that jamming four thousand or so people into one system and jumping in hundreds of dread on grid with everything elsespeaking as someone who was actually in the dread fleet as opposed to some random forum alt thats not how it happened while i didnt jump in myself i was in comms with people who did and it wasnt one dread at a time the server was struggling and dropping in batches all at once weird bullshit happened with them there were blackscreens module lag was horrendous and doomsdays were again the only thing that workeddrones were never even mentioned trying to cyno several hundred of anything in all at once all on grid will generally end up like thisif it had been the other way around with the cfcrussian dreads getting in well before the n3pl carriers the exact same problems would have happened

we can hasi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
actually you have an excellent method to introduce lore into the gamestart off the capsuleer as a real person full skills in their races ships and weapons essentially make the person uber and capable of fielding excellent ships weapons etc so skillwise they would be an excellent battleship pilot battlecruiser pilot etcat the end of this tutorial once they are podded or killed in real life the person becomes reanimated as a capsuleer but due to the transition they lost all their skill so now they must begin to train up this also bridges the whole concept of their damn immortality how capsuleers never die how skillpoints can be lost how pods work etcthere have been a few games that start off with the player being literally some supreme god or in this case an excellent pilot who gets reduced to a scrub and must climb their way back up to being amazingoddly enough this can be done easily in evei like the concept as it gives you a birthright a beginning a reason for being a capsuleer same thing just giving a purpose to the player

lol op whut  are one of the most successful and balanced ships in eve plus they are one of the rare ships that require actual piloting skills excellent squad coordination reactivity and good 3d awareness
wrong there is such a thing like dynamically synced threads whereby you create one thread per player that can be processed in parallel and if players interact its only then that they start waiting for each other as the threads intertwine even then each thread is capable of consuming one core that means that 100 players can consume 100 cores thus paralleling the workload unlike now where all 100 players are stuck on 1 single core while the rest of the cores sit idle mostly disabled to allow for that 1 single core to be overclocked to hell and back
there is no possible way ccp could afford a 1 core per player approach think about it for a minute  i dont even think they could afford a 1 thread per player approach you log on and see 40000 players an ibm watson is a cluster of 90 servers each running 4 x 8core 35ghz cpus with 4 threads per core  total is 2880 cores and 11520 threads which costs about 3 million ccp would need 4 of these 12 million  support to support 40k players  1 dedicated thread each that said it is not unreasonable to expect a company with 66m in annual revenue to spit out 3m for one of these and move the core database processing into the 16 tb of ram that this monster has you are correct though that none of this helps if their base code is not set up for parallel processing
if anything a means of color coding the orders between pilot and corporation should be made availablei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
brain in box is a chimera like many other things ccps promised and never delivered like pos rework sov fixing etcits marketing at his best dont be a fool
brain in a box will not solve their main problem of the core engine not being multithreaded it will remove some strain from the existing infrastructure making it perform better it will work exactly like tidi it delays the inevitable
it is very very simple like hundreds of my fellow coalition i have today cancelled all of my eve online subscriptionsenough ccp the state of nullsec is not worthy of paying real money for jump luanch drones assign drones call it pvp i think not world of warcraft currently has more depth in pvp that is a horrible admission for a player who loves eve online to make but it is true so either nerf archons buff dreads and make null servers actually stable inclduing the ones around the battlefield system come on you dont have to be a genius to work out that you need to reinforce more than 1 system when a 4 to 5000 player battle is expected or watch all the players and thier credit cards walk out the doorand lets be very clear here plex does not pay the rent us subscriptions pay the rentyou will get no more real money from any of us until this debacle is fixed why because we are going to spend it all on star citizen  if we are going to be lied to by developers at least we can have new prettier lies to enjoy before the big let downps no you cant have my stuff when eve goes free to play as it must when star citizen steals 50 or more of its players i might want my stuff or not but hey i am keeping the option
if you have played eve long enough you realize that the original base for it was not much more than the old mud code from the 1990s with a graphic overlay characters ships systems  they are nothing more than database records with a bunch of flags and timers attached along with some pointers to other databases as such it has an upper limit on how much data they can process and update in real time i know tidi was supposed to address this issue  by giving the servers more time for backend processing and lessening the amount of data they had to transmit to you per second obviously they have some other issues as well id be amazed if the backend database engines are not multithreaded and working as fast as they can to try to keep up with all the updates to the tables but i think the sheer amount of data in the system is the real problem it is a problem of game design but the problem is that they are not limiting the game design to the amount of data it can reasonably handle in real time this is why you see other mmorpgs limit the number of players in a pvp situation in the same place at the same time i really think the only way they solve this is to limit the number of ships in a system at the same time 
this is still a good idea and i think it should get some more supporti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i support this proposal 1
defanderthank you very much for posting your support in this proposaldmc
was thinking about this recently and thought maybe we could even do up versions of them like the current industrialsa t1 hauler version that can barely haul the largest bc size 270000m3 or 400000m3 if you include the industrials since the orca can currently haul 400000m3 in its ship maintenance bay and having a t1 hauler that could compete on that level may be a bit imbalanced you could drop it down to barely haul the largest cruiser size 120000m3 or 200000m3 if you include mining barges or maybe barely haul 2 of the largest cruiser size 240000m3a freighter size that can barely haul 8 of the largest bs size 4760000m3 this makes it 2x as good as the jump freighter versiona jump freighter size that can barely haul 4 of the largest bs size 2380000m3 this makes it 2x as good as carriers are currently
like but no bonus for defensive capabilities

hey everyoneim posting this thread here to start a discussion so feel free to brainstorm and talk about ways to reduce the playermoney gap ways to increase interest in tournaments both for participants and viewers ways to encourage new teams to participate in tournaments ways to tier tournaments so everyone can find a tournament to be competitive in ways to provide the community with the proper tools to host their own tournaments be it on a separate server or on tq id also like to hear your ideas on new prizes aimed specifically at newer teams for instance a good prize for best new team for the new eden open if we get good ideas i really want to add something like that to the neoiiccp bro

tournaments in their current format are both exhausting to participate in and exhausting to watch it would be much better if they were played in the manner of footbal leagues through entire year like every saturday and sunday two or four matches are played its also better for people in other timezones as its much easier to not spoil yourself the results and watch 12 hours of recorded stream instead of watching entire dayalso disconnect  death is too harsh penalty ship should stay in place and allow player to reconnnect quite a few matches were stupidly lost because of that
consider tournaments where there is some goal other than exploding the other side for exampleew football was popular for a bit the goal was to tractor a can to your goal any nondamaging mod could be used webs ecm neuts ectraces these do get run there can be all sorts of variations like just pure speed allowing nondamaging weapons or go back to allowing explosionsplayer tools a way to have near perfect security this is eve and someone will try and spoil the party if it is in any way possible for them to do it guarding against such people is so difficult that most players just give up on the idea of running their own tournament right now do it on sisi works almost perfectly as interfering is a bannable actiona way to know distances ship distance from a beacon or a race turn point or the distance of a can from a goala way to know times like the time a ship is within a set distance of a beacona way to set beaconsa way to disqualify participants who violate a rule your ship is out of bounds boomfor cost control a way to know the cost and meta of everything on someones ship quickly and easily
ill write up a longer response to the op later but this has existed since neo 1 or atx i believe theres an invisible bubble so when you disconnect your ship just sits there the only exception to this is in the first few seconds when everyone is warping in since the bubble is not up at that point
ways to reduce the playermoney gap  bans generally force pilots to have multiple fleet concepts setup ahead of time so they can reship appropriately this is a source of moderate expense although i prefer having bans as it makes the tourney more interesting  ships themselves can vary wildly in pricing faction  t2 battleships go for 5001b each which becomes very expensive very fast  skill gap some ships are really good but extremely skill intensive to fly like command ships with warfare links with all these in mind you could run tournaments that remove the pricey elements for example a tournament consisting only of t2 cruisers and below these are easier to afford have a lower sp wall and could still be very interesting  fun to watch as more  more explosions happen alternatively you can artificially create this through a more steeply structured point system ways to increase interest in tournaments both for participants and viewers interact with the fans surveys for mvp andor best matches you could make bans come from the players rather than team captains ok this would be gamed you could add in obstacles ways to encourage new teams to participate in tournaments have more tourney slots and lower the barrier to be competitive lower the cost of entry and lower the time window requirement of the tourney a 10 vs 10 frigate match doesnt need 15 minutes a match and can be very entertaining ways to tier tournaments so everyone can find a tournament to be competitive in t1 frigate tourneydessie  t2pirate frig tourneycruiser tourney etc ways to provide the community with the proper tools to host their own tournaments be it on a separate server or on tq environmental control password protected systems like last years duality was nice deployable beacons etc observation ship create a ship with a 250km lock range 12 max targets passive targeting as a special ability a unique ship class so it can be easily filtered off the overview but lacks the ability to fit any remote assistance andor offensive modules could simply be no mids no highs id also like to hear your ideas on new prizes aimed specifically at newer teams for instance a good prize for best new team for the new eden open if we get good ideas i really want to add something like that to the neoii eve collectors edition  smaller prizes pirate frig  cruiser  bs pack implant set  gag gifts if someone distinguishes themselves for flying a hero damp ship give them 100 damps or damp ships
 ways to reduce the playermoney gapyou mean how the richest alliances always get spots in tournaments if so here are some possibilitieslittle guy format all players are not eligible for the tourney who are a member of an alliance or corporation which contains more than 1000 members as of the announce date of the tourneyhave tournaments much more frequently that do not have an option to buyin for your teams slot instead randomly choose all teams you could help deal with crappy teams by blacklisting or at least give lower weighting chances to players who repeatedly fail to show or are unsporting if combined with a tier system this would have the best of both worlds  frequent battles between similarly classed teams without letting any teams money come into playif your concern is instead the richest alliances have enough money to buy etanas and bhaalgorns i would do a flat rate tournament entry fee from tq wallets i would try 500m per team for a lowtier justforfun tournament and scale up for higher tier events run it on sisi so players can use any gear they want put any restrictions you want for the format no special edition ships frigates only etcways to increase interest in tournaments both for participants and viewersrun more tournaments way more one per week in each of several tiers find really entertaining announcers i was quite happy with the atxi announcers but you will need more to prevent burnout with frequent tournaments make sure the announcers are trying to engage noneve players who found the stream eg explaining the basics every now and then you dont need the announcers physically present give them access to a mumble server whose audio is mixed into the stream audiosee if you can get twitch to display ads to ppl watching other streams team deathmatch in space now live eve online rookie tournament  week 13ways to encourage new teams to participate in tournamentsingame decorations to 1st and 2nd place winnersplay on sisi with an entry fee that even a handful of brave newbies can affordpickup matches that follow tournament rules but are just for fun so prospective teams can see what its all about ways to tier tournaments so everyone can find a tournament to be competitive inthe first thing that comes to mind is to start off with a basic metric of pvp activity kill countannounce open entry for all teams no limit to how manyget each team members total kill count over the past year not isk destroyed calculate the sum to get the teams total kill countsort the teams by kill count and bin them into however many tiers you wantso thats what i would use as a starting point to kinda bootstrap the tier system you would of course want to explore more relevant ways for teams to affect their tier status eg tourney kills tourney wins noshows etcways to provide the community with the proper tools to host their own tournaments be it on a separate server or on tqmake a bot that blows up ships crossing the edge of glory so you dont need a dev to do itmake a bot similar to moveme that is used to move team members who are staging into a station in the tourney system have it put red team in red station and blue team in blue station align the undocks of both stations towards the arena destroy any ships that warp anywhere from their station before the match beginshave a bot announce in local fight and turn off the destroyshipsthatwarp mechanichave a rules bot who i can link my fit to and it tells me if it is a legal fit for this formatone way to detect people using illegal fits would be to destroy all ships after a winner is found then have a script look at all killmails generated to detect problems not sure how you could control implant use unless you podded everyone tooyou might also be able to parse killmails to automatically identify the winner of each matchid also like to hear your ideas on new prizes aimed specifically at newer teams for instance a good prize for best new team for the new eden open if we get good ideas i really want to add something like that to the neoiiagain ingame decorations would be niceflavor items are always nicemaybe make a rendering of their characters standing in front of a big neo ii backdrop and put it on the launcher and community pagemaybe a devblogcommunity spotlight talking with the best new teamremember that ten year veteran station how about a station for tournament winners andor teams that didnt win but are granted honors like best new teamlittle things to improve U22C1  my little things posts

i really like what i am reading here so far id also want to open the floor for some alternative competitive event ideas much like earlier in this thread we worked on a hunger games concept a bit back but that got scrapped so if you can think of something cool id definitely like to do something different
ccp bro wrote ways to increase interest in tournaments both for participants and viewers during breaks there could be in game events with prizes similar to what somer blink has done or even more ccp roaming fleets also more promotional videos theres a lot of really talented video editors that play eve so perhaps even get the eve community involved with prizes for best alliance tournament promo videos releasing compilations of the alliance tournaments best and most exciting contests in the lead up would also generate more hypeccp bro wrote ways to encourage new teams to participate in tournaments perhaps tutorial videos would inspire new teams to participate making sure everyones aware of how to use sisi for practice and give examples of popular tournament fleet compositions i think also getting some of the tournament veterans to talk about their preparation for past tournaments and their experiences in the later rounds perhaps this could be done at fanfestccp bro wrote ways to tier tournaments so everyone can find a tournament to be competitive in i like the idea of a several smaller tournaments for those alliances that dont have the funds that certain alliances do these tournaments wouldnt have a large buy in price and would be shown in the weeks running up to the alliance tournamentnew eden open perhaps the victor gets a place in the new eden openalliance tournament as its rewardccp bro wroteid also like to hear your ideas on new prizes aimed specifically at newer teams for instance a good prize for best new team for the new eden open if we get good ideas i really want to add something like that to the neoiibest newcomerbiggest overachieversbiggest upsetmost creative fleet compfastest wincheapest successful fleet compwinners to be for voted by the broadcast team as to stay somewhat impartial
if you wanted to do a hunger games thing you could just have like 1224 teams of 510 all random in one system have the gates turned off and have them hunt each other gms could spawn certain items for the teams based on crowd response and their specific needsie probe launcher and a depot if their scout dies last team standing wins
oh wow lets see others have had some good ideas alreadyctf with tractor beams no damaging modules allowed obstacle course with beacon checkpoints  interceptor pilots for speed runs or covert ops maybe with 1x tidi for precision flying dont decloak dogpile  one team gets a single badass ship anything subcap maybe and all other teammates fly noobships the other team gets to fly a more normal comp maybe t1 cruiser down or dessy down 1v1 ladders if you develop all these automation tools for team fights they would probably work just as well for 1v1s i do like the hunger games idea and suggest that you periodically activate different wormhole effects maybe everyone starts in frigates spawned randomly in the system and you put a supplies beacon where bigger ships are floating in space prefit plus some mobile jump units and mobile warp disruptors to take i think lucines idea for many teams that are all locked in a system is great you could hide further supply caches in cosmic signatures and spawn them as desired minmatar militia format give every pilot a random fitted ship with some specifications of what skills will be required to fly everything brutor cheerleeding squad upon starting the competition each team is given a particular formation to form  all in a line smiley face cube sphere 7o any team may claim done at which point 001x tidi is activated while the judges decide whether the team has successfully completed their formation if the judges rule against the team tidi goes back to normal 1x and that team must wait n seconds before another done claim enders game format red teams goal is to get from their start point to a beacon on the surface of a planet light a cyno and jump a capital ship to it blue teams goal is to prevent the capital from jumping in warping in the arena is allowed mobile cyno disruptors and mobile warp disruptors are allowed drebuchet bowling little things to improve U22C1  my little things posts
idea 1 solo or team deathrace after the countdown everyone must fly 600 kms to an acceleration gate and activate it live weapons fire score people based on finish time add in obstacles like mines proximity activated stasis web towers and the like for extra fun bonus prizes for ship kills this is very scaleable and could have a 1000 pilots participating at once although id recommend rfing the node idea 2 hunger games everyone starts on the edge of a sphere 20 kms apart from one another at countdown may the odds be ever in your favor idea 3 team starship troopers teams must defeat wave after wave after ever increasingly brutal wave of npcs whoever can survive the longest wins sleeper ai jams neuts and webs a must use sleeper rats so salvage and bounties arent an issue idea 4 team capture the flag to be done in highsec whoever picks up the flag goes suspect so everyone can shoot them flag must be moved to your base a can you drop it in shooting someone not a suspect gets you concorded suspect can return fire if aggressed thanks to limited engagements coding should ensure the flag always drops as loot to be picked up by the next pilot idea 5 bumper cars put a large ship titan in the center of an arena bump it around this sounds kinda lame tbh edit make this gladiator challenge style and combine these for a multiobstacle tournament series
a few ideasfirst on the isk gap this is only an issue in the atsneo where there are massive prizes at stake have smaller prizes and noone will consider fielding etanas or chremorases or the likeof course smaller prizes will only be worth running if ccp can make tournaments automated so that no ccp intervention is required in running the tournamentsecondly on the sp gap this can be addressed by disallowing warfare links command ships are the only subcapital ship class that requires more than three months or so of dedicated training to work what id like to see a system where you run 8 team low stakes tournaments on demand via an automated systemon other formats i really think the hunger games approach has merit give every player a tech 1 fitted tech 1 frigate to start with and litter the field with better ships you can eject from your frigate and jump into
hello reimbursement policy is missing some important information hed fight was classified as largescale player engagement and any losses of any kind resulting from a largescale player engagement are not covered by this reimbursement policy1 can ccp be more precise and define what is largescale player engagementis this means for example local bigger than 300 people or 300 people shooting 2 how normal player can protect itself from being a part of something that is against ccp policywe cannot know  what is on the another side of the gate  cyno in case of capitals if someone else will jump in into the system3 can we get some popup that will state before entering system  you are about to enter largescale player engagement that is against ccp reimbursement policy and not supported by eve do you want to execute the jump yesno or when you are in the system current system escalated to largescale player engagement that is against ccp reimbursement policy and not supported by evedo you want to continue to be here or do you want your ship to be moved to the nearest safe system yesnoyes i know  do not undock but i ask for clarification from ccp employee and answers how player can defend himself from being in some events that are not supported and against official ccp policy thank you for your answer
1 if you dont know what a largescale player engagement is you shouldnt be undocking2 largescale engagements arent against ccp policy reimbursing except for very obvious ccp screwups is usually denied by ccp and in the case of large pvp fights where reimbursement of potentially hundreds of ships is possible is explicitly listed as being a noreimbursementzone deal with it2a yes you very well or your fc knows whats on the other side of a gate or whats potentially coming or you or your fc is bad3 you shouldnt be undocking and heading into large fleet warfare if you dont understand what it is deal with it
start the player as a skilled member of their races military or militia they are involved in a battle that goes horribly wrong resulting in their pod death and the pod deaths of thousands as a result of the financial cost of their failure the military forcibly retires them strips them of their military training and sends the person out as a capsuleer that way an individual gets a chance of tasting the big fight but there is a valid reason for their sudden loss of skills
if i stasis a poco it should slow it down so that it falls back into the atmosphere nolets bash pocos with stasises how awesome would that beoh and for 1  2  no it feels badhowever free planetary launches why not this cool feature is not used enough even within its niche
building a systemmechanic for players to do tournaments is to much workeffort for little gainthis is only my opinionno sure if right i would call this a low effort tournaments system first we have a dueling system you could extend this to teamsgroup level off equal numbers be able to fight insted 1vs1 we have now only seconda deployable structure like arenacombined with the at and neo ui that you use if possible if not make them seperatethis could be used by players to make some basic tournaments privatealliance ones or publicyou know less effort to develop iti guess
thanksyes i am still working away on pi 30 when the mood to commit hours to walls of text and game mechanic crafting strikes me not to mention the graphics that go with this version after having been omitted from the 21 versionthat having been said i must admit work on it has slowed to a crawl over the last few months partly because of my growing disillusionment with eve online and its prosub capital all pew pew at the expense of industry and very little focus on anything else approach weve seen in the flavors of ccps last 4 expansions and their revised vision post incarnagate when compared to games in the making like star citizeni guess im scraping the bottom of the intellectual barrel for inspiration to finish the work yet again and wait for nothing to happen in eves devs cycles with such a massive proposal yet again while star citizens prealpha access gives me everything i wanted out of eves wis before even being in beta stages without having to post a single word on their forums about the possibilities that whatif proposals could have for the game
every possible solution ccp could contemplate delays the inevitable because hardware is finitethis is why people like trebor are steering the conversation toward introducing incentives that make smaller fleets a superior choice the current more is better meta is guaranteed to tax any server to the limit
quotegrace ishukone rabble rabble quoteafk cloaking this thread etcyou whine a lot
you are almost in every pointbut can you state what is largescale player engagementif this is a 1000vs1000 people fighting or 2000 people on local or 2000 people on the same node in multiple systems difference2000 on local you can have in jita  and there is always people shooting each other on the station they all are part of large scale engagementmaybe we dont have to go to thousands of players and large  scale player engagement for ccp starts from 255 playerswe have no guarantee that at some point someone will not abuse largescale player engagement and deny some player reimbursement because of some obvious bug during 70 vs 40 fight i dont see any harm in asking ccp for a definition of lspe  clear rules will never do any one harm  they will also cut speculations editadditionally why are you stating that largescale fights are supported by eve they are possible  but as unsupported feature  and because of this ccp dont reimburse any looses no one normal will ask for reimbursement because someone destroyed my ship  people will be asking because some mechanic is bugged during those fights  and those mechanics cause loose of this person ship so in my interpretation ccp say something like this  i want to know what is the definition of large scale player interaction that ccp consider unsupported  and how player can say no to this kind of event those are very simple and logical questions  and only ccp can give response to them thats why im asking for support from csm in getting answers
obviously ccp cant say x players is a large fight no less because at some point in some place there would be someone fighting with x2 people and demand unfair reimbursementthis is not about bugs they cant manage this is about not giving any advantage to one side of a conflictif you dont want to go in a fight without knowing your ship will be reimbursed maybe you should join an alliance that offers a reimbursement program an not rely on deus ex ccp to save you
good rule of thumb when tidi kicks in  large scale fightbasically op any company in any industry is going to keep some of their policies vague on purpose it gives them flexibility in what they can say or doin this case a large scale fight can be pretty much anything yes but i dont think the gms are that spiteful andor lazy that they would declare any battle a large scale fight and be done with it though i can imagine it being very tempting sometimesif this can never satisfy you well htfu accept any loss you take regardlesss whether you or ccp were at fault
ill give this a 1although quafe zero covers speedboosting it cant be manufactured by players and it doesnt scale with the synth  std  imp  strong varieties and the associated benefits and sideeffects
the microjump deployable adds another option race around a track of these either with racers being required to activate them each in order or the course and ship restrictions set so that activating them is the fastest way to the endracers will then have to make a tradeoff between spending time before activating each one lining up a good activation and time spent slowboating between where it send them and the next deployable because their activation angle wasnt perfect
make it open to corporations having to form a 1 corp alliance just for this is a bit much
at is what it isyou have neo
neo is  because it is clearly 
i think that the problem that the tournaments have is that they are essentially playoffs without a seasonthere needs to be some sort of constant ladder or league system for people to make it easier and more fulfilling to practice or get involved in tournaments however it might be difficult to integrate this into the sandbox
a great number of interesting ideas that would certainly be a great improvement to what we have now expect ccp to implement it in about 10 years
i have seen no less than two sc references on this thread alone and my conscience dictates i remind everyone of the old saying if it looks to good to be true we all know how it endsid hate to see anyone lose more money than they can afford to on nothing more than one big jesus featurewe all know how those tend to end as well

yesterday while moving 40 man gang thru gates we got tidi no gunfire  local less than 50 thats the point why im asking for definition because as a players we can only speculate at the same time i want from ccp the statement how many players can interact with each other until eve servers are unpredictable thank you for your posts  but what we need is a clear statement from ccp
you already have a clear statement from ccpany losses of any kind resulting from a largescale player engagement are not covered by this reimbursement policygrr kimmi nerf chans jenn aside wwweveradiocom join eve radio channel in game
please read my posts i dont have any issues with no reimbursement ccp should clarify just what is large  scale player engagement because this will allow each player to be aware that they are in this position cut all speculations why some items where and few days later in similar engagement where not reimbursed my primary goal is to persuade ccp to add to policy clear statement large  scale player engagement occurrences when local reaches for example  800 people in the system or  on kill mails you have more than 255 people or maybe bothall looses caused during this time will be not reimbursed we had situation where overloaded node crashed  and yet all items bugged during this accident where reimbursed eg billions in fighter bombersrecent nyx with over 300 people on its kill mail  also reimbursed at the same time all people in hed are denied reimbursement based on the same rules that others in the similar situations got it those few lines in policy defining what is large player engagement will cut all speculations in future incidents
do you lack an understanding of the concept of intentional vagueness do you understand the need for intentional vaguenesslets see if this will suffice  all reimbursement requests will be evaluated on a case by case basisgrr kimmi nerf chans jenn aside wwweveradiocom join eve radio channel in game
i believe that tidi works on the node not individual systems so you and your 40 man nogunfire gang didnt cause the tidi something else going on in another system on the same node didjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i dunno why you folks keep spamming this the policy is clear one could be entiteled to a reinbursement only in case of some server bug if you can prove it basically very few scenarios are covered node or server crashing du to some bug not simple overload and similarthe largescale battle thing steps in only to enforce the concept that even if you can prove there was some bug will not be considerated if happened in some massive battleso in the first place you have to run in a bug if you want to try to ask a reimboursement the flow is1 were you victim of a bug or server error 1a yes  goto 2 1b no   deal with it2 where you in a large fleet engagment 2a yes  deal with it 2b no  maybe you are entiteled to a reimboursementhed is typical scenario where nobody is entiteled to any reimboursement any half experienced eve player know how ccp handle this if your blob leaders or fc are telling you something different and pushing yout o spam eve forum then theyre either incompetents or liars in both cases better to drop them
i honestly think its an ocd thing that there needs to be quantifiable numbers for every actionscenario you take and lacking those numbers is a problem in of itself worthy of simply deleting everything and starting from scratch until it can be quantifiedi have a guy in my office like this damn good number cruncher but cant comprehend dynamic situations and that there may be mutiple answeres for a single question because circumstances are not always the same
the root problem is that it isnt always numbers in system that cause the instability a relatively small number of people can spike time dilation by all jumping a gate at once or all undocking at once etc but thats not an issue because its just a spike and its well within what the system can handlelets say you get to hedgp before ruscfc do you get your dialog box saying hey you can jump into system we got this so you jump go wherever youre going and suddenly 1700 more ships on grid boom youre in a largescale fight and one side just hit the system much harder than time dilation can handle and you and lots of other people are under lag ccp can no longer guarantee the performance of the system because of actions taken by the players that overloaded it and you get no reimbursementbasically the causes of largescale fights are too dynamic to predict by the time its obvious that youre in one youre in it dont fly what you cant afford to lose
but is not relevant poor performances overload of the systems lag and so on do not make you elegible to a reimbursement you can ask for it only in case of loss as direct consequence of a bugthe large fleet engagment reference is only to say that if you are in a large fight they dont even bother to check if was a loss caused by a bug or noton the countrary this people keep talking as they should be informed before the undock if there will be a bug and if there will be in a large fleet engagmentagain everyone in eve know as the reimbursemnt policy work they keep creating alts and spamming the forum with this  is only cause their blob leaders ordered them to do so to suggest the idea they lost a battle due to some bugtechnical issue and oh how unfair and cruel is the world  its the same old whine they got the loss reimbursed from their alliance anyway
with all of the new things being added to the game this would be an amazing help to those just getting started or who wanted to be suppliers for war torn corporations by moving ships for them we need thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
if you really want to have new players involved the best way is probably to set up leagues you could have an entry league where ships and fits were announced and publicized well in advance so that new players who wanted to participate would have training goals and obviously there would be no bans because as tactically interesting as they are they disproportionately hurt new players have them as seasons with schedules like any sport would then have a championship round once a year or take a cue from american college football and have bowl bubble games hosted by the various empires npc or capsuleer vying with each other for prestigei will second the request to have deployables available that facilitate the construction of games not arenainabox doeverything deployables but special bubbles anchors timerssinglepurpose raw material items that can be assembled into games by the players that way it may be possible for a playercreated sport to become popular even popular enough to eventually become something like the scl
er yes that was my point
they pick their fights id agree if they couldnt fit a covops cloak  which i suggested as a possible solutionthey would if we went with the t1t2 bomb disparity i suggest i know it wasnt your point but its ironic that are not rare at all  you see them all the time in all securities
smart pilots pick their fights what is your pointwhy do have to be rare again you fail to make any sort of meaningful point
according to the forums postings on this issue ie
it is my understanding that the csm opposing an idea put forth by ccp is a thing that happens because ccp has a bad idea and the csm is pointing out why its not like the csm has arbitrary power to change the game when they support or oppose a position then need reasons in this case the reason is that the fix proposed wouldve technically fixed the one specific issue at hand  scams being possible in part due to the market interface lying in exchange for a nontrivial nerf to market play in general they opposed the nerf which wouldve had a rather more significant negative impact on the playerbase than the scam thats a good thing imo
so if i want to cause lag i just need to carry five different kinds of drones the only thing i agree with here is grouping drones leave the ship balancing be
afk cloak is a dumb mechanic that just kills pve and pvp content fix this instead of wasting time on the esspos and ccp could have brought far more content in rather than wasting effort on something that will die in a week
afk cloaking is not a mechanic educate yourself
its cloaked ships appearing on the allseeingeye of local that makes afkcloaking possibleaddress that problem and then you have real cloaked ships and people not at their keyboards wont be able to scare the nullbearsjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
completely agree the only reason i afk cloak is so that people actually come out in space to fight
the key imho is uniting the new with the experiencedso a regular monthly newbie tourney i reckon should be hosted by ccp i would have x number of teams decided by initial interest each captained by a regular experienced preferably distinguished player with 2 xos also experienced the match would be for fun and to help the newbies learn but aim still to be competitive so id give the teams the same name each month maybe something to distinguish them eg team yoda only flies executioners whatever the captains would stay with their team so lol maybe the captains decide on their team name the interesting thing i would do is randomise the newbiesdraw out of a hat or similar and each month have small prizes the random newbie draw would happen each month aim would be to get newbies and also carebears into pvp and tourney games maybe even carebears could treat it as their monthly forage into danger right now there is a chasm from where im standing between tourney players and newbish daily loggeronners like mejust my thought full comms and the newbies can learn from their captains and xos and by cycling the newbie teams theres variety and chance to learn different ways of doing things
hi alli have a small frustration i use jump clones a lot and unlike most eve pilots i dont actually know every system by name and where they are in relation to each other what i find myself doing is looking at my list of jump clones and typing then link each system name and setting my destination to those in turn to find which one i want to jump clone intocan we get a little development work into this screen and simply have the system or station as a link that you can set destination to from the context menu if anyone else wants this too add a comment so hopefully this post gets noticed by someonecheers
effectively you could just like if you ungroup your missile launchers you will add to the server load but no one does it as its easiership balancing is mostly because ccp just gives drones out to everyones ship and its faction uncle jed variant and its just getting silly nowhowever carrier and supercarrier do need to be addressed at some point
so im curious grace are you ever happy about anything i mean this is the fifth petty whine thread youve made in less than two months all about things which if you took the time to engage your brain instead of your mouth you would realise are nowhere near as serious as you believethis post pretty much answers the question you raised by the way
youre right i hadnt realized cloaking was useless are everywhere everyone has trained them this suggests that they are too versatile  which is my entire point
who said cloaking was uselessmaybe you could realize sbs arent exactly hard to train into why dont you tell us how you really feel
yes thats my point while all ships try to pick their fights quicker ships and cloaky ships are better at it thats how ganking works  you fight people that dont want to fight you dismissing my point  pick their fights with smart pilots pick their fights is disingenuousthats my point i said that in op please read it
what is wrong with mobile ships being able to pick their fights thats the idea you trade defenses for mobilitywhat is wrong with the length of time sbs take to train intoedit also ive looked at your kb and i dont see a single sb kill and its funny you said bombers are good at killing small things when they arent unless the target is webbed painted and going slow doesnt show a lot of credibility
did you read my post at all i address your questionsraylu c is my sb pilotread my post  are the best ships for getting initial tackle on small things
in a nut shell bad bad juju would come of this making people go to low or null sec like that would be like making you go to your original high sec starter system to log in and out
i firmly reside in the hell no category if people dont to leave highsec who are you to try to force people to do that i mean seriously its right up there with forcing everyone to only be able to use festival launchers fireworks and snowballs because someone might god forbid get killed stop trying to ruin the game please thanks1
perhaps the csm brought up viable uses for the margin trade skill and that stayed the csms hand furthermore the initial two solutions proposed by the ccp dev have issues which were elaborated on in that thread if you want to fix  there is one very simple solution add a verify order with the broker function to all market orders this ondemand function has the game verify that enough funds exist to fulfill the order of course it is proper to pay the broker for performing this check 1m isk or so
there is an even more simple solution get rid of  refund sps and move onyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
they already took combat drones away from supercarriers because of whining like this why on earth would we want to limit the use of drones how bout if we limit drones then all frigates get 1 turret or launcher hard point all destoryers get 2 all cruisers get 3 and all battleships get 4 would that make you happy as well how bout we make it so that all ships only fire 10 dps regardless of how many guns there are or what there skill levels are stop ruining the game please
pve npc bounty payments in null sec reduced by pay out 95 of full valueso in essence it is now worthless to do any kind of pve in nullsec
your only losing 5 the new ess system is suppose to drop you to 80 bounty then it increases to 110 of bounty so you get paid more and get paid in lp imagine thatnews flash null pve in arms over tax drop on bounties more at 11
its either a typo or youre reading it wrongits reduced to 95 not by 95
i vote for yellow or red highlighting
subwarp racing is my favourite evesport its fun for both viewers and participants it can be streamed and it takes little investment to be able to competewhat would be really helpful to make it easier to host races is a deployable like one i suggested here
pure pvp tournaments  wh to jove space isolate 12 systems and they can fight there
regardless of hwo silly the ops other accusations are i have to reply to the can gank smaller shipsive been in wormholes hell i was with syj for over a year back when they were c5c6 and no one had failscaded yetthe most amusing thign on the planet was when a sb decloaked near our cruiserbc gang because we would isnatntly lock and alpha them off the field with 1 or 2 guys before they could even launch a bombmissiles
which part lets not do this look at my post garbage because ive read your posts so what if they are the best ships at getting initial tackle thats only true if no one bothers to shoot the bomber ceptors have much better survivability you answered none of my pointsalso being on a handful of kills with your bomber doesnt make raylu c your sb pilot just the one that happens to fly sbs
dscan just needs to be in au not km that alone would make it far more usableon top of that let us type the degrees we want as well as having a slider make it easier to get the 15 degrees not the 5 degrees if thats what we want
i find traveling with my pair very fun i am always using multiple destinations and the optimize route is amazingthe part i find lacking is having to do the same clicking on both accountswould it be a good idea to be able to link the route in chat as a single clickable drag and drop into windowbefore this makes it easier for macros or whatever im behind the times i just play now eve already promotes multiple account usage
cant group drones since they are independent entitiesright now lets assume you have 5 guys and an opponent your gankingfighting has 5 drones you can either each engage a separate drone try and kill them or all focus on one drone and nuke it off immediately but focusing means your wasting alot o dps because the alpha is way more than the drones hp so no matter how much dps you have youll only remove 20 of the dps if drones are groups you increase the damage of each drone but also increase the effectiveness of alpha and therefore create a huge vulnerability for the dronespost is probably completely incoherent but im tired and will edit later
which reminds me  you can group drones already sure you have to do it for each ship and you cant group different drone types ie combat and ecm drones but grouping already exists
if you read my post youd notice that supercarriers would benefit from thisas explained many times seriously countless threads on this topic from 2006 onwards drones are a problem within eve when it comes to huge fleet fightsthere are a few issues i have addressed but you prefer they get nerfedit exists as a way to organise your drones it has zero functionality outside of thati agree with your points however the idea that you can group them would be beneficial in some situationshere is a picture from br5 where it would of been an advantage as the order at the time was to only launch fighter bombers so that they didnt crash the node now if they were combined that could of made the server stress less
linking insists people can access it from anywherethis becomes an issue because autopilot isnt coded for ab its coded for current position  b to allow routes to be linked between any two spots in eve they would have to overhaul the whole routeplanner system to accomodate the need for being able to identify a as at least a temporary bookmark and an active connection to bookmark bmaybe im just making it overcomplicated but either way i cant the benefits would be worth the effort of recoding an entire mechanic of the game
or even a simple warning that tells users that orders are not guaranteed and buyer bewarethere is nothing wrong with or the skill used the error comes from those who make bad investments believing they are going to make some nice isk and blaming everything but themselvesdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
with all the titans and blops bss jumping to their target destination instead of bridge to i propose a simple change to the ui for the right click menu when clicking on the ship or capacitorcurrently the bridge to and jump to selections are 3 or 4 slots apart but both menus expand to the right creating a possible  and well documented via killboards resultthe short term fix is very simple have jump to remain cascading to the right and bridge to cascading to the lefta very simple change that will distinguish which you have selectedother changes that would help the pilots in larger alliances is possibly the greying out of beacons that are not in range
no

the problem is this has actual performance downsides whereas the only real benefit is better server performance in which case no one would give a damnas for your idea about the fighters changes that would be better served in a separate thread idea but you may as well just keep them how they are instead of having this is totally not just a drone with a different name even though it isas for ships being heavily restricted in the drones they can field thats infeasible for missions any kind of solo play with larger ships as you would become completely unable to counter smaller ships with a alrger one as you would no longer have a pointdefense style weapon system of any strength
same with grouped guns you dont hear anyone complaining as its purely optionalso having the ehp of a figher the ability to chase in warp and be assigned is this is totally not just a drone with a different name even though it ishowever this is a drone revamp thread fighters are a brand of drones and they also need to be altered due to the way carriers and supercarriers worki dont even see how this is a valid point people use drones because they are easy and with the new changes to npc ai they are no longer easy target painters and webs are the easy way to hit smaller ai ships and the only reason people stopped doing this is because drones were easy
im bored at work seen this thread and i remembered an idea that i pitched to ccp fozzie at a bar and this is prolly the wrong place to put this but i see ideas and tournaments so i decided to shove this here ill just reiterate hereduring matches you have 2 commentators as fozzie told me one trys to describe what mechanics is going on and how they work this is usually between breaths of the other guy commentating on the actual fight and i really mean yelling at the top of his lungs when a shot is firedusually a lot of stuff is missed on the actual fight and viewers are confused to all hell i usually watch tournaments with irl noneve players most of my time is spent explaining what exactly is going on and not getting drunkso my ideasuggestion is thisin other sports ill use nascar as a horrible example note i dont watch nascar except when i visit my redneck relatives what they do is beforeafter commercials or during points when stuff is not on fire they have little 2030 second segmentsanimations describing how things work draftingcorneringtire wear etc etc and they usually do a good job of itto help ease the commentators during fights and the vast majority of the audienceesp noneve playersis to do similar quick 2030 second videos on how tracking works scan res the various ewar stuffs theres a lot of dead air during the tournament to do this jita cam for example just an idea

sorry but noi dont know about anyone else put personally being on comms when someone jumps instead of bridging is one of the funniest things in eveplus think of the interesting content that this particular class of derp has caused over the years
