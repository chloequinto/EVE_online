lv i really like a lot of the things youve had to say and i respect your continuing effort to make eve a better place for all of us so i cant understand why you dont champion thisif you recognize that this is one of the highest supported topics of the player base for three years running then why dont you bring it up first thing every meetingnow i want to comment on the role of the csm i hear a lot of things like the csm was not created for this purpose that doesnt sit right with me sure some issues the csm should have extremely marginal roles such as exploit issues  banning issues  cheating  internal abuse of power  etcbut on this i believe the csm needs to forget why they were initially created and define themselves in order for the csm to grow into an entity that truly can affect change they need to realize that they have been granted power even if it is only the most infinitesimal amount and they should exercise itnow i am not suggesting radical action and grandiose proclamations of entitlement because ultimately ccp creates the game and they call the shots but it must be recognized that we in fact are shareholders as well we pay for this and without us the game would not only be very boring but nonexistent this is not one of those awkwardly worded threats by the way its simply a statement of pure facteven though ccp created the csm now we have it and i think it should be every csms duty to continue defining itself and asserting the views of the player basethat being said i think it is high time that ccp truly listened to the player base and made a sweeping change to the game that the players ask for if at its core the csm is focused on representing the player base than i can think of no better task charged to them than pushing ideas that we want pushedby the same token i dont think the majority of the people who really wnt this to happen want ccp to scrap everything and fix this but i have to ask why has there not been a devblog or any kind of response from ccp saying this is what we have now and after that were going to work on a pos overhaulhell id be happy with one dev that they stick in a closet with a candle etching ideas onto the walls with his fingernails if only to get the ball definitively rolling id be happy with them sticking a janitor in there as long as something is happening with the issue i have to echo what has been said before in that its too hard is just not a good enough excuse from a company we all love whom i may add has exceeded expectations in so many other waysby the same token i believe that the csm cannot rest on its laurels nor can it abide pressure from anyone in representing the player base including ccp you represent us and we want you to keep bringing up and pressing the issue any way you can
well let me try and explain further thenso say that you as a kid didnt really like the house you went over to your dad and said that you would really like a new house he says no its too expensive to move and points out that he just renovated the while thingthen you start bugging your mother about it who gets really annoyed after a whileits the exact same im afraid the csm has to appear stubborn because it would ruin it we can resort to reasoning sure but what you ask us to isnt reason im sorry i really am but we already raised it we were told it would not be viable the issue is still in the system and was revised when we were in iceland to the same conclusion
i must respectfully say lv that this situation you describe is not accurate enough sure its close but it doesnt quite encapsulate the situationwe are not children begging to dad and i believe that i can speak for a few out there who are resentful of this view im really not trying to pick a fight with those words but i simply mean to say that i feel that us as players and especially those in the csm are much more than thatthe fact of the matter is were adults and we pay rent in this imaginary house we pay a subscription fee and seeing as how there will never be nor should ever be an eve 2 ccp continually upgrades the existing platform being that we pay rent and are not simply the impotent children that seems to be the popular viewpoint i feel that we are validatedwe are the living breathing eve we make it what it is and ccp merely provides the tools for us to have funeven beyond wanting this idea to come to fruition im a little saddened by the fact that everyone seems ready to roll over on this why is it ridiculous to demand a higher standard from a great company why is it audacious for them to at the very least release a statement about this extremely important topici want the csm to fight for me on behalf of what i see as something a little more than a game eve is some sort of insane sociopolitical experiment and in order to function properly we need the right tools having something as cumbersome as the current pos mechanic hinders our ability to enjoy this little world of oursnow i dont want to get all preachy and say that eve is life and simply rant about not having my way right away what i do want however is to eliminate this seeming stigma that the player base has accrued on behalf of this issueeve is an everchanging world and thusly i believe that the answer does not lie in the pat answer wow is i want to change eve for the better and effect the most change in the way that people basically interact with the game instead of just ditching out thats what i expect of my csm as well so please dont stop representing us in this matter
i think the main problem is that missiles dont have a module to increase their tracking exp velocity as turret does turrets have several tracking computers tracking enhances remote tracking computersmissiles should have the same increasing either exp velocity or missile speed depending on the script in themi cant imagine why this isnt already in the game as if the missiles wasnt prenerfed enough to begin with p heheedittypo
ccp you have done something really wrong somewhere i can only assume and hope it was just a mistake that is already being fixedplease we dont care if you change things for the better i still support the nano nurf but changing something for no reason is just wrong
caldari ships arent even good for pve anymore
explosion vel really ought to consider which direction the missile is approaching from and if its hitting from the front half the speed mod really ought to be adding tothe damage not reducing itweve had missiles that attack from the front since the late 60s you know

i like being flashy flashy however under the current system i can drop from 0 to 8 in a day of pvp however to get back up to 0 would take me about 3 weeks of 00 ratting there needs to be an easier way for a pvper to gain sec or make it harder to drop sec while in low sec 04 and below
this is something that i do belive is very much needed at this point as it stands at the moment ship scaling is very confusing at the moment with some ships a very good example is the caldari frigate the merlin you can see a large window at the top of the ship that makes it look like a 1 man fighter but then if you take a look at a larger class of ship like a cruiser lets take the blackbird the windows are a hell of alot smaller on it and looks like it can carry about a hundred or so yet the ships are pretty much the same size only the merlin is slightly smaller this kind of thing is more emphesized when you look at the size of a carrier lets take the archon here its maintenance bay can take around 3 battleships and if you look at the hyperion next to an archon then the battleship is over half its lengh and there is no way it could fit inside the carrier in any way now im not saying make the capitals bigger to the point where it looks rediculusly oversized coming out of an undock tube but maybe make the other ships smaller keeping capitals as they are scaling everything battleship and smaller and making sure each class keeps to certain size no bigger than x but also no smaller than y i know this isnt really fixing anything but i do belive it is something that has been way overdue
im so glad all of the other concerns and issues in eve are fixed so we can now worry about details like my megathron is too big
im not saying its to big or to small im just saying the scaling isnt right
youre saying the windows on the merlin are too bigstop drop fix the merlins windows
the merlin was only used as an example
i agree completely and this goes for a lot of ships too another example is comparing the scale of a freighter to regular transports or other ships both visually and statistically looking at relative cargo capacity the scaling isnt right on many ships the windows are way out of scale in comparison to other ships in other cases other components just dont look right when compared with other ships etc and yes i think its important and i dont think it would be hard to fix almost always ships could be scaled up or down to bring things into more believable proportion
i trained for the nag thinking that in the insane amount of time it took to get speced for everything that ccp would of fixed it but alas they still havnt almost a year ago now and i sold it to buy a phoenix which im currently training for

mechanics change for highsec thenif a player lootssalvages a player wreck in high sec that heshe didnt kill him or her self or are not in corpfleet with should trigger concord action like any other aggression that could effectively reduce the highsec suicide ganking problem as the suicide pilot will have to wait for concord aggression timer to cool down before being able to return to the wreck which allows the victims corp to come in and maybe salvage the remains before that happens
hey good idea
1 wardecs should be more expensive 50100 mill per week seems more reasonable as a minor deterrent the wardeccing corp should be saddled with the weekly expense for an additional 2 weeks if they retract their wardec without having their target surrenderthe problem seems to be that griefers can wardec at practically no cost and start hunting players not used to lowsec conditions primarily for easy kills which imho does make the griefers look really pathetic2 that you become a part of the war if you assist a warring party at least the wardeccing party is a good one too
if youre not prepared to fight or otherwise survive a war youre not ready to form a corp stay in a larger stronger corp until you have the resources skills and experience to survivethe problem is not that wardecs are not expensive enough but that creating a corp is too easy and cheap
if people want to pvp in wow they can go to battlegrounds the people that quit as a result of being wardecced is a good thingif you dont want to be wardecced dont spam local with defenceless carebear corp consisting of 16yos recruiting now or whatever it is that you do people like you are soooo tastyyyinstead of leaving the game why dont you join a massive alliance like intrepid crossing or something thats where you go these days to avoid wardecs and just hide behind the bloba will reply again

baaaaawwwwwwww can i have your stuff
cant we have the ability to chose a corporatealliance colour scheme on our ships along with the corporate and alliance emblem painted on the ship itself or would such diversities hurt the performance too muchim not thinking about a complete custom paint job but more like predefined sections of the hull could have their colour and perhaps a pattern from a limited selection of stencils set by personal corporate andor alliance preferences
thought about this before but i imagine it would be 10 on the priority list
i agree not exactly a vital change but seeing how much players in other inferior   games put value on guildganggroup signs and colours it might not be a bad idea to consider this for a future update however distant it may be
id support this as long as it doesnt cause a performance hit to the game  which i think the op was in agreement with given his question
i had a thread on this matter  painting ships you can view it hereunfortunately the csm believes it will add to lag which it wont  most lag occurs on the client rendering the ships not the servers delivering the data they shot it down so now were stuck with the same old bland ships
its not like we want custom paint jobs like thesecustom kestrelorcustom apocfound these in another thread in eve general chat 
i think you just killed your topic thats the way how to smartbomb a good idea
those pics offend my eyes i dont think preset colour schemes would effect performance that much but being able to colour your ship mightcorp and alliance badges on ships shouldnt effect performance that much either because ther not going to be huge and ther is already the preset parts for them most alliance badges suck anyway apart from those that were created out of game like goonswarms badge now that is a badge that would look cool on a ship
i did say that i wasnt looking at that level of customization my thought were to be able to use colour highlights along the same line as you see the differences between t1 and t2 versions of the same hulls just a bit morenoticeable
id be happy with base colors that can be changed say 10 colors and their variantsyes youd have one or two wackos with bright pink hulls but for the most part i think it would create a variety and fleets in warp would look fantasticeven if you leave colors alone we do need corp emblemsits the little things in life you treasure

the lag in jita is horrible everyone knows that and its getting worse as the games popularity increases something must be done there are several ways this issue can be mitigated my suggestion is thisall stations within a 1 system radius of jita the forge systems only would be linked both in inventory and in market related respects in addition extra systems surrounding jita which would have links to them from multiple systems would aid getting traffic in and outin addition having only one vector that ships leave stations on creates a perpetual traffic wreck of ships outside busy stations ships crashing into each other at station exit in peak hours this can be so bad to prevent you from warping for up to a minute or even more fixing this is fortunately easy simply add numerous exit vectors from stations and use them in a roundrobin way this ensures some spacing between ships allowing them time to get to warp

ewar battlecruisers 5 bonus to heavy and heavy assault missile kinetic damage per level and15 bonus to target jammer strength per level
you are a bad person kirth that said need moar t1 ships
faction battlecruisers are long overdue more battlecruisers please also tech 2 tier 2 battlecruisers would be nice more destroyers would be nice but faction battlecruisers would be a fairly easy implimentation
i still do not see what the named ships would actually do other then change slot layout or increase stats arent rigs for this purpose granted there are no rigs to change slot layout but couldnt there be rather then named ships the issues around named ship delivery  faction drops exploration bpc lp store rewards seem to be a major fail also what exactly would be different  as to researching bpos to gain different levels of named ship creation  thats terrible one more way to timesink research one more way for large corps to distance themselves from newer corps different slot layout would be nice but isnt that also part of using different ships altogether i think changing lp stores to give out named ships would be nice just who is the target market for these ships and still again what exactly would they bring that was new
the op does not suggest slot changes at all i really dont know why the discussion keeps finding its way back to that point all that hes suggested is named ships much in the same way we have named modules at presentas for how these are acquired researching the bpo is the only reasonable way it could be implemented drops arent a realistic option and there are faction ships in the lp store but having the ability to research your bpo and make the ship your produce differentbetter than what the vanilla bpo produces this would be beneficial to the research and manufacturing industry and would provide for more variety in possible ship fittings which for both pvp and pve would be a good thinglolwutso what youre basically saying is that there should be no benefit to industrial corps that deploy resources to research their bpos and organise themselves well
you dont have to spend a long time in a 00 alliance before you realise 00 is at least just as flawed
i like the clean rules of 00 to the mess of standings and war decs that exists in empire by clean i mean anyone can attack anyone at anytime if somone is not a known friend they can be assumed to be hostile until such time as its proven otherwise pilot actions are dictated by the pilots not limited bydictated by game mechanics such as war decs or the sec status of the system please note i didnt say alliances i live in 00 and stay out of alliances alliance rules get just as silly as concord rules much of the time
i was told by ccp that its perfectly acceptable to jump corps multiple times to avoid a war witch imho is stupid 
yeah its not like people run away from countries when war hitsccp knows a good portion of the player base does not want wardecs or combat so they are not going to prevent them from enjoying a game since it brings in money for ccp to stay in business

other then the you want to macro mine hisec posters i havent seen a good reason not to have a monster lowsec capital mining ship one that actually mines this time i still cannot see why in the age of giant fighting ships there would not be a comprable giant mining ship but the rorqual where is my roid eating ships isnt that a slightly more efficent way to mine then lasering it bit by bit get up close and personal with the actual rock i dunno but matter transmission seems wasteful when you could just as well move to 1km and eat the roid where it sits but thats neither here nor there no sec simply does not have a mining ship built for it not tank not mining ability not size and we needs one
as it is with the hulk i cant actully get a full cycle of one of my strip miners without the asteroid dissapearing at the end of the cycle for most things so i think its fine but in all honesty it should have been made a lvl 4 exhumer requirementbut on a serius note with this post if you have something larger than a hulk it should probably be deployable and be pretty much static for the extra strips more a mining platform with a range and yeild bonus and extra cargo space or even a special type of strip miner for the ship but if it was implemented some drawback to useing it though not to much to make it pointless should be impementedim not to fussed either way but i do belive industrialists do need some loving to p
rofl at limittolowsec suggestionswtf flying a good mining ship is against empire laws or something will concord feel offended and blow you
its a balance issue mostly noobs vs established having bigger solotype miners will let fewer and fewer individuals clear systems new players wont be able to mine anything as all the starting systems will be cleared out in a matter of hours ristricting a huge mining ship to low or 00 will keep that from happening worse then it already is and why should 00 miners face worse dangers in the same ships shouldnt they be slightly more staggered to the inherent risks the possibility of having a deep space miner on par with dreads or titans shouldnt be ruled out im not saying they should tank or be that sized but they should scale mining ships the same way they scale combat ships
supported but i think players shouldnt be able to make their ship bright pink or whatever it would just be terrible maybe hues of moss  rust  gunmetal etc etc

hi guys well i can see that the csm has voted on the issue so i hope somthing will be done about this asapim no programmer but i think that it should be fairly simple to impliment a script or a modification that would fix this issueas it is there is a lot of effort required to remove poss that have been abandoned for most players this is more a choir than fun but raiding a pos and maybe even stealing it would be fun or at least funny and allso there would be no need of a huge gang of guys sitting at the offlineinactive pos that is basically a waste of spaceto the naysayers i like to point out that if you fuel a pos 1 per month then you wouldnt be in danger of loosing the pos to some hacker pos owners just make shure the pos is online if not its just an exploit really invaulnerable junk floating in spacethere are a lot of nice ideas around here and ofc i have one as well7 days after pos goes offlinethe pos shields turn off at downtime only armor and structure hp leftif players want to kill it its much easyer now no shield hpstarbase structures can be approached and hacked hacking skill or whatever if successful their contents can be stoleni would recomend having seperate hacking attepts for each hangardivisionrequires multiple hacking successes for each corp hangar etc14 days after pos goes offlinethe all starbase structures can be hacked and if successful unanchored and eventually scooped or redeployedthe starbase structures would haveto be reanchored if the player wants the moonadditional stuffif somone attepts to hack a starbase structure then a evemail is sent to the corp maybe limit it to one per daymaybe having a special unanchoring skilltree or maybe tying some science skills to the equasion so that it would be science carebear type of players that would be posraiding specialists make those rd alts work for once
i would love to be able to hack offline poss that said the chance of success should be really low likely you would end up spending hours sitting there trying to hack the tower gives owners a chance at defending it if they havent really abandoned it but just let it offline cause theyre short of cash or just trying to keep the location or whatever i could see this as a way to bait the prospective hackers in this situation if hacking someone elses property flags you does it i havent seen it mentioned anywhere
yes but cans also had hp reduced and were blown up by devs if they were used as place holders on moons anchored pos are just exploiting the same system but with the added effect of more hp and the potential to online them if an attack comes only difference is the fuel saved during their offline state when a tower runs out of fuel it should start using its stront while anchored as if in reinforced if it also runs out of stront then the tower loses its anchored stated people wont want to pay for stront so theyll stop exploiting offline towers holding moons add to that a 50 reduction in total hp and 0 resist while in anchored mode and i think we got a winner
well i agrea that it should take some time to hack like i wrote in the last post if you haveto hack each hangardivisions seperatly then you spend 12 minutes to hack each of them and if fex a corp hangar arrey has 6 divisions its likely to take 612m for each arraysecond thing is flagging well i personally think this should be treated the same way as when somone tryes to steal your can only in highsec does it really make a diffyaaywell considering the investment then i think it would be ok to let the owner keep the placeholder pos for a short time my suggestion is based on the pos loosing all shield hp no fuel  no energy and only armorstructure being leftamarr pos shield 40m hp 0000armor 10m hp 0000structure  99999999no shields  80 online hp it would take 10 bs 30minutes to kill it takes 2 hours to unanchor a large pos anywaythe risk is always there if the corp lets it go offline that somone would attack it and pop it i guess its a bit easyer to pop a pos with no shield hpdevs plz listen to csm and impliment some new form of sov mechanism 00 needs help using planets to hold sov would be brilliant colonys would be even more so
it is completely different it would be done with the community knowing and knowing why from a role playing perspective chribba has done a lot for the community and there is no reason why from a rp standpoint you could not believe his character acts the same way in game therefor especially with their new leader the amarr letting chribba move his titan into amarr may not be that unbelievable so they make him remove his ddd and the titan is harmlessi will not comment on the capital afkmining in empire thing because it does not deserve a responsewhen an alliance wins the alliance tournament they receive a monument in a solar system of their choice chribbas actions imho have earned him a reward from the armarr empire its not favoritism when you put a logical reason behind it if chribba was some random guy who had not done anything but be buddy buddy with a dev then yes it would be favoritisim anyways enough ranting from mei vote yes chribba has done enough in my view to earn this reward from the empire
i support this however my only question is how would you keep it safe would you just be constantly flying it or would you somehow haxxor the system to deploy a pos considering that titans cant dock just curious isaac

it would seem ccp is to high on their horse to even allow players producing content for them to use even though plenty of games do it and theres a game i can think of thats almost entirely made well its being made of player produced artmodels with skinstextures and all the other stuff required when designing things
respectfully lv i must disagree a better analogy would bethe csm acts more like the concierge at a hotel that ccp owns it is thier duty to inform management ccp that certain paying guests are reporting a problem with the plumbing in thier rooms according to reports everytime they enter their bathrooms they discover that the toilets have backed up and sewerage is floating in the toilets poswhile they can flush them and clear the turds thereby making the toilets usable this is an unacceptable situationspending money on the hotel resturant and the convention center ambulation while likly to attract attention and customers is offset when every time one of those few paying guests with the toilet trouble pos users speaks to another potential guest and expresses thier disgust at the ongoing situation it damages the hotels reputationas others have stated this problem has been going on for a long time while i think everyone would love immediate changes to address the turds that are poss i think most would settle for a commitment by ccp to repair the system within a reasonable time ccps avoidance of the issue and that includes the lack of commitment to entertain a solution or consider one shows a lack of customer respecti am looking for a commitment from ccp to us the customer base that they will repair the pos system that it will be similar to the dead horse pos system and that it will be implemented within 1 yearrespectfullytribeall my misspellings belong to us

roflmao hundreds thousands in a frigateok i dont know the numbers for our current wet navies right now but i seriously doubt they are that high in a spaceship it will be considerably lower after all they have to worry about things like life support so a a space frigate would likely have a crew of about a dozen figure 1 captain maybe a first officer an engineer figure 3 watches so 3 pilotnavigators 3 gunners and 3 electronics officers fact is that crew in spacecraft will be kept to a minimum so more space can be devoted to weapons defensive systems engines etc as opposed to having to use a lot of space for crew quarters life support and food storage not to mention drinking water since you cant compress water and in a frigate crew quarters would probably double as escape pods to save even more spaceedit to give thumbs up
have you noticed that secure containers or whatever can actually carry more then their size so inside the container its cubic meters is larger then the cubic meters of the container itself

if you ctrl q under cloak the aggressing party has 30 seconds to kill your ship if they have a point on your ship it just disapears
oh they fixed that well that helps somewhat but when camping a highseclowsec point that doesnt help muchi try to not jump into hostile camps but i cant say i have disconnected right after gate jumping often usually disconnect mid combat and that really sucks as they have 15 mins to find me or even 15 mins to kill me as they have me pointed i support that log off tactics need to be looked at
i think the real issue is the double logging that makes ships not return to their original location and that should really be adressed
if a neutral reps your target instead of him being hostile for 15 min he gets concordedinb4 the whine
100 agreeand made a thread about this in cp a while backthread in cp
totally agree people will say well why not just shoot them you enter a fight with what you hope is proper intel on your targets but then when 34 neut reppers show up and you have to waste time killing them you have just lost valued time and dps while taking dps to shoot a target that should not be there in the first place
your proposal goes against the sandbox idea that eve is supposed to be if someone wants to become involved in a fight they should be allowed to do so no reason for police intervention since the neutral hasnt broken any laws
i think getting involved in someone elses fight should be illegal
yeah its just cheating if you want to get your alt involved then join the same corp or war dec
the thing that would actually resolve this is if remote boosters got actual aggression timer making them unable to dock or jump a gate and not just the current passive can be shot 15min timer which is worthless when you can constantly remote boost dock when fired on undock remote boost etc
this becuase currently it allows someone to engage in a fight and deagress wo consequences its considered agression when repping someone who does an action that brings concord in the same it should be counted as agression to rep same with in lowsec rep someone who is gotten a gcc and you get shot by sentry guns but yet still allowed to dockundock at easethis is going to get even worse now that players wont have a 30sec timer on changing shipsbut not some illegal to interfere with your fight crap this is eve someone psses in your sandbox lol good luck
repping rats in highsec will get you concordedthus repping targets currently at war with another corp you are not also at war with should be the exact same as repping an npc you get bbqd by the donut squad

pre pach i loved my manticore now it just sits in the dark collecting dust with the nurf to missiles its just not worth iti love this idea
wont happen m8why you think you got the api pbesides if ccp started doing official killboards the likes of evsco evekb and griefwatch would die out pretty fastso no editps why do you think beans ralle and myself started evscoso we could fill in the gap that ccp hasnt given us read more here 
not supported i dont like the idea of an offical kb would make it too easy for people to get intel etccan i offer another idea everyone on a kill mail gets a copy would be much eaiser and would solve all the problems you currently have chapters
give ceos the ability to instant kick members no more notice to suspected thieves and saboteurs they have been found out and people that want to instant leave can ask their ceo to lend them a hand
i support the ceo instakick also when a ceo instas someone he should have a short list of choices hostile neutral or friendly he picks one when he boots someone and it shows up in that players history next to the corp the choice would default to neutral for those who just cba to let the world know if they like someone or not the choice only shows for corps that a player gets instad from so it encourages ppl to just drop roles and wait the 24h i also think a ceo and corp security officers should be notified via eve mail when a player drops roles as that would make corp theft not quite as easy
changed my mind signed
signedshouldnt need a sensor booster to lock someone of the same class before they warp
no
jita has lag
heres one for you stop going to jitaoh wow what an idea that isgee i never thought of that one before
been to jita many a time maybe you need to get off your ancient connection and get highspeed internet like the rest of usisaac
the ammount of people that are normaly in there is the problem most of the time and the server not being able to handle that amount of people rather than a persons connectionalso if the frame rate is low on his pc then its more than likely thatjita does lag still but they have fixed it so it isnt as bad but i do think that linking the markets together in that area would make it so people are more spread out then again if they did that then people will just go to the system at the edge of that area moving the them there and the problems it causes
i cant stand jita  and so i very rarely go there an idea due to the cost of the faction wars the caldari state needs more funds the caldari see an opportunity due to the thriving market in jita and they add a wartax to all market transactions that take place in the jita system potential result hopefully this would push more trading and market activities out of jita  increasing markets in other systems
wont accomplish anythingtaxes are a poor excuse of a solutionjust stop going to jitai can get pretty much anything i need if i look hard enough
if and i repeat if this is actually causing lag on the server side as opposed to client lag then the solution is fairly simpleeither 1 expand hardware to meet demand or2 reduce the concurrent user per star system countif on the other hand it is a client issue there really isnt much ccp can do to help and id hate to waste their resources trying
this whole thread is about a minority trying to impose its viewpoints on the majoritywhy do many groups think if we tell everyone about ourselves and how great we are then everyone will love us want to be one of us i a lot of cases it will just cause backlash as ppl just get sick of hearing about something they would gleefully have ignored til they got sick of hearing about it constantly i would bet that at least for a while the ingame stuff will escalate after all you wont go to jail for killing an annoying person ingame like you would in rl
when did i mention t2 ships perhaps you misunderstood what i meant by t1 counterpart i was referring for example to ships like the cyclone this ship is flow disproportional less than the hurricane because it is generally outclassed by the latterif the objective is to have more usable t1 ships im suggesting that it is more efficient for ccp to fix existing but largely ignored ships than to create new ones ccp wont have to make new models textures etc all efforts can be focused on making new useful and hopefully innovative roles for the existing hulls moreover ccp has a lot of information on existing hulls and thats a good starting place to fix them as opposed to starting from scratchonce ccp has made most existing ships reasonably useful then they can focus attention on expanding the fleet of t1 hulls or spend that time on something more useful this will yield more results from ccps limited resources
ahh right i misunderstood what you meant by t1 counterparti agree that unused ships should be rebalanced so they fulfil a useful role  but in the case of destroyers both rebalance and expansion of the line is needed imo
no worriesi probably would have misunderstood myself had i not already know what i myself meantif that makes any sense
this has been a constant complaint of mine for quite a while more stuff after better stuff
we have named tech1 ships theyre called faction ships but we do need more of them
not really look at modules in no particular ordert1t2namedfactionofficerthen look at shipst1t2factiontheres holes in that there listwhilst id like to see officer ships too im happy to start championing the cause of named ships as these could easily be implemented using existing game mechanics
and we should fill those holes
as has been said time and time and time againflag all members of a corp with the wardec if they jump the flag follows them until the end of that war period the flag does not transfer except corps joining alliances as under the current mechanics but the new corp can assist the warflagged pilot without concord involvment if they are attacked and become subject to aggression flagging but they cannot attack the flagged members foes until said member is attackedmake war flags sticky and all problems will be solvedoh and slap some damn limitations on npc corps such as hull size limits skill tier limits agent limits ect make npc corps places to start out not places to exist permanently
and how is that griefing jackassthe only griefing i see here is you making a stupid post with no stupid rationality or thoughtgb2wow they like your kind there
sometimes its nice to be able to take the weekend off 
because we need more time sinking learnign skills terrible idearemove all the learning skills from the game reimburse sp and extend the queue to 48h if you want but no mroe learnign skills the worse idea implemented in this game
and that is when you train those long skills spanning a couple of days not supporting this idea btw
sounds good to me the 24 hour queue is nice but i would like it either extended or have it be any skill that starts in the next 24 hours so that you can tack a long skill on the end of it
capital tractor beams on the rorqual are going to waste we need to make it possible to tractor asteroids using the rorqual and bring them off grid into slightly better safety
ummnoquit making stupid ideasisaac
this
sounds like this could be pretty funny
i think pos bubbles should act like warp bubblesmake it so people who are cozy and safe inside the bubble have to come out in order to escape or you warp to the edge of the bubble and then fly ineve needs more death and destructionhiding your nyx in the bubble and you think you can warp away free and clear oh no
eve needs fewer people who make stupid ideas
i agree drake no support to the op qq about it somewhere elseisaac

being a gallente purist i can say that my gunnery sp feels very wasted when my t2 hammerheads both reach the target and do more effective dps to it than an entire rack of t2 ion blasters unless the ship is holding still or flying directly towards me gallente ships being rather slow and having the agility of a brick make catching ships of the same size difficult at times with how many people fit scramblers now as well im starting to fit afterburners on my pvp ships having no mwd 7km out means my medium blasters arent hitting anything the current state of blasters sometimes makes me wish gallente had a racial bonus to nosneut rather than blasters blasters arent dead or useless but have really fallen away from their true purposedisclaimer blasters arent completely broken shiney stuff still comes out of the other end when i fire them and they seem to distract the enemy enough so that he doesnt start popping my drones my real dpssigned and supported
can you give me the tldr of how a huge increase in demand for mined minerals wouldnt benefit miners and make mining outside hisec more attractive
please remove the processing skill prerequisites from mining crystalseffectively this forces people that want to be good at mining to become good at processing orethis strongly devalues both skills discourages teamwork and in general holds back mining ops and holds back miners from learning combat skillsit would be really nice to be able to rely on someone to process your ore for you  like if youre a computer programmer it would really suck to have to solder your own motherboard together just to write a program 
yeahrighthow about rejoining reality
well im curious anyways is there a good reason game design why those skills are required for the crystalsdoes this nerf dualaccount players or somethingdoes it nerf trials like im not sure what the advantage is to having those skills linked
yes there is it is called not having to train a million skills everytime you want to wipe your butt in eveall your terribly thoughtout proposal would do is make miners or just one character per corp train a few more skills then everyone has perfect refine againrefining is simply click button  receive materials not a profession and it certainly does not deserve to have a separate skill tree
you had me at eviscerated
this is much ado about nothing i remember the crap that ankesceptic made about hacking killboards all pvpers being griefers etc and she is now the chairman
really when did vuk relinquish that role
way too much stuff to quote and still have room to respond so ill just wing ithere is the chain of events that prompted my posting in this thread1 i read this thread2 i read the csm minutesif you dont like how isslers input was presented in those minutes then you can ask to have them revised i saw isslers name along with 00 issues and a red flag went up because ive seen her operate and unless something major has changed shes not my image of a 00 capable leaderthis is how issler worded what happened if she honestly feels that her suggestions were positive and helpful things that will improve eve instead of removing challenges then she can post them and i will read them maybe they werent so bad but since they werent detailed in the minutes i wasnt privy to that infoive tried to explain this before but ill do it one more time just for the heck of it why did a red flag go up when i saw her name along with 00 issue discussions1 her leadership style which she broke down in this thread isnt so much a leadership style as it is a social event directorship its not conducive to survival in any hostile environment although its a great way to meet nice people2 avoidance of challenges  while the entire alliance lived in low sec isslers people lived in high sec rather than organizing low sec mining ops everybody sat around in high sec and mined its not so much that this is a bad practice but that it became a habit to avoid challenges mining in high sec is fine except that it dulls the survival skills needed to mine in tougher environments3 disorganization  maybe this is part of her core philosophy who knows but nothing seemed to be important enough for her to focus on it tada os ship building service was often plagued with delays due to nobody centrally managing it orders got canceled all the time because jobs werent getting built during freighter ops she had this bad habit of warping to the wrong gate and she was one of the freighter pilots again its just a simple case of organization and discipline everybody makes mistakes but some situations call for extra care organization and attention4 lack of understanding of serious politics  yes this goes back to the payoff for the freighter move some of this is coming back to me now that im thinking more about it there was a crap ton of minerals for sale in either pvh8 or ezafm when we moved into syndicate i remember issler having logistics issues with getting her build supplies into the pc9 cluster where we lived im pretty sure she purchased those minerals and then realized she couldnt just go get them solo with the freighter i dont know the full story unfortunately but i do know it was confirmed that she payed off one of our direct opponents to be allowed to move the freighter safely it doesnt matter if it was huzzah or fire mandril or exm or whoever it happened and was the final nail in the coffin that got tadao kicked out of the allianceso thats it as best as i can explain it im not saying issler is a bad person or that she shouldnt be a csm im simply saying that seeing her name next to a discussion on 00 made me wonder what good she could possibly bring to that discussion maybe shes changed maybe she learned some lessons along the way who knows
we understand shes not your ideal representative her leadership is moot unless you would like to apply to the corp i assume thats why you voted for someone more in line with your viewsi thought you didnt comment on things you didnt know about your next post had i not done it here for you alreadyand the rebuttalniskin we have heard your views several times we understand entirely that you dont know what issler said on the subject of 00 something you readily admit
you are absolutely right why didnt i see it before internet space ships is very serious business
niskin mostly you still seem to have a grudge let talk more about your views of leadership when youve started a corp of your own had it survive over 3 years started an alliance and then run for the csm having done these things or at least one of them would add to your credibility right now you just sort of complain about a vague feeling of unrest that you attribute to me and my participation in the csmyour recent posts also contain a variety of errors for example that we didnt partiticpate in low sec operations when bruce was there since our primary office and where we paid out for minerals was aeschee which is low sec your statement is just wrong we were active in every bruce mining op also i live in low sec and hardly ever leaveyour claim of canceled ship orders is partially true bruces insistance on only engaging in combat when gigantic blobs could be formed and huge numeric advantages gained meant that we often could not get minerals to produce ships thus the one time that i personally risked my own freighter to folks bruce would have called pirates to get bruce their ships i should note in the end the pirates were more honorable than brucestrange that these very insignficant events are still somehow the focus of a small group of bitter people i think in the end what this is about is we moved on and are thriving sorry about that how we do that despite my horrible failures must just be impossible to understand let me give you something to consider if realty continues to be inconsistent with your theories maybe your theories need some reconsiderationby the way i am happy to report that my attempts to reverse engineer the nonnis lamb sub are advancing with great success i am close to cracking the sauceissler
you run an alliance in which nobody is required to do anything you are nice to everyone and you give them stuff to help them out yes its definitely an accomplishment of great merit that youve survived for 3 years seriously if your corp didnt survive 3 years id be amazed failure cascades and corp breakups usually happen in the face of great challenges not in the face of carebear bliss i complain not because of what youve done but because you think what youve done is somehow specialthe mineral cans were in attyn thats where i was told to put the ore in the entire time i was in tadao i saw almost none of our corp members in aeschee so while there may have been cans there there werent any people there to fill them dantar420 and skiorh were regulars down there but they werent miners eithermemories are apparently short on your end of the gray matter slow builds happened as far back as aeschee myself and other people canceled our orders after waiting over a week on ships bruce didnt blob until we got established in syndicate and grew quite a bit at that point we had to because corps like exm werent gonna give us a break just cuz we werent as skilled as them yet besides if the orders were large due to blobbing losses why didnt you keep stuff stocked youd think that would be the kind of thing that an industrial corp would doinsignificant in your mind which is why you dont understand how people could be upset over them failure to understand whats going on around you doesnt make it any less real you make a choice you take an action something happens because of it you brought these things on yourself even if you dont understand that you did
i was inactive when the csms were put in and voted on after bruce fell apart i took a 6 month break and when i returned things were as they are nowbeing a csm puts a player in the public eye by their own choice might i add so its not moot at all how well a player understands certain portions of the game is relevant to how they fulfill their role as a csm im sure plenty of people are worried about what dariuss input would be on the csm and if they were they could do the same thing i am doing
you sure are making a ruckus for someone who chose not to be part of the voting process you know what they say if you dont vote then you relenquish all rights to complain do your civic duty next time voteedit all this talk of supremely tasty sandwiches has made me hungry
yes your eve history is quite fascinating i greatly admire your attempt at changing the minds of eve one csm at a time also issler is not leading you so it doesnt matter what you think of her leadershipshe was not elected to remake eve in her image but to lend her ideas and represent quite a few people in eve who voted for her we understand you were not one of them and dont need to hear why againback to the point though were still waiting for the reply to the million dollar questionyou have quoted the end of the post which contained this but oddly enough ignored the five or so ways this has been asked of you in the pastthe best you have managed so far ismaybe you have an argument maybe you will like her views maybe she should violate ndas and repeat a ccp discussion just for you maybe she doesnt care about winning your vote should you choose to be subscribed to eve next election
so now i should be held in scorn for being nice providing freedom and creating carebear bliss for over 3 years i think we just hit your nail on your head i am happy and so are the folks in beep and we are enjoying ourselves in a manner that you dont like ok gotcha ill get right on trying to reduce our enjoyment of evethere were mineral cans there too if members didnt want to operate in low sec i wasnt going to force them sorry you missed the miners there i didnt because i was both busy mining and paying the other miners there as well we were very active there as there is where all our zydrine came from you know a mineral you canf find in high secsorry we offered you cheap ships and somehow you wanted them quicker no one made you buy from us ill be sure to ask you next time i need to understand what an industrial corp does since you clearly are an industrial genius typelets see we left bruce and syndicate not long after the move there another 4 months goes by freed becomes famous for having one of the larger egos in eve bruce moves to harder 00 grows larger stabs some allies in the back foom guts bruce and runs back to aeschee killing bruce in the process and somehow in all that what i did in those early days is still keeps you awake at night wow i feel specialso niskin when are we actually going to get an actual example of what ive done or said i was going to do in the csm to change eve that you have been asked for something like 20 times now all i really have seen is that you now agree i have created 3 years of care bear bliss which i will use as an endorsement if i choose to run againissler
 this comment has no valid point your completly ignoring the actual situation and just stating a bland rebuttal what does the old player have to lose from this say you have 2 million sp invested in learning skills and ccp decides to get rid of learning skillsold players will have all their learning sp removed and will earn sp at twice the speed until they have reaccumulated those 2 million sp they could even make it 4x the speed or 10x the speed does it really matter so basically what the old player gets out of this is a free 2 million sp about 2 months training timenew players can start training towards their specialization immediately without having to learn how to learn remember folks this is a game its supposed to be fun now of course anything fun is also usually a challenge but training learning skills is no challenge its simply a delay of the fun factor of the games skill system which is training your character towards better modules better fittings and better ships when my engineering 5 first completed i was really happy and proud of my choice to start training all my core skills as early as possible when i finished training my last learning skill up 5 i wasnt happy or proud i felt cheated out of my learning time to train something redundant so i felt relieved that i got it over withedit oh and for the argument that they would have to give older characters the sp they would have had if all their learning skills had been level 5 from the start forget it who cares unlike you selfish bastards i actually care about new players experiences and not just my own insignificant nonrelevant gamer ego scratch that i dont care about new players i love blowing them up but i want new players to enjoy their first month because if they enjoy their first month then they will stick around the more players in this game the better because then the game will expand and not die out like most other games i care about myself having fun more players joining eve online and sticking around  more fun for meso what will all your precious hardearned learning skills mean if the game dies out because nobody wants to keep playing a game where you sit around and mine in your ibis and run level 1s in your merlin just waiting to learn how to learn for the first 2 months of a game while you pay 15 a month and yes i know the alternative is to not train learning skills but the point is that you have to train them if you want to learn to fly anything in a reasonable timeframe

well hate to break it to you but i am not an alt just because i have a life outside of eve shock surprise and i dont post on every stupid thread nice post about golden waffles doesnt mean im an alt nice try also bump for thread haha
srry wrong thread
give us new pos ccp
hell yeah
signed awesome idea
sighned the pos is my favorite part of eve though currently its implementation is lackluster at best come ccp we want this reworked
hi sec posessome corpsalliances have turned theres off because the bldy things dont work right and havent since the day poses where introduced into the gameand only left anchored in the hope ccp will fix them
i would love to see the explosion that ensues you would hear the delightful sound from all over new eden
darth if you are not happy with your purchase you should get your money back takef your pos to the nearest station shouldnt be that hard in hisec and place it back on market to get your isk backhaving moons populated with anchored offline poses when some other players want to place poss and use it is a wasteif you want to use a pos then you should be required to keep it fueledi think my suggestion is pretty balanced if you would have a pos at a moon that nobody wants then you could probably go ahead and leave it offline but it could get robbedstolen or it could get destroyedmaybe its like renting corp offices at stations and there were just one time fee fo9r themthere is a limited ammount of moons and there is a limited ammount of offices if you dont pay for your office you loose it thats not unfair is it if it were so then a few players could rush to get all the offices and then sell them for a huge priceps i hope pray that cccp will change sov so that possmoons would no longer be a part of sov mechanism
from 575 would be spot on it might seem slight but in practise its make or break for the gallente ewar linea range buff would be welcome as well

mate reality check this is a titan he doesnt want it in amarr so he can make money off it 6070b worth of ship to make 5mhr mining veld he already has an ungankable ship he can do that in he doesnt mine veld for isk if he did hed have spent the money on the 60000 hulks he could have bought for the same price
this general discussion proposal is a the reraising of the ore redistribution proposal that was discussed on the 5th csm2 meeting on dec 20 it proposes a general discussion session with ccp on the topic of asteroid mining the issue was passed without discussionvotes 90  escalatedsupported by everyoneso the reraising of pos updating makes us look like children but its ok to raise ore redistribution again and was supported by everyone
no you are getting it entirely wrongfirst time bunyip raised it it was voted down this time it was voted for because of the fact the discussion was a request for us to discuss with ccp about miningits fundamentally different
whatever half the time i do not understand what is so bloody hard about saying to ccp to devote one damn dev blog on the pos issue  let them take their time and address the issues in order of significance lv i do not even understand what the hell you said above about a discussion about a discussion your defense of indefensible behavior is actually funny at this point the issue with the pos has been supported for over two going on three years by a huge number of players the fact that it still exists and is actively resurrected is reason enough for ccp to begin to address it granted for the first year or so it has just been myself and a couple of others who have been waking the thread up but for the last year it has gained momentum like no other what i have seen mostly from csm is pushing for individual agendas but what else is new i am sure eventually ccp will surprise the hell out of all of us and will actually say they have been working on redoing the pos for the last three years and have a final model soon
so you are blinded by the strawman put up by the person who faultiy pointed out something he didnt know a thing aboutlet me make it extremely clear for you1 bunyip raised an issue about miningores the csm thought it was a bad idea and told him to come back when he had something better2 bunyip came back still the csm couldnt agree with it the csm did however agree that it was an issue which warranted discussion with ccp thus the agreement to pass it
what does this have to do with the price of cheese or the defective pos system we currently enjoythroughout this thread the issue is constantly being direvrted we do not care that mining was discussed or that fitting tool will be revamped thanks those are nice issues now back to the pos system we would like ccp to comit to fix this give it a place on the agenda relevant to the communities desire to see this fixed relativly high and set a time table  schedule to get it doneanything else is deflection  yes blasters need fixing yes gallente need some lovin  blah blah blah ccp needs to quit deflecting and postponing this treat us with the same respect we treat our customers  clientsthank youtribe
if you notice people questioned an action done by the csm based on a strawman if i let that incorrect perception become a truth by not pointing out the obvious fault in the reasoning the csm is worse off
absolutely
i reject your reality and substitute my owncorrecting someone  staying on topic is possible all that is needed is the realization that the topic at hand is more important than the reputation of the csmgetting the flogged to death pos system pushed into ccps agenda and representing the players who placed you in the postion to represent them would demonstrate that the csm is not a waste but actually does benefit the communitynow how can you help me and the other players that are pushing for a revamp of the pos systemtribe
he cant it has become painfully apparent that lv wants to please ccp more than he wants to help the players unless of course the line in question coincides with his own sorry lv but i cant let you forget your own statement about appearing to throw a tantrum there are ways to push for an answer without appearing to be like a spoiled child as you put it it takes tact forethought and some degree of grace unfortunately i think some csm have indeed forgotten what they are there for to serve the greater eve community and not just some projects to make sure the eve community is respected and deeply needed changes brought to the attention of the ccp it is ok if ccp says no it is not ok if ccp just brushes csm off it is ok if ccp says no and gives thorough explanation and not just too hard and too much work so i just hope that eve players realize that and will push other csms to respectfully request a thorough dev blog on the current pos issue aka bunch of junk strewn in space aka the dead horse aka dead horse reduxthe more vocal the community the sooner ccp will realize that this issue will not just go away hey it has been around for a while 2 years  and going strong and the more csm might actually realize how badly we need the pos revamp until then keep on flogging
this thread deserves to stay on page one i wanted to train the nag but in its current state it is not worth putting more training time for an inferior ship the least it deserves is a large boost to cpu so it can fit a shield tank and damage mods without needing a fitting mod which no other dread needs
the upcoming tribune article should be required reading for anyone who has any influence to bring to bear on the log off abuse issue
while ill agree with you on thisim still of the opinion that if a neutral party remote reps or remote sensor boosts someone involved in a concord sanctioned war its giving the enemy an unfair advantage and thus should have their ship removedits cheating and some corps have made their rep using this lame ass tatic
ill settle for them getting aggression so the interfering alts cant dockjump for a minute after they stop repping
im not a topic and i support this awox alt

what does she need votes for now
as nice as it would be to have colored hulls im afraid that ccp has much more pressing issues not to mention im afraid this would create more lag than we need im supporting this idea however i believe ccp has more issues to fix before we bother with hullcoloring isaac
thisdont think it would stress ccp a lot to do it
wd be great
supported
support
well you people please stfu and get the hell off our board
yeah lets move it to amarr
so to entertain this jackass that and my corp needed to purchase an orca for cheaper than our local markets i went to jitahasnt really changed since i last visited my only complaint is its damn crowded other than that lag was minimal yes its there but not nearly as bad as it was the last time i visited jitawhich was about oh4 months backmaybe morethere where about 6 to 700 people in it at the timetons of freighters plus mine  o again dont go to jita unless you need too there are plenty of markets around
jita is fine as it is it might not be the cheapest but you can get almost everything in one spotalso jita lag is minimal when you compare it to the old days when its was almost unbearable currently the market works perfectly lag outside the station for me still exists but i couldnt be bothered less about that since im gone out of the system in 2 minutes
good on ya mate for pointing this out to ccp noone should feel discriminated against in a game for what they are irl especially if you have paid for said game this is your right as for the minority or softy arguments these are pretty immaturewe live in a society with rules eve exists within this society so it must abide by its rules and eve may be an international game but its devs are based in iceland and iceland has very strong anti discriminatory laws as for softy well it takes more guts to stand up for a minority than to side with the status quo
btw the immaturity of some of you people it truly astoundingseriously you guys need to get laidor at least leave your rooms once in a while and venture out into the real world
i too am gay
who the hell are youyou call us immature for pointing out the bull inherant in this proposalissuewhine and then you start your judgements go screw yourself pal the only discrimination i see going on in this thread is against the intelligent among the eve populationalso to your little remark about how no one should be discriminated against i guess you dont actually live in the real world where it happens every day to almost everyone in some wayall of you need to get some thicker skin and stop bumping this nonsense to the front page pushing genuine proposals back proposals which could actually make the game better thats what this board is for isnt itoh yeah and note the csm response amount of supports this thread is a troll period ill repeat myself if a mod reads this you should lock it its a mockery of the board
i believe something ought to be done about the emergency warp and its exploitation by people traveling through hostile areas ie traveling without a scout through lownull sec or traveling during a war something should be done about people who abuse the emergency warp to get out of such hostile engagements the remedy is to remove the emergency warp from player initiated warp scrambles or to start penalties against players who repeatedly abuse the emergency warp mechanic the below was a post in a thread i had made 
next time when your enter key is broken just dont postthe problem is that freighters disapear after 60 seconds  30 seconds gate cloak  not enough time to kill them that has nothing to do with ewarp
i for one like the ewarp mechanic its saved my ass from rats more than once when the client decided to crashcant say the same for my ceo who lost a ship when his client went poof

please get the flaming off this board this is for serious discussionokay maybe i need to be more clear about what i want to accomplish i want it to be so that people cannot join a corp thats at war with you attack you then leave the corp without consequences its stupid and exploiting the game mechanics they should have the 15 minute aggro timer like everyone else or not have war rights for 24 hours after joining a corp
i like game boxes  they look cool in the collection  so am thinking of buying the new eve box apohso my question is if i buy the box can i use the serial to add time to my account or do i need to make a new account to use the serial so the question is to wast money or not to wast money 
you can use the etc ingame and convert it into plex for any account you wishalso this is the wrong board qa is that way 
post with your main cowardprenerfed reasonable thumbs up
i agree making a skill queue a bit longer is a must i mean come on 24 hours at least let us make it 72 hours like the new deactivation timer on the accounts
from the information i have read so far you can do this needs confirmation though as i have not been on the test server
confirmed ive tested that before and it worksfyi this wont be a time sink if its just a rank 1 skill or something if you dont want it dont train it and stop whining
thatthis
im embarrassed for you
thought i was going to open this and find a good idea like give capital tractor beams to other capital ships but no
so what you are saying is that you have repeatedly asked me to answer a question that you know i cant answer because the information i need to answer it is under nda all i can say is this if her other ideas were as brilliant as custom ship paint jobs then yes we are all doomed are there any other unanswerable questions youd like me to take a stab at
yet again i dont care how you and your corp enjoy themselves im simply pointing out that keeping a casual family guild together for 3 years doesnt take any serious management skills i dont want you to get an inflated head with this new csm power you have acquiredthats a pretty convincing argument i think ill concede that point apparently those low sec miners were sneakier than i thought or maybe they just werent around when i wasthis is just another balance of points previously you said there wasnt much pvp in tadao because industrial corps had other stuff to do then when asked why you couldnt keep up with demand you make it sound like the buyers were at fault for wanting something quickly a week or more is a long time to wait for something like a bc or bsahh there it is i thought you had moved on what allies did we stab in the back again thats a new one as for foom gutting anything those rumors were completely false we left more than half our corp hangar contents with bruce when we split and handed over some corp owned towers which were being used to hold sov the only thing we took were a few members which were rl friends of some people in foomand dont worry im sleeping just fineapparently that info is under nda so i cant see it however as i mentioned above if its as good as custom ship paint im sure it will be groundbreaking in its enhancement of eve
we are a family wow i need to get more help with the chores around the house as to the csm powers i have aquired you still have no idea what the csm actually does do youwhen you are living in a pocket of 00 being told that this amazing alliance you helped formed will assure your safety and your pipeline to get key minerals not found where you are then you are at the mercy of these amazing combat types for three days prior to the freighter incedent bruce formed a blob actually went into the system where i had puchased minerals found only about a 15 to 1 ratio in their favor turned and ran i had an alt in the station and got to hear the pirates crack up over that so i took maters into my own hands made a reasonable business proposition to the locals a bruce got their shipsi have moved on there is no post in my forums saying i need revenge against bruce we would never waste a minute with something so wasteful and pointless as for the back stabbing lots of posts in coad at the time for anyone that wants to do some researchyou have repeatedly stated you already had evidence of things i have said to support your case now you are using my nda status to dodge that bullet give me a break put up or shut up niskin you cant site anything to make your case about my horrible csm influences you just want to hash over your sad panda melancholy caused by our continued success because if we arent something horrible and failing then you cant make your case that leaving us shows how smart you areissler
the reality of the matter is you are still posting because we have entertained your delusions delusions which you are now using a nda to cover up i will no longer entertain them and i encourage others to follow suit i have no further questions thank you for your input
i support this product andor service
a family guild is a concept not an actual collection of family members although technically they could be as for what a csm does so far they eat lamb sandwiches and attend meetings where they make suggestions to try and improve the game the lamb sandwiches might be optional thoughthats what i was looking for thanks for the explanation back in those days facing those opponents we did often have to run from fights when we had a numerical advantage they had more skillpoints and tougher ships along with better fittings we went to syndicate with the understanding that we were a severe underdog and we picked our fights because of it i still dont understand why you chose to deal with the pirates instead of raising the issue at the alliance rep level thoughok ill look for those before i comment on thative repeatedly stated that i have evidence thats funny i dont see that anywhere what i do see is myself repeatedly referring to things i pulled from the minutes and stating that based on those things and what i knew of you from the past that i was concerned with the kind of suggestions you were making on 00 issues
i hope u guys dun make fun of me while im offline
nexy said they do and then told me all the lil things you do that annoy him i mean gawd 
uhm havnt you already been voted like twice and you can only be on board like twice i know im ignorant about irrelevant matters and all but this smells coup
i told you those things in confidence how could you betray me like this
huh i thought that was the other thing sorry
like your rubber ducky samuele dont know how i managed to mess that up but i did
absolutely signededit  how about just for hisec as a trialtest lowsec you dont really need to wardec someone dreads
i suport this action
half way through and i have read enoughsecurity rating has no effect on the minerals in the system hello science astrogeologythe only factors that should effect mineral availability are mineral rights and system features such as differing types of stars and the gravity of planets moons and such
i think wormholes should just allow passage of combat capitals into hi sec this way the 00 players have a new incentive to interact with hi sec players i think it would really spice up the gamewoops edited to add support thumbs up

definatly think missle stats need to be reviewedstealth bombers and expecially bombs need some extra attentionon bmombs something along the line of explosion radius to 150 would give you a chance at poping a cruiser frigs would have to get out of area bs would be fine  5m isk a pop they should do some damage if people are within blast range currently your bairly scratching a frigates shields fleet fights it would encourage people to be spread out and you have the option still of killing the bomber or the bomb
indeed stealth bombers were crippled by the changes to missiles they badly need a bonus to explosion velocity andor an improvement to bombshowever have you noticed the lack of response from our much vaulted csms or ccp
funny i pop frigates with two volleys when i use 2 target painters dactually the nerf was a buff now i can hit small stuff before my missiles hit for 01 dmgif you want hit a speedy ship for full dmg use websnow gief me all your caldari carebears stuff plz you have no use for it this thread proofs it
signedi say hell no to the missile nerf being caldari aint easy these dayssigh
signed the amount of damage a missile does to another ship using a ab is just ridiculous
signedwe send pilots back to station to change out of their missile boat for pvp nowive given up with missiles and use t2 drones now i can run lvl4 missions in my spare time faster in a ishtar than a missile boat
not signed minmatar jocks now have a use for their target painter racial ecm bonus a target useing a afterburner will get smacked fairly hard by missiles if it is target painted and webed it wont be full damage but alot more than what a turret ship will be doing against the same target
i will sign this as who doesnt want their weapon of choice buffed but tbh i saw a minimal decrease in effectiveness of my missiles after the patch the only ships i have problems hitting for full damage are the ones i should have a problem with ie frigates with the cruise missiles
agree that the nerf needs to be though about atleast im sure ccp nerfed it for some reason but i dont think they did a good job with it this timei spent a bit of time away from eve about a year and wow did it hit me when i did my first mission before i left i could bust in and finish a mission 10 times faster than now
and it will be smacked pretty hard by anything else other then missilesremember missile boats 99 of the time need midslots fo tank  thats why people dont like caldari  now they need webs and target painters etc so now they suck 100new drake fit7x hmlwarp scram 2x web 2x target painter 10mn mwd4x bcunow it has ok dps and does max damage to cruiser and higher

kirth if you want people to take this thread seriously youll need to stop posting complete nonsense like above your comment on abfit bs was equally stupidhow about you look into some realistic ingame situations identify some specific problems and propose some solutions i suggest that you start with rockets or precisions
not signedmissiles were put back in line with other weapon systems thats allyou seriously think normal that you could hit target with torps which is supposed to be a close range weapon at 7080kms  noyou think normal that missiles in general should hit for 100 damage all the time  notracking is to guns what explosion velocity is for missilesthis wasnt a nerf at allat least for torpedoes it was a hell of a boost ok they reduced the range drastically but they could have left it that way istead they gave it a drastic rate of fire increase to torpssounds like a boost to menow you want to hit for more damage  fit a target painter and train signature focusing to 45see it like that  target painters is to missiles what tracking comps are for gunsthats itmy 2 iskand yes im caldari
missiles are really bad atm try hitting a angel bs rat abing to u in a 00 
signedfor the love of the tengu 
incorrect any movement from the target reduces damage even if transversal is 0 unlike turrets missiles will do less damage to a target coming right at them missiles need a lot work to be balanced when you couple flight speed with the long cycle times of launchers things just dont balance out
signedfix missiles please weve invested so much skillpoints in them its not funny
signed
signedi cant reliably kill anything small in my sacrilege now

find an eager minmatar rookie or any goon and place him in this now missile preformance shoots up a good bit teamwork is not hard or badreallyi have a thundering 12m sp in missiles and my cruise raven does just fine with a single t2 target painter training up the two target painting skills wasnt a total waste afterall only took two years for that to happenit is true outside khanid ships to use webspainters midslot tank may be sacrificed this is no different than the choise turret users have to make between tank and damagetracking mods in the lows missile ships get to be forced into some of the same hard choises turret ships deal with everydayhell missile users still have it easy no goofball tracking to worry about at all no ewar module that make said goofball tracking even worse nearly all the lows are free for damage modules from what i can tell no more doing 00 damage to things finaly the sp requirement to use a single missile system to the fullest is still far lower than its turret equivalent with all this you guys still whine and rage
thisthere are plenty of other points like a working antimissile weapon tds work great against turrets defenders do not that well against missilesmissiles are ok atm muzzling attempt  huh  
ive had a fair amount of experience lately with missiles being in the gallente militia and they are by no way underpoweredyes heavy missiles will do pretty low damage to me if i am afterburnering in a rifter but guess what thoraxs do 0 damage to me in that situationbut the bcu assault missile launcher caracal with lse that hurts a lot ab rifter with 200mm plate  repper or a 400mm plate cannot stand up to it for more than 30 seconds even when i am not webbed webbed i go down pretty hard a light ammo type getting bonuss on a cruiser thats pretty nicethose ams are even better than light neutron or ion turrets which i can actually get to miss me a lot with a 500m orbit if the other pilots ship is slow enough and i am not webbedmissiles are not underpowered by any means i fear caracals a lot more than i fear thoraxes

 thatmissiles are fine you carebear scum
well the only fix id see is to add some sort of collision damage independant from the usual basedamagetype damage which wouldnt be related to the known 4 damage types and would do significant damage to a target having a near0 transversal but high speed kinda
fix unguided missiles and give us target painters that actually match the range of cruise missilesand god damn yes i think it is fair a weapon system with delayed damage offers better range on a ship with range bonus then pulse lasers on a range bonused laser ship
one way to fix missiles would simply to increase the damage bonus form the warhead upgrades skill it currently only givng a bad  per level for such a high rank skillmake it 5 per skill elvel not 2 and it would all work out
1010 would lol again
as a naglfar pilotfix itanyone that suggests using an armour tank on this is crazythe thing does negligable dps with the 4 dmg modsdont take them awaysecondlyi would be fine with paper tank big teeth but instead its got paper tank no teethautocannons are not an alternative due to their optimal range on a capital class gun of like 8km between 515km depending on ammo even with acs fitted your dps still doesnt beat any other than the phoenix and you are 515km off the shield  ie instant webscram range of any ship as you warp off a pos and you have no tank
hi i also did all the training for the nag and nid now i am cross training to actually get a benifit for this charagreed all the ways8nt
found a post under warfare and tactics area of the forums where multiple freighter pilots openly admit this tactic
for everyone who has ever setup a pos this is totally understandablethumbs up from me
i am proposing for stations with repair services that you have the ability to just right click on the item in your hangar and repair it just like you have the option to reprocess itit would make life alot easier than having to scroll through all your items to find the one that does need to be repaired

yeah this is a broken mechanic i mean aside from hargaflemstickwhatever forgot his name already disbanding bob in couple mouse clicks there should something done even if a ceo wants to step down he has to name a new ceo i am not sure what should happen but a director should not be able to some crazy stuff like thati wonder how many alliances did some house cleaning on who are directors of their holding corps after this
this is really quite disturbing the mind of a reaver is a horrifying place
that would completely break ninja salvaging
suicide ganking is an intended game mechanic
no downside and sorely needed ignore the cvc fools this is an excellent idea and should already be implemented
the number of times i have wanted to be able to do this of have the person i am trying to contact have this ability is one that when added to the numbers of other people who have thought the exact same thing and wanted it would be innumerable
i foresee this being a welcome change and one that i could use
i like it as long as its restricted to corpprivatefleet channels also keeping it out of npc corps would be nice too
1 low priority
this is a stealth nerf for afk cloakers 
make it an option for each channel like the join audio dont see why this cant happen
i think this would be a nice feature for corp and alliance chat
i agree with this however eve is an mmo where low skill players can be victorious over players with actual skill due to the skill treadmill if when a war was declared and a player was suddenly limited a total sp cap while the war was active youd see actual pvp and not mmo losers griefing lowbies i am returning to fps pvp in eve interested me for as long as it took me to understand exaclty what pvp in an mmo environment meansif i made an mmo there would not be the concept of leveling or skills just you and your wits the landscape and mechanics at your command or someone elses what ever but not being able to pilot a ship the equivalent of your enemy even though you can afford it really destroys the illusion that there is even pvp in eve the reality is cvc character vs character and you know what i am actually thinking of taking another look at wow and seeing how it is coming along but i wont because i know that all that storyline npc quest crap will still be there so yeah axels experiment into mmos is over and the battlefields of armed assault 2 await me i will miss my corp mates but not the ass hats that made its such a struggle to enjoy eve and you know what its utterly hilarious sickly stupidly amusing that the upcoming release of walking in stations and new stuff that new players wont be able to use it really interested me but i realize that it wont get rid of the terrible problem with reavers that the empire authorities do nothing to stamp outive been eaten enough times i think i can lay my character to rest and stop feeding the reaver piranhas
resources are hard to come by and it is the reason for war declarations you people have no idea what the carebears are doing they are making your stupid pvp possible by supplying vast amounts of minerals ships modules ammunition and everything else to you only to get griefed and slammed for playing the hard game and running the eve economy the player i have quoted here is the perfect example of a reaver a totally mindless killer who casually refers to the destruction of the aspirations of other players as pew pewthis is why in rl empires were forged with the millions who banded together in order to defend themselves from swirling evil of pure chaoson the subject of swirling chaos when i visit nulsec and see all those untouched belts and realise the massive potential there but then attempt to speak to a local reaver gang and get chased off for spying so me and my carebear corp have to stay in highsec and be insultedso stupid so sad and all based on the ability of an old character to hide behind their char sheet and insult carebearshow about you bring it to an fps server and ill paint the server red with your unskilled rl minds slow reflexes and lack of instinct or you can do that to me either way its fun not like here
we need more war decz a corp can only currently have 3 war decz running ccp should at least double thiz to 6 i do not support your idea of a carebear heaven in hi sec dont turn eve into sim space
weve had this conversation a few times in my corp chat i usually kill it in its tracks when i tell people id paint my thorax flesh tonesi think there might be a reason they dont let us do that
1 ban the alts and trolls
those fuching inties 300km awayif i had the option to bring along a new role of ship that lets me snipe at things 300500km away i certainly would be nice
please stop posting
totaly agree
im sorrycan someone translate the op into something resembling human speech so i can figure out what hes whining about
dps and range in eve is akin to a slope graphmore dps  shorter rangemore range  less dpscurrently a 200km sniper is around 300 ish  rough  dps atmso think about the dps of a sniper at 300  kmthen think of the tracking issues
new ship roles often pull themselves out of the usual graphshictor is up to 30km infinite scramscram is 10km 2 pointsdisruptor is 24km 1 pointso new ship roles often are outside the usual
wait waiti can shoot things from 200km awaywhat do i need to do that
its all fake wtf this must be where i have been failing to understand all you people you think its real omfg sacre bleu these characters you are not roleplaying have access to computers millions of time more powerful that your crappy laptop and my awesome rig dont you think they would use thatinstalls new gpu and engages in virtual battle ground with crappy current technology and has funmy char would use his awesome high tech stuff for all sorts of awesome fun without turning valuable resources to space dustyours wouldnt because yours in a mindless reaver that should get told at a jump gate that heshe cannot access concord installations any more
oh how i love it finally miners are becoming harder to kill harder to gank and harder to outsmart pirate tears anyone theres more then enough1 why are you messing with miners2 for what reason other then griefing do you mess with miners3 what did that miner do to you4 orcas are the answer to griefers like you5 orcas are expensive for small corps6 not everyone in a corp is online at the same time7 not everyone can fly an orca or has an alt that can8 a killboard full of miners sorry a kill message something 9 really you just suck10 why arent you shooting other pirates again
i have no problem when it comes to killing macro minersone of the reasons i never mine alone is that very reasonim the one with the bestower following me wherever it goes  o pyou want to be a real pirate go to 00 and be a man  o i hear its lovely in delve this time of year
even if one couldnt put ore directly into an orcas hold the orca could simply anchor a secure can and sit right next to it in fact any stationary hauler can do the same thing and have been able to since secure cans have been around miners  secure can  hauler 100 safethis isnt anything new im afraid
if you dont understand the issue or are just going to troll please dont bother replyingholy crap theres a novel idea as a margin trader i could just stop going to the market capitol of the galaxy not sorry to burst your bubble but some people must go to jita to make money its not a matter of simply making slightly less its a matter of making any money at all 90 of the time jita is crowded for a reason if you fail to understand the reason then this topic isnt for you i would say more but your simply not worth the effort i mean seriously do you have some idea floating around in your head that people just go there for no reason at all god so bloody stupidbusiness class cable static ip 258mb sorry try again its a server side issue trust me i get paid to fix server issues and i write realtime network code as well so im pretty familiar with the topicive found that the system is pretty usable up to around 850 people try going there when theres 10001200 people and youll see what i mean and just to reply to the inevitable but naive statement yes its common it happens every single day during the servers peak hoursguys this isnt a terribly complex issue its not a mater of trying to change peoples behaviorgood luck with that its simply a mater of spreading the people out more and you do this by giving people an equal choice as i described above it can be done by having a circle of systems around jita that are interlinked and market shared this way players going to jita for social reasons will tend to go to the center jita and us traders the vast majority of people in the system can just visit any one of the surrounding linked systems
dont go to jitaproblem solved
you do not simply spacewhale into jita
poor baby you really are one sad little idiotseriously you dont have to go to jita it is not the end of the world if you cant make that extra million iskif you cant be discerning enough to understand that the market can easily be shifted around away from jita and that everyone here would be more than happy to buy your crap for less than the jita market every so slightly you just might make more moneyoh im sorry you dont have a brain i guess i cant expect you to think before you speaknevermind
ive written a multiuser clientserver market analysis application in c with igb integration thats now grown to around 5000 lines long it aggregates data in real time from any combination of usersusers choice permissions based etc on the system as well as evecentral the mysql database only tracks current market conditions as opposed to historical datasince im only worried about buying something somewhere and selling it immediately somewhere elsethis is not a debate i am telling you that there generally are no other options unless you want to fly amok all over highsec trying to find enough goods to make a decent profit remember its not only a mater of price its a matter of volume often its simply not possible to find enough volume of something to get a reasonable portion of your capitol into product to ship outside of jita not always true but frequently true sure if your just an occasional buyer looking to buy some ship or something theirs plenty of small volume deals out there but if you want to buy a ton of something its very likely going to be in one of the market centers and more often than not in jitathe generation of market centers is inevitable unchangeable human behavior so long as you have to transport goods from one station to another and so long as you have regional markets that should not be changed either since it works very well this is not wow after all where things can be instantly moved anywhere the solution is to make jita better as i told you before its not 1 mil difference its often 1020 mil difference in final profit or even the ability to make anything relevant at all im not going to do 30 jumps for 3 million profit obviously traders go to jita because its profitable and worth it for them to do it if they had a reasonable alternative they wouldnt and i dont when i doyou have not given one solution besides dont go there as such your just a trollheres a possible real solution
so you can write 5000 lines of codewhoopee im an it professional too and that means crap to meso other than inflating your pompous ego i got 2 words for youalliance tournamentread the bloody news posts about thatin case your too stubbron to looka corp decided to raise the market prices on several key peices of equipment they went all over new eden and successfully cornered the marketif a single player can do that anyone can do thatyou buy your product elsewhere and you keep buying it elsewhereyou sell it elsewhereyou dont need 5000 lines of code to do thatstop going to jitathat is not a debateits a fact
your comparing apples to oranges here buying up large quantities of something in order to raise its price requires vast sums of capitol certainly more than most people have including me honestly im not even sure what your suggesting at this point you recognize that jita has a population issue yet you are just saying dont go to jita this isnt about me even if it was an option for me to go elsewhere all the time which it isnt it still wouldnt solve the problem jita would still have the same issue im suggesting a real solution to a real problem we both know that telling people to gtfo isnt going to solve it it never does additional infrastructure is the key if you have a better solution feel free to suggest itim not posting in assembly hall because i want someone to fix some issue specific to me im posting because this issue will at any given time be affecting around 1 in 35 people
how can i spell it out for you people to understand it its so easyjita is jita because the market is there people use itso stop using teh frakking market and go elsewhereits not rocket science even a kid can figure it outso your spending a few million isk more than you want whoop de frakking do the isk is easy to make up so make up a few more and deal with itor build your own damn marketthe example is to point out how easy it is to manipulate the marketso stop being a penny pincher and a lazy ass and just get to itif i can do it so can youi didnt have to go to jita to buy an orca we could have easy made up the extra 50mil in rens to buy it instead we wanted one right awayyou can make suggestions until your blue in the face the market is player driven and controlled so be a player and move away from jitastop going there
just stop if you dont have a response to the problem that would actually solve the problem for everyone then theres no need to reply any more your statements are off topicthere are plenty of ways to make money without going to jita nobody is arguing that there are plenty of ways to make money that do involve jita however and some people are there for other unrelated reasons as well regardless of the reason there are 915 people in jita 22 of eves total population right now that have decided that its worth it for them to be there for one reason or another many of those people are in transit so the actual  of people that are effected during a day of gameplay is going to be much higher this topic is about improving the experience for those people
amazing thread i am sure to have already read the first 7 posts verbatim several times about the op idea so you want several system with linked markets for your convenience at that point can we ie the rest of eve players get the same feature in our regional hubs or it will be only a caldarijita prerogativei operate near amarr it would be nice to use stations 1 system removed from it to build stuff and sell it in the whole hub same for reins and heck or oursulaert at that point why hubs would be the only system to benefit for a so nice feature make villore a hub i can build items in artant and sell in low sec in old man star without problems intant transportation through a dangerous hi seclow sec gate without troubles with the militiato put it simply no instant transportation of your stuff so that it can be sold in several system at the same time without any risk or work
as you point out you certainly would not want to have instantaneous transport of items between points of interest venkul mul i agree with your general sentiment entirely however i think this general idea could be laid out in such a way that doesnt give anyone an advantage or added safety its basically just taking jita as it exists and splitting up the traffic in to more manageable portionsan arrangement of systems like this should only be used where server hardwaresoftware performance cannot keep up with the demand i go to the other economic centers frequently too like amarr i have not seen their populations high enough to cause problems yet if amarr did start having 900 people consistently then you certainly could use a similar model to help distribute the load there as wellthe diagram i made isnt perfect it would have to be remade by the devs to ensure that the traffic flowed through it naturally and as intended however marketers shouldnt be getting any real advantage distance wise with this setup the number of hops from point to point doesnt really change if your visiting a border system the only systems that would have shared markets are systems abcd and jita not any further than thatthe starmap surrounding the jita area remains exactly the same
drake draconis you fail at life so have to spend your time being an ass on forums
posting with an alt  epic fail
omg so agree reavers argrhh the reavers
1 why notvery low priority
lets say i put bait in the belt in some low sec systema silly little pirate pulls in and starts shooting my poor bait our blob jumps in and clobbers the pirate taking no lossesevery single person who shot that ship or even ecm the ship takes sec hit and since he never got to shoot anyone else he gets killrights on themseems broken to me tbhsame also works in reverse the bait is the one who first aggros same result
you sure because if he goes global to shoot you that means he is fair game to everyone elseon another note it should not pop up with the usual you will take sec hit  be concorded blah blah window if you are shooting someone you have killrights on
considering the large number of stupid ideas he comes up with its likely he never reads either
you are discriminating people with homophobia people with irrational fear for homosexuals should also be allowed to express their feelings by trying to ban peoples nature you are doing the same offence you claim to be offended by ten thumbs down
sorry i should have checked the paragraphs before posting have editted it and made it a bit more readable nowtheres obviously a bit of confusion about how ewarp works and what we want changing about it we still want ewarp just if you happen to get tackled during the ewarp then you should gain the aggression timer and stay tackled for the 15 minute duration ive outlined ewarp currently works belowif you have an agression timer and are warp scrambled you will stay in that spot for 15 minutes then warp  disappearif you have an agression timer and are not warp scrambled you will be warped to a safe spot where your ship will wait in space for 15 minutes before disappearing during this time it can be probed outif you do not have an agression timer and are warp scrambled you will stay in that spot for 1 minute then warp and disappearif you do not have an agression timer and are not warp scrambled you will be warped to a safe spot where your ship will wait in space for 1 minute before disappearing during this time it can be probed outnow as far as ratting  missioning goes youre going to have an agression timer anyway so will remain warp scrambled for 15 minutes if rats warp scramble you if they do not then you will be warped off to a safe spot for 15 minutes thats fineif someone disconnects during warp or whilst mining without a timer then theyll be warped to a safe spot for 1 minute thats fine toowhats not fine is when someone jumps a ship with a large buffer through gates then upon finding themselves in a hostile environment disconnect their client deliberately which leads to them being tackled for one minute before being warped off in a real situation if theyd stayed connected they would have been destroyed if they had aggression and were disconnected they would have been destroyed why the difference what we want is for ships tackled during the emergency warp to remain tackled for 15 minutes otherwise emergency warp is fine as is
me shakes head and walks away grumbling
balancing stuff  new stuffi agree except that ccp are implementing things like t3 without rebalancing things for the lower endi would rather have new low end stuff that have it ignored like it currently isalso the harbinger has 7 turrets give the hurricane its 7th turret back  
i would have especially liked to have been able to pilot a transport that could at least have the power to drive off a lone frigate as a destroyer can and i was especially incensed by players destroying my cargo never with the intention of stealing it as a real pirate would so id like to see a transport with about destroyer level weapons there are enough pvp ships adding more pvp ships would add nothing to the gamei just canceled my subscription because i was destroyed again by a player who obliterated my cargo with no intention to steal it so work on ship balances may have helped retain my patronage
forgot to support more t1 ships i might point out the clash between galleons and frigates in rl as an example for my post
well this might just be my missionrunner povbut generally speaking caldari and amarr space are fine when it comes to missionhubs  both factions have access to multiple system with decent quality agents or medium quality agents in 0506 surrounded by highsec which rewardwise is rather equal to having a q18 agent in a 0708minmatar on the other hand got a serious congestion problem with dodixie as their only good highsec l4 system yes there are others but they either have lowsec borders  or are lowmedium quality agents in too high secstatus systems meaning the iskhour factor is too low to make it worthwhilegallente is a bit like the matari but not to the same degreeand yes motsu is a notorious laggy missionhub but the caldari state has a halfdozen corporations with l4 agents in solid highsecno low sec borders meaning that the problem is more a case of lemmings than actual congestion
we dont need more systems we just need less macro miners

i disagree the ingame courier system is fine the only problem with it is the players
with a modular pos system we could some day have ambulation on our own stations
we could have alliance buddies with there own corp hangers in our poses with full access to labs etcastro farms farm modulesoilplant seeds   1 oxygen use per hour cattle farms ccp could develop it in many ways if ccp is interested in changing sov to industry based this is the way to go
signedi have a suggestion or two1st new skill hack equipment  requires anchoring v and hacking v allows use of advanced equipment codebreaker reduces hack time by 10 per level2nd new equipment  advanced equipment codebreaker i ii requires hack equipment skill iiv t1 version acts as codebreaker also allows access to anchored secure containers criminal flagging as per can flipping on any attempt base time to access container 30 seconds times size of container small secure  1 medium secure  15 large secure  2 giant secure 3 cannot hack structures t2 version as per t1 reduces base time for containers to 15 seconds allows hacking of anchored structures that are offline such as an out of fuel out of reinforced mode pos and associated equipment base time is 1000 seconds times size of equipment small rail  1 medium  2 etc hangers and labs would be a 3 control towers would start at 4 for a small tower and ramp up would be ciminally flagged and would give kill rights to entire target corp for 1 week per attempted hack to run similtaniously ie  you hack a tower and 2 labs they have 3 kill rights on you for the next week this will get rid of the clutter in space solve the problem with macro miners provide some high sec piracy etcalso perhapse modify the electronic attack ships to allow them to attempt to hack a pos in reinforced mode using the above gear  skills this will spice up alliance play i imaginejust some thoughtstribe
arazulachesis definitely need to get their ew looked at i think a optimal range bonus similar to the falcons would bring it in linearazulachesis dampening the 200km falcons bringing them closer to the fight would be something before you flame i fly falcons parazulachesis are still very decent pvp ships for closemedium range stuff very situational but no more or less so than the other recons
i honesty doubt ccp sometime when they say they will see how it goes and make adjustments later rsds have been a dead horse for over a year now and falcons rule the roostplease take some action on this
support xmy suggestionchange arazulachesis dmg bonus to a falloff bonusarazulachesis should be able to damp falcons inside falloff range of damps not up to 250km becausecaldarilong range and ecm chance based

sir you are a genious
hello  sumbarines in space  shots going through solid matter  orbiting causing you to miss as much as it causes your target to miss  asteroids materializing in belts out of thin air two times a week its called game balance as opposed to realismbetween the two realism is the first to be abandoned if a balance cant be struck between them
for what he provides to eve community and indirectly to ccps collective wallet grant him this wish
i read this interview with ccp hammer and thought of this issue
yeah nice article if you fought for us this hard wed have a new pos system by late next week
this is exactly it actualy its what ccp thinks is best and the csm can only influence minor things thats why persisting on the pos redesign is important fancy new features have precedense over fixing important game mechanics  great game design 
signedim running into that problem alot now that i have my raven 
signed for the love of god please give us our missiles back

remember to check the box if you agree
agree with what theres nothing to support here no proposals no arguments nothing  its just a hopelessly vague generic whine threadif threads like this are to be taken seriously you need to identify a problem prove that its a problem then offer solutions i suggest that you start with precisions and rockets start a thread on each in features and ideas
my post is very relative to how missiles are nowi know about precisions and rockets hop in you drake or whatever and bump a battleship and watch your damage drop the point of the topic still remains you might not like my sarcasm but well thats how i talk sometimes
kirth a ham drake does full damage with rage to a webbed abing hurricane

signed
a webbed abing hurricane is like a hurricane without an ab unwebbedso you agree to me nonconstructive post then utility is a must for missile boats now the range advantage of missiles is not so much an advantage anymore cause you have to web people and dont say have someone in gang in some webbing ship some of us still fly solo missile boats need lowslots to increase damage to par with guns now they need midslots for utility like the other ships often use aswell but dont you see the problem here not like caldari was so great for pvp before anyway now it had to be nerfed harder and now its even less great for pvp and pve read what everyone is sayingsaid i should say something constructive not just a sarcastic whine i did ill repeat it in a sec
here
oh god missile range advantage became stronger because ships got slower and range became more meaningful plus missile boats are now able to defend that range advantagedrake has always had to web its target to stop it just mwding off and laughing at youqr was a boost to missile pvp remember missiles doing 01 damage to anything 4 kmsbut why am i bothering to write this you havent got a clue about game mechanics or missile pvp as your drake lolfit shows i cant believe that youre whining about not always doing 100 damage when this didnt happen before qr anyway
ah but as ccp say minmatar are versatile and can speed tankUFFFDUFFFDsigned the minmatar capital like many other minmatar ships need a rebalance
supported
this is very true my nag in siege doesnt need to even run reppers it mitigates soo much damage by its amazing speed tank17 pages and still no real response other then ccp will take it into consideration when they review cap ships
now mixing heat damage with the new repair system means motherships become more proactive as mobile bases of operation as do friendly titans titan effects are crippling without being obnoxiously devastating titans moms defensein addition to the change in dds roles i think the titans need to get a defensive bonus and yet another hp buffer for motherships just a hp buffer rather than siege which seems to be the popular quick fix idea my solution is to add the common 25 resist or 375 active repairs to each ship in accordance to their race however for each lvl of titan add an additional 5 to the primary enemy damage source so for an avatar that would be 25 resist with a 50 bonus at lvl 5 for explosive damage to date tanks have never saved a titan they havent even prolonged them titans are either ganked or not lost its just that simple motherships are even worse because theyve had more opportunities to be on the field with dreads active their problem is before anything can be done to save them a few dozen dreads can drop them without issue so for motherships a hp buffer is more geared to allow better spider tanks simply put there has to be more reason to justify their cost we know there is a change coming to 00 sov mechanics its probably going to be on par with the nano nerf in its severity at the moment a motherships last saving grace is its affectiveness under a cyno jammer when thats removed what will it have left give it hp give it docking and fleet jumping give it repairingapocrypha effects on these changesone of the beauties of these ideas are how they work with t3 docking inside capitals can open the doors to reset ships at a mobile base not just refit them but rebuild them on site some wormholes allow motherships in currently so i say increase the potential to allow titans in but remove pos structures and cloaking for all ships except recons this means capitals become the foreground bases of operations in wormholes yet why risk a titan if you cant cloak it thus creating the balance between economies of scale carriers and rorqs become just as effective and useful just with smaller capacities for shipscargo local changes mean youll never know these ships are present which creates the discovery of a lifetime opportunities for pvpt3 also receives a bonus to heat damage reduction meaning 1 doomsday under the proposed mechanics cannot incap its modules even if the effect lands it actually creates more of a purpose for the introduction and implementation of t3 designs and its future development it creates a logical purpose for why its needed
more asinine ddd change ideasddd is dumb idea dont fix it get rid of the goddamn thingand you just grouped together a bunch of ideas so even if we agree with one of them we arent gonna thumbs it
i like the fixes main reason being as you said it keeps doomsdays as a useful fleet weapon without removing the need for a fleet
rl is hitting me hard so i just cant find time to finaly finish my supercap proposalhopefully i will have it all summed up in next few days so i will raise it together with your thread we share similar views thoanyway stay tuned d
supercaps are not allowed in wormholes otherwise the only thing i support is the changes to the mothership the titan changes still suck it pretty much nullifies the whole point of them so please try again isaac
please change something with the way u put poss up
a repair all button wouldnt be horrible neither
oh god im agreeing with him
signed
loving this idea
csms should be doing something useful like giving their opinions on the missile nerf rather than ing around with this
retro mike  oh so you are the one who chooses what is useful and what is not i thought that csm members have their own brains if you dont like it vote next time
ahh check out the huge missile petition and the lack of any csm responseenough said
ok i agree that csm reaction to missile petition is more important but i think that this proposition is useful
please get this in
go away troll your cross postingand the csm doesnt give a rats ass about your stupid missile whines eitherbe a man and fit a target painter like everyone else or get a tacklerworks wonders i hear
yeah missile nerf is fine and this is the wrong thread for complaining about it makes you look stupid also if no csm wants to support it dont you think there is a reason why its fine learn to playanyway i support this topic isaac
loved it so much you wouldnt even give it a thumbs up
duh there you go added the thumbs upi might just try and raise this issue at soonest possible meeting
nice useful to the point supported
the thing is do you really need to boost them is there really people who arent using the ship now because of these thingsthe real stuff we need to be allowed is cansgo watch one of the farjung wannabe vids how they manage their cap the cap800s are in a can giving him 12 more caps which could mean win or losei cant see why we need drones in the cargo they can go in the carriers corp hangar bubbles should be fineliquid ozone is the giant one used for cynos jumpbridges etcetc such a major one
or instead of just allowing two or three items you mentioned they could just allow anythingof course people are using the ship despite these drawbacks does that mean the whole remote corporate hangars thing isnt terrible in its current state nopeople use it because its all there is all the op is asking is that ccp give us a break now that theyve made untouchable jump freighters
lots of thing in eve have a stasis period and some are more neededlogical than others but this should certainly have such a cooldown period its just not logical to not have it in place
i dont support this because of bob but because of unbalanced mechanics
broken mechanic needs fixing should have at least a 24 hour timer and automatic post in alliance mailedit helps if i tick the support box
remove all risk of metagaminghell no its  like this that makes eve so ing awesome just the possibility is enough to make a spy dream of grandeur
not far enough salvaging or looting any wreck by anyone is the desecration of a war grave and should provoke an immediate concord response
after m10 this wont really be that feasible any morebut id be quite happy for trial players to be automatically restricted from any act that would cause concording
i know this isnt intentional but this reads like some sort of horrible local law that is written intentionally obfuscated anyway made me chucklei dont not support having no loan loopholes
i oppositley oppose this
that is going toalready causing issues and to be frank im not happy with how rl cash has an effect on gameplay like that no real idea on how to solve this without further knowledge on the subject cba with rmt etc but it does need to be looked intoon an unrelated note as i see it lavista is one of the few csm that operate within the spirit of the csm idea and has been doing so for 2 terms now well done didnt vote for you nor actually know you but it has to be said
i honestly dont know what ccp can do about itfrom ccps point of view person 1 transfers large amount of isk to person 2 which gets the flag off they look at person 1s transactions and discover that it isnt rmt person xfering tons and tons of isk all the timebeyond that what can ccp doi guess you could sue the person in small claims courtdoes that mean rmt can claim that its all happening in rl no
so when somebody is that stupid to send you money for an in game loan you can keep it since its a giftif you want it back try to go to court and see what gives
as i illustrated briefly in the linked thread all while quite merrily intoxicated im inclined think that keeping the status quo is the best way to handle this rather than make a fuss to ccp about it in the hope theyll write something else down for us to abide by if people are already performing loans of ingame isk with rl money held as security then im not going to get myself up in arms over it as far as im concerned it just makes it easier for isk to move around inside the economy if for example someone has an idea to generate ingame profit but cant raise the capital quickly enough via more traditional means which are already accepted by the community in order to exploit the time critical window of opportunity which has been identifiedif anything im further inclined to think it acts like gtc trading  as an incentive not to use the rmt websites we have to put up with being spammed towards ingame and which are also probably behind most account theft and hacking reported it may not be a huge incentive but i think anything that draws business from those sons of es is a good thinghoweverif such exchanges are in fact being or were to be performed with the intent to rmt instead i dont see how legislating against this particular method will curtail rmt in any worthwhile fashion legislation is great until it falls down in the face of being unable to be enforced effectively or fairly and in this case i think responsible enforcement by ccp will be difficult to say the least  especially when intermediaries could act as escrow agents within private player arranged organisations hint hintthat being said i know virtually nothing about the tools ccp wield and the methodologies they indulge in to sniff out rmt malefactors all i know is that i think it will be impractical  an edict with all the authority of those little please do not walk on the grass signs in the park while almost every beat cop in town whod write you up for doing it is legally blindmeanwhile and as i have said previously changing the eula to proscribe against rl securities being used in ingame isk loans strikes me as snapping off an evolutionary branch from the tree because were afraid of the thorns it may develop once it has grown and matured i dont think we should be preemptively pruning the development of the economy like that  on a whimespecially in this game and especially when the rl securities themselves are completely outside the control of ccp anywaywhich is probably why the thread linked almost immediately got this as a concise response anyway
i think ccp should retain its current stance of not directly covered by the elua i think they should do this for several reasons which ill just lay out right here1 unenforcable2 premature3 outside of the scope and responsibility of the companyif people want to secure in game assets with rl currency  items then there is literally nothing ccp can do to stop it catching rmt people is hard enough as it is and is in most cases probably based around speculation can ccp prove without a doubt that if joe recieved 10 billion isk from fjaakj for a single tritanium that it was an rmt no they cant and it clearly is now lets imagine some semi reputable player does a loan based on rl assets can ccp now prove to the degree of issuing a ban even internally that joe recieved 10 billion isk from sally for real life assets i doubt that as well
its called common senseif people dont have brains enough to figure that out they deserved to get ripped off
its not so much that they can get ripped off dont care about that its more the fact that with this method tradingfavours rmt and metagaming can prosper beyond control even more than now
the reason to explicitly state that it would be forbidden is that more or less its not really a form of rmt its more a form of isk laundering for ill gotten gains rmt and exploits

i would like to see something similar implemented when it comes to caod from other side i dont agree with banning internet from caod 1st of all ccp rule which is disallowomg members of corps purely founded to post on caod is kinda blury if certain group of players wants to play this game purely to post on caod its their right as long as they pay subscription also there is much much worse smack flame offtopic spam posts from average john does from all alliances then from internet guys anyway caod should be moderated heavily either by mods or by some mechanic similar to something scagga mentioned ps i dont have char in internet

the corporate hanger does not store ship the ship maintenance bay stores assembled ships the corp hanger on an orca stores stuff ore mined by the miners is dropped in the corp hanger which is moved by the orca pilot from the corp hanger into the cargo hold of said orca which means the orca pilot while not doing much i suppose cant really be afk for extended periods of timeif u wanna talk about 100 safe then moan about 100 safe haulers for empire the blockade runners even in 00 i imagine they are very hard to catch if the blockade runner has 2 braincells to rub togetheriow adept or dieps i suck  quoting
ive bolded the part that breaks your own argumenthow can something be 100 safe but have a exception or did you just decide to ignore it
they are being organized by doing so so why dont you stop whining and be organized as well bump them away from the orca
i mentioned this in my post on mitigating jita lag however it got a little lost in the discussion it stands alone as a suggestion so i will repost it herehaving only one vector that ships leave stations on creates a perpetual traffic wreck of ships outside busy stations ships crashing into each other at station exitfixing this is fortunately easy simply add numerous exit vectors from stations and use them in a roundrobin way this ensures some spacing between ships allowing them time to get to warp the exit portal graphics are large enough to accommodate this without changes
this has already been posted in another thread not yours its questionable if its a good idea or not although i would like to see it i think ccp has more issues to fix than station undocking isaac
its a small issue but it should be a very easy one to resolve helps immersion too seeing all these ships crashingbouncing into each other is rather unseemly
i dont like this  its immersionbreaking every station has a fairly obvious docking area ships exiting from random locations that are not near the docking area would just be strange i would like to have some sort of traffic control information available to a pilot who is in dock an airplane taking off from an airport has information about the location of other planes in the area a space station should be able to relay basic information to the captain of an ship prepped for undocking about the ships outside the station
thumbs downhaving a docking vector requires people to be aware which is goodit rewards the prepared in many ways
you misunderstood it would be at the same location the docking area but instead everyone of exiting the station on the exact same line they would exit using several different lines the docking area is very large so everyone is still going to be flying out of it like they are now but instead of flying out of it along the same line knocking into each other immediately on exit exiting within each others ships etc there will be some proper separationthis essentially could be looked at as a minimal amount of exactly that im a pilot actually air traffic controllers job is to maintain separation between aircraft and its the pilots job to obey the traffic controllers when in controlled airspace a decent analogy would go like this right now we have one runway leaving the docking bay this proposal would create multiple more runways leaving the docking bay which would then be used alternately
yes yes yes yesim tired of looking up the tailpipe of a freighter or some jackass in a battleship camping the stationsupportedand im not talking in front of the station 360 degrees of exit vectorsif we can enter the station in 360 we can exit it the same way
its good to know we can agree on something on basic principal so im reluctant to even post a reply i would like to point out however that 360 degrees of exit vectors around the station exiting randomly anywhere around the station just like you can enter it if i understand you correctly would essentially eliminate station campers wouldnt it im not a combat pilot yet but i think the range of a station end to end would pretty much make it impossible since that would change some game mechanics i would suggest that it would be hard to gain consensus forhowever looking up the tailpipe of freighters so to speak certainly can be eliminated easily without changing any game mechanics
figured this would be a good place to ask this could we ask ccp to institute a policy of dating the subject lines in the information portal this would make it easier to find the most recent post about a topic i guess it gets old seeing 90 of the post with new in the subject when i go there just replace new with the date that it gets posted
the newest sticky post we make is almost always listed on the bottom of the sticky threads area but the index page by design shows who last posted in the thread
more than most other games the meta gaming aspect of eve is much amplified however only the forums are available out of game to access ones evemail one must log into the game clienti would like to propose the creation of an eve online messenger eomobjective of eomto enable access to the characters eve mail mailing lists buddy list and select channels ingame while not having access to or not being able to open the full eve online clientthis will allow eve online players to stay incontact with the rest of the player base when not ingame being able to respond to mails and chat with otherspossible problems1 being able to access all channels while ingame can lead to abusement by using messenger clients to scout locations using localto combat this the usage of this client should also disallow the participation and access to location specific channels like local and constellation2 the player using this client is in a state of for better lack of a word undeadness neither online nor offline to correct this a new online in messenger status will have to be created this might be the biggest stumbling block as i do not think that ccp might have anticipated the need to have more than 2 values for onlineofflinewould appreciate any comments and further ideas
sure we can also have a evespace and evebook to go with it and dont forget you can always have evetwitter well actually that last one didnt work out too well so scratch that

thanks for the heads up looks like the function i hope for is already in the workshadnt seen that particular vid yetdo hope it arrives soonerconsidering that spammer dont usually get entry into corps i fail to see how spam will increase since most of it is limited to localunfortunately its abit difficult for everyone to be on that program but thanks for the linkwell i guess its in the works so the point is abit moot however to state my problem i do find it abit difficult to get contacts of people who are in a public channel hence my wish for this functionthis leads to me sometimes having the client open just for the chat function just thought ill explain my rational for wanting it
im going to say no although i heard ccp was creating something cosmos apparently i just dont see the need for it but if ccp does then all the power to themisaac
sorry but to me your reply sound exactly i dont want to implement instantaneous transport but i want it implemented when it suites me look again what i wrote your idea would be linking several stations with all the production facilities in them allowing in reality for a multirace multicorp researchproduction mega station instead of paying for the rent of a office in jita 44 a corp could rent a office in new caldari for a fraction of the jita cost probably with building facilities at hand and supply the hub without any problem the cure seem way worse than the malady
and he calls me a moron implied for my suggestion of shopping somewhere elseits a player driven market so start competing with jita and get everyone to start selling product for less than the jita marketits perfectly valid suggestion its easy if you get off your lazy ass and do it that isjita will be always be as laggy as you claim it to be as i dont see the problem from my end and im on a crappy 15mbs connection herei always love it when players sell products for less away from the market hubs its quite refreshingbut when you refuse to do that you make the problem worseyour idea makes a simple problem a very complicated oneas it was already pointed outas a programmer even you should know that the kiss principle is very importantprogramming 101 keep it simple stupidmarket hubs are created by players not by the game you could kill jita lock it down tax it chain up the stations 3 systems around blah blah blah it will sprout up somewhere elseccp wont do a damn thing about it because it would require changing the game mechanics to such a degree as altering a well rooted database and for someone who claims to be an expert in programming you obviously have no idea what your getting yourself intoall ccp will do is increase the bandwidth load and cap a player population limit in jita and they already have done thatand sorry to say but your outnumbered here we dont see the lag so either your infected with a virusspyware likely as most people think they are safe when they are not or your cable is fracked overuntil you get it through your thick skulls you wont get me to budge an inchthats why its not a debate or up for discussion its a factagain stop going to jita when other people catch on it will be no busier than rens or hek or any other market hub
i was probably too harsh i just find it irritating when people belittle a topic instead of working with it instead of discussing the topic i spend a bunch of effort explaining why i know what im talking about what you do in game no doubt works for you and there are plenty of ways of making money that do not involve jita as you pointed out there are others that do and as long as its financially worth going to jita or wherever it may be they will and this problem will remainnew caldari would not be linked with jita as it wouldnt be one of the new load balancing systems however thats a good point anyway what would be wrong with simply not permitting research production etc at any jita linked system then if thats not an option you could also make it such that any linked station is essentially the same station therefore you wouldnt have an ability to have multiple offices production queues etc it would all just be the same place so you wouldnt be able to exploit ityeah and this is likely the simplest approach naturally it would be much better if they could optimize the code further to support more players or add more hardware however both have likely already happened its more likely that eves current design only scales on a per system basis for example the eve server likely allows a single server to handle multiple star systems but it probably does not allow multiple servers to service a single star systemtherefore i would speculate that they have one really fast kick ass server dedicated to jita and despite this it is still getting into a situation where the load is too much so the options are to either keep the existing design and use ingame methods to better distribute the load as this suggestion outlines or to change the design to allow better scalability within a single system much much harder there is a 3rd option but i dont like it and i doubt anyone else does either you could instance jita that would be really lame though drastic measures like rewriting bits of server code in c could also be thought of but ccp would hate that idea too since it would be a major undertakingexactly which is why you have to deal with the problem as it existsgo there when theres 1100 people in the system and tell me that its a bit like a black hole at that point have fun getting back out lol
i have and the only problem i have is getting through the mass of ships not the internet connectionyour jumping at shadows your indicating theres a problem with the system when the problem is rooted by the very players who control the marketyou want a solution move the market diversefy it spread it out make the players push harder for markets in backwater stations spread it aroundjita is not the problem its the people who are creatures of habbitfixing the system will not workyou already have obviously indicated your acknowledgment of this its like saying theres a problem with wardecs and there is but asking for a solution to the problem with an amorphous idea is like pouring gas on a fire and everyone learns real quick those who tryeven myself that the problem is far more complicated then they ever imaginedyou need to keep it very simpleand asking ccp to rig the system for your so called favor is going to be shot down quicker than warp driveyou need to push for a more diverse market get the players to shift there goods of sale and there buying power elsewhere perhaps skills that let you purchase your goods and have them shippedat that point its a pointless matter of where you place products shipping of course should have a fee attached and possibly able to be intercepted by pirates to keep our friendly yarrers who are rabbid and foaming at the moutheven then put the freighters to work and have them ship the goods on behalf of npcs for standingsthere are far better ways to go about this but having jita rigged for the sake of jita lag is not the answer
bad idea again1 jita is jita between other things because it has 14 stations in system with 6 stations with factory facilities2 adjacent systems see another 18 so stations with factories3 jita and the adjacent systems have stations controlled by several different corporations even if all caldari or jove i all the stations would become the same station the net result would be1 24 industrial stations will become 1 with a net loss in production capabilities2 the players that have raised standing to get a lower station tax with corporation that arent caldari navy will lose the bonus3 the offices in something like 50 stations i havent spent the time counting them will become those available in 1 stationdoing that would probably kill jita as a trade hub even if that didnt happened it would inconvenience greatly a lot of people on the flipside jita lag is generally bearable so dont break what is working decently edit please link those images they are breaking the forum formatting
just have each jita load balancing system be functionally identical to jita with each station linked with its counterpart no standings issues no increase or decrease of productionresearch etc the new systems dont need to be artistically the same of course keep in mind they dont even have to be systems per se you could artistically represent them as different parts of the same system and replace the jump gate graphics with acceleration pads though they would technically work the same as different systems anywaycontinuing to reiterate the idea that people could just move away from jita is meaningless its akin to suggesting that we could solve urban congestion in real life by telling people to leave it just doesnt work that way cities solve the problem by building infrastructurein the end it doesnt much matter what i say here because if the problem gets much worse the devs will have to address it and i can bet you that if the technical problems exist as i suspect they do that they will resolve the problem in the general way that i have described eventually given the currently technology in eve a form of station linking over load balancing systems is almost inevitable
no its notand it will never work that wayare you even reading my posts let alone paying attention or am i just talking to a brick wallseriously i suggest you start reading and doing a bit of research before you come up with hair brained ideas about station linking and load balancingyour trying to program up something that is entirely controlled by playersstop while your ahead
unfortunately i have read all of your posts your a broken record telling people to leave jita as a solution to jitas lag is not a solution and will not happen go make your own jita as you suggested when it exists my application will find it and ill go there as will a lot of other people of course if you did then we would have the same issue at your system and we would be right back where we startedvenkul mul doesnt agree with me and thats fine and he posted legitimate reasons why it wouldnt work as i originally described it and he was completely right as well they were aspects that i hadnt thought of so i adjusted the idea hopefully he will come back again and give some more reasons why it wouldnt work
as per this discussionlinkagefor those of us that use drones as primary dpssupport i think we need a buttons that we could assign different groups of drones to that would automatically deploy and send drones to the designated target if i was using turrets or missiles i just target and f1 etc im not sure why i have to go through the menu of launching drones then assigning the target so basically i would like to see a button above the mods that deploys drones and attacks target all in one

i like this suggestion atm i dont really see any reason to use a cyclone since the hurricane does just about anything better except active shield boost  i was thinking of a change of shieldboostamount from 75 to 10 and more cpu before i saw this thread but i think your idea is better
i really like the looks of the cyclone even more than the cane ducks from incoming vegetables and i wish it was actually any good so id fly it and be pimp im not sure on the shielboost bonus tbh id rather have it get resists or shield amount and change it so it can passive tank decently for missions while at the same tim giving passive defense for pvp giving you more fitting optionsand yes it really does need more cpu and the high slotmidslot would also make sense so i cant support the changes you propose but i do support the call for looking into it
are you kiddingcyclone with an xl booster is insaneyou want even better a tankhow about unfit that oversized xl booster and go with a large then you can fit
im thinking this could be a beast coming from a faction like mordus who are ecmhappysomething similar in price and size and capability as a rorqual relative to tank and ehpcosts fuel to run just as the rorqual doeswhat it doeslets say you are sieging your enemys territory you are more or less hold them hostage in their space or they are just running like madyou deploy this it cynojams the system so no capitals can come to the systemit also jams up any capitals so they are unable to jump outit also puts the stargates in traffic advisory mode or whatever where it takes up to 3 minutes to jump to the next systemother uses of this systemyou deploy thisget your dreads on a pos shooting they try to jump in 2 titans nope no longerthey will have to come toe to toe with the subcap game
this could be a nasty abusive toolcynojammers require sov to deploy unless im mistakenwhile im all for the idea as it would make things interesting it may throw the balance a bit too far offit would have to be a very expensive ship but expensive these days also means not so hard to obtain due to the easy nature of obtaining iskin short good idea but may not fare so wellill sit back and wait for others to comment
yummyyou are not mistaken you require sov 3 infactthats where qa and balancing comes inalso of note they are planning a complete overhaul of the sov system so in the new system they could very well establish even better balanceease of isk does not compute to materials so naturally the materials are also an easy nature of obtainingaka dont try to blame carebears for making people rich the whole market has made people richsrsly lol facepalmgif
im thinking no too easy to abuse too easy to deploy i mean cmon we dont need 100s of these insystem and overall not want able how about no more ideas jasonthanksisaac
that seems a bit overpowered for a ship to be able to lock out an entire system what about making a 2au diameter cyno jam field to inhibit the ability to hot drop caps on the field so they have to warp in thus delaying their response time given you will be able to see the caps forming on scanner will give you time to prepare and the extra 30 seconds could save a lot of ships if you become heavily outnumbered
your pushing your luck keep it up and any future ideas you come up with will be ignored 100 of the timeits bad enough 999999 of your ideas are crap but being a smartass is even worse

theoretically you could just leave the old character as a fake account and add a link saying changed name to to the character biography also the new character could have a changend name from in the biography for the account of unscammability it might even be placed somewhere more prominent like in a similar place to the rolesof course the new character would keep all the history of the old character you could even make it so that the new character even gets all the appropriate standings other people set on his old character along with an explanotary remark on the first eve mail or whateverdatabase load would be increased but as long as the practice isnt commonplace certainly less effort than a single new player or account

my drake lolfit is not the drake i use its trying to make a point did you even read my post in the link im trying to meet you in the middle but you just want to throw snide remarks and assumptions around and argue like a bad tempered teenager i dont say you dont understand the mechanics but somehow you know that i dont you know everything including how i think and what i knowso i cant come down to your level please dont reply to anything i say again and i definitely dont need to explain myself to people like youbesides if you use missiles why wouldnt you want them to get a buff if you did you would be agreeing forget what i have said and remember the point of this thread but youre not agreeing so that just leaves us with youre here to argue and shove your ego in everyones faceif you even read this far and have a clue what ive said congratulations
actually kirth i think that im pretty good at providing accurate information in response to intelligent questions in sm about missiles and general game mechanics if someones asking sensible questions and genuinely seeks knowledge im very happy to help them  we were all clueless newbies onceif however someone comes on with an illinformed whine that i know to be baseless and starts posting lolfits as the solution to this imaginary problem i tend to have less patience oh and im more interested in general game balance rather than missiles being perpetually buffed look what happened with the falcon
ok i made different experiences as most people here dunno whynot signed i dont know anything about missioning at all and yes maybe its worse than before but im ratting alot and doin exploration alot in 00 and i found out that ratting in my cerb is still faster than anyone would do in any hac im killing the rats even officer ones in venal fast enough to have an outcome of 45 million every paycheck if i chain and 34 million if i kill all spawns  the faction chanceim using t2 launchers ofcause  fury and precision missles at the appropriate targets i found out a huge difference when switching to precision ones fom normal ones at killing destroyer and frig spawns the other thing is for pvp u wont need much tank its more for buffer and resistance so what u do is to put the explosion sig radius rigs and the explosion velocity rigs on it and u will hit small targets just fineu get the advantage of choosing the dmg type too which noone here mentioned is very much helping at getting the target down easily in pvp i as a cerb am not soloing but in fleet or gang its a very good thing to have target painters with both skills on 4 on ur ship ur really boosting the dmg for ur misslesanyways i just wanted to make this clear to have the choice to go for rigs  choosing the dmg type will give ya the isktime ratio back at ratting in belts
so you either didnt read or understand anything i said then oh and err all the people youre helping i mean thankgod for people like you are just clueless noobies and youre far more superior then everyone else would i be correct in assuming that i need to ask you because im a clueless noob at life and especially general logic

ive been playing around some naglfar fits on sisi and i now agree that armor tank on naglar is a bad idea for damage outputits like having 34 of a dread for same price as others and longer training timei think armor tank can be good for pos bashing if youre primary by pos gives you more chances to survive only its tank is still subpar to other dreadsi thought about the term ccp has used for description as versatilecomparisonamarr dread  carrier armor tank  1 weapon systemcaldari dread  carrier shield tank  1 weapon systemgallente dread  carrier armor tank  1 weapon systemminmatar carrier  armor tank dread  shield tank  2 weapon systemscapital shield booster  27 daystactical shield manipulation v shield operation v capital shield operation vi  27 days citadel  torpedoes 5 warhead upgrades iv citadel torpedoes iv  26 daysversatile costs minmatar capitals over 50 days of extra training timearmor tank  still subpar tank 34 of damage output compared to other dreadsshield tank  more competitive damage ok buffer tank weak shield tankforced split weapons system layout  not much advantage in terms of damageto sum it up i think all this versatility and extra training time doesnt give much advantage to minmatar capitals at allit doesnt even bring it equal to performance to other capitals
one of the concerns about docking into player controlled ship ideas is that what happens when a player thet carries other players disconnects or logs off would the ship stay in space until everybody disembarks perhaps delaying logoff aggro too what if theres an afk pilot or everybody would pop out into space when the carrier player disconnectshow would you solve this
i like the ideas but would there be a reversal of the limitations of what can be in the ship maint baysor do i have eject any cans or cynofuel before i can get inif that restriction gets changed what would stop people from using carriers again to move goods and ships besides jumpfreighter etc etci dont like the idea of nerfing jumpbridges they are limited to sov 3 same with titans titans arent exactly cheap and disposable despite what shrike thinksi definately like the idea of boosting carriermoms to do what they sort of are designed to do right now its a joke just to get people into jumpfreighterspersonally im more of the opinion ofboosting moms into a new role such as being able to remote rep sieged things like dreads for exampleright now if you get into a big dread battle if the dread is primary they unsiege hoping they dont die and get repped by the carriers in order to mess up their targetswould be very cool to see moms there for more balanceas for titans when bombs came out with the anticap sort of idea i thought they would come out with something similar for titans generic mod that all 4 titans can fit 250km range anticap dd just to give the option of dmg or anticapheatwarfare should be left to be done right
player controlled ships get ejected obviously this isnt an afk hiding place
signedif you did not take the adequate precautions and got your freighter into a situation where it will die you should pay the priceas it is people would rather do this than use scouts or escorts in order to move under war dec or through hostile territory with near impunity we can beat this with tactics but its ridiculous and very much against the spirit of eve imoat the very least increase the logout timer to 60 seconds this would still save many many discos but would allow those that do it to cheat be punished
supportedto clarify i support extending the dissappear timer when a person is being aggressedeg take these situations as an example as a pilot loses connection after jumping through a gate1 he is not aggressed as his ship aligns and enters emergency warp and is not aggressed once it is safe his ship dissappears 30 seconds from when his connection was lost2 he is initially aggressed on the gate as he aligns for emergency warp but his aggressors lack a warp scrambler or disruptor and he enters emergency warp regardless his ship dissappears 30 seconds from the last time he was aggressed3 he is aggressed and tackled on the gate his ship is now at the mercy of his aggressorsthe same should be true for pilots that have been involved in aggression before logging off1 player aggressors stop aggressing and player logs off he is not further aggressed and his ship dissappears after 15 minutes2 players aggressors stop aggressing and player logs off he is scanned down and further aggressed his ship is at the mercy of his aggressors3 player loses connection in the middle of a fight his ship is at the mercy of his aggressorsi think thats probably the best way of fixing ityou take a risk when you undock a ship and while disconnects do happen i think thats a risk people should be willing to accept

raised it for next csm meeting but due to the timing it wont be discussed with ccp should it make it through the csm until the 3rd meeting with them may 10
a reasonable compromise but they can still warp to ss warp back rep and repeat
with the alteration that if theyre tackled when attackers notice them flagged they are much more likly to have to deal with the consequences
i really agree with this idea especially if we could select a field of choices and the repair window only displays those items that need repaired in there i think this was mentioned before but it would really help with my poor damaged drones if i could select the whole group and the window would display the ones that are damagedi could see it being useful in a bunch of other ways too for now i think a supported is enough

lets face it moons are static and the latest hopes at increase in supply from game development aka wspace moon seeds has been shattered growing player base  growing demandstatic moons  no increase in supplygrowing demand  static supply  never ending price increasethe latest attempt at fixing this problem was alchemy alchemy was a epic failure to say the least it very well could be rebalanced to work in favor but in its current forum does little to help the ever growing problem in short im asking the csm to try and push this a little higher on the agenda for ccpedit my proposal on what might work to help
from what i remember we already discussed this with ccp at least i remember talking to some ccp people about it at fanfesthowever alchemy is a price loftthe problem eventually comes down to supply and demand im not sure we should mess with it too much if a dynamic system is made it will be farmable i think that means t2 become more abundant im not sure if thats always a really good thing
prices of t2 ships and modules hasnt been increasing steadily over the years like your post suggests instead they have gone up and down more on speculation of lots of high end moons changing hands and supply being lower for a whileso i dont really see much of a problem at the moment t2 ships and modules are relatively cheap stillbeing able to mine moon minerals via mining lasers is a terrible idea thumbs way down
there used to be a day where hacs costed close to 200m and hulks upwards of 300mand people still flew themnot supported
i disagree alchemy is there and works great the price that justifies the use of alchemy just isnt there but people can do it anywayon top of that worst case scenario they do a patch just to adjust moons to create more nice moonsor even just allow mining in 04 to 10there are tons of options and ccp very well knows about it
even then if hacs become too expensive again people simply fly battleships and insurance becomes a factor alsoso reallyits all supply and demand if people use bs and not hacs hacs prices go down
so people are going to spend billions of isk and slave over pos work for a loss sorry thats not the way the system works and thus it is unbalanced and brokeni do not believe t2 should be 1000 more costly then t1 i do not believe that ccp intended for t2 to be so high there first mistake was the t2 bpo lottery second was the static moon mining systemi understand the idea of the eve sandbox and we make the game as we want it but the counterargument can be made that the pos exploits as of late showed use that t2 could be cheaper if a new supply was added i respectfully disagree on the point that you feel t2 should not be more abundance if that was such a bad idea why did t2 production go from static to dynamic and high end t2 minerals are already farmed but only by a select power block alliances this should not be the case
actually this was hashed out in the market discussion forum quite a bit about the dynamics of current moon minerals over the course of 8 months we had thread after thread about 1 a week really dicussing1 the increase in moon minerals and the inevitable high end to expect the previously mentioned 200m hacs for instance2 the then price trend down and then eventual crash which coincided with the start of major exploiting well before it was publicly knew it props to akita for pointing out that minerals were coming from somewhere3 the prediction of the price increase and leveling point to juneaug 08 levels which obviously has turned out trueright now there is no indications that prices will spike much higher however well still of course have the occasional massive demand spikes but those spikes all have a soft cap of price for the final goods and profitability of moons being diverted to external market vs used internal in whatever alliance happens to have that moon at the momentprices also have the nice ability to adjust quickly thanks to invention as well where as before it would take some time before bpo holders would shift price points up or down at times instead riding the prices highs as long as sustainablethe system is working as intended and about the only change that needs to be made at this point is a lower soft cap using alchemy or disjoining the current alchemy reactions from specific racial ties in their r units
well the dics have been so sad since their bigger brother has come aroundnow while i still think being cloaked in a safespot somewhere should be godmode but a cloaker who is spying on a gatecamp shouldnt necessarily be godmode now there is the chance of getting bumped but that is so unlikelywhat decloaks you cloudsi think dics should be able to drop a probe which explodes into a cloud that is what 510km ranged or sothe cloud obviously dissipates after say 5 mins or somethingthis in conjunction with bubbles and a big gatecamp might mean no holding of your cloak i think thats a cool thing this way people dont leave 100 wrecks and corpses at a gate just to attempt to decloak people
its an interesting theory but i dont believe interdictors should have this ability if anything it should be a cloaking ship or an astrometrics ship that gets a cloud mine to decloak ships then again most ships that are designed to cloak can move pretty fast even warp while cloaked or move faster while cloaked so dodging or avoiding the cloud and reentering at range would be easy enough as i have a covopstealth bomber alt i personally sit well over 20km from a gate that im watching so any 510km decloak mine would be pretty much ineffective while in a covop like a helios ill literally sit 152 km off the gate and just swap my camera to the gate and then each ship as need permits to be completely honest a nano hac intie or cloaked covop with a smartbomb is the only thing that i ever really need to worry about especially if another covop has the smart bomb and start orbitting around cloaked
why not really dics could use a little love new role would be perfecthow comethats the real balance now isnt it thats why dic is best in my opinioncovop is understandable warping cloaked lets you get there and you could be 500km away and watch things stealth bombers and noncovop ships either have to setup before the gatecamp and sit there and do basically nothing or they could get decloaked because they know u are therelets say you have a bomber he sits around a gatecamp waiting for nubs in indies coming around he decloaks and fires 1 volley and kills them then cloaking right away almost nobody gets him targeted but a dic can get right on him super quick the cloudmine pops and is certain to decloak the guythe whole decloak cloud is good for decloaking people who jump in

so is transferring isk between character wallets between corporate wallets and via the purchase of commodities on the market and the exchange of said commodities in a variety of ways  none of which i forsee being proscribed against any time soon on the basis they might be used for dirty ingame isk laundry
im all against rmtbut this doesnt sound like rmt if you think isksellers are going to be able to sell isk with a simple change in the way they word it then you are wrongif you think ccp will lend support to anyone who gets scammed in such a foolhardy way or that internet lawyers will get a legitimate case then you are wrong againi believe the eula states something like you cannot xfer sell or auction anything ingame when i read that i figure that loans and collateral is pretty much implied but if you want to get all huffy about it sure throw in a few more words if itll make you happy ccp can ban this type of action but hell if i buy my friend a pizza and he gives me a 200m isk loan ingame id like to see ccp track me downthrowing support but you sound like chicken little lvv
while this is disheartening news i dont think ccp is going to have any way to enforce it as the rules stand they can do the same that they would be able to do in game with any rules modifications lets not forget that the eula states the followingwhile i would support this measure i cant see that it would do any good sorry i dont think i can support this measure
signed because salvaging is like mining rocks which happen to be miles apart with a random chance of yielding somethingthats fun right rolls eyesmake them need some kind of module which eats up cpu or create a salvaging ship which has a bonus along the lines of 99 reduction in cpu needs for salvage drone modules

on another note mods in caod seem to be removing a lot of altposting lately nice
seriously 2147483647km  143550291why not just have the options of 1 au 2auwould make things easier then memorizing 150000000km to 1auproposalleave the box for allowance to change km range to whatever but how about an additional box or button to adjust range of directional scanner in factors of 1au or whateverperhaps something similar to the different ranges of probes on sisi atm
i like the idea of a few preset scan ranges id also like to be able to select those ranges the scan degree arc and activate a scan all with hotkeys
yes please some reworking of the scanner would be nice sliders would be a good start
this would be really handy
hotkeys for preset ranges and arcs would be golden
im surprised at the resistance to this i can think of one good use for it training i mean those neanderthals of earth 10000 years prior to this whole new eden fiasco were using computer simulations for training p
well duh the idea was pretty ed in the first place eve is amout risk once you start to implement carebear death  free arenas you will start eve on the road to its death get rid of that idea for good
yes because the dozen or so poses which we could imagine having scanners on them and able to perform simple trilateration would broadcast to the matching corpsalliances on an encrypted channel it always makes me laugh when socalled pvpers whine about the state of affairs in the game when they are really sub par compared to what we have right here on earth right now in a game that is supposed to be 10000 years in the future of course it makes perfect sense that humans could master spacetime so well as to fling fleets of massive starships hither and yon all without mastering the mathematics of simple location finding
with local in delayed mode its simply not worth it anymore to rat even in good systems
the problem is with delayed 00 is that it makes the space super indefensible you would need a small pvp gang just to protect people while the agressors have the map which can see average pilots in space last 30mins or active pilotsthe agressing fleet knows exactly what they are likely to come up against directional scanners being weak because u can ditch ships in pos and the 14au max range covers very little usuallyeven then if im ratting in 00 its a pain already having to watch 00 quite a bit if i have to spam directional scanners constantly instead oh jeesehonestly 00 is hard enough on nubs no reason to make it even more difficult
it becomes more risky but encourages the use of manual intel and scouts its also a blackops buff
if i have to use scouts to rat im much better of doing lvl 4s in high sec not to mention how easy it will be for cloakers to clean out ratters
if you can stomach that kind of activity  sure a large chunk of my isk comes from 00 rats and i am all for delayed mode local in all 00 space when someone comes insystem theres no reason for them to know im already there 
ratting is just as mindnumbingly boring as doing missions the ones coming in system will be hunting ratters so they will look for you and find you within 30 seconds
which makes ratting less mindnumbingly boring as you have to keep your scanner peeled for signs of incoming enemiescloakers should have that kind of power as to be honest most cloakers could be swatted by any real ratting ship  or at least driven off boohoo you if you rat in a ship that sucks
pressing scan every 2 seconds is mindnumbingly boring and an utterly ed mechanicin that kind of situation id be happy to run around in my recons killing stuff but id be stupid to try to rat to get isk in that kind of situation it simply isnt worth it compared to doing lvl 4s
last time i checked i couldnt do level 4s in a t1 cruiser
i agree
we asked for an entirely overhaul during the first csm that will be done when cosmos arrives
i do not agree
i support this
you are welcome to go out in the big bad eve world make isk and buy the t2 bpos and i agree that most people whine about t2 bpos because of so please do what i did and countless others before me earn isk and buy them from the lucky sods who won them steal them from the lucky sods who won them etc
racism detected why are you picking on my taiwanese amigo for not having perfect englishwould you vote for a racist pigdog
nogonna petition for racism
you just insulted my petreported for petting
petitioned everybody in this page except for misanth and mu for being complete and utter sstop derailing this is unacceptable behaviour from pillars of the community please stay on topic i wish poupon was here to restore order psif he was charming and could baffle mobile phone salesmen for hours on end possibly 
its a deliberate tactic if you always post something triggered by a post in a topic but derail the subject in the reply yourea not trolling or going offtopicb if you reply to a troll you have derailed him rather than falling into his trap offensive and defensive tactic at the same timeits a winwin situation everyone should derail threads always i vote you pull that up on your agenda
how can you derail a topic if its about blasters
laser sharp wit i almost missiled that joke
i dont have the links on me on my phone atm so hard to check multiple pages but if you check thr assembly hall you should see topics regarding forum layout changes search engine forum merging and at least one other
those are topics raised on the forum i was obviously under the mistaken impression you meant raised in a csm meeting as ive gone through the agendas in the meetings you have had and cannot find a discussion pointso again can a csm raise the point of forums in particualy caod the best thread discussing this is here
read better its number xi on day 2 theres more in other meeting minutes but as that one is stickied in the top of this forum i thought i would just point at that onenow what exactly do you want raised as an issue those links are just people questioning what the point of caod is and asking who is actually reading it as i said above if people would stop complaining about caod and actually reported all the posting then the mods could clean it up faster and most of the posters would get banned for repeated violations
no point getting short with me my friend the ideas raised and discussed here will be a good point pay particular attention to jades post
im not getting short with you just pointing out that you need to read the minutes a little more thoroughly

several issuesadding in another gun to make the minnie bs class work simply demonstrates the class is fundamentally flawedminnie fighting is about glass cannons weak tanks huge alpha and mobility the phoon is high dpsshort rangenonautocannon boat that actually can tank switch the shield hitpoints with the armor hitpoints and it will be fine this has been an issue for years the tempest should become the fleet sniper glass canon with massive bowelclenching alpha  low rate of fire and have a weak tank the utility comes from having the two spare high slots to fit whatever floats your boat drop the rof bonus and make it a 10 per level damage bonus and an 10 per level optimal bonus the slot variation then allows you to choose 1400mm or 1200mm full on gank or a bit of tank the spare highs mean a remote rep ability or a nos ability omg it has no tank thats the price it pays for being the scary beast in fleet warfare lifting the optimal also gives it some autocannon capabaility but the lack of a real tank is the weakness of this ship the maelstrom should be the terrifying pure autocannon wet dream do not change the tank bonus or the rof bonus make it the most agile and fastest bs adjust the tracking of all minnie autocannons  they should as a matter of race be the best anyway not worse than amarr ffsthen you have three clear roles miassion running and ratting  short range armor tanking nonautocannon bs scary pew pew sniper scary pew pew close range gunboatof course perhaps one day minnie will get effective ewar but dont hold your breath on itit is incredibly disappointing that minnie bs remain the worst and the whining of the amarr saw it become so clearly superior this is a failure of game designas for the blasterthrons welcome to the minnie world
signed they went way too far
you see this is what you get as a result of the endless nano whines omg their spaceships are like going fast and stuff wahh be careful what you ask for next time you just might get itnot supported missiles are too overpowered they need to be nurfed
i dont agree why should missiles be the only thing hitting for full damage guns cant do it why should missiles
you are an idiot do you even play this game go back to wow if a freighterany other ship jumps into a system and sees a giant camp all they have to do is ctrl q and all you have to do is have a large enough buffer to last circa 30 seconds before your ship disapears so say the target is bubbled infinpoint and has 40 more points of scram on him his ship simply dissapears poof gone as long as they have not been shot before or not shot at any one before they ctrl q they dissapear this is ccps way of helping to protect the people that get randrom drops or have an unstable connection at which point if your connection is untable use a damn scout ask a friend again last night we had another hauler try this exact thing too bad for him his mammoth did not have the tank for 10 bs plus support ccp needs to stop being so damn nice it just facilitates the means to exploit
once again the problem is not being able to point bubble scram whatever the problem is thisif the player logs out before aggression has occured by being hit with a hostile module or by engaging in a hostile act they vanish in 30 seconds regardless of any other conditions
dude check number of replies in missile petition threadthen check the number of supportsthen check the number of active playersthen gtfo
just to point out somethingthe number of supports mean nothingits the lack of response from csm and ccpyou can scream all you want just because you support something doesnt mean anyone important give a damnrule number 1 in assembly dont post stupid ideasrule number 2 in assembly dont assume your idea is going to fly with or without supportyou live longer keeping that in mindhalf the time all the whiners are idiots who dont know how to play the game ive been around long enough to see missiles pre and post qr the mechanics are just fine where they are you people are just sore because you lost your i win buttons boo hoonow can we please get back on topic
confirming support means nothing just look at all my postsyep i follow these rules to the letter
rule number 3 alt posting is something that should be banned from assembly hallpost with your main
another rule that i follow
no manthe numbers clearly state how many people who read the forum actually care and in this case there arent manynow if people would care scream on the forums and stuff and support other ideaswell check the dont nerf carriersthread or the skills queue thingy or the speednerf or warptozerobtw i did not whine about losing my missiles if you would have read what i wrotesorry ot

while im all for a harsh but fair introduction to eve the ap standard setting just doesnt make sense same with the autotargeting why the hell do we have it anyway
definitely
fully supported on both especially given how many settings are stored on the hard drive  i have buddies who lost ships because they were trying eve on their shiny new system to see if it could dualbox premium and didnt notice that their autopilot suddenly decided to stab them in the back
afaik you still need to answer the prompt even if you primed your guns also there is no longer any option to permenantly dismiss the warning so they will need to answer it each timehowever these changes to the default settings would be nice if for no other reason than my own convenience
more1 display setup  interval one instead of interval immediate ie vsync on so advanced settings also enabled some people actually experience damage to their video cards due to overheating might want to prevent that from happening also theres no point in having a fps higher than your display refresh rate anyway2 general settings general  show session change timer and make it actually display a timer not a bloody rotating 5pixel thingy seriously annoying as hell3 overview defaults  sorted by distance stargates on overview canswrecksdebrisasteroidsbillboardsstations off the overview overview taller at least fill the screen from below current target to the bottom on the lowest display resolution height4 general settings inflight  auto target back  zero targets its one of the first things most people that have a clue do anyway newbies are only inconvenienced by it and only a handfull of vets actually can make a decent use of it5 general settings windows  dont try to use existing info window we really dont need the old info taken away by default its easier to close an opened window than pressing shift every time6 shortcuts  add a lot of the existing commands with some default keypress combos especially drone commands for instance f9 for attack or anything else that makes sense having some standardized keypresses for things people use a lot would only make sense7 common graphic settings  cache size off seriously it doesnt help that much at all to have it any larger if you want you can make it larger later
i almost got caught out by the fact that drones are set to aggressive by default i have been advised to set them to passive
wholeheartedly supportedsetting up new people without the slightest bit of experience to make dangerous mistakes is really unconscionable its a lame gotcha i tell all the newbies i meet have you set your autopilot not to fly through lowsec im sure there are those who believe im trying to trick them into something until they see the actual line in the autopilot tablet the newbies acclimatise for a while when they know enough to make their own decision they should absolutely bear the consequence can we just not do that in the first hour theyre here though when they dont know where they are where theyre going what theyre doing what all the knoepfkens and blinkenlights are fordevils advocate argument getting podded in your first hour of being in new eden is your clear sign that youre not in my friendly pony land in this place you pay attention or you pay the price ignorance is not an excuse i actually like that argument quite a bit myself eve is not for everyone i see newbie frigates abandoned outside of stations when people decided they didnt need this hassle fair enough life in new eden is not for the give me a hand out crowd it is very much the mindset of i dont ask for what i want i take what i want having said that the autopilot should not default to the riskier choice when the newbie can decide on their own they want to fly through lowsec autotargetting a ship and not knowing how to turn it off and risk being blown up by concord is just stupid these are decisions to be made by experienced capsuleers not by people still trying to find their way around the interface never mind the game universe and the strange bestiary of predators it harboursabulurd bonifaceme meceo

what a  idea nerf solo pvp even more no tqi can already see when i am engaging somebody he drops a beacon and in a matter of time we have other people getting into the battlefield since quatum rise its already easy enough to stay away from pvp if your get caught its your own ing problem and your own ing stupid mistake this should be trown into the trashbin
have an enemies list and a long and vengeful memory i will pay some visits to my budies soonjust spreading the love
at least we can agree that alchemy in its current forum needs rebalencing or disjoining of some kind
if youve ever lived in curse you see interdictors do plenty fine id love to see some interdictor pilots who like to use it as a small solo pvp ship come in and give some inputa possible better more amusing and game improving suggestion is swapping out defender missiles for a decloak missile yes you heard me a decloak missilehave a missile that generates a 15 km field around fire it off what used to be a defender missile cloaked ships can only get so close to something before decloaking now you have a chance to fly around the gate launching these possibly cheap missiles every which way while i just came up with that on the fly it would be way more useful then the current defender missiles are 
i agree that this is happening and its detrimental to the game it allows people that dont abide by the rules of the game to achieve wealth without due diligence thus cheapening the achievements of true players that play by the rulesthis should be easy enough to enforce by implimenting a few curency transfer rules the amountvalue specifications of these rules might be adjusted a bit to encompass most scenarios1 isk transferssales cannot be made more than 100 above median price of goods sold that are above 1000000000 unless players are older than 6 months2 iskgoods cannot be gifted in quantties above or add up to 1000000isk or in value within a 1 month time frame by players hows account is not at least 6 months old3any account that is found attempting to solicit rl curency for a n ingame profit will be deleted and the ip and cc will be blocked from game 4any one that turns in an account that is found to be engaged in soliciting rl currency for ingame profit will acquire 50 of the offending accounts isk valuethese rules will destroy the rl currency funding of players that dont want to earn there place in the game by the rules
ok now before we ever see this kind of list again lets first sit back when we first started playing eve it was tough it was complex and lets face it we were all pretty broke unless we had a buddy comping us i myself easily blow 100mil on newbies in skill books  items and ships being a newer player is tough enough without some 6 month barrier they are paying customers and thus should be treated as such not to mention it guts altsso onto the list1  6 month barrier issue  scamming is part of eve pay attention when you buy something2  basically makes alts and supporting friends that you talked into trying the game impossible or more hassel then its worth also just no3  i think a ban and the subsquent purchase of a new acct by the offender is much better in ccps interests repeat offenders may get the whole ip ban but im not sure how ccp handles this or would handle it ive never been banned4  no because then we have false reports what happens if i report you for rmt and i may be lying but i managed to provide some evidence do you get half of my stuff do you get banned because of extremists measures like the ones you listed and i get half your stuff can alliances like goonswarm completely annihilate the other alliances by spamming rmt trading on red alliances i mean out of 5000 people suppose the penalty for multiple false reports is banning they could easily lose 1000 alt accts that we all know they have most eve players have alts after alledit fixed a phrase in 4
im confused and havent looked into how much rl money isk goes for on ebay or something but dont plexs scale comparably with thatalso with the plexs you can use out of game assets money in your bank account to literally buy iski guess in the end it does take money out of ccps pocket because it encourages macro mining but so does the ability to pay for your account with in game moneyi think in the end that it is really hard to say whether selling iskloaning large sums without any true ingame collateral is really all that bad considering that ccp has provided the tools to rip themselves off lolbut in all seriousness i think it can be unanimously agreed that macromining is bad and it is truly the source of all this evil sadly i dont think that any of the suggestions to defeat the cursed macros are feasible and so i think that until they are dealt with selling isk will continueps the pizza comparison is perfect
this topic isnt about macro mining at all the topic being discussed is whether ccp should consider specifically amending the eula to proscribe against the loaning of isk between players when rl currency a promise of a meal at mcdonalds etc are offered and accepted as securitiesfurthermore gtcsetcs and the consequent plex items are not tools to rip ccp off as you seem to imply but rather they provide ccp with increased revenue in addition to game subscriptionsim now going to take the opportunity to repost the official response garnered in the thread which precipitated this one
imho no where does this statement says that the activity is allowed or that it is a loophole essentially any and all remedial actions available to ccp in such matters is limited to items and services provided by ccp they can not legally interfere in any transactions that did not happen across their network applications or any other property of belonging to them virtual or realhowever to take this statement of fact as some sort of permission to engage in the activity is foolhardy in the extreme not to mention an obvious failing in reading comprehensionlike ive said before why this is being allowed to be discussed is beyond me as it is very simple person a hands person b isk person b hands person a cash at this point we have a transaction just because both parties agreed to the same rate of exchange at some possible future point doesnt change the fact that cash and isk has changed handsthe only reason this is a big stink over in the md is because ebank is tangentially connected to all of this of course using the ebank banking system creates an rmt laundering system that is apparently being used by its primary founder after all ric can just transfer isk after receipt of cash to an ebank account and some unsuspecting and honest teller simply handles the ensuing standard withdrawal request voila rmt is launderednow this may seem like an irresponsible accusation and something not worth bothering with imho ric should have just never said anything however hes flaunted that he does this hes flaunted that it is successful and that ccp can look at all of his accounts and find nothing untoward primarily i just think hes stupid for coming here and thumbing ccps nose about the whole matter when silence would serve him and his customers much much betterfor myself ive recently withdrawn my isk from ebank all of it i want to have nothing to do with the potential fall out as this whole mess simply plays to damn close to banhammering last thing i want to do is spend two weeks pleading via email to get my account back because someone else cant color inside the lines
btw i think we should point out that blurring the lines between virtual property and physical property has brought detriment to many no matter how stupid the people involved are allow the lines to blur permits even fosters greater and greater stupiditycase in point chinese murder over weaponfurthermore considering how stupid and brutal some of our fellows get im sure that if we allow real life mortgages over virtual property that some defaults may result in this and thisps mind you the above is rather hilarious im sure you all know someone in eve that would be stupid enough to borrow isk and someone brutal enough to hunt that person down last thing we or ccp needs is this kind of publicity should the unspeakable but likely happen
just to clarify here please check the other thread it is quite clearly stated that this has not been done on any level with ebank and only me personally in the past helping out others ingamebut nice try shar keep up the good effort
at no point have i tried to represent the quoted repsonse as permission ive only used it to reiterate the position of ccp as youve put it more extensively that they cannot interfere in any transactions that did not happen across their network applications or any other property of belonging to them and that any and all remedial actions available to ccp in such matters is limited to items and services provided by ccp and if a tree falls in the forrest but nobody is present there to observe it did it really happenim sorry but in my mind it really isnt the same thing rmt is the exchanged of ingame isk for rl currency and the exchange is final just because rl currency may change hands in the outlined scenario doesnt make it rmt the rl currency is if at all only being used to leverage the loan where a loan may otherwise not be possible that is the point of using it as a security deposit the exchange isnt considered to be permanent unless the loan defaults and if the loan defaults then i think for all practical purposes the tree fell in the forrest and the at minimum only two people there to observe it happen will probably behave like a monkey  in the see no evil hear no evil and speak no evil sense  rather than fling their waste at each other until the zoo keeper deals with them bothtangentially ebank is tangentially connected to the discussion because of ricdic  one of the employees youre connected to what i am aware to be their only significant competitor also as an employee yourselfas for the rest of your post shar i consider you and ricdic both to be like a toilet that doesnt flush quite right or a stair that always creaks  fixtures that make home like home at least in md that isthat doesnt stop me wishing sometimes that i could take a hammer to you both for a little diy improvement
so if no one sees you breaking a law you then did not break a law how unkarmic a thought what you do when no one is watching you says much of ones characterthats the end of what i have to say
on the flip side theyd probably be upset if i d in front of them
im sorry but what was the point of this thread again
if you look hard enough youll see it at the top of the page
oh because for a while there it looked like a coad thread
rmt  real money trading transaction  to complete a transaction in which real world currency is used that is the real definition any transaction in which real world currency is used whether this was a term coined by players or ccp affects exactly what impact this has on the eula as i am to lazy to go read it right now to hunt for the term there are a few things about this topic i think people are overlooking sure due to the possible abuse of this system it should be highly regulated im sure ccp does not relish the thought that if a loophole does exist that isk sellers can now run rampant however it has always been ccps own stance that the players create standards and regulate themselves clearly the majority of players dont approve of this form of rmt which can be used in legitimate circumstances due to the more common talked ill uses however if ccp indeed will not touch this matter as i believe they wont because i believe they are smart enough to realize that trying to extend their reach into this manner is merely symbolic and will not actually affect anything then it is up to us the players to enforce standards onto this new form of tradingthere are some really simple ways of creating rough standardsregulations for this type of trade have respectable people only use trusted banks of eve such banks should never allow someone who has defaulted on a loan to keep taking out loans time after time clearly this will kill iskselling in the sense of respect banks participating in it a simple audit could confirm that they have been sending large quantities of isk to people who have defaulted on their loans also those same respectable people being those who own ipos and the like can be confirmed to only accept lisenced loans on the other side you have those sneaky folk writing bad home loans an that will be our non respectable side of rmt loaningthe fact ccp hasnt commented leads me to believe that theyre using this as some type of sting operation to catch people willing to admit on the forums or that they have no intention of making any immediate changes to the eula to address this loophole or theyll make the change on march 10th and sneak it in with the expansion then start busting people hehe
so if i understand the scenario being mooted as correct person a lends person b 1 billion isk person b gives person a real life monies as security until said isk is paid backthat being the case its simply a form of real money transfer and real money should have nothing to do with eve against plex sales too btw but thats another topic i guess some would say that it doesnt become a rmt transfer unless someone decides to default on said loan but to my mind i would have to say thats pure sophistry at its worstso yeah clarification from ccp on the matter would be good
i knew what rmt iswasi was just commenting on the obvious corp kicking that was going onrmt in eve is a nasty can of wormspersonally i tend to take the stance of its your money and your head feel free to lose both if you wantrmt is a stupid move you have no legal recourse or protection to prevent scamming to the 10th degree compounded with the fact your dealing with international playersthe only time ill condone such things in my corp is if its done via ccpand no where else otherwise i will be the first to point and laugh at how foolish you are if not have you removed for stupidity as in some cases it causes more trouble than its worthrmt should be strictly forbidden and only done through ccp sanctioned channelsperiodas for how when where proof wise thats entirely up to the powers that bepeople buy and sell isk all the time tracking it can be difficult that or its already being done and we just dont know of itccps silence on the matter is going to be obviousthey cant stop it but they will punish those foolish enough to further itkeep in mind that even ccp answers to international law so they are probially going to take a nuetural stance as much as possible and keep the rmt to a minimum if at all possiblermt is a real thing its everywhereand it will happenso dont give any of us that if a tree falls an no one hears it does that mean it happened crapbecause your just lying to yourself you might as well play eve blind folded and with ear plugs at that rateit starts with the players who think cheating by spending money to get isk and other rmt transactions is the way to gohell even i question character buying as great as it is to have a member who bought a carrier pilot in our corp i cant help but feel just a wee bit jealous and slightly ganked over the fact he went from battleship pilot to carrier in just a few well spent dollarssome of us put a lot of time into training and have issues with shortcutsbut i keep my mouth shut on that its his money if he wants to spend it so be itbut ethically speaking theres something wrong with that picturejust how far is too farwhats next trading ships for cashsomeone needs to draw the lineand quite clearlyagain it all comes down to the player the player needs to be told you will not and can not do thisand they get told and they ignore and they do it anywayand they end up screwed over quite frequentlythere are no cerdentials no security checks its all on word of mouthits your own damn fault if you dont think it throughso i dont think any amount of rules will help because this is not something you can controlyour better off tracking disconnections vs logging off
go back to the fanfest 2008 videos with the gms playing with their rubics cubes one of them said they had made salvage drones but they didnt work right so they took them out he alluded to the problem being drones not having the cargo space so your salvage would go poof even if they did salvage something
1 add a tick box for not showing contracts from blocked characters2 add a filter for characters age to contract filtering and a tick box for enabling it that way you can ignore contracts from characters younger then xx days when looking for high value stuff gets rid of most scam contracts3 add a local chat filter for showing any and all posts andor posts with links from characters younger then xx days id say a 10 day setting would get rid of most of isk spammers and bogus contracts in locali believe when using this you can filter out 90 of scams in jitayou could miss out on a legit deal that way but it is your option to turn the filter onif anyone can improve on the idea please go for it point out any negatives as well i might have missed something

coad has always been a placeas long as i can remember in my years in eve5years9months where random alts post crap but it has got worse in the last few years in my opinion the problem is the created alt corps and also the goon alliance every little change they get they post crap topics on the forumnow back in the old days bob also posted alot off threads but never as much as goon and less spam topics so my proposal is too ban chars who make spam topics without warning this might actually clean coad up a bit caod should be about large fights spies whove done there jobs and ran off with the loot that kindoff post
caod was  before internet it will be  after thempeople just like to feign outrage because of their honesty in the open way they post  with an altnot supported obviously

essentially ive become annoyed that low level noncosmos pve encounters such as the ded complexes allow the entry of tech i small ships and tech ii small ships my particular focus here is on the caldari 210 ded complexes pith merchant depot but i feel my arguments apply to all the noncosmos 1 and 2 level ded deadspace complexestech ii ships namely assault frigates interdictors and to a lesser extent interceptors have obvious advantages over tech i ships in the same ship classes the primary advantage in this scenario being their greatly increased resists allowing them to permanently tank a whole room of npc aggression without difficulty and especially without risk pilots of tech i ships will usually find these complexes challenging often needing to carefully manage the npc aggression present in order to survive  before they even get to the last room they are by no means a cake walk to complete meanwhile a tech ii frigate or destroyer will find them quite easy to complete with almost no risk to their ship at all i feel this is unbalanced giving pilots of these ships what amounts to be an unfair advantage over anyone else attempting the complex in a tech i frigate or destroyermore importantly for tech ii pilots in this scenario there is comparatively no element of risk for reward presentthese complexes only respawn after several hours and can drop approximately fifty million isk of loot example pithi btype small shield booster at a time and that kind of isk would be a real boon to a new player who expends the effort to earn it unfortunately these complexes are often found to be heavilyregularly farmed by much older characters in the above mentioned tech ii ships whether some of these do it to generate isk for rmt is open to debate im sure many players have heard rumors about this or seen suspicious activity themselves  im not delving into that aspect of the issue heremy concern is that we have a part of the game which provides an excellent potential source of income the new players being sabotaged by more than the usual amount of greed we put up with and exercise ourselvesi think there are a few solutions available but i think the most obvious and best one is the removal of assault frigates interdictors and interceptors from the accepted ships list on the noncosmos 1 and 210 ded deadspace complex accelerator gates an alternative i will also raise is to introduce a timer lockout function on the entry accelerator gate that restricts players from entering the complex for an arbitrary time at least days after their last attempt
eve players age like fine wine we become more complex strong and even change coloring sorta like the difference between t2 and t1 by virtue of the t2  t1 ship issue i suppose an older player able to fit all t2 items including t2 rigs onto his ship should be limited to t1
i really fail to see the issue here to me it sounds like your complaining that because people have better skills they can earn isk easily isnt that the point i mean next your going to say that hulks shouldnt mine in highsec because there is no risk or that marauders shouldnt be able to do lvl 4s because of all the isk they make or that hacs shouldnt be able to rat because its too easy for them and there is little risk involved im sorry but unless i see a true reason other than its too easy for them i dont see the need to nerf noncosmos encounters isaac

on a posting spree today it seems i think the ccp panel got it right during the qa at fanfest this isnt wow anyone who equates the possible new tournament arenas to that obviously hasnt played eve if anything i have faith the dev team would fire anyone who suggested a battlegroundisque feature in eve with that in mind this could possibly be part of the tool set they were developing to help run the alliance tournament if that is the case then clearly alliances could hold minitournaments internally or any amount of tournament  grudge matches etc etc could come about not to mention wed be able to bet on the outcome now imagine we can bet a shiphow about the ship we get virtually in the arena someone gets to blow up a fake ship and gets i dont know your real kronos for winning the bet sounds like pirates will quickly become highstakes gamblers much like underground racers who put up the title of their cars on a side note what if you need to own the ship in eve reality to use it in the simulation and subsquently lose it in the betedit fixed it to your real kronos
i really disagree with implementing some sort of arena combat into eve but what about a contract system to engage in consensual combatthere could be all sorts of conditions placed in the contract as to the terms of the battle things that come to mind are publicprivate number of players involved meeting point and items to be wageredthere could be many more options to select in the contract but you could set them up with extremely minimal restrictions as well so as to not feel stifledalso potentially you could have the choice to rank the fight or not if youre just messing around then set up the contract for nonranked or never accept one that is rankednow i realize that this might open a floodgate of suicide gankers so mitigating that would be difficult but would it really be that terrible for something like this to occur i dont really know how this would work out so please no flame but definitely open up some criticism on this one because i think a contract battle system might be interesting
waithow the hell do you join a corp and not realize youve joined one
i dont really care much one way or the other but i would demand reimbursement for the sps if learning skills went away cant see ccp willing to do that even if they could
you know it speaks volumes when the turnout for csm is lower than the special elections they throw here in the middle of the year for bond proposals in order to keep the turnout downbascialy the player base is apathetic because they realise that by and large the developers honestly dont give a  so long as you insist on shoveling money at themin fact to be blunt if the turnout drops again then it would be in ccps best interest to just ignore them
backsorry rl really sucks it out of youwhat did i miss is nexus runningby the sigs id say the camapign is still goinglets get things back to where they should beyou seen sol
good to have you back sorry things have been hectic your end  hope they simmer down soonthe campaign is very much still on march 17th is the start of the submission process so thats a gogoinnumerable people now appear to be jumping on the bandwagon you created sir havent seen sol in a while but im sure hes lurking
what im here
lol my badalso have started a page here for greater informational dispersion facility
dont vote for this idiot
im sorry that you are bitter because you are still an embryonic piece of punctuation however i have high hopes that one day you will metamorphose into a wonderfully polite poster
i didnt understand those words  and as nexus cant beat such a diverse vocabulary my vote will be remaining with captain pompus sorry for swaying earlier
good to have you back
i know le poupons main olololol
who is it
ill tell you if you tell me yours
zingi guess youll have to wait until the election thingymabob
are you actually genuinely going to stand for csm because i seriously think its just a ty gimmick for an alt
i am indeed at least i cant see anything stopping me sir if that was the case it would be ty indeed
so in short then it seems i need to write up a detailed well thought out post covering the points re caod that have been raised within multiple threads in various differant forum threads written in such a way that the csm knows exactly what the issues are so that csm can then raise the issue to ccp formally and await andor discuss the responseif that is the case ill try but surely that the job of the csm i know a lot of the posts titles are stating issues that cant be discussed but reading through the replys to these a no of constructive well thought out ideas have come to light surely a csm can look at the generality of the discussions and pick out the common theme and raise that
unfortunately we cant  they do need a formal vote thread in assembly hall so yes you do need to right it out
signednot only would this make them look much better it would add a lot of realism
with smiisle skils on 3 on sisiusing hams  anticruiser im killing assult shipsfrigates under 1 minute same as fully trained t2 turets ummmm they need to be buffed you say
first of all id like to apologise to the community for yet another topic re caod but as far as i can understand the csms refuse to acknowlege the issue unless its put forward in a undisclosed way lolquote from omberzombie unfortunately we cant  they do need a formal vote thread in assembly hall so yes you do need to right it outthere has been a no of threads re this the main one being
if you really want a ceo only forum as well it cant hurt though i guarantee it will be full of anodyne and worthless hurf blurf tbh the old intergalactic summit forum was as good as this sort of thing will ever getbut honestly caod has always been worthless and it always will be goons and internet are just open and honest about thisjade is just upset because jade is actually really good at trolling via posts that leverage jades lack of understanding of 00 now caod is exposed as a joke it isnt as much fun for that type of trolling
posting bans on a corpalliance level is an excellent idea also only allowing directorsceos is another way to goi support this but i think these restrictions are a little too harsh i like caod and find some of the trolling to be funny ill admit to that i would love to see which forums are the most viewed i would expect it to be gd followed closely by caod and how can you say such a popular forum needs fixingi would love a little bit of cleaning but if caod was just neutral battle reports id zzzz and go look up some pron
just dont read it it seems that ccp and the players prefer to keep it as a place for trolls to have their fun so they dont ruin the rest of the forums
make it worth reading which probably will require large scale banning or posting restrictions otherwise might as well delete the whole section and save the mods time
since there is an actual topic to discuss in this proposal its perfectly valid in its current formas for jades suggestions  i personally like the requesting to post bit combined with the organisational moderation or mods could start banning people againyes this is a topic that continues to raise its head but as i have told you in another thread already every time we raise issues to do with moderation or the forums in general we get told not to im happy to raise this if it gets some support but dont be surprised if nothing comes of it
i like
ban on misuse ban all accounts from that person on being caught a second time that and what the op stated
coad is no longer worth reading
would be rude not to support this topic ultimately i think most non caodspamming players recognize that something has gone horribly wrong with the corporate and alliance discussion forum and since playerled politics and wars are a key selling point of eve online its getting ridiculous that the virtual storefront for this gameplay appeal has been systematically sabotaged and rendered near completely unusable for anybody outside a certain 00 powerblockcertain players are currently abusing the intentions of that forum by creating disposable alts in an existing 00 entity simply to insult other players and post pointless drivel and meaningless spam in increasing volume this has been going on for months now and it really needs to stopin the op neresky quotes a proposal i made for dealing with this problem and its worth pointing out that i actually tried to gain consensus in this direction during my own six month csm term but failed due to at least 23 of the other csms being affilitated with the very people conducting the endless spam campaignit may well be that the current csm will be unable to reach consensus either  but its important that the effort is made and those csm members who do see the importance of caod as a window into the playerled politics of the game take a stand and present strong advise to ccp that this situation really needs to be cleaned uppersonallyspeaking i still believe the application for posting rights on caodcollective bans for organizations abusing that right is the way to go here since it will immediately disbar those entities that consider caod a dumping ground for their oneliners and puerile spam and prevent the endless cycle of disposable alts being used to flame and troll and insult other forum users almost entirely without consequencei certainly believe there are many many interesting events conflicts campaigns and political struggles going on across the single server of eve online and it is close to a tragedy that all of this is currently 100 occluded by the destructive spamming and personalattacks of one particular enity and powerblockso with that supporting the motion
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
coad is not supposed to be goonswarmcomagain the csm leader being a goon and goons goal is the ruin the game and get players to quit how can we expect this to reach ccpit was stated in some interview with a game website a while back i cant find the link atm unless someone has it

what kind of crash just client or client making your system crash had an issue recently with the client crashing my laptop randomly had to uninstall and reinstall hasnt crashed since hard to fix but should be looked into supported
half the time hes serious and actually fairly reasonable half the time obvious troll is obvious you happened to flip heads this time as for the idea minor and i worry about clutter  repair all somewheresay on the front page of the repair shop instead of having to do each ship and container individually would likely be better  but id support something in this vein for sure
protip control  a in the repair window selects everything for repairgood idea though
great idea supportedfirst time poster in csm forums
you are suggesting that the eve forums be made functional
a director can kick a player out of the corpan alliance director can kick a corp out of the alliancea director cannot overrule the ceo without the issue being voted upon by shareholders of the corpan alliance director cannot overrule the ceo without the issue being voted upon by shareholders of the executor corpa director cannot disband a corp because he cannot overrule the ceoan alliance director can disband an alliance even when he cannot overrule the ceohows that for a flipping failure of an oversight
the problem with all of this is that youd have to apply the same level of control to booting individual corpswhich sounds all well and good until you find one of your corps goes alliance but you cant get them out for 24 hours
also all disbanding the alliance actually does is reset sovereignty to level 1 for a few weeksyou lose cynojammers jump bridges and invulnerable stations is sov 4 systems that is allall you lose is certain aspects of your defenders advantage for a few weeksthe invading alliances still have to beat you on your own turf you still have all your pos defences and all your outposts and all your allieshaargoth didnt dissolve 1000s of players effort losing fleet fights with a reduced defenders advantage did that
i find it very amusing that every single goon cling to a supposed victory by utilizing an obvious oversight from ccp before this following sentence ive never said one single word about bob and goon and how haargoth disbanded bob in 30seconds dissolving thousands of players effort over the yearsall i did was raising a valid point of argument by comparing the one single difference that lead to this discussion between corplevel director and alliancelevel director attempting to counter the argument with such feeble effort is selfserving and egocentric but who am i kidding youre a goonthe mittani has the power to walk off with 5000odds goons effort at this very particular moment and god knows he would he doesnt practice space bushido the question is should he be allowed toall is fine and dandy thats the same mentality that brought down bob you are only spelling your own downfall by refusing to let the flaws in the system be rectified properlyalso please edit your post to english if and when you find the need to make sense
yeah i really dont think anyone was responding to your poststhe ops point would be fair enough if not for the problem that you cant put restrictions in without putting in the same restrictions on removal of individual corps that is what happened to formerbob there is no disband alliance functionand not for the fact that it doesnt do as much damage as people seem to think it doesyour point is just pendantic rules lawyering that i dont think anyone really gives a  aboutone simple thing that could be done would be to allow alliances to exist with only one corp left in thembob would have kept their name and it would have been clearer to empire dwellers that all that happened was that cynojammers and jumpbridges were disabled
have to support this even though i laughed for hours the day i started and one of my friends got podded close to a dozen times trying to get to where the rest of us were wow guildies who all started a trial on the same day i only went back to wow long enough to give my stuff away
have star gates on the overview by default as well
the entire ship should be setup like the theroetical eve universe civillian ie  no lowsec routes  stargates on overview no autotarget automatically everything on overview ore cans debris better warning about canflipping they will shoot you for thiswhy not why no kb padded with ibis noob pewpew is lolz sometimes you just die pay attention to your route and surroundings  hello kitty online
dear csmsome time ago the devs put out a feedback thread on the features and idea fourm of using fuel pellets basically it allowed folks to take all current fuels and smash them together to make a compact and less of a hassel fuel format that would require only 3 fuels the charter the pellets and the isotopes for the racial fuelthe topic soon stopped getting responses from the devs and more recenlty lost its sticky statusoverall most of us thought it was a good ideathe major complaint was build times the issue is not keep this topic alive but to possibly impliment the fuel pellets for the longest time star base operator need pos improvements and this is just a small step in improving the lives of all who run poss and a possible boon to industrythread is located herepos fuel pelletspleasebring this up to the attention of the devs again in hopes we can get this in finally
yeah
yeah good idea
or rather whats with npcs selling minuscule amounts of fuel at one time  stupid enriched uranium if the damn guys would just sell me 1k units i wouldnt have to hit the buy 16 units a million time fuel pellets hmmm yes let someone else make it easy for me i like it
yes fuel pellets are needed imo if a good balance in production time is foundbring this topic back to attention
after being informed about details on the pos pellet idea i now find myself in support of this concept im sure ccp is looking at it but a bit of info isnt that bad to have as to the progress
yup im really curious about why this idea died it seemed like a good one no the pellets would only include isotopes and the npc goods ozone and water are separate and would remain so under the proposed system also while i dont mine ice myself the refine charts ive seen say that ozone is available in all four highsec ices merely in low quantities25unit
oh my scan down a mission runner in lowsec warp in drop distress beacon cloak after the ensueing slaughter salvage the battlefieldwith my luck would happen to mewould still flippin funny though i think it would work better as a physical beacon that shows up on the overview and requires the use of repair facilities before you can launch another
maybe make it so it can only be issued when the attacker has a criminal flag in empire and can be linked in other channels ie corp or intel channelsrather than use a bookmark you can use a system similar to corp fleet invites to broadcast it in a channel
sounds like lolz for all
this its not like the buddy list lets you set destination or anything hey now theres an idea modified buddy mechanics that allow you to request friend status to someone that you add if they allow it then be able to set destination to them at any time when they are on as set destination only gets you to the same system its not gonna be like a modified fleet thing
alright so ive made a thread like this before but im going to refine it and narrow it down weve all seen the cool trailers where ships are flying in formation but in reality fleet fights are two clusters of ships orbiting around each other  real ugly some may say that this is a fluff but i think this will make fleet fights much more interesting and will require more strategyfleet formationsin the tactical overlay give the commander a way to move other players ship in game to his set upinstead of a circle the tactical overlay will be a cubedgrid in the cubedgrid idea you can also upload bookmarks to your fellow pilots you set a point in space for them to move to and also be able to set a point that they will align toin the cubedgrid you will be able to see the intersecting lines point names example a57  l22 a  altitude l  latitude etcsaving formation settingsautomatically moves everyone in your fleet to their previous set upfleet formations can be made on an ingame tool before the fight that way you always have a plan preparedsynchronized warping in formation optionmakes all ships align to warp designation and slow their warp speed to match the slowest ship in the fleet
wow really nice idea me i think that fleet formations will involve much more strategy in this game making it like chess sort ofyou have my support
nice for prewarp setup but during actual battles no very much no warping in with your very nice battle formation may look really cool and it does fighting in formation no each ship needs the ability to move around a lot thats why when you see dogfights top gun memphis belle tora tora tora the planes do a single dive then break into pairs for individual mobilityas real planes dont have the actual ability to rep each other blobs dont happen fleet fights devolve into blobs because of this i like the idea but its actual execution is fairly pointlessi would like a way to structure your fleets in space but it really really is a useless feature since this game is not line of sight it doesnt matter to that laser aimed at the logistics that the mega is in the way and it doesnt matter that your own ships are between you and them for your missileswhen that changes then real formations will be needed but as a look really pretty tool sure you will see many more eve universe videos on youtube and they will be epic
i see no reason why anyone would ever use this feature given that it would actively make your fleet worse in combatscrewing up ranges etc and i definitely see no reason why any dev should spend time on implementing it not supported
structed to warp in but then they are allowed to break off and move of course
your buddy should be the one bringing this forward not yourself i agree with the ninja about the petition option i wonder is this the result of unchecked ninja activities ninjas gone bad so much for the apocrypha revamped noob experienceif a player is participating in empire sanctioned activities such as running missions and another player interferes there should be some consequence ie balancing at a minimum the interfering parties should lose standings with the corporation whos agent assigned the mission with the agent themselves with the mission runners corporation and possibly even concord edit the ninja bumpers should be given something as a rewardincentive i suggest improved standings with the mission faction whom they assisted so long as they didnt kill them off in the mission fieldthere is a place where such interference does not warrant consequence that place is called null secan empire is no empire without law and order
agreed right now the current mechanic which ties it to cadmium is rather backwoods and really only ensures that the high end cap is higher than normal since cad is used in other much needed reactionsit would have been much more ingenious to tie the alchemy reaction to a combination of the r8s and r32s rather than the r16s
i see ccp projected price of t3 as a way to control this and vice versat3 cruiser projected price is on the same level of hac price moon minerals go too high hac are substituted by t3 cruiser and demand is reduced price go down t2 demand increase and t3 demand decrease it all depend how fast t3 can enter in production but it can be an interesting mechanic two different items with different production systems competing for the same market
interesting concept i support at least looking into it
how do you propose to boost recon ships and covops ships after this is released which it wont be
personally i think that you are expanding too much out of what was actually said in that threadbasicly the way i understand that is that if to people who actually know each other personally in real life work out some sort of deal to loan isk to each other ccp wont get involved if you owe your friend 20 bucks ccp doesnt care nor do they care if he owes you 1b isk there is no real reason why true friends cant lend or just give each other whatever ingame and outofgame items they wantccp isnt going to turn a blind eye to rmt transactions just because someone comes up some fancy story about how they were just giving isk to a friend ccp has limited resourses to prove that real money was traded between people outofgame and they have even less ability to prove that the transaction was related to an isk transfer obviously they look at the patterns of those giving and receiving isk and establish rmt transactions primarily from ingame informationi would have prefered it if mitnal had cautioned against iskforcash loans but i dont think that a weak statement disclaiming responsiblity for what arrangements friends make among themselves amounts to approval of a loophole
i guess youre welcome to try discussing this topic in coad if you really want to try but unless youre actively trashing the reputation of an individual or alliance based on their ingame political affiliations then youll most likely only see it moved or locked for being off topic for the forum or more closely related to your second point perhaps they have no intention of making any immediate changes to the eula because there is really no hole in the eula being exploited just players making their own private arrangements between each other and outside of the game environment where ccp know they cant police it  all without supporting the real rmt vendorsmaybe they also recognize that these loans have the potential to actually hurt rmt vendors and even further drive egtc sales1 if a loan defaults and the person who issued the ingame isk consequently keeps the rl currency submitted as security for the loan the point of having said security provided there is nothing to stop them using that same rl currency to purchase an egtc from ccp or one of their distributors and injecting that rl currency into ccp alternatively they could even use it to finance their own game account directlyit doesnt mean the rl currency is necessarily going to funnel into the banking account of a sweatshop in hubei province if people want to rmt and i mean really rmt then theyre much more likely to use an rmt service like the one ive linked a report on the hysteria people are exhibiting over the concept behind this thread and the other is getting sillylet us also not forget that the security provded for the loan may have nothing at all to do with rl currency at all it is just as possible for the security to be in the form of information such as requiring ones rl address or contact information in some cases even actually signing and sending official documentation statutory declaration and identification proof in the case of australia stating that you are liable for a specific amount of rl funds to use to recover losses in the form of an egtc in the event of a defaultscam  not actual rl currency itself2 sophistry being by definition being a subtle tricky superficially plausible but generally fallacious method of reasoning and fallacious often meaning deceptive or misleading please dont try to use big words to insinuate other people are liars youre not likely to get away with it without a challenge and it means i have to double check terms on dictionarycomoh so i guess youre talking at me now the point of the comment i made was to illustrate the fact that the loan of ingame isk with rl currency as security is probably outside the reasonable abilities of ccp to identify track and persecute with accuracy i said it to further build my argument that it is pointless to enact needless and reactionary changes to the eula when the economic system evolves beyond some peoples comfort zone even slightlyas for the rest of your offtopic tirade im not going to concern myself with it
not sure how ccp could really do anything about it on a large scale as actively enforcinginvestigating would be a rather large financial strain compared to the rmt actually involved if they are informed and have proof then yes they should drop the ban hammer and should definitely make sure those activities are covered in the eulalook at it this way conspiracy nut time if isk acquires any kind of stable rm valuation i could see cash strapped governments trying to tax in game assets not likely but given the current world economic difficulties ya never know
wrongchina taxes it already if theres an incentive to do something somebody will do it that includes western governments doing the exact same as the membrane between virtual worlds and the real world breaks down
not every situation warrants the courtesy of any notice yet people live with the history they create some decisions have undesirable consequences yet sometimes the choice is worth itthe 24 hour waiting period imaging having to give an abusive spouse 24 hours notice
not supported current game mechanics arent perfect but its better than this way too much like world of warcraftisaac starstriker
heres the idea apologies if it has been suggested alreadyin each region there is a shuttle service you can use it to be transported from station to station in any system in the region as long as it is 05 to 10 and the station is an npc stationthis means it is an empire based highsec thing only meaning no one can use it to stealth into other peoples poss and such i suspose you could add some functionality to make a pos become on the grid a shuttle service depot module maybe for those that want people coming to thier stationthis also means that if u want to go into lowsec or 00 you still are at risk cause you have to fly your ship the cost is based on number of systemjumps you are going but not really high cost say 1k per jump 500 per jumpthis shuttle service transports just the pilot  nothing else no cargothe idea for this comes from seeing those convoys going in and out of stations and thinking maybe some of them are passenger liners and such or carrying passengers as part of thier freight ok  flame away lol
i of course support my own idea  lol
your ideas is good and pretty solidbut it will never flyjump clones setting up a clone in a different location and podding yourself these are just a few of the methods pilots use to get aroundthe pilots are capsulers not passengers of any particular shipall your doing is encouraging a very lazy gamenot supported
buy a shuttle autopilot fast cheap requires no changes of game mechanics i see no reason to implement this
quoting for the truth isaac
well it would mean u didnt have to buy a shuttle and no worring about autopiloting to a place you merely click the button choose the destination and poof there u are for a few isk dont see why that wouldnt be such a bad thing
you dont have to buy a shuttle  noob ships and pods also work perfectly well but since paying a few isk isnt a problem for you i figured youd also be fine with paying 10k or so for a shuttle
so you want a jumpclone
this go check out zUFFFD fanfest vid it is the ccp panel
so give the drones a stupidly large cargo space make them salvage one thing at a time and not pick up lootdrone size 25 m3drone cargo size 100m3if they cant pick up loot and have to return when they do get something anything make it a one shot deal then problem is solved
its something they could fix eventually heres hoping they do
ishkur
everyone one has skills they hate and or never trained i would love it if you could delete unwanted skills give it a 24hr peroid and then make it for you have to confirm it but some times i get so angry that when i was a newb i bought some dumb skill and never trained it makes your beautiful all lvl 5 skills broken up by one skill that you never trained or only did lvl 1 of
this must be the epitome of absolutely useless nonsenseif only a single developer had to put 10 minutes into coding it and it would take much more than that it would still be 10 perfectly good minutes of dev and lifetime completely wasted
just because it doesnt look pretty is not a good argument for this featureother than there is no real reason of adding this
oh please get a freaking lifelast thing we need is some jackass wanting to make his skills look good in the name of vanity
of course not that would just be terrible wouldnt it
how about an alteration to the character sheet skills tab an added dropdown box to where you can alter the level of the skill for say learning purposes and formulas you set the skill to the desired level but still have the option to train skills instead of modifying how fast the skills train give a dual ability to affect their level as for testing learning times try this scenario you set all of the learning skills to either untrained or 1 pick a skill say spaceship command set it to level 1 now test the training and other effects on the skills time this would give you the option to just test the times easily or jump straight into different situations bug hunting would be much more efficient and with the added ideas of resets or other possible freeloading players with titan dances testing of new changes would be incredibly accurate this along with the devoted or logically thinking players would create very detailed and well rounded ship configurations and enable inexperienced players to also find their niche in the gameedit tired poor sentence structure and my jumbled ideas enjoy
forget it they talked about this issue a while ago and could not even be bothered to post the results i had to evemail a csm member to get themand his reply was something along the lines ofsorry we didnt post about this erm we forgot devs dont want this were not doing itthey dont want the database changed for any reason on tq  sisi guess they forgot about poss
i like the lp exchange idea but dont see the need for a plugin
its not reducing scammingits called filteringits for people who are smart enough to see straight through them and give them the fingersome of us dont have the time or patience to listen toread that crapso yes id like the ability to tune them out
i dont really care about reducing attempts to scam people i just dont want to have to slog through them looking for legitimate dealssupported
1 definitely and should default to being checked 2 and 3 im less confident of because it seems odd to have exactly one method of filtering people and not others age is one of the more valuable ones but this would still feel weird a firm maybe to these two still proposal is worth supporting for 1 alone

what if he turns out to be tillers alt
i can assure you that i am nobody of consequence 
i dont like him too mysterious hes a scammer trying to get into position
but in the other thread you were defending scammers im confused now
i wasnt defending them just saying whats the point in trying to get rid of them 
if theres no pointmay i have your vote sir
i take isk bribes votes are like 200mil so maybe i dont know think bout it
more like 200k plus a pompous blessing on your endeavours of the day
you seem awfully bothered about this for someone who tries to seem as if he didnt care you know i wub u miss mckinnon but youre just so easy to tease let me guess you got older brotherssisters

that is similar to the relationship i have with the captain i am glad we are having this forthright discussion hatred from nexus notwithstanding
wrong on both counts
hi cat herei was wondering what kind of policies and the like are popular and what is unpopular for csm candidates to speak of i mean the business of pirating is one of the items that will be on my agenda but as to what other policies i may wish to enforce well im at a loss but piracy while at the top of my agenda will hopefully not make up the bulk of itthis isnt a thread to ask what policies are good so i can use them and win deal but i am genuinely interested in what the issues that make players ticki cat oninetails would love to represent you in the most applicable manner possible but at this point i must ask for the communitys ideas to best facilitate this goalwhat do you want out of your csm candidates and how can i provide thatwhat issues are really bugging you and how can i help solve themwhat do you need that you dont have and how can i help you to obtain itjust to reiterate this is not me trolling for things to include in my policy to achieve win but this is a genuine whats on your mind deal so what policies would be useful for a candidate to havemuch love cat xoxoxox
not being antithetical to core elements of gameplay
stfu and gtfo 
how about being the hero against certain core elements of gameplay
i will vote for you if you agree to wear these on all csm meetings you participate in im not too picky so you can wear other cat ears if the type in the link isnt to your liking that is all im asking i can acquire everything else i need without any help
yes i will do thatnow i want cat ears 
like for example carebearism e forgot to add where pompous blazes the trail cat is soon behind lol
id settle for an heroingame of course
welli solemnly promise that if i am elected to be your representative i will wear cat ears to every meetingthats one election promise that is hard to beat
i love you cat no seriously i do
sweet thank you very much i see you have become a part of the campaign machine by having my sig in your sig so many thanks cat stands for justice
you can have a policy of saying all hail enslaverofminmatar in every thread you make that is very good for pr
but how would i get the minmatar vote
thats just silly
but how would you get amarr votes amarr  minnies in the current patch fotm
free holy spirits
if you have to ask what the community thinks then you obviously arent qualified to be in csm if you looked at the forums you would knowalso its impossible to represent everyone and i already know you dont give a damn about the pirates
xindi obviously has no idea as to what hes talking about
despite the comment to the contrary this thread appears to be a what stance do i take to be elected which is something people who want power ask not what somone who wants to help the communityalso so far even cat doesnt seem to be taking this seriously see cat ears commentto apease me id like to see1 that you care2 that you have more on your agenda than getting rid of the pirates in rancertldr cat needs moarbetter goals
if you knew cat you would see she is very qualified for csm and helping us eve ppl and is working hard to be on csmyes she dosent represent everyone lol how can you do that we are innocent travellers who want ppl to hear our voice 
it is true i dont know cat i dont know lots of people that is why more of a showing must be made because so far all i know is that pirates are bad and cat likes to be funny those arent bad things mind you but having one stance on one issue isnt of much help since theres many issues id also be comforted if i knew cat understood the pirates point of viewonce again more caompaigning is neededin other news xindi has a great ideaa questions for cat thread we ask you answer and we get to know the real catsound good
edited now with more contentim gonna type this out in nice long words so maybe some of it will penetrateit sounds as though you have very little opinions of your own and are interested in finding some sort of popular approach that can secure votesyou seem infatuated with the idea of attaining a position that you believe will be seen as important by the community you seem to care about that much more than bettering evein short you aspire to be the very worst type of politician only you want to fulfill your ego by corralling a spot on an advisory board for internet spaceshipsany attempt to describe how pathetic that is would probably be inadequate in scope or intensityi have never seen fit to mock you until now despite this forum and your constant urge to bespatter it constantly with your oral discharge this was tolerable until you sought to screw with something that can actually have a positive effect on this gamecsm members must be of a certain age 21 to participate assuming for a moment that you meet this paltry requirement your level of discourse in this and many other threads youve started on the subject seem to indicate that your presence at a csm meeting would unequivocally result in ccp treating the csm process as a  joke in fact they would be correct at that point and the one best avenue players have for influencing this game would lose whatever credibility it still has in the eyes of its producersin short kindly pull your lower lip over your caldari head and swallowsincerely
this
i will address each of your concernsyour first remark being that i am asking what stance to take to be elected i refer you to my first post if you read more deeply you may discover that i am actually asking for opinions and points of importance rather than electionwinning points i thought that id made that clear in my first postas for the catear remark well if it happens to be a point that someone else has asked for and is suitably funny andor awesome it will be considered hence if i am elected i will be wearing cat ears to the meetings it need not be a serious thing but the lols are pretty decent and to appease you1 that i carei care deeply for the game and i care deeply for the innocent travelers through lowsec it is not neccesarily my position to eliminate these piraty culprits but perhaps to allow greater freedom for the innocents over the criminals people have mentioned that i discriminate against pirates and while that is true to a certain degree security status does a lot of that work without me2 that i have more on my agenda than getting rid of the pirates in rancerwhile piracy will be always on top of my agenda and i for one would like to see some kind of limitation of the gankage that goes on in that system i make no secret of that what i will say though is that come election time i will have to scan my passport and probably reveal who i may be affiliated withpiracy is not the only thing on my mind
also quit forcing me to use punctuation and capitalisation lol
sunday 22nd february 2009present ankhesentepemkah bunyip darius johnson issler dainze lavista vista omber zombie vuk lauwasnt i there
i dont remember you there and the logs say you said nothing so im going with no granted it was 2 weeks ago and i was on painkillers so my memory may have some black holes
no we hardly even had enough people to start the meeting
truly we are losing two giants of the csm
if you dont like the name of the character your contemplating buyingdont buy it
can a csm post a intuitive instruction re the best way to write out a proposal in a format the csms recognise as a lot of proposals dont seem to make it to the meeting because the writing of such a proposal doesnt either explain the topic in way the the csm recognises andor isnt written in a understandable way or is unclear to the csmthis should help the csm in understanding the topics brought forward and help to prevent misunderstandingthankyou
good idea
perhaps you should be asking youre tacklers why a random noob beat them to the loot  or are they noob as well
supporting the pitboss on this one if you kill a wt you should rights to the gear that was on their ship and any one not on the kmin the corp should not be able to steal the gear without any form of danger as for why dont your tacklers just loot the wrecks have you ever been in a fleet fight your tacklers duty shouldnt be to run and scoop a wreck after every kill a little while back we were in a fight and killed 56 ships when we were done we looked for the wrecks they were all looted and salvaged within 1020 seconds of the fight coming to close every single one of the looters was in a noob corp
sounds like a cool idea
sounds fine but frankly id just make it so charters ie rent are required just to keep the tower anchored you dont pay rent the landlord tosses your stuff and gets someone who will all id do is unanchor the things 30 days after the charters ran out a grace period to account for rl issues and back payment required to online themnewbish players who want to muck with the pos side of eve shouldnt have to wardec a 300 person corp just to clear out their abandonned placekeeper tower we ought to at least have to keep them fed with charters to retain rights to the real estate

ok so the nid is ok it has its uses and such but the nagcan anyone justify reasonably why this ship shouldnt be seriously buffedreally this is also just to keep this on the first page until its fixed
supported wholeheartedly just about every character ive played as havent been a part of eve for long mind you has been minmatar and i love the minmatar race lets make the naglfar able to compete with the rest of the dreadnoughts out there for starters
supported the naglfar looks way to good to be as bad as it is
great as if its bad enough to have a bunch of aholes posting on these boards in one coad it yet again happens with a 2nd oneseriously people get a grip on reality stop acting like monkeys throwing piles of  at each othereither you post for or against else stfu and gtfo
signed i especially like the restriction to a single or just a couple of representatives
great topic the deterioration of caod has been a big disappointment of mine for awhile this game is supposed to be for a different class of gamer a large majority of the threads in that forum are complete crap and a deliberate attempt to sabotage the tools given to us by ccpi personally like the idea of corpalliance pr being the only ones doing the posting or banning entire corpalliances as an alternative you simply cant tell people to just ignore that particular forum its part of the game thats like telling people to ignore empire space because itls cluttered with noobseither way ive been playing eve for 4 years now and i have seen the mentality become severely sophomoric and irrelevant please do something about it
just because jade constantine wants a forum where he can advance her agenda without being laughed at doesnt mean that we should give it to him its a disgrace that we are even considering her proposal she can do it on his own forum if she needs a place where no one will point out all his inadequacies we once had a place like the one youre discussing granted we had it after jade was banned for trolling so she never got to participate in it and it died a long slow death of irrelevancy as no one posted in it and no one cared about itcaod does not need to die if it did nothing would fuel the enmity that makes this game worth playing why should i log in if i dont relish shooting my enemies how will i really despise them without some place to get riled up should we all just get along and play nice no and we should not all play jades game because he has tricked a few people with long posts and words they dont understand
goum theres a difference between fiery discussion and outright trolling caod has slowly descended into the latter
unban jade constantine ban all goonies from caod
well for starters i think its posts like this one

community csm is better suited to moderate itself than the moderators as they are closer to the community thus i reject this proposal in favour of the one currently above it that seeks to grant moderation powers to the csm i urge everyone to do the same
the above thread doesnt have anything to do with csm moderating the forums its about raising issues to do with forums without getting a blanket forums are outside csm purview response
argue semantics all you like you support your little pet project while the res of us actually try to solve something luv nacn
the proposal has got nothing to do with individual players but has everything to do with players wanting a cleaner more professional political discussion point with troll posts and flames drastically reducedit just so happens jade typed out some ideas which were actually quite good there were other ideas such asby scagga laebetrovoingame corp interface create a spokesperson position that gives a can post on caod abilityadditional rules costs 25m to appoint or change a spokesperson 1 spokesperson per 50 members in corp other than ceo ceo can always postok now for some off the wall ideasother rule for caod you cannot post on caod if you have less than 50m isk in your wallet 50m isk fine to the poster if get moderated on caod increased severity or frequency of offenses  bansthere are plenty of ideas out there that have been posted all with merits but the end result is a lot of players wantrequire caod to be improvedas i said this thread is not about individuals but about corperations and alliances and having a political forum clean of flamestrollsspam where corpsalliances can have the freedom to post within the rules and not running the risk of their voice being drowned out by hundreds of trolls
erm correct me if i am wrong but cannot alt corps just do the same thing alt alliances already exist in this game and 25milmember is meaninglessall that is needed is to have better moderation just more people to check and delete crappy threads but that creates a problem in that too much moderation makes coad as boring to read as shcs war  politics secionceo only forums would end up having alt corps in them thus ceo being a alt so it does not solve the issue just transfer it coad just needs better policing it does not need new laws
lord waratron the idea is not ceos only but alliance leadersceos and diplomats i would suggest at least 5 depending on how many corps are in that alliance for a alliance maybe 2 or 3 for a corpthis would still allow for a good set of posting however if one person in that entity is warned or banned its not the player thats warned or banned but the entity heshe represents
say it all you want that does not make it true this proposal has everything to do with individual players and you would know this if youd bothered to read the thread in question or look up the history of the person in particularso instead we drown out their voice with zero posts in a forum that no one reads and no one cares about weve tried this forum before it did not work lets not do it again and remove the enmity from caod that fuels the conflict this game was built aroundas well when people troll your thread it goes to the top of the page you would think that by having your thread trolled you would be grateful for the extra exposure that you were being granted if no one posts it gets ignored and falls off the first page and no one reads it again if you want to not read goon posts just ignore them read the things you want certainly the threads in question have proven that such a thing is very possible i mean if it werent you couldnt even have had the thread that sparked this in the first place right it would have been trolled into oblivion and all those long winded nontroll posts that you are pinning so bad for would never have been written maybe the problem is more that people dont want to post long winded nontroll posts rather than they think theyll get trolledyoure right one of them is more honest its the trolling the trolling is more honest
supporting the op
supporting the opalso how interesting it is that those strongly opposed to this idea are the very same that have made it necessary
thats funny i havent seen kenny members here opposing this idea
good ideas m8
indeed  very funny there are though thankfully goons opposing this which makes my statement correct otherwise you might have had a point
personaly i think caod section should be for battlereportsanouncementsnot spamwich is 9999 atm
so what youre saying is it was okay when caod was the stomping grounds of kenny  co but its not okay when goons return the favor got it
whatever cleans it up gets my vote
if thats the way you want to read it then fine there have always been problems with peoplegroups abusing coad my opinion which is what i am contributing here is that things have just got beyond reasonable in recent months sure there are various groups responsible for it  but the worst of the worst offenders are goons again  only my opinion it just happens to be one shared by many many others
how could any supporter of free speech support thisnot only no but hell no
i dont so much see this as a campaign against freedom of speech its more or less supporting the proper use of the forums posts about self destructing nags dont seem to be the proper use of the forums
some very good ideas
supporting this
i was already proposed this idea by more then few players and as leader of one big alliance i totally support this it both small and big alliances can benefit from this i will raise it for the following meeting
i know this is thread necromancy but i recently rejoined eve and thus wasnt here when this was madei throw in my full support for this idea
please bring back events i need a new mothership for freethanksxoxoxoxo
hello ccp i like to roleplay but i am too lazy and lack the imagination to come up with something interesting myself so ccp if you could send one of your employees over to my system and hold my hand so i can roleplay without putting in any effort or initiative that would be great thanks
eve is the only mmo where the players can really create the story and that is how it should be that and the potential corruption and favoritism that can arise from this suggestion is a very bad thing in the very competitive game that eve is just say no to ccp run events
fully supportedi was hopeing for more of this with the on set of faction warefare but was disapointedtribe
this is exactly the problems that must be addressed and if proper measures are taken they are completely preventable just like t20 scandal introduced ccps internal affiars this would fall under their purviewsaying live events shouldnt be introduced because they bring opportunity for corruption is like saying eve online shouldnt be developed because developers can be corrupted its already happened and now more than ever they have protocalls and an entire department dedicated to making sure there is never another t20 which reports to the ceo of ccpif the ceo of ccp is corrupt eve is ed anyway
there is a reason that they removed in game rp events because people unlike ai are biased and prone to corruption we dont want dev resources wasted on something like this
it is entirely preventable especially now with internal affairs reporting to the head of ccp you cant assume the whole of ccp is corrupt
let them rp as much as they want but please dont waste any resources on this ccp
a couple of weeks ago we had biggest longrunning soap opera in eve resolved at last by the destruction of the band of brothers alliance at the hands of goonswarm and allies this is the resolution of a very old plotline  tied into the launch of eve the development of 00 empires  of vital interest to anybody playing a character in the game of eve onlineit was a raging successand i dont think you need to be a rocket scientist to understand what was missing the potential for dev interference lets ing keep it that way now youve finally got it working eh
i support this as it will permit jade to focus on things that he understands well rp as opposed to things that he does not 00
i know that theres enough people irked at this exploit being abused so much and that there are some relatively simple changes that would make it less abusablemy personal favorite is the login timer which would be like a reverse aggro timer1 if you log in in space and only if you log in in space your ship must remain for a minimum of 5 minutes during which time it can be aggroed regardless of whether you are connected or not2 for the 30 second timer after disconnect you are vulnerable to aggro mechanics3 after logging out your warpin point never moves until you have actually completed a warp back to it regardless of how many times you log outthat would mean that anyone who logged in then logged out to move their warpin would be vulnerable to being probed out and aggroed within 5 minutes and would take the logoffskisafe brigade and cut them off at the kneesit would also mean that those who logoff under gatecloak or after hitting the jump button would be able to be tagged with aggro without having to resort to silliness like an aoe weapon on a covert ops
yes please
universal love of this idea is entirely understandable so annoying looking for the damaged item

not sure if all of the above will work out but it is much neededsupported
i agree this is a much needed feature especially for those of use who use drones as primary defensive weapons re mining barge pilotsi would at least like to see it looked atsupported
i like

looks good
this would give drone users a bit more control over their primary weapon systema good thingany improvement to drone aiui would be a good thing
more love for drones is desperately needed these changes seem sound and hopefully some will get implemented drones certainly need it a few commentsgrouped drones why is this needed i guess i dont understand what you mean by this autotarget behavior seems a little too afkcontrol to me and not needed but that is my opinion yes current drone controls are kinda afkcontrolcheck agression flag  needed great ideaotherwise support is given for this idea isaac
i for one support this
i gave some thought to that grouping optionusing that would be more effective than focus fire and reduce load on the server toodrones as they are are afk weapons anyway though
not sure if i like the details of this proposal or not but im all for better more complex drone ai its gotten far better since ive started playing but theres some room to improve yet
supported
while the idea certainly has merit im not sure that youd want to automate too many things in eve that would be the same as setting your guns to automatically target and attack the ones that are tackling youthat and ofcourse you expecting these new drones routines to actually you know work just as they have been able to make drones work properly over the past years with the little amount of variables they currently havethe only real setting id be interested in is attack target closest to shipattack target closest to drone that in itself is not overpowered but takes care of most of the issues without taking away the requirement to actually think about what youre doing it couldshould also be something ccp devs could actually make workso not supported sorry
yes please
ive noticed that a lot of the time in a big fleet people get killed and lag makes it so that their pod just sits there while the session changes and they spam the warpto button this makes it easy for enemies to podkill themwhy not have a warpto command instead of having to rightclick and hit the warp to 0 or the warp to buttonwe have a targeting function ctrl  left mouse why cant we have a warp functionctrlw  left mouse or w  left mousei think that this would be a very helpful tool to have in the gameno it would not reduce pvp in any way by the time you really need to use this you are already out of your combat ship and in your podwhat say you
never really had a problem if i know i am going down i just change over to my run tab and start spamming a random moon and i never have an issue unless there is a bubble of course
not a terrible ideabut i seriously wonder if thats needed however it seems to be a thought out idea its one of a few command keys we could use so supportisaac
simple logical and not overpowered
since this can be achieved with an overview tab might as well just implement it
bumpity thanks for your supporti personally think that this is a simple addition and would greatly help many people through something small and simple
i guess you guys havnt realized what the rest of the lame eve world that cant pilot a ship has allready the hot key you speak of is ctrl q i dont see why we need a button to remove thinking from the game a proper overview setup goes a long way
this change is stupid allowing a skill to train when someone takes a break from the game encourages return business
bring back ghost trainingcalling it an abused bug is a absurd joke when it was touted as a feature not so long ago in ccps own player guide and marketing informationlet me guess though the inability to train all the characters on your account concurrently is still a feature and not a bug
youre avoiding the question yet againalliances can already exist only one corp in them the key to the problem is allowing a corp to be kicked out of the alliance immediately without a period of time in between when a player is kicked out of the corp hisher roles have to be removed and theres a period of 24 hours before she can be kicked if you argue that alliances arent corps then youre only support the fact that this is an oversight and in need of revisitingit doesnt do as much damage as people seem to think it does  i think you should rethink that statement to be closer inline with the truth your alliance and your leader have done nothing but lobbying the damage that has been done since the opportunity to exploit an oversight presented itself in form of a disgruntled director with too much power in his handand pendantic isnt a word in the english language yet so i think its safe to say that your entire post make no sense whatsoever
people keep drawing parallels between what happened to bob and conglomerates in real life but the whole picture is not taken into considerationin real life you can kick all the corps in a conglomerate but it can not be done overnight too much paperwork and light stepping is involved to avoid a potentially bankrupting lawsuit this was an oversight by ccp and should be addressededitlet us forget an alliance a disgruntled director firing all the employees in a corp cos he was dissatisfied with the way he was treated will spend the rest of his career making money to pay his exemployees
i say the game mechanic should be modified im saying modded do to some real corps do have 1 person in charge and by working with or for someone with that much power this is what can happen now i suggest that instead of one or the other something needs to be added what i purpose is that an option be included for larger alliances maybe 7 and up corps that they can divvy the power up between the corp their for giving them votes to kind of like dictatorship vs republic ccp can work out the finer details remember when bill gates owned microsoft he could have destroyed the corp that he built but let people buy stock and he didnt own the company anymore but stock holders they voted a board of directors that to gether made the decision as you can see one person or many can deside peoples fate i think thats what needs to be added
auto targeting this must be why my blockade runner exploded that crushed me where is the crying like a baby emote
that oh and signed
supporting this as well as several other good points raised in this thread

anything to improve the pos
how about you bums actually read the original fuel brick thread instead of just wanting anything new manufacturingwise and not reading anything looking at you lvv you should actually think about what ccp proposedit is a bad plan with numerous downsides that have been gone over repeatedly in that thread there are many playercreated ideas in that thread that are better than the original ccp ideaits pretty obvious that people in this thread cant handle more than a few sentences so i will try to paraphrasethe proposal was meant to streamline pos logistics however it only made it more complicated good idea bad proposed mechanics fail
whats so complicated about letting carebears gather materials and turn them into a use all fuel pellet
i read a dozen or so pages of it a few months back and while there were some legitimate complaintsmost notably that poses would no longer serve as backup fuel depots for capital jump drives it still seemed to me that the consensus was broadly in favour its been a while so my memory may be wrong but i thought people liked it if ccp decided that the idea wasnt worth doing then fair enough but when a thread has been stickied for that long itd at least be polite to have a dev post and say actually never mind instead of just pulling it down and letting it die
saved overview tabs will now display in the correct alphabetical order it would be great to have the same thing for drone groupscarrier pilots would love thisand also if posible to add subgroopex groop  subgroupheavy  em
i dont know about you but my drone groups have always displayed in correct order im for subgroups though
you are correct here resources are hard to come by because everyone else is out to get their hands on the massive amount of available resources war decs play right into this penny my buysell orders and you get a decthe rest of this drivel is pointless you people as in the people declaring war know exactly what the carebears are doing because gasp their alts are the carebears sure they will deny it but its the truth
war decs are no longer made over resourcesthat is an utter lie and you people know itwar decs are made over whatever the hell they want to make it overand over 95 of them are over because they can and want to kill your ships reasonas for the carebears whom you refer to being the ones manufacturing those ships and materialswell duhif you cant see thatyour really are blindthe market is player driven that stuff doesnt come from some fanciful fictional time warp in space its manufactured or gathered from missionsthe greater majority of industry and manufacturing takes place in 00 space however as most corps have to be very large or in an alliance as no new corp ever makes it past the gauntlet of wardec greifing that takes placeyou want to make wardecs more interestingtake away the single reason why they happen in the first place the ability to kill without concord and make it literally what you pretend to think it isif it was over resources then make it over resources literallyinclude materials shipsbpos territory there are many things of value that would put the motivation and driving factor in wardecsbut as it is wardecs are literally a joke to me ok corp a wardecs corp bwow corp a is doing it because corp b is small and easy prey corp a will never wardec someone bigger than they are unless they get other corps to join incorp b leaves corp and goes to altswaht did you expect to happen them sitting there letting you blow upwelcome to game theroy 101 folks that or human naturei have no issues with wardecs but stop fooling yourselves try 00 space for a bit and see what real wardecing is all aboutwardecs are an outlet to forced pvpregardless of what you people think of eve its not about 100 nonconsenual pvpif it was it would be much like warhammer online and anyone and everyone would pvp anywhere at anytimeof course i wouldnt like it very much if it was no pvp at all in high sec it would make life rather boringmy point is seek a middle road a balance and stop making crap up for enforcing either sidethe carebears hate it because its forced on them so build a mechanic that will make it a bit lucrative for them to fight backthe pvpers like the blood and the tears fine make it a bigger and more difficult challenge not the iwin button they smack because they have more ships than you doisk is too easy to make wardecs fees are too damn cheap this cycle will be exponentially infinite and impossible to stop until you both manage to agree on something
the csm was very surprised a few months ago to discover that the forum moderation team had placed itself beyond the purview of the csm the reasoning behind this was stated by wrangler as being that the csm is meant to deal with game issues and the forums are somehow separate from this i move that this is a farcical conclusion and that the forums are very much a part of the game if that is not the case then why have forums at all why maintain them why have forums based on the game if they provide no benefit or have no impact on the gamealliances and corporations do indeed action based on what happens on the forums as such i say that the forums are very much a part of the game and the forum moderation team is just as in need of the csms oversight as anything elsei will not delve into specifics except to say that at a high level someone needs to be responsible and there does need to be oversight regarding actions taken on behalf of the community on these forums this thread will serve as a discussion point for that subject and i believe personally that the csm needs to get involved as the moderation team has been found wanting why should the forums be treated any different than any other aspect of eve what about the forums is so magical that they should be able to operate with immunity this is stupiddiscuss

if the forums arent part of the game why do we need to use our game login to obtain access in order to post if they are not part of the game why can actions here result in our game accounts being banned they are as much a part of the game as anything else they should not be excluded from the oversight of the csm
i support this discussion and might pop back in later with some actual commentary on the situation
oversight is good
if there are issues it would be good for the csm to be able to raise those issues

forum moderation should fall under the perview of the csm while ccp has done a great job of cleaning up the in game cronyism there still exists the potential for forums cronyism which a careful observer can see it is ridiculous that the forum mods are not put up to the same scrutiny every other part of the game is from the csm

yase
as members of the eve player community the forums are ours not wranglers the moderators work for the community therefore we should have every right to tell them how to do their jobs the fact that any of them think otherwise is a major problem
the forums are in dire need of an overhaul if the csm can get it done sooner rather than later good for them
confirmin dis
the forums are there for the community as is the csm to have the forum moderators not held accountable to the community is akin to allowing a vampire to hold the keys to a blood bankfurthermore
i too confirm dis
i wouldve never thought to agree with goons but i support this
it would be nice to hold the forum mods accountable to the player base
supporting this
i have seen week bannings handed out for things our enemies have also done without repercussion stop the madness heal the world
i support this product andor service
openness transparency fofofoing
supported
i will kill you if you vote no for this
irl
no one should be above answering for their actions
irl
boo yah
all the csm does is say stuff it has no powerthe forum mods dont want the csm banging on about forum stuff because it feeds into an angst cycle on the boards and most players dont give two s about the forums
provote
yes
i support this
i also like this idea
yes
i thought the forums was the game and the spreadsheets in the stars are just to pass time
have to agree
quis custodiet ipsos custodesedit thats a serious point and not just a reference to topical movies who watches the watchers is a fundamental axiom of natural law im appalled after the shocking history of the moderation team in the past which was one of the key reasons for the creation of the csm institution for newer players who are unaware that the current team think that they are above oversight
voting yesthe csm should have input into how the forums are moderated including but not limited to penalties for inappropriate posts
is this where we all get banned for blank posting
i believe i agree
more needed here than in deciding blockade runner slot layouts
yes
ok you can stop the debate i lend it my imprimatur
the forums moderators are inconsistent and present an image of bias against certain individuals due to no apparant reason other than their corpalliance while its hard to point at a single incident the little snips here and there begin to add upmoderators also have a reputation for not reversing their decisions no matter how bad or foolish that decision may be should a moderator make a judgement not in line with apparent policy we the players have no way to highlight or argue the point since all moderator criticism gets immediately censoredccp are quite entitled to keep the moderation separate and able to operate with impunity against certain groups but picking and choosing where to apply the transparency means you might as well have none at allsorry wrangler but you need to answer to someone 
yup
amen
free dj
i fully support this these boards are for the discussion of ingame activities and as such should fall under the purview of the csm hopefully ccp will actually listen to usthe csm about thisalso free darius johnson
i support this idea and i would like to expand upon itassuming a successful election outcome for myself captain pompous i will enquire as to the feasibility of devolving forums moderation to individual playerled groups in each forum section and then on occasion rotate the mod crews if nothing else it will provide jollies and keep everyone on their toes for they will never know from where the lockhammer might fall
the idea that the forums are unrelated to the game is nonsensical at best and deliberately misleading at worst cmon guys dont pee on my leg and tell me it is raining
why would there need to be any oversight over the forums that isnt driven by the player base id like to know that the people moderating the discussions at least had a rudimentary knowledge of game mechanics and politics who better defines those qualities than a csm
i agree
i concure
100 in support of this
i agree
agreed
supported
why doesnt the csm have this already support it
nothing should beyond the control of the players except things that should be but this isnt one of them
the forums are a vital extension to the game as they are the primary source of information for players not directly involved in an event this is made especially crucial given that the ingame news that comes up every once in a while only covers truly spectacular events well mostly and as such smaller stories tend to go unnoticedif the forums are an important part of the game experience it stands to reason that the moderation thereof should be a topic for discussion by the csm
i agree whole heartedly
this has always baffled me as well ive seen many topics being closed as offtopic or not relevant even though it is crystal clear to all the involved parties what the thread is about and why it is relevant often this is obvious from the reactions as well but the thread still gets closedso why do we let forum moderators who appear to have little clue of what is actually going on in the game to interpret these kinds of actions in the most favorable light imaginable decide what is somehow relevant
no moderation without representation
agreed
not supported this smells of a mob
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
sounds good to me
response to moderated post removed  mitnal
not supported bias screams too loudly here
bias is the problem in the first place i think the council would take umbrage with the fact that you would lump them in with the goons
i support this proposal
i dont think he did threaten you irl it was char to charalso im concerned re your wording of perview it suggests to me that the gmsmoderators have to report to the csms no matter if they maybe all goons or not who knows what future block voting may cause in their decisions re punitive measures re rule breaking on the forumtbh as i said id rather that decision remain with ccp although i would support ccp involving the csms re forum changes andor to include punitive measures for continous rule breakers 
it places the mods on the same playing ground as everyone else in ccp char to char or irl is up to the mods to decide unfortunately thats a bad thing
currently if you want to change say your standings to make someone blue or reset the standings the person needs to be in the executing corpoften diplomatic roles go to other people in the alliance not necessarily in the executing corpi would like ccp to work on improving this system creating literally a board of members who can be given alliance roles1 this will mean that diplomats wont require to be in the executing corp needlessly or have an alt in said position2 at the same time increased security can be achieved in order to potentially protect an alliance if they are smart with who they give said roles toso for example anyone in the alliance could be given the alliance role of diplomat which grants you the role of changing standings on behalf of the allianceanother might be called recruiter who is capable of reviewing and accepting application from corporations into the allianceanother might be called warmonger who is capable of issuing changes to wardecs or even declaring them
i dont have a problem with this per se but what is so hard or dangerous about putting an alpha clone alt in the executor corp
like the idea especially if its as part of a broader overhaul of corpalliance role mechanics they need a lot of work its not difficult merely stupid and unnecessary alts are wonderful things but they shouldnt be relied upon as a workaround for poorly implemented mechanics
this would be damn sexy to have if only for moviemaking
quite true
i like it its rather refreshing and so thus supported
as a progressive human and a gallente i raise this very important issue to any societyi was recently gagged on the help channel accused of trolling after i told an ism he was abusing his position tat i was paying his salary although i see ism doesnt get paid and writing freedom of speech after heshe was telling someone not to use the word fg watever tat means i wasnt angering and offending the community as per rules and policy but stating my point of view i really wonder why they were telling the other person not to use that word why some people think one word is worse than another why they deem one word obscene and not for example the words kill murder i dont think any word should be censored censoring prevents the spread of information hinder progress science and even moral the use and giving or not giving second meaning to words is a matter of personal beliefs objectivity and degree of intelligence a word is a word period whatever meaning anyone give it is up to those people for any organization censuring it for being obscene just indicates a tribal belief system and not much of intellectual advance progress or freedomit was a disturbing experience being gagged because not only i could not talk to my corp members or write mail which are completely unrelated to the situtation they didnt ask me nor i could raise my concerns ask for a supervisor or ask where to go to make my point which actually is the very same thing that happens to journalists in totalitarian regimes i believe freedom of speech is essential to any civilized and advanced society and the restriction of which comes to repression and injusticehopefully this situation was an isolated one and not system wide policy of eve online say no to censorship and long live freedom of speech
ive heard this term freedom of speech bandied across the forums quite a lot latelystanding on a soapbox airing your views is one thing but airing your views in a racist defamatory or obscene way is not freedom of speech and it isnt what freedom of speech is all abouti suggest you grow and wake up me lad
there is no freedom of speech here this is an internet spaceships game not the enlightenment
freedom of speech is the right to have an opinion not the right to say anything you wantif it was the right to say anything you wanted i could call you a dumb  who cant see or read or understand and that your totally  and full of  and so stupid you cant see straightbut i canto
freedom of speach is a right of citizens of some nations im pretty sure there is no bill of rights in the eula
you have no freedom of speech when youre using ccps stuff their servers their rulesalso the word youre misusing is censor to censure is to punish to censor is to restrict or prevent something from being saidyoure pretty much wrong in every possible way including the ability to type coherently construct a sentence or create a paragraph you have failed in your understanding and you have failed to make a cogent argument in even the remotest sense of the word
im going to beat a dead horse here because1 i like doing it and 2 im at work and i am boredfreedom of speech does does not exist in an mmo due to the fact that1 it is not a country that has freedom of speech and 2 op is a silly person i needed a 2 and this was all i could come up with
freedom of speech is a legitimate human right freedom to use someone elses resources to express that speech is not i have no right to speak in someone elses house to be published in someone elses newspaper or to post on someone elses server the only thing that freedom of speech encompasses is the right to use resources at my disposal to express opinions and spread information without fear of government persecutionsubject to limits like libelslander laws privacy copyright incitement to violence restrictions etc swearing in a public chat channel of one particular computer game is not a human right and suggesting that it is is a sad mockery of what legitimate human rights are for learn to act like a gentleman in public places and respect the space that ccp lets you use instead of trying to defile it by doing things that you have been explicitly told you should not do eve isnt counterstrike
if stupidity was a crime the op would be executed ingame
it is really sad to see how careless and not knowledgeable about freedom of speech people are unfortunately same is in society in general with the end result very appreciable abuse wars jailings torture killings even our own life span for people against freedom jammed science for thousands of years claiming it was obscene and killing everyone who tried to bring research or improvement to human kind 1 the more you in your own home your company your online game yourself dont let someone else be free to speak as they want the more you are endangering society to fail as a free civilization one person or one million people you are endangering society for restricting speech 2any restriction to speech is dangerous aracist such race has this more cases of disease than such race banned speech for being racial end result hindering health research bobscene dont teach people about sexually transmitted diseases end result spread of sexually transmmitted diseases and increase population mortality this actually happens in many countriescdefamatory someone presents evidence that a politician is involved in a crime witness jailed for defamation end result spread of crime i wont mention countries where this happens regularlyddangerous speech someone yells fire gets arrested for being there no fire next time no one yells fire for fear of being mistaken there was a fire end resultwidespread destruction freedom is an absolute with many categories that stand in direct opposition to each other certainly as such one might choose which freedom to restrict and which to free because yes freedom can destroy other freedoms and be even a danger to itself but in undergoing this task humanity is prone to make many mistakes we really shouldnt tamper with freedom unless absolutely necessary doing so imperils our own existence so we have to be careful in curtailing freedom and not doing it wantonly as it is done sadly most of the time many people unfortunately dismiss freedom as nothing important but its actually of the utmost importance so much so that millions have died throughout the entire human history in order to defend it or to achieve it so there is no context where freedom should become irrelevant freedom is always relevant long live freedom
so what your saying is i can call you a total liar and an idiot and theres not a damn thing you can do about it especially if we all agree and refuse to accept anything you say as fact rightreality is cold just like evewelcome to eve online
i could go on and try to let you know in how much you are wrong but to be honest acwdc78 i wouldnt know where to startit would be like trying to tell a terroist they are wrong in blowing people up or telling a police officer to go screw himself or even better trying to advise a racially bigotted person not to go to ethnic minority area wearing  propogandapeople like yourself dont know about free speech because you just havent a foggiest notion what its about but as others have said this is a forum provided by ccp its not a political debate re ethics or moralitygo stand on a soap box in a public street and mouth your free speech ideas and not on these forums
close the loophole better safe than sorry
helloi have one idea for shorten our journey through the empire only empire i thinkthat the ccp put the specialized star gates in the certain solar systems that we can jump 5 or 10 jumps through empire at onceand with thatit would be interesting to play eve
well im often on the road in althrough the empire2030 jumps constantly and i must say that i like the idea of somewhat superhighway that would shorten the time between systemslets face it 2030 jumps are simply boooring and when you got nothing to do afk you can only count flies on your monitor or write haiku poemsthumbs up from me
not supported keep space huge
so you measure eve space by the time wasted traveling beetween jumpgates interesting
yes because that distance is measured in kilometers or au and the size of a galaxy is also determined in km or au most used of course lightyearsback on op post i have to say no because it would make trading between big hubs too easy for traders if they want money they got to put an effort in it be flying around shooting npcs or probing down plexes
space is supposed to be huge it should take a long time to fly somewhere that is the price you pay for moving between trade hubs i would only support this if they charged a fee for each jump like a toll road 10  20 million isk per jump sounds fair
theres this thing called jump cloning i hear its really good
they do have gates linking systems 1020 jumps away  see niarjakaaputnen thing is once such gates are in place the systems are no longer 1020 jumps away theyre adjacent this is one of those cases where you want something you cant have because you dont realize what you do have also even if you amend your proposal to be make space smaller i still disagree space is just fine  i spend most of my time about as far from jita as its possible to get in highsec and its about 25 minutes for me to get there on autopilot while afk or more like 15 if i fly manually space is fairly small yeah its more of a pain in a slow ship like a freighter or a plated battleshipi remember one day i flew about 120 jumps in a 3plate 3trimark bs to protect from suicide gankers took me about 15 hours but such is the price you pay theres no need to make space even smaller its not that big as is i prefer tradeoffs existing as opposed to just you should always fly the biggest thing you can and distanceflight time is one good way of doing that
how about a boost to fighters such that they have roughly 5 chance of warp scrambling the target very similar to ratsthusly a carrier with 10 fighters has the chance of up to 50 of the time scrambling the target mom with 20 fighters would have roughly a chance of up to 100 of the time scrambling
you fail at probabilities with twenty fighters the chance of being jammed would be 109520 or about 64aside from that itll never happen support is there to jam targets you dont fly a carrier solo right and if you really wanted to you can fit a jammer
erm what jamwarp scrambler  ecm jamming even though ya gurista rats do jamyes i fail at probabilities i didnt bother calculating it because 5 is just a random  i gave i said up to instead
i meant to write scrammed woopsanyway to expand on what i said above holding targets down is the role of support if theres a thing carriers dont need its an increase in their viability solo which would be the effect of your suggestionand if you really want to tackle in a capital ship they can already fit officer tackle mods without being crippled by grid use
please stop posting your worthless crap ideas jason
this is not a good idea sincerely since carriers are support ships and with the fighters following people around in space as it is warping this would overpower them if you want your carrier to scram get a oh well anything except a chimera and put a scram in midsother than that i would like to see some diversity in fighters by adding new categories of fighters so we can step away from the old cookie cutter drone setup
id like to see a missile drone that occasionally has to dock to reload but then im a sucker for realism
im sorry jason but i do have to agree with him
as soon as you stop trolling every goddamn thread in this forum with your insults and your nonconstructive contributions i am sure he will likewise stopgot it good
you honestly think thats going to workor are you just an alt of jason yeah thats the tickethow about you go back to cp where you belong eh
way to make false assumptionsand how about you go back to under your bridge theres a good laddie 
sorry fresh out of bridges to busy keeping the idiots away
yeah drakes a fairly cranky fellow but so far as i can tell his disagreements are legitimate and mostly reasonable just because he expresses his opinions with a certain lack of subtlety doesnt make him a troll jason on the other hand is  hes used that word to describe himself  and thus the flaming is fairly legit i just wish hed stop deriving so much amusement from acting like an idiot  he has reasonable things to say when he wants to he just prefers to fool around and  people off sad really as for the idea in case its not obvious i think its silly fighters are fine
i am the original jason edwards flamer i stopped he still posts i simply ignore him nowreally he just needs to be posting in features and ideas but unfortunately this forum has no moderation
everyone has vices i just have this onecourse its not because i enjoy it i use it to vent my stress  o p
in regard to fabricated killmails theres another option they could do digitally sign themwith a digital signature anyone can verify the contents have been unaltered using the public key but only ccp could generate the signatures using the private key so anyone who tried to alter the text couldnt come up with a correct signature anyone who tried to verify the signature would identify the document as fabricatedit would effectively be a seal of authenticity that the document has not been altered in any way
first of all the ops idea has merit but unfortunately its not a idea i can support it would mean further trafficking of info on the servers creating a addition to the work loadsecondly killmails has always been a unexact science and to be fair its up to the individuals that are interested in them to post them on the various sites advailable if its stats you want ie via the insurance entity that pays out for loss of ships then im sure a statician somewhere can tell u how many ship types were killed in whatever period but thats about as interesing watching mould grow on my coffee lolnot supported because i believe any extra exchange of info re kills and killmails will put xtra load on the system and i wouldnt vote on anything that may cause this
this would be a good thing
why not
supported maybe something like a sky marshall skill requires fc5 each level allows you to command one fleet
im going to use a bad word nowmake it consensualie player says i want out if ceo then says off you go hes gone with no waiting timeif either one for whatever reason wants out but the other doesnt let him go hell have to waitinstakick by ceo can be abused just as instaleave canif both agree its their own fault if something is missing afterwards
if you switch corps so much that it bothers you then youre probably doing the exact thing the whole 24 hour stasis period is designed to counterdeternot supportedwhile it does make a whole lot of sense it makes fleeing from a wardec way too easy if they would change the wardec rules regarding people leaving in favour of the wardeccer that is then i would surely support your idea
all missiles suck in comparison to the other weapon types for pvp
needs a fix
if i need to move my pod afk i usually just buy a cheap frigate and an mwd put the mwd in the f1 position set your autopilot and tape down the f1 button as you drop warp the mwd activates and if the cycle ends before you hit the gate a fraction of a second later it is activated again this is the quick lazy mans afk
buying shuttles is good for industrialist bank accounts but so annoying buying a shuttle and trashing it when you arrive to keep your assets list clean is effectively the same thing as the proposal there are plenty of other items for industrialists to manufacture for profitgood idea and would help create a sense of realism i would even go so far as to make it possible for a player to elect to receive a free shuttle rather than rookie ship from their insurance company
you know you can just sell or reprocess the shuttle afterward right

i have no idea why i didnt quit when i found out about learning skills i think i was doing them as my alternate overnight skill while i trained more immediately useful things during the dayi dont care about getting reimbursed if they get removed its just water under bridge newbies are more important than anythingfurthermore i find the comments about evemon a little offputting its a great tool but i always feel a little whenever i start playing a new game and everyones like here are all the third party utilities you need to make it not suck when you guys wonder about people who are too stupid to use evemon i cant help but think thats me only im too lazy to juggle a bunch of extra  to go with all my games in short evemon is not to my mind a newbiewinner
great idea lavista wheres the thumbs up buttonperhaps a web based ballot is feasiblei would be content for now with voting on the csm generated wish listeach main character could be evemailed the link the player logs in and votes a yes or a no on items heshe wishes to be brought before ccp by the csmthat way others will know that not everyone is in favor of disposing of learning skills better hurry folks ive trained mine and now im catching up to you
so lavista you want us two steps removed from ccp now weve got to bend your ear for even the possibility word in with the developersccp could get better player feedback from ingame or web based polling on hot button issues and save a bunch of time effort and money in the process the candidates generally have no special insight or expertise time to drop the whole thing and listen to the entire player base not just the pet issues of a small clique
nvm 
good policies are good bad ones are bad
actually i have a better idea nowyou can have a policy of saying vote pompous in every post you make that will add irony to your post and that is even better for pr
negativei have asked my friends and colleagues in eve to throw the occasional vote cat into their conversations just because i think she is awesome
geographical location triangulation engagedneed two more hits to pinpoint source that was a well setout and well thought series of responses to sindis questions cat
ah yes the next election will be so much fun
hello eve pplcat has come up with some other ideas for csmcat oninetails  the welfare of rodents will always be a priority for catvote cat and the server hamsters get replaced with hyper gerbils to fight lagcat oninetails  i support actions against isk sellersvote cat if you hate isk sellers cat oninetails  black ops ships have made it onto my agenda vote cat cat will fix itwe support every 17th of march for love day in eve too and i think its very important for making ppl in eve happy especially piratesthats it for now im sure she will come up with more tho vote cat and get your ideas here too 
hehe i at least have the good grace to more or less suspend csm things whilst the captain is indisposed
i think cat has outclassed your sig in horrendousness sorry budalthough holy  i just realised yours is interactive
personally ill be voting for a candidate who supports policies that they think are right rather than those that they think are popular
cat 4 csm belives were doing whats right for eve and what will make it better for most ppl were not popular to pirates lol cuz a lot of our ideas will make it harder for them to get away with killing ppl all day and not get punished anymore i think their sex status should keep going down and not stay at 10 so youd have people with like 200 but im sure cat has better ideas 
we aim to please lol
yes please
cat disagress with you
agreed
no she is just seeing what ppl think it dosent mean shes only going to bring up those things only haha ooops stupid laptop keys
lets see some of these policies then
this pretty much sums it up  cat wants to do this for all the wrong reasons and not only has no idea what the right reasons are but would have no way of representing anyone properly except her little palsalso unless cat is deliberately pretending to be an idiot theres no way she is over 21 so this is all a moot point
post your pic if you have nice boobs youll get elected no matter how dumb your ideas no need to thank me enjoy the holiday
thisi also feel you dont get eve at all your incessant bleating about removing pirates from the game has become tiresome pirates always have been and will contine to be an integral part of the game your crusade to remove them is doomed to failure i suggest if you want to play a game where everyone is happy and plays nicely you try a game ironically involving kitties i think it will suit your playstyle and apparent level of maturity far betterthere are many areas of eve which are far more in need of attention most of which i personally doubt you are even aware ofanyway hals und beinbruch ingamekras
yeah these two quotes sum it up nicely cat is eithera a proper troll who is laughing with juvenile delight because hes managed to get people to believe hes really an idiot by well acting like an idiot  or  b a slightly educationally subnormal childeither way cat seems to think that his way is the only way to play and that anyone playing as a pirate is playing the game wrong  this attitude at the very least should disqualify himher for runningand what about the agelimit of 18 or 21  how do they check that arent we just humouring a silly little child who isnt even eligible for this
my only meeting that i missed then
supported the tempest and maelstrom are both currently garbage and id love to have all the sp i sunk into them be worth something finally training t2 lasers anyway though
anything to make these ships not suck balls
nobody else any comments 
missiles suck a little to much now
delete caod forever
got to be good
i got bored reading the op after a couple of paragraphs and would be disappointed to think whatever boring  the op was talking about got funding from ccpbut going by the thread title id say fck live events in the past they have been abused and tilted towards rewarding certain groups if the roleplayers want to pretend their real lives dont exist let them but ccp should spend more time on worthwhile topics such as 00 incentives
imma support this even tho its contrary to ccps official line of why have a ui feature available in 2 clicks when you can have it in 9
i like the idea of a pos fitting screenused in conjunction with the dead horse idea now that would be a patch worth waiting forsetup on screen fly componants out to moon and deploywatching drones assemble the full pos while you wait
pos kill people
totally agreegames are suppose to be fungames are not suppose to make you want to kill yourself from boredom and tedious repetition sounds like ratting tooon that note cheers to all the pos keepers
reply and bump and support even tho daveydweeb is terrible
i have a proper overview setup and i lose my pod whenever i fight i run eve on a decent machine i do not doublebox do not run anything else etc whatever it is about the session change it takes long enough that someone can lock and pod you moving the mouse over to whatever i am warping to while rightclicking and hitting warpto repeatedly just sucks its that extra fiveten seconds before i die that could be used in an attempt to overheat my repper guns or abmwd in an attempt to escape certain death by the time your target needs to use this youve already won so i really dont see why you are arguing against it
duh
signed and supported
oknever package 2 items like thisi like the autopilot thing but i dont understand the game well enough im new myself to like or dislike the autotargetting from a game design perspectivetherefore i cant support this logroll
isnt this covered in the tutorial also if they allow idiots to buy guns i am sure people who play eve have the brains to learn
the surprising thing about this idea is that it was suggested by ccp them selvesand even with alot of yes please from the people that posted on the idea thread there has not been anything heard of it for a long whileccp please do this idea
signed
at the risk of needing fire proof undergarments im going to take a stab at offering some fixes for wardeccing1 both corps involved become locked that is neither can add or drop members during the war  if players leave the corp of their own volition the war target flag follows them for 7 days or until they get podded once also they cant rejoin the corp until after the war2 wardec fees go up 10000000  10000000 for every other war dec you have currently open to declare a wardec weekly fee of 1 isk per skill point difference between sp total of deccing corp and sp total of target corp with a minimum of 25 million per week so if you have a 20 million sp corp and you dec a 10 million sp corporation its going to cost you 10000000 a week admittedly thats mostly aimed at reducing the griefing but if you really want to great by all means pay for it3 npc bribery both sides can bribe npc corporations to take sides fees would be exorbitant on the order of tens of millions and of course the other side can out bid suddenly npc stations might start refusing to let you dock and shooting at you4 spies specifically npc spies that could be hired to report not only player locations but ship fits etc5 surrender allow one corp or the other to surrender  basically they make a surrender offer and the other corp gets to accept or decline it  they could sweeten the pot with isk or equipment what have you6 redecs wardeccing the same corp within 30 days doubles all associated fees  again this is aimed at lowering greifingthats all ive got at the moment its all off the cuff  and lets face it its not going to change any time soon im mostly just trying to offer some kind of solutions rather than just whining about it
what corp are you in
madprops
now why do i suspect there is more to this thread than meets the eyecould it be the very high percentage of voters from one single alliancecould it be the curious use of language in the opcould it be the couple of incautious comments from certain respondentscould it be the timingin conclusion im a bit wary about supporting this kind of motion without seeing precisely what the make up of the next csm will be if the turnout is low and we end up with a majority of csms from a single powerbloc the risk is that the kind of behaviour weve seen recently on caod will be given official sanction from the csm and the reputation of the csm as a viable entity would be damaged profoundly as a resulthence im not prepared to give my support to this motion until i see the results of the next election and id advise anyone on the fence in regard to this issue to hold off casting a vote likewisei would suggest people looking to make a serious improvement in caod right now should read this topic and cast a vote there for the issue of caod spam and low standards of posting thereall the best
no i agree with ccp the csm is supposed to be dealing with ingame issues not forums not websites the game eve online i mean seriously the csm is a bunch of players that signed up to be in a group of people that voice the opinion of the player base they are not an oversight committee if they ever became that i would fight it or quit eve the csm is neither qualified nor voted in for that reason why is everyone so desperate that ccp have an oversight committee they arent a government heck they dont even have the biggest player base in the world if anyone should have one it should be wow but i dont see anyone crying for one for them either way its not needed if your so tied into this game that you feel that ccp is some sort of government that needs governing you need to take a vacation from eve this idea is moronic and stupid and im frankly appalled that any csm has any support for this idea you need a reality check isaac starstriker
you two disappoint me i didnt think it could get worse but you two proved otherwise at least the guy who i least respected the least didnt have a powerhigh saddening truly saddeningisaac
man thats a lot of words nobody cares about does it burn you up that this topic has been up less than 24 hours and has more support than any single one of the assinine issues you raised yes it does we cant all be winners
is it just me or is it goonswarm and all their alts that support this why is ccp blind to this utter bullshyte first they ruin coad now they turn the whole csm thing into a friking joke you are all fools
ask ccp why they set it up the way they did you act as if the csm has created itself
youre going to be pretty upset when this passes
oiuwhy dont you enlighten me either way csm is fine the way it is and to be very honest no other game has a csm like this we get something really unique and all we can do is complain about it very stupid in my opinionisaac
i agree you should probably be more positive in the future
also on the fence  i think id like to see the mods actually cleaning up the forums before we worry about who they report to
you seem pretty sure it will pass wonders whytbh i doubt anyone in ccp will agree with this regardless as to how many of the goonsand their alts vote as the op suggests taking the power away from ccp re the forums into the hands of players which is something i and every other person with any sense would not wish to see while the forums are treat in such a irresponsible way
the op does not suggest taking away power from the mods it suggests that ccp mods should be obliged to answer the csm with regard to questions concerning the inconsistent application of moderation policies and similar related issuesif you think the op is suggesting that ccp should reinstate something like the isd again i suggest you read again also ask yourself whether you seriously think that any goons would ever vote in favor of such a proposal so no thats not what the proposal suggests
wow you are incredibly bitter about being irrelevantperhaps go and post this elsewhere on your beloved badly moderated forums and take someone up on their offer of can i has ur stuff
i did read the op and after reading it  the word purview means the range of operation authority control concern etcthis means to me that the csm will have authority and control over the modsccp re the forums
so you disagree with the assertion that the moderation immunity is nonsense there really isnt anything hidden in the language of the op that i can see the csm as far as i know does not get to decide how things are run they address ideas and ultimately ccp decides based off information your suspicion is just you trying to get a rise successful from people by being controversial for no good reason  aka you are trolling under the guise of intelligent discourseif the population as filtered through the csm wants the forums to be moderated in a more balanced fashion such as equally banninggagging you and your trolls along with the trolls you respond to for an example then ccp should have that pressure applied to them
makes an obvious joke to a friendgets permabannedyeah id say the mods need some oversight
supported also permaban jade constantine
well whether an error in the writing or not its all rather sinister and i believe theres a ulterior motive in there somewhere and tbh you accuse me of trolling but didnt the op ask to discuss this and isnt that what im doingoh and stop the ingame spam of mails please
the eveo forums mods seem about as disciplined in their duties as the goon forums mods

i fully support any option that gives you an avenue for recourse from what you believe to be an oversight by the moderation team as things stand now there is no satisfactory method to pursue a review of a moderators decision
posting on eveo is often more enjoyable than playing the game
heavy handed moderation stifles creativity

i like this idea
look at all the goonswarm alts and members postingyou all fail
quite
moar support needed
no as current corporation rules require you to be the director of a corp it makes sense that you have to be the director of the master corp in an alliance in order to change standings it makes sense to me and it really doesnt need changed also do you really need to change it that often i dont think you doif you do you the corpalliance needs to be a little more stableisaac
the point is that this doesnt have to happen thats more of a workaround for the broken systemyou havent been to 00 have you they change almost everyday in some manner
rightthe last time i was in 00 we had sooooo many pets going in and outthat alliance didnt need to change every hour of every day its standings the only coalitions of alliances that needs this is curatores veritiatis alliance and friends foundati0n and ushrakhan and friends and guess what theyve found ways around it kos system so i really do not see the need of this system isaac
with amarrs t1 crystals never buring out an amarr laser ship could go in wspace and stay in for a long time and get more loot and salvage due to never running out of ammo so never having to sacrafice cargo space for ammo like all the rest of the races the only other ship that comes close is the drone boats but you can easily lose the drones due to the new ai of the sleepersi recommend that t1 crystal burn out like the t2 ones do as well and increase their m3 to bring them more in line with the rest of the races of eve
i recommend training amarr immediately because they are clearly so overpowered you should be sure to exploit this bug before it is fixed
oh yeah its great being amarr with limitless ammo and guns that are affected by every single ewar module ingame oh and dont forget they suck cap up like no tomorrow yeah they are overpowered isaacps no support
how long do you expect to be out there before you can fill your hold full of loot anywaysbtw  sleepers  cap instablity  cap charges take up a fair bit of cargo space too and no cap means no damage
i do not seriously expect cargo capacity to be the limiting factor in the length of a wspace expedition  more likely causes for wrapping up are hitting the end of your wspace and having to leave or getting your ship blown up ammo isnt big enough to cause serious supply issues for anybody if you think its broken go try it i expect youll be surprised unlimited ammo hasnt made lasers broken in any other context and that wont change here
is to control this game by placement of goons in csm positions and places of power thru the csm program you can see this in action in the thread
u mad
meh ccp will only really start to pay attention when their subscription revenues start to drop once that happens i imagine the ban hammer will start thudding with amazing regularity
if i had a nickel for every time i heard an asinine goon conspiracy theory on the boardswell this post would make me a nickel richer yes theyre a big group that acts like idiots a lot no theyre not trying to destroy the game
ok goon alt i really believe you
posting to confirm that all goons are honest individuals and they offer a legit and affordable thirdparty contracting service
funny the last time i was called someones alt it was jade constantines i wish the obnoxious forum troll community would put their heads together and figure out whether my main is an alt of a goon or of one of the most wellknown and strident goonhaters in the game
well at first we had corporations corporations started working together and then you get alliancesnow we have alliances working together creating coalitionslets bring them into the game as a system purely for the purpose of isk sink with the advantage of the standings and combined chat channelmove a new pet into the space you have to get all your allies in the area to set them blue its just a hassle
i agree why not
no i see no reason to the nap thing does it already move on nothing to see hereisaac
you dont need a regulated game mechanic to make an agreement about alliances xy and z setting each other blue forming shared intel channels and cooperating in operationsthe reason for having alliances as an ingame entity as opposed to an informal coalition of corporations is that theyre required for sovereignty mechanics unless you want some similar sort of interalliance mechanic a system of sov 5 regional sovereignty for example this suggestion doesnt really do anything
this
stopped reading here hahaha you know nothing about this game dictors are still awesome the heavy version tanks nicely but its a fat lumbering pig
i honestly do not know whether to laugh because the op is a troll or cry because he isnt
im pretty much going to quote drake for this freedom of speech only lets you talk so long as what you say doesnt affect another person just like rules of freedom are like this you have as much freedom up till you punch me in the face dont like it too stinkin badisaac
actually feel free to punch me in the face but dont act all surprised and indignant when i react in kind after all freedom is a two way street
to get gagged by the gms you have to say something supremely outrageous hence why this guy is justly angeredim pretty sure the gms are doing a superb job with their standards
i hope the devs read this as well as fellow eve pilotsmuch hype was given about black ops battleships and their supposed lethality and stealthiness in theory the intent here is to foment some discussion for improvement not create a smack and hack at the developers and hopefully have this get back to the developers for correctionin practice the black ops bs is extremely weak for the following reasons1 it cannot use a covert ops cloak2 it cannot portal jump without a cyno pilot rendering the ship useless for most applications3 lack of a jump portal generator fuel bay4 too few high slots  all 8 should be available for missiles probe launchers portal generator or whateveri would even add another rig slot to it perhaps limiting this extra or all rigs to black opsrelated functions ecm and etc as a balancing tooli would also recommend making this ship the equivalent of a rattlesnake and etc not so much on armor and shields as much as all the available slots higher resists and etcbalancing  limit the number of covert ops ships it can take with it and fleet with favor ecm and etc over dps but keep it at a respectable dps level for soloing in wormhole and 00 space make the dps dependent upon fleet mechanics andor fitting configurations so that the ship can do well enough in wormhole space on its own for instance give the pilot the option to fit out with defense  offensive rigs  fittings to countercancel out semisevere dpstank restrictions when fitted with ecmsupport modueles andor portal generator  balance it this way depending upon configuration rather than sweeping generalizations that render the ship to expensive fancy paper weight status in the pilots hangarjust some thoughts no flames please
1  if they could use cov ops cloak it would be extremely good boat so good that is all everyone would fly thus overpowered2  a battleship that can just jump to where ever without a cyno or taking gates would be extremely good boat so good that is all everyone would fly thus overpowered3  they have said that it along with other jump capable ships will get one of these unless i am mistaken so let them get it done and stop asking are we there yet are we there yet are4  high slots this is a role boat not a can do everything boatyou should try using them as they were intended first and stop trying to do things they were not intended for its like your asking for a jump drive fly cloaky maurauder or something that doesnt need cynos or gates to get places
the hard part about using them the way they were intended is finding other players who can compliment a black ops bs both mechanically and logistically ive had a sin since they first came out and have never used it it sits in a hangar because nobody ever has either the skills or the ambition to do a black ops operationmarlona i was talking with zorn the other day and he stated that you guys do a lot of these ops which is coolbut rare imo most pilots in my experience all want a ship that can do everything and its very hard to get a group of people to actually play a role and carry out something that takes any bit of tactical planningwhat i do think would be a good idea is if a pilote could drop a cloaked covert cyno beacon which requires same skills as regular cyno to turn on from cargo and a black ops bs could lock onto it from within 5au away and create bridge to it would make it much easier than having the other guy specifically fitted for black ops bridgethe range sucks imo thats it
no they made major space highway jumpgates to negate multiple jumps its fine how it is and ccp has more issues than making this smaller isaac
ccp actually tried this before it was horrible then then broke down those highways for smaller highways they are still horriblenozh im pretty sure said they want to remove all the highways from eve however this would inevitably hurt the newbs more
quoting for truthisaac
heh i have respect for drakes opinions we could do with less of jasons opinions as 99 of them are pretty much moronic and troll like isaac
only troll likemy feelings are hurt
id like to propose one small simple feature the ability to lock your cameras position relative to your ship on all three axes im happy without a cockpit view but the ability to watch the world roll by in a more realistic way would be wonderful and add greatly to the immersion for at least a few peopleit should be part of the advanced camera menu toggleable by rightclicking on your ship follow your ship on all three axes and ideally lose the current restriction on the zaxis though only when following your ship through extreme loops and maneuvers that take it briefly upsidedownyou get the idea you should be able to adjust the camera like normal no snapping back to a certain spot after youve adjusted it it should be done as simply as possible im hoping for ten or twenty minutes of coding max but again these are just ideals personally id be happy if i can just watch the world go by from just behind and above my badgers butt and it not take the devs away from important things like finetuning the exotic dancers in ambulation for too longwhether it gets implemented or not many thanks

the inability to increase the size is becoming a real issue with the rapidly increasing size and resolution of todays displays more font options pleasesigned
very yes although this is almost certainly harder to implement than it sounds
something a bit more readable wouldnt hurt so yes please 
yes
the griefing potential is endlessi totally approve
thanks for the support guys but it needs more
i support it on the following conditionsabadnoned  disbanded corp or 30 days of inactivityonly hackable structures should be ones with something in it that is all
i fully 100 support the idea of assuming control of a pos that has been abandoned for a period i have just recently found 3 and blowing up a unfueled pos is just such a waste
there have always been problems with abuse of caod what problemsseriously if you dont like it dont read it it has never been strong on journalistic content and if anyone ever started putting relevant  in there their alliance leadership would put a stop to it because opsecthe current fashion in caod is to openly mock how pointless it is this at least has the advantage that nobody reading thinks theyve found something important
absolutely agreewhile i feel there ought to be a place on the forums for smack talk between alliances and members of corporations there also ought to be a place to discuss topics concerning corps alliances and wars in a serious fashion and caod in its current form is nothing short of an embarrassment to ccp and the whole eve communitysmack talk placed in a forum specifically labeled as being for that very purpose is fine but when the whole forum starts degenerating into a cesspool that resembles the very worst of a fringe usenet group something is wrong and frankly im a little surprised that ccp has permitted this situation to degenerate to the point it has
live event sx orgy party in delve be there or be squarersvp plz
yes ccp please bring back live events ccp give me isk and call it roleplay thanks
i have a roleplay event ideahow about some storyline goonfleet people steal jade constatines caod posting rights and stash them in the station in nol and star fraction has to take soveriengty in the nol station before jade can ever post in caod again star fraction is a premier pvp alliance and jade knows everything about everything 00 related so hell probably only lose posting rights for a week or so until sov kicks in right quote this if you down
this looks like a good solution to this issue on the whole support this idea what people who keep posting against this complaint dont seem to realise is that this is a get out of jail free card for freighters orcas and little more most bss wont survive a couple of bss shooting them  and its specifically abused by those industrial ships and little else if youre bouncing about in lowsec in a cruiser and you disconnect when you jump into a camp youre going to die with or without a fix to this problem so the average player will see no difference to their gameplay at all
thats a terrible solution not everyone plays the same way i fly with a nomadic group in deep 00 space we are often more than 1520 hostile jumps from any place we can dock we log out in space every day  because we rarely dock it is not acceptable for ships to float around for 5 minutes after a player logs out or loses connection for some pilots that would be the equivalent of  when you log out in a station your ship is ejected into space and sits there for 5 minutes
i agree sitting there for five minutes after you log is not a great solution sry jimer someone suggested a special packet be sent for a ctrl q or an esc  quit be sent to the server to let them know they quit the game that said the ship should be vulnerable to 30 seconds after the exit meaning even though they are not in game you can stil agro the ship with a direct fire weapon giving it a 15minute timer as it would normally if you were shot then logged out its not a concrete solution as a person can just unplug the motemturn off their pc but its still better then nothing or just simply you can be agrod for the first 30seconds after any type of exitdc as it stands if you dc after a jump your dead any ways if your in a bssub bs most of the time we were able to take down an abaddon that dropped right after saying bi in local with only 5 reconshacs so
no you misread what i said the five minutes applies only from the time of login and only if you log in in space meaning that if you log in stay for more than 5 minutes then log out you still vanish in 30 seconds if you log out after 3 minutes you stay in space for 2 minutes
reiterating because i obviously wasnt clear enough the 5 minute timer applies only to login and only if you log in in space if you stay for more than five minutes there is no timer other than the current oneso for those who log out in space with no aggro after doing their regular play session for hours nothing changesall it means is that you cant log in and out to check local or move your warpin because youre around for five minutes if you do if youre not exploiting login mechanics youre fine
updatesmartbombs may no longer cause immunity to citadels but they are anything but fine their explosion velocity while in siege is atrociously low at about 325 msusing the missile damage formula i obtained the dps against various capital ships at different speeds see for yourselvesphoenix damage to carriersphoenix damage to some supercaps all stats are without implants nor rigs in a max skilled char flying a phoenix with three bcu iis and do not include drone dps keep in mind no matter how many bcus are fitted the damage reduction percentage is the same i used the phoenix as an example but the problem is with citadels and affects the nag as well to a lesser extentshockingly the damage of citadels is so poor against moving targets a phoenix deals more dps out of siege to an archon nidhoggur or thanatos moving at max speed than in siege mode and barely less against a chimerathats for theory  i am aware that in practice between other capitals blocking the way the long time it takes them to accelerate and of course webs  carriers dont move at max speed for the most part but this extreme example reveals the underlying problem citadels explosion velocity being far far too low in siege mode in fact if a carrier is flying at 45 ms or above a rage siege raven outdamages it even if the targeted carrier is triple webbed the phoenix still loses about a quarter of its damage due to low explosion velocity against supercaps the phoenix also loses a significant chunk of its damage up to 64 against a moving hel and up to 31 against a leviathan  the ship with the single largest sig radius and tied for slowest capitali realize capital turrets have to deal with tracking but they are not penalized anywhere near the extent citadels are against other capitals short of shooting one at extreme close range if you disagree back up your claim with some facts and not just well turrets miss missiles always hitthere was a time when citadels werent just useful against caps they could also be used effectively against battleships and some bcs but doing so either required a gimped setup or specific support and there was no flood of whine threads about how imba they were today this is impossible but its not important what is important is that citadel torpedoes as an anticapital weapon are massively underpowered aside from their very delayed damage and being destroyable they are crippled by their explosion velocityit feels as if the devs tossed out a random number for citadel explosion velocity and went with it without testing consequences be damned citadels dont need a token boost what they need is a significant increase in explosion velocity to allow missile dreads to fulfill their role in anticapital warfare
the numbers are correct i dont have the experience to properly interpret them in terms of capital fights but they look horrific
i just get a 404 for the pictures
my numbers pretty muched matched yours as a nag pilot this is pretty concerning supporting a boost
ive changed host for the pics they should be working without issues nowalso supporting my own thread
i so plan too run the test again so i can fraps it just as more proofthe test ran on sisi was 2 part first we use 5 phoenix and 1 thanatosall phoenix enter siege and starting firing on the thanatos as it enter grid at a range of around 30km by the time the first volley reach the target it had reach the speed of 50ms for the next 10 mins of the cycle for siege the thanatos was easily able too deal with the dmg from the phoenix crew it took them nearly 25 of there cycle too simple down the shieldsthe next test used a mix of revs2 and moros3 dreadsnow with them in siege and the same thanatos pilot upon entering grid he lost shields and some armor before gaining speed even at the max of 90ms the use of the armor rep was more then sparing around 75 in too the cycle for siege the carrier was cycle both armor reps at times too deal with the dps outputsomething is broken here
good luck incantare
as someone who has flown both with and against citadels i can safely say that without a doubt this needs to be looked at
hows that working out for you
yes lets give in again to the goons look how they took delve metagamed their way in and spammed a bazillion towers up and now they want to make it easier
weve killed twice as many pos as weve spammedand weve spent over 100 man days spamming
we have not heard a single solid reply to why we cannot get more standing slots at corp lvl in order to be able to properly set redblue settings on outpost accesss with the current increasing playerbase 300 is a rediculasly small ammount of corporation slots to run sutch things and even if for whatever reason ccp does not wish to increase our corp slot limits to something reasonable like 5000 then  how about changing things so that ops use the alliance lvl standings settings sutch as friendenemynapcompetetor since ops can only be built by alliances anyway which is the heart of the slot limits problem the inability to control op accesss because there are far more standings that need to be set at corp vs alliancecorpchar is most vexing and so far we have had 0 responce from ccp on the subject and the old threads are necro locked seerindarkness
look ccpevery day i get some new propaganda that eve is a sand box where players are allowed to make the game what they wishprovidence wishes to decide who is red who is neutral and who is blue  for pos reasons  outposts etc  we are running out of slotsits been asked to be fixed for months if not hitting apon yearsfix it i cant imagine its more then 30 mins in the code
additional to the previous postings i suggest to implement a autocleaning functionbutton to choose the function whos deleting closed corpsalliances orand especialy a function for the personal standings of each player to delete settings for solo characters when they joined an corpalliance its pretty hard to sort that handish with just 300 slots and wastes a lot of time but if that will come we will still need more slots to set our standings properly i suggest to double the limit so up to 600slots
i too support more standing slots combined with outposts and poss being able to use alliance standings
eh why not supported
already brought up in csm1 cant remember exactly what the outcome was its on the list with very low priority though
yes
support
this sounds reasonable
very intelligent suggestion thumbs up
the problem here is lag  too many standings means too many database lookups thats not to say it shouldnt be changed but its not as much of a nobrainer as people think it is
so selecting any celestial object and just clicking the little box with a bunch of arrows in it doesnt cut it for you thats essentially what youre asking for and its already there i dont see how a shortcut for this should really be a priorityedit in case that as at all unclear heres a pictureplease visit your user settings to reenable images
i like it useful in an emergencysomeone could make the argument that anything that makes podkilling harder is bad for game balance but i wouldnt personally agree with that argument
more command keys are good
link perhaps i am making a mountain out of an ant hill but i would like to know how much sway the esrb has over the creative choices at ccp if mitnals words are to be taken seriously then it would seem in order to gain the t for teen rating granted by the esrb the devs had to cut out a background setting way off in the distance of an old hanger screengranted it is insignificant but if the reasons for its removal are in fact censorship how much of eve both present and future will be affected by this
i want to know this aswell
pretty sure i remember seeing an unrated by the esrb when i logged in
the exact words are online interactions not rated by esrb this means interactions between players as opposed to the content that ccp produces my concern is that did ccp in order to get the esrb t for teen rating agree to remove certain aspects of their game and or cease pursuing those lines
they are shown at me in the order of creation
just tested it and it seems youre right guess i just created mine in alphabetical order okay im for alphabetizing too
its spelled group
when i grow bored of alliance life i tend to go into my one man corpi then go back to my ore stealing and killing darwinsoccasionally i see a corp ripe for ransoming 400500m one man corp vs a 2050 man corpi dont war dec one corp at a time i war dec 3 or so if i canbegining of the week i send a email to allt he ceos i am at war with i then go hunting and kill anyone i can find then send that person an email saying blame youre ceo for not paying upso removal of the war dec system while good for some aint good for allif paying to war dec another corp was raised to 50100m isk then what would war deccing an alliance cost 250500m isk per week at thathell one of these days i must one man war dec an alliance lol
i support this product andor service

yep
if the forum is part of the game then why is it not a function or application inside the game besides browsing to it with the internet browser which makes connection to the world outside eve thus also unrealistic
csm candidates should have some purview over forum moderation they are supposed to be looking out for the players some of us just play forum games not allowing them oversight is a bit disheartening that the initial csm concept has been retooled so much by ccp that it is now only a shadow of its original intent
what you are saying is that the forum will merely end up being an extension of goonswarms policies and serve as a political tool to achieve its goalsi see what you did there somebody has been reading the cia manualswe cannot give you that power although you will seek it by other meansabulurd bonifaceme meceo
haha cry more man  this could serve just as much use to you as it would the idiots you claimi support this idea it serves a lot more uses than the op suggests if you can throw it into any channel and anyone can use it absolutely
i like it its a useful mechanic and its balanced so that its both useful and dangerous basically all were asking is to be able to place a bookmark in a chat channel i see this having a lot of uses  in fleetcorpalliance channels as a way of quickly distributing bookmarks and in local as a way of sending out distress calls planting ambushes or being a good samaritan anyone using the mechanic understands the risks involvedand id like to point out a person under attack sending a distress signal in local really doesnt assume any risk  presumably youd only send a distress signal if you knew you were going to be beaten if more bad guys turn up nothing is going to happen to you that couldnt have happened already but if good guys turn up you might get lucky or even more interesting maybe different bad guys turn up and turn it into a 3way fightgenerally itd be a useful mechanic to have supported
why not seems reasonable to me
hello all how r u guys im super thx 4 askini was wonderin y teh margin tradin skill hasnt been fixed after all these years teh simple fact of teh matter is that there aint no way 2 turn teh skill off like if i want 2 buy a super special item like maybe a titan or a polaris there aint no way 2 front all teh monies so i kin b sure tat teh order goes through teh only way that i know of 2 turn off teh skill short of no playin is 2 relentless self destruct until my skillpoints is below 900000 but thatll take 4ever possibly literallyin shortthis is offensive fix your game ccp you have tohugs n kisses cbs
1d10t
you know ive read this three times and i still dont understand what the problem iswhat about the margin trading skill isnt working and why would you want to turn it off
the fact that the op talks about buying a titan or polaris via the market should be a huge clue that you should not take him seriouslysimply ignore this thread and it will likely go away
hi thx 4 readin my postteh prob is tat the margin trading dont turn off so u cant front all teh money for an order up front if u want in rl this wouldnt be a big prob since people is always willin 2 take monies up front so should brokers i mean like just a little checkbox when placin a buy order sayin front all teh monies would be superhope that helpshugs n kisses cbs
hi thx 4 readin my posti do believes that titans kin be bought n sold via market but i was under teh impression that it waz just impossible to get em inside a station 2 be sold could a dev confirm this thxhugs n kisses cbs
hi thx 4 nat gooing 2 skul b3c4us3 i dnt knw how 2 sp3ll1m 2 2tupid to sp3ak english
doesnt the eula mandate that you have to be age 13 to play as for the issue here i suppose i agree with the op in the abstract but its pretty minor if you can afford it its not a problem and if you cant then you shouldnt be buying it
as its been proven by this thread alone people dont care what the eula saysanyone with a credit card and some cash can play this gameim just surprised anyone is bothering to translate that kiddie languageseriously if your going to post at least post in englishat least the bulk of the ideas ive shot down spoke very clearly and where understood i respect them more than i would this kid
i respect you drake even when youre telling me im wrong i mean clearly that indicates youre delusional  but still worthy of respect
hey i resemble that remark er resent errr
im sorry that made my day drake snorted water out of my nose when i read that to the op tldr isaac
if your fleet has an industrial or two with it to carry tons of potential loot throw ammo in there 1520000m3 can hold a lot of ammoif the system you find is really awesome you could just setup a small pos and use it for a few weeks and make ammo by mining asteroids in some of the sites if need be granted it might just be easier to use the worm hole and haulers to fill up corp arrays with tons of ammo if you run out of ammo then after all of that then might i suggest cashing out on the systems spoils since youve likely got a massive amount of loot to selluse by then if you didnt get all blown up
uh excuse me do you even know how to play amarianguess you dont because anyone with half a freaking brain would see that they drain capacitor like crazy unless you fit them propperly but its not cap stable thats for sureeven then tech 1 crystals are only slightly more powerful than most common tech 1 ammo but its always about resistancesplease leave before you stench up the place
drake i love your posts
im in a good mood premium graphics on a mac and a shiny amarrian destroyer does that to you8 o 
is it just me that finds this typically to mean strip away variety and uniqueness
ive fought with rails and with lasers and it never seemed to me that unlimited t1 ammo on lasers is unbalancing as has already been said it sucks cap like whoa and leaves you very vulnerable to neut and nosno change necessary different guns have different advantages
greetings everyonei had a new idea for pvp mercy missionsit would go something like this at a certain standing a player would have access to relief supply missions that would mark your ship as a neutral the scanner would show a peace sign or something and the mission only pays for a short term insurance policy on your ship perhaps an addition to your current policy if someone destroys your ship during that mission then they are marked for a longer period in hi sec space and their standing get reduced further than for a standard kill other ideashere is the twist after a mission is complete you are fair game but still carry the neutral markings and insurance for a short period of time this could open up a whole new professionexample bob takes a mercy mission to deliver an aload of medicine to a colony five jumps away through low sec space now that he takes the mission his ship is painted with a symbol that designates him as on a peace mission if anyone attacks him then that person loses standing andor an immediate bounty is placed on himlets say that bob completes the mission and he sees in the station a deal on some expensive items and he can sell it for twice the price five jumps away through hi sec space since his neutral status and special insurance does not expire for another hour he takes the risk and sets a course for the selling pointmeanwhile tom is gatecamped waiting for an easy meal when he spies bob on his way to sell the stuff he bought he doesnt want a bounty on his head so he lets it goin the next system joe is camped as well but is broke and desparate so he goes after the ship anyway after the kill he loots millions worth of stuff from the wrecksince bobs mission was over there is no loss to joes standing nor a bounty placed on him resultsbob loses his ship but can buy another due to the insurance and is only out on the stuff he bought at the station after the mission was completedtom wimped out and missed out on a big payday joe took the risk and it paid off bigi am not a pirate so some of the penalties may not be appropriate please give me some feedback on this and let me know if this is something worth looking intoi think that this has potential for both pirates and carebears and could coax more people into 00 spaceconstructive criticism please any devils advocates please add your 2 cents as well
intriguing idea but full of holesi get what your trying to do but the current mechanics wont permit such thingsand honestly theres not much an incentive markets in low sec are practically a world of there ownnow if said mercy missions had large rewards or something thats different
csm could pass it and demand ccp implement it that doesnt mean ccp isnt going to tell them nothey stopped using nonpaid staff already why would they go back to something that would be even more limited than simply bringing back crc
i kinda understand the ops line of logic being that goons are well represented in every stupid thread on these forums spam caod at will and even here from the number of goonswarm led and goonswarm suppored topicspersonally it would be nice to ban them in their own entirety from the eve forums and let them use their own forums they pay for instead of forcing others to read the utter drivel that spews from their orfices every sad day 
hahahahahahahahahahehehehohohohohahahahahahahaheheheahahahagasphahahahahahaheheheheohohohohhohohohahahahehehehahahagaspcoughcoughgaspi havnt laughed that hard in a long timeyou sir have won the jackass of the monthcongrautlationsnow stfu and gtfoyes goonswarm are very large quite poweful and full of idiots save darius at least his respectible to a pointno they are not taking over the world only total idiots think thatseriously get over yourselfthis belongs in coadherschel snickers a goon hahahheheheme laughs
after reviewing your carefully wellcrafted proposal ive decided to support you in your endeavors
and as expected the goons are flaming but keep it up girls i am going to keep bumping this topic for the next couple years
aslong as goons continue to kill people my alliance doesnt like a im happy
its true youve uncovered our master plan to take over the csm and then use that power combined with the mighty nerd power of devswarm to insert malicious code into the game that instantly hacks all accounts and scams ccp of one billion rl real life iskand then take that seventy three cents and give it to our godking darius johnsonall hail the godkingall hail the plan
your optimism heartwarming though it is does not negate the underlying truth eventually the swarm will come for us allthere will be no survivorsabulurd bonifaceme meceo
you realize that even if goons get 2 people onto the csm they will still be in a vast minority it could evengaspwork against goonswarm think before posting who am i kidding this is the internet
so theyve had people on the csm every time which wasnt a problem they claim theyll take over the csm with each new election but afterwards its just all about the whine threads itll spawn like this onedont take it serious and dont give it attention
we control your posting now
why is it that eve makes having alliances really useless i mean like with poss if the alliance are the ones who hold sovereignty why is it the poss that are set up alliance use dont work for the alliance we are given the option and it means nothing alliances can not use ship maintenance bays corp hanger arrays when set to alliance nor can the alliance take control of pos guns seems to me that alliances in eve are truly restricted and pointless i understand the issues with protecting corp assets but if the alliance agrees to operate in the same areas we can not share things as a alliance i look at real world alliances and they share not just info but equipment and duties can anyone help us understand the whys to giving us the options yet they dont work i think it would be nice to actually work like a alliance not just fly together just like in empire a alliance is pointless as well you can not help defend a corp in your alliance a alliance is no better then a napkaila
hey alli totally agree its just 1 big monies sink i think we should totally let alliance members have more control over posses or we kin let corps take sovriegnty
anyone speak druggie i think hes overdosed on space crackop your question has some valid points but the approach is wrongyou should spend some time talking to alliances who deal with this on a daily basis before making conclusions
just saying they kinda suck balls perhaps  i dunno  make them useful again you know like you said you would nohz
1up
well yes they do suck whilst there have been numerous threads on the plight of the bomber i cant recall anybody promising to buff it perhaps now ccp have put in some new content they could spare a couple of bods to fix some of the things they broke  bombers and black ops to name but a few
tbh bombers have always sucked imo not really good at anything including their rolebombers do need to be looked at although im not sure exactly what role but the bombs need to do more damage and the mechanics of launching a bomb needs to be looked atorbring back mines now i know this is a seperate subject but can we maube incl the bomber as a mine layer as well sort of incorperating a dual role so yes i support the propsal of bombers being looked at
bombers were very good at their niche roles and if you used the right tactics and patience were very effective at their job bombers do need to be looked at although im not sure exactly what role but the bombs need to do more damage and the mechanics of launching a bomb needs to be looked ati think bomb damage is fine atm but i agree the mechanics need revisingorbring back mines now i know this is a seperate subject but can we maube incl the bomber as a mine layer as well sort of incorperating a dual role bombs missiles and mines too many roles for this shiptypemy solution is a bonus per level to cruise missile explosion velocity and the ability for bombs to continue to their target even if the bomber is destroyed or warps away
letting bombs continue on their way to the target is a definite but i dont think the stealth bomber needs any boosts to the damage it can cause with cruise missiles it works fine as it isthe idea of a bomber is to come up on a target cloaked decloak drop a payload and then either warp away or cloak again before anyone can attack you right if the bombs dissapear when doing so it kind of defeats the purposesupported minus the explosion velocity bit
whenever you open up info on something or someone it will automatically open up one of the info tabs which can be handy but also very annoying if it decides for instance that the standings tab is the default one this time and you check info on a corp itll take a bit to load which takes time slows down the client and taxes the database for no reason this is also the case for other tabs ofcoure but the standing one is the most annoying you could ofcourse set a certain tab to always be the standard one but i think it would be much bettereasierfaster to show no info at all till the player actually clicks one of the tabs the one hes actually interested inas said it causes less lag and there will be much less pressure on the database because of it no idea how many times someone checks info on something but it must run in the bazillions if that means the db has to be queried twice as much because the info screen opens on some random tab or the one the player isnt interested in at that moment that surely will help a lot
having read the excellent explanation the op gave id like to subscribe to his newsletter and also want to have his babies
this isnt an ideal solution  a lot of times i want to see the same screen on each of a number of modules and this would greatly increase the work needed to do so  but you have identified a real problem the current system of opening the fourth tab if the fourth tab was the last one open last time is pretty bad and yields a lot of unnecessary frustration a better memory for what tabs we want would be good
it took waaay too long to implement
and this is in the assembly hallwhy exactlyi mean i am sure they appreciate the feedback but lets put it in the feedback section shall we
im sorry cant hear you over the violin music playing in the background
glad you are enjoying the skill queue but this thread has no purposelocked
wow jason you have put a half decent idea on the forumsi will have to give you support just for that
as much as ai hate bumping its an sactioned game mechanic by ccpif it were otherwise we would have ships passing through each other not a nice look lolbut yeah as others have said if you cannot tank the mission lvl dont do it
i can not ever see t3 being any ware near the price of t2 the effort vs reward when the production stage hits in going to be unbelievable anything involving a gang to do complexes means every one wants there 100mill for the hour of plexing and currently you can not even think of doing a sleeper complex with less then 610 people who really know what there doing add on top of that the cost to start up production and the skill reqs and i think a lot of people now get the pictureso i still feel that t2 should be as dynamic as t1 or t2 now is well take that back t1 is static and dynamic in that belts have yet to be taken out of the game so it has the best of both worlds t2 is static only with moons and t3 is now full dynamic
this would be awesome i would scoot around jettisoning lag clouds all over the place i approve
you lost me at the gigantic wall of ing textand i wish you could be gagged until you learn to properly use the enter key
now im falling in love with your posts
go back to your corner jason your better off making random ideas
no shut up go to ure corner throll on the serios note u mite see this diferently but eve dose have a large comunity that involves many classes of agesin the official channel words that are considered obsene internationalylike fk or dkare and should be bannedbut words like kill murder etc etc can not be banned to understand what im taking about read here
1 learn to speach2 join the monks since ur into enlighevercrap3this is a game ccp have to consider children playing and people who are against insults and swearing so they have to take drastic measures and since it is against there rules to swear or be abusive to new players then by all means id say kick ya from channel

why not allow the account hold to use his 3 slots in the following wayslot 1 full training speed depending on skills and attributesslot 2 half training speed based on skills and attributesslot 3 14 training speed based on skills and attributesthis would mean the additional charge for running multiple chars on an account could be kept lower due to limited training players would be able to activate multiple training slots to suit their needs with most electing for slot 12 im guessing 1499 for 1 slot1999 for 2 slots2199 for 3 slots
well you are forgetting one thingwith attribute and learning skills you elimanate implants making them plain and boring and not really worth what you pay for
why wold you remove an option
there seems to be some really vast oversimplifications being made in this thread many of which are based on assumptions or pure speculationin real life i wouldnt even consider not voting its not only one of our most important freedoms but its the civic responsibility of every person that lives in a democratic nationbut i did not vote last time in eve even though i find the concept of the csm fascinating and applaud ccp for what it is attempting to do i still didnt vote and it wasnt because i felt the csm would be ineffective or anything like thatthe primary reason i didnt vote is because this outofgame political experiment is still in its infancy and the process has not yet matured into something where the average eve player can see a tangible outcome from their votelet me use american politics as an example the differences between the two major political parties in the us are pretty well known and their party platforms well established thus voters are really voting for issues when they cast a straight party line vote and the vast majority of voters do vote straight ticket meaning all democrat or all republicanthere is nothing like this in eve so when i vote for john doe for csm what can i expect to see as a result anything there is no clear or established party platform because there are  at least so far  no political parties in the csm which in turn means its up to each candidate to enunciate a clear vision of where they stand on important issues and what their priorities will be if elected and no disrespect meant but most candidates have done a very poor job in this regard most eve players simply have no idea what the candidates stand for or even where to get information about themdarious johnson as strange as it may sound to some is actually slightly ahead in this regard now people will say he is doing nothing more than being an advocate for the goons and attempting to use the csm to further his alliances goals perhaps but the point is he has a real constituency and they have a pretty good idea where he stands on issues and where his priorities are im neither endorsing nor criticizing his positions im merely pointing out that he has an established platform of sorts and people have a good idea of what they can expect from him as a csm member hes visible and that counts for a lot in the world of politicsim sure the other csm members have strong opinions too but i think its fair to say most people dont know much about them this tends to turn eves voting process into little more than a personality contest and if thats all its going to be i have serious doubts it will mean much beyond being a sounding board for ccp to bounce some ideas off ofif the csm is ever really going to mean anything to the average eve player and i think it would be great if it did then communication will have to get a lot better and players will need some mechanism to know what to expect from candidates even if most players were confident the csms recommendations would have real weight with ccp and stood a good chance of being implemented in a timely fashion the current system makes it unlikely there will be a large voter turnout people just dont see any point and dont know what or even if they can expect anything in reuturn for their support
he must have missed the lock button idk

please return the effect of the cyno jump that was before apoc one of the joys of capital ships was the blinding light the bang of the warp portal opening up and the woosh as you fly through and hot dropping on people or a titan dropping out the blinding white light all that stuff was awesome now its meh
totally agree wanted to showoff to a friend but is was kinda disappointing old capital ship jump effect is nicer then the new one
i agree to a certain degree i think all ships should maintain the current jump animation however i think capitals should also show the directional wormholing effect like before currently gates dictate jump direction and the rest of the effect for subcaps so the capitals should get their jump direction via the original effect  the current one additionally it would be nice if the entranceexit of the jump caused effect of the actual ship directional movement but if not possible then the effect needs to be originally projected on the ships facing direction and then locked on coordinates regardless of if the ship swings so you dont get the swinging gate effect if it gets bumped on entrance and exit

now i feel bad about having started a thread in the other boardthis has my supportcruise missiles they do have lower dps than turrets they do even less to the vast majority of targets frigs  cruisers they have a counter lowering their dps even further defenders they are still of no use in pvp torps have their users they are expensive  and you need more of them to kill the same targets they have a low roftorpedos they dont even hit battleships for the damage listededitas for the no tracking worries argumentmissile boats cannot work transversal velocity to compensate i know why i fly vargur and sold the golem really i do
and ban goons too
agreeing with this
caod does need cleaning maybe even its purpose redefined or a troll sectioon created for the bull that is posted there
ive done this personally in a thanatos vs nagfail and pheonix i cant attest to the skill levels of the pilots however ya pretty much anything moving at any speed can speed tank citadels it is a factshould this be fixed certainly notat the same time im doing this the nagfails projectiles cant track at allthe problem consists entirely in allowing the carrier to move it should have 5 webs on the thing
what i do support though is tech 2 ammo and guns for dreadscitadels get the uber dmg short range type also the high precision who can hit the faster moving thingsalso equivalent for the rest of the dreads
thumbs up in support
the nagfail suffers from the cid effect too on top of that i am talking about a cap battle more then 1 vs 1 here and not only just vs caps a moros can fight subcap ships and kill something it guns might miss a lot but if it lands a hit it counts for something on the other hand you can fire cids all day but if you only deal 80 dmg with all 3 then your not going too kill anythingtelling pheonix pilots too fire webs and such too make there cids worth while like amarr ships too use projectiles weapons as there cap issues with lasers
this is simply not true outside of very close range as i said in my opening post but rather than ask you to take my word for it again take a look at these graphs of various dreads firing at a full speed thanatoswith 50 of speed contributing to transveralwith 100 of speed contributing to transversal all have one t2 damage mod except for the phoenix which has three closest range faction ammo was used in all cases drone damage and the nags citadel damage were not included in the graphsthe curve corresponding to each weapon is as followsblasters  pinkacs  greenpulse  tealbeams  yellowrails  bluecitadels  redfrom a single glance it should be obvious that there is something very wrong with citadels as they are
not to mention that while gun dreads have the ability to add tracking mods if needed the phoenix has no such option supercaps are immune to ewar and a painter wont work but not even looking at the gunmissile comparision your data is about spot on with what i had been experiencingi tried to bring this up earlier in the old boost citadel threadgood luck and supported
the waiting game is something everyone gets too play but long as we keep this going maybe we can at least get a reply from ccp on the issuedo they think its right or will they changed it like they changed the whole smartbomb issuehow long will stealth bombers be broken how long till a phoenix is not lol at in local channel trying too fight anything that can move
as a wyvern pilot i can say your numbers are innacurate they may be accurate for a completely untanked ship but i was recently being attacked by four dreadsall phoenix and simply moving reduced their missile damage to 800 per salvo now my normal untriaged tank should not be able to speed tank 4 sieged dreads regardless of the race but it was pretty hilarioussupporting this
bump
what the  is wrong with you
if the slots cannot be increased due to lag issues then i would aprecate consideration of linking the alliance standings settings to outposts so that useing the corp lvl settings isent needed and we could generaly clean corp slots of the settings and reduce the db lag even more since the corp slot settings of the controlling corp for the ops are duplicate settings in 99 of them anyway the issue of a self cleaning standings is a seperate issue tbh but i dont understand why closed corpsalliances dont self clean in the first place in order to reduce db lag seer
oh i agree i dont know enough about the system to know what exactly the problem is and what the best way to work around it is but im sure theres some system better than the current one and id love to see them implement it i agree with you i just figured it ought to be explained
lovely
do want its common knowledge that the best micromanager will always be the player but if npc ai gets smarter than drone users should be cut some slack as well
a new command key wouldnt make you warp faster though would it i dont see how the same packet would be sent to the server at the same timeand your issue with always getting podded because of session changes is a user issue not a game issue most experienced pvpers never get podded unless caught in a bubble
in eve you are only allowed to train one character on an active account concurrently i think eve is the only mmo that restricts one in this fashionto achieve this end people would previously use multiple accounts and take advantage of ghost training i propose that we be allowed to train all characters on an active account concurrently they can even lie and say its a bug that took them years to identify and fix if they wish
i support this great idea
no name another game where you can train 2 characters on the same account at the same time i cant think of one in most other games you only gain skillsexperience while logged in and actively playing and you can only log in one character at a time so again  no
noinsert 1000000 posts from everyone else who said no and there reasontry searching the forums
if i say something wildly inappropriate here can we get this thread locked  before it gets out of handshort answer nolong answer iirc ghost training was the bug and it has been fixed why would they unfix it
cloaking can be quite an advantageous but boring aspect of the game i want to propose a fun and interesting way to counter cloaking but at the same time not ruin cloakingin modern naval warfare submarines are the silent service much like cloaking is to eve these ships hide from radar or sonar unseen in order to spy pry or poke as they pleaseto counter submarines navies have anti submarine warfare ships and helicopters some ships are designed specifically for this purpose to assist bigger fleets or convoysmy idea is to take that naval strategy and dynamic put it into eve for even more interesting game play for example just as stealth bombers are designed specific to carry bombs no other ships can afford to carry them or battlecruisers are designed to carry command modules  modules that would cost far more powergrid on other ships well the same can be done for acw modules on frigates and destroyers so that those ships have specific duties in a fleet ontop of ones they already can fillhave a fleet to move want to protect against scouts cloaking and shadowing your movement bring a acw fitted destroyer or frigate that can scan the area for cloaked shipsthis will also make things a bit more dangerous for cloakers however if a cloaker gets scanned out only the acw destroyerfrigate will see the cloaked ship blinkingbigger ships can fit acw modules but it should cost them tons of power because they are not designed for acw activities and fitting for such would be a waste in this way frigates and destroyers are the fast acw boats mimicing naval strategy and just providing more game strategy options once the acw ship spots a cloaker it can go uncloak it or sit ontop of it and fleet can warp ontop of itlets say there are a couple cloaking scouts around your system feeding intel to the enemy in eve cloakers can camp a system for 23 hours and you may never know if they are a threat or afk cloakers can go afk and cause stress for an entire systemwell with acw fleet commanders and system owners can do something about it if they employ an some acw shipsacw ships scatter throughout the system and start pinging for cloakers doing so would be similar to using a scanner or prober to find ships the caviot being that once acw ships ping for cloakers there is a chance cloakers can tell they are being pinged for the acw destroyer does not break the cloak of the enemy ship but it can see the cloaker and can warp to or speed toward it if the signal is strong enough at that point a fast acw shipthis also opens up doors for more types of missions lets say you are given a mission by an npc agent to use an acw ship to find a menacing cloaked ship in a system lets say also acw equipment can also double for finding worm holes and plexes too that way acw ships become very versatile useful and interesting ships to fly hmm but perhaps acw equipment will be expensive to be effective not sure how you balance the costuse part yet any suggestionsso i thought this might be a new and interesting addition we could have for the future if the opportunity provides thanks for reading see you in game o
do not want this i dont feel theres anything wrong with cloaking mechanics and wont feel there is until the day comes i can fire while cloaked
i do not support this every gatecamp would have these ships and in 00  theyd have them in addition to the bubbles delayed mode local will hopefully come to all of 00 eventually and solve the i get stressed out by afkcloakers problem
cloaks have penalties that are more than adequate for current mechanicsnot supported
two days ago i could see bubbles dictor or anchored finetoday i diededed in a bubble i never saw this made me somewhat sad panda i then went and got my hictor out and started adjusting graphics assuming that my turning eve graphic down yesterday because of stutters in framerate was the issue i cannot see bubble in low shadermedium texturei cannot see bubble in medium sadermedium texturei can barely see a little discoloring where the bubble is in high shadermedium texture however i cannot see any real definition to it and cannot tell where i am in relation to it except for the hictor being the middle of the bubble thingchanging textures did not change anything for me i feel like whatever they changed in how the things are rendered has made them a little too hard to spot for those of us who may not have the eyes we once did and would appreciate some definition being put back into the things to make them easier to see
i would think you would like the semiinvisible dictor bubbles o 
nope dont like being ninja tackled if im in a bubble i want to damn well know im bubbled so i can act accordingly
i havent seen a bubble postpatch if this is accurate i completely support the op though when you jump through a gate into a bubble its important to know youre in a bubble
been having this problem as wellnot with pos bubbles but with hdictor bubbles and anchorable bubbles
careful what you ask for they might make it look like you are inside a pos forcefield no missing that only problem is you will probably die anyway from the nausea inducing vertigo disco you are in
i noticed the new graphic effects have a general pattern of being more blurry transparent softer colors makes me wonder whats the point of a new fancy graphics engine if i can see less than i did beforemajority of people who play this game for over 1 month dont care for graphics they care for game logic and ergonomic interfaces  we need things to be clearly defined
im seeing those bubbles just fine and clear so not sure what to say
to be perfectly honest its far more annoying that the bubbles fluctuate now and sitting on the edge is significantly more annoying probably a good thing in the long run but wow does the graphic feel half assed
content ccp creates is rated online interactions are not you may have some e m or ao rated interaction while playing eve but the ccp provided aspect will be rated for teenssince eve is t for teen id imagine any hopes and dreams of running around naked in ambulation are going to have to stay dreams
damn kids spoiling it again
pleasure hubs back in gallente stations pleasenext thing you know itll be the exotic dancers and then the booster drug market stop censorship in its tracks im american its a problem over here dont let it become a problem over there
stop the censorship of eve
stupid ccp this dumbing and younging down of eve needs to stopthe quafe girl was ok for a 13yr old to see imo
yes you are making mountains out of a ant hill
while it is nice to attract more customers by lowering your age rating i find it very hard to believe that those in their lower teens will find eve an enjoyable game and become active subscribers for long rather see a higher age rating and no censorship walking over creative choices
ah thank you for showing this then venkul at the time when i read that thread it appeared as if mintal was refering to the ingame object as i had not seen the image the op had posted and i think you would have to admit the way it was handled would lead one to believe mintal was refering to the ingame object as opposed to a piece of fan art the and that really do make a diffrence in a short sentience i made this particular thread before the clearification so call this all bad timing kicks the ant hill
stop the self administered censorship please bring back the quafe girl implement more features that will push the rating up to m at least
ive sat here keeping an eye out for a few known names to comment they haventwhich says that this thread is a waste of our timethere are more important things to deal withi concur this is an stupid ant hill needs to be kickedmove along move along
this game should definitely strive more toward mrated contentmake eve cool for the hardcore gamer look at gta  its uber popular
not supportedit wont work you would need like 10k different pellets to match all cpu and pg needspellets would cuz more trouble then they should remove
just so i can say im gonna lay a brick in ur pos
not supportedthis topic was talked to death with most people who are actually involved with the larger pos operations for the 00 empires  canning the proposalits been consigned to the garbage heap of bad ideas where it belongs
tnx anyone else for this small change 
im for itits very useful to have subgroups and alphabetical order its a mustjust my opinion
supported
sub groups noalphabetical yes
although i have not delved into drones heavily at this point i can see how this would be extremely nice to have if i played with many drones slade
i would love there to be just a bit more versatility in the drone groupingthe ability of creating a drone group of different types of drone if you so wish ie throw in a tp900 with 4 orge iis
high sec war dec  someone called confirming  please escrow all your stuff to me on your way out honestly though  if you dont like high sec war decs  then stay in an npc corp  they are immune
raise npc corp taxes
raise idiot taxes
i have a story i want to share with everyonethere once was a carebear corp that that got its first wardec in their first war they took many casualties and ended up surrendering for 200 million iskit was agreed the corp would never surrender againthe corp recieved another wardec a month later but the corp had prepared this corp gathered intel studied pvp setups and were sure to train skills needed for the fightthen their first war started the enemy were greifers failed pvpers of 00 who liked using t2 ships and faction equipment the little corp that could had fewer skillpoints cheaper ships but they had the numbers and were fighting in their home territory the fight started but the exact events are lost what is known for certain is that this little corp held their own and ended up bankrupting the enemy into ending the wardecthis same thing happened several more times all with the same outcome the little corp that could held their own despite their losses and have matured into tough combatantsim in that corpabout war decs war decs help your balls drop as an eve player pvp is like sex in eve your first time is really messy but once you get good at itoh baby if anything i wholeheartidly support wardecs even greifing wardecs used to annoy people it will toughen you uptoo many people who play eve at the moment are scared of losing ships what these scared people need to do is gather intel on pvp setups get a stockpile of parts mission loot is really great for this and then get there stuff together when the time comesseriously quit cowaring people that wardec in highsec are usually not bigbad megacorps they are usually smaller corps with old bored players who just want to kill you for the lulz
i tend to agree with previous postexcept for some parts but never mind thatwardecing tends to be a griefing tool because theres no real incentive to it other than greifingtheres only 3 solutions to that problem under current mechanicsget tougher and expect more to comejoin an alliancequit and join a larger corp or move to 00 were 90 of the wardecing corps are utter cowards and refuse to grow a backbonethis is unacceptable my corp never wanted to get involved in alliance hell we wantted to do our ownof course we are very happy with our alliance we just had ambitious plans that never came to fruition due to the interference of wardec
i dont trust the forum modsbecause there is strong evidence certain mods are biased all we want is accountability for serious moderation like when someone is banned for something others arent in the same thread then you know favoritism exists
supported
no this opens the forums to be used and abused for player driven agendas i for one would not want other paying subscribers dictating what i cancan not do on the forums which is essentially what you are suggestingivory
it seems the few people who are against this issue dont understand it at all no one is asking for control just a reason when someone is banned in the least
supported
no it would make sense that you can give out the role of recruiter or diplomat or whatever to a different corporation in the alliance you describe a situation where one corp is the master and all the other corps in the alliance are es which is one way to run an alliance but not all alliances are like that some alliances have corps that are equal partners and have different dutiesroles in the alliance as far as alliances needing to change standings often a common thing is to have to arrange temp standings to attack people or hot drop enemies or stuff i guess if you are in a carebear alliance that lives in jita you dont need to change anything but that is not how every alliance worksthis is already done via alts in the executor corp so why not streamline the process supported
is more time for bug testing and fixing wanted by the eve pilotstldr are you willing to wait 36 extra months for a large expansion so as to give the devs more time for old bug fixing to develope the new expansion and more time for player testing on sisii admittedly have not even been in eve for two years so this post is made from a point of observation more then direct knowledge of game designdue to all the threads in gd after patches and expansions i have heard a cry for less development and more focus on bugs i have also heard the idea of settling for 1 expansion per year to allow for a smoother transition and more focus on fixing old bugsi am not here to say which is better but to get a feel of the number of pilots that would be happy waiting 36 extra months for expansions that are noted to be excessively large this in turn allowing the devs more time to work it out and the players more time to assist with bug testing i also have no clue of marketing and how something like this would affect new subscription numbersslade
yeshard dating a expansion like they did this time with a tied in box release with atari has forced them to push out a dodgy releasei for one would rather wait for something whole and complete than new fluff that is buggyi realise that no release can be 100 bug free but i feel if ccp had taken a bit more time on this expansion there would of been a lot less problemsbugs and they would of been able to implement features in their whole form instead of how some of them are currently only half way implemented since they ran out of dev time
i agree whole heartedly nothing can be bug free but i would love to let the devs have all the time they need to work the magic we all know they can weaveposted to show my supportslade
i always wonder why they continue to plan for two expansions a year when each one gets released with so many bugs in fact i would prefer that their next expansion add no new content i want the next expansion to just fix all the bugs broken mechanics and rebalance all the things that players have been asking for years things like sov mechanics pos mechanics add some functionality for alliance management rebalance missiles explosion velocity rebalance projectile turrets and minmatar ships in general feel free to add what other broken features you feel have been swept under the rug and ignored by ccp
my main man left me for a wormhole not to be confused with a scummy exotic dancer for the past two days he is stuck in an unknown system he is a good scanner pilot and found the wormhole minutes after the upgrade however after waiting till end of day enough ships passed through it to cause it to be unstable so much so that when he jumped through it it collapsed behind him trapping him and a corp matehe loves the new game mechanics and even his current predicament is funny to him he continues to scan for a way out but there is some evil he has found a system that is super full of roid belts and worm holes are mixed with that class additionally there is no way of knowing if there is a wormhole at all thus he keeps scanning finding only more belts gas clouds and stations guarded by sleeperson the first day there were pilots from other systems not just his so that meant there was more wormholes but after they all closed other pilots were killing themselves to return homeon the second day yesterday he scanned for about 6 hours finding nothing but more roid belts the issue is that there should be at least an indicator that a wormhole exists someplace in the system no it should not tell you where it should not even hint location but just a binary yesno like the original system scans could do for bases just a simple there is hope today yes or sit back and enjoy your cell no would not be a big whoop to game mechanics and would do much to reduce the frustration the issue is a simple mechanism that exists there is a wormhole there is not a wormhole would not negate the need to still search the 37 roid belts to find itwhine callers yes he could destruct pod out yes he could of stayed home yes he understands the risk of wormholes
sounds like the ultimate pvperspirates type of areasorry but honestly i dont see a problem with thisyou go for riches and gloryexpect riskits expected for people to overwhelm these wh systemsid say give it a week when the attention tapers off and people figure it out
pretty much what he said ccp doesnt need to change the current mechanics its fine youll figure it out or you just wont explore wspace it was never meant to be safe or easyisaac
i got trapped in a wormhole yesterday found its replacement within 20 minutes a hole im pretty sure didnt exist before we collapsed the other one came out 31 jumps from home but it was still highsec im pretty sure that every wormhole system has a way out to somewhere you just need to find it i agree that its a major pain winnowing out the gravimetrics to find the wormholes but from mylimited of course experience with wormholes there is always a way out
you kids had it easy now its time to really play the gamebout time something came along to disrupt the status quowh ftw
i think he means there is an issue figuring out which of the signatures you find is the wormholei have seen this before when i was probing sometimes the system is just loaded with stuff having to narrow down which one is the wh is a serious pain in the arse if you get unlucky you could be there for hours trying to finagle which one is the one you want out there are time sinks and there is needless tedium all the while your mates are griping at you about how long it is taking while they sit therewhile i am all for keeping it not ultra simple i think some improvement could be made here some way to be able to sort and remember which stuff youve sorta found from which you still have to scan and so on there still should be some skill to it of course
first  tell your mates to stop sitting around go make some isk while you look second  heck no this should be kept very difficult if an exploration team sets of into the unkown there should plans and preparations for not neccessarily being able to easiliy find the way back home or further in we should expect to sometimes be stuck for days in a wormhole system looking for a good way to move forwardbackwardonward its the freaking unknown  it should not be like getting in and out of a mission or a deadspace
thisread the backstoriesfor those tldr idiots  the pioneers of new eden never had it this easy they had to struggle to build those fancy stargatesquit your griping get to work
well we just went in to check it out and my mates were in throwaway ships and got owned we pretty much expected that no biggie at all and had fun checking things out as a result there was really nothing they could do but sit there and i agree this should not be simple like warping to a gate i am not suggesting some big flashy sign on the map proclaiming a wormhole is thereunless you have experienced this it is difficult to explain really you need to try it and personally face this issue to have a feel for iti am all for keeping the overall mechanic what i would like to see would be something akin to pushpins on a map that the player can put there for themselves so when you narrow down a sig and it says what it is you can note on your map that grav site is there then go scan down something else once you leave the system or logoff all that info is erasedthat keeps the overall mechanic in place which is fine but allows the prober a better sense of what hes already found so he can continue in a more careful manner
that sounds like a freakin dream no players for days on end he shouldve brought a pos maybe freightered in some fuelnext time i got through a wormhole im going in there with a few iteron vs with gear for a few months worth of a stay
i agree but sooner or later you will want to leave and bring your loot back
hate to say it but theres this thing called bookmarkswarp to site drop a bookmark and move onits not that hard of a conceptyes theres alot of stuff but you have to explore its not supposed to be easy
you cannot warp to anything till you have probed out its exact location at which point it shows on your map anyway thing is you usually know what type of sig it is wh or grav or radar or whatever before you nail it 100so as you would have it despite knowing the sig you just found is not the one you want we are supposed to spend more time nailing it 100 so we can actually note that we found it why does that make sense why is it unreasonable to move along to another sig once you have done enough work on one to know it is something other than you want note you still have to do the initial legwork at least to get a clue as to what the site is and i am fine with that i just see no reason to spend another 5 minutes or whatever on each pinning it down to 100 when i already know i do not care to go there
allright i was unaware of the nature of scanning down sigs to that degreebut another 5 minutes is not going to destroy the world eitherthis is supposed to be a challengeconcord did issue a very stern warning after all
5 minutes is no biggie but it is 5 minutes if you are good andor lucky can be more now consider you may have a dozen or more sigs on your list to deal with with some bad luck you can easily push an hour or more particularly if you find yourself probing out something you already probed but did not nail to 100eta again this is something you really have to experience for yourself to get a sense of it grab a probe ship and zoom around hi sec till you find a system with a dozen or more signatures in it you can determine that on a first scan easily now set yourself the task of finding the wormhole and youll soon see the issue it is very frustrating
everyone starts somewhere eventually youll get it down to a systemagain i get what your saying but you need to understand something my perspective has been altered by the fact that everyone has had it easy and with the introduction of wh space now theres a stark contrasti expected people to react negatively to iti suggest you give it some time before you cast judgment on the mechanics
fwiw i love the new probing system reallyi think it is a huge improvement to how it was and makes it interesting now i am not complaining overall and if youll note above i pretty much want it left unchanged i just want a mechanic that allows me to know which things i have already worked on and which i haventkeep it as it is mostly though well a better method ala homeworld i think to rearrange probes would be nice too but that is minor detailsnot fundamental mechanics
fair enough

he knows exactly what he is talking about zero sec is a collection of about 5 or 6 power blocks that control all but a few systems excluding npc space unless you look at venal nc might as well claim sov would make no difference with bob gone will we ever see a war again you have the russians in the north slapping at nc kinda not really you have goon blue to everyone in eve pandemic legion sitting fat and happy with goons there best paying client living to the south and nc who is a bunch of complaining girls that dont want to be seen as catty but really talk about each other behind there back yep zero sec is like high school and in truth only about 5 or 6 alliances run the show
so he knows what hes talking abouti thought were here to talk about facts not about feelingsdo me a favor smartass tell me how many alliances currently hold territory on the gridthen come back here and tell me theres 2 to 4 alliances who really control nullsecseriously stop your crying and learn to play the gameyou people should spend less time griping about big alliances like goonswarm and others and more time working together to take im oncrying gets no one anywhere and making ccp redesign the game just because you dont like it wont work eitheryes pos warfare makes it insanely difficult but not impossiblesaying stupid assed things like only a few alliances really have control speaks mountains of your ignorance on the mattereven smaller alliances have a degree of influence
yeah i have to agree with drake sure there are coalitions but there isnt 24 it only seems like that because bob just got steamrolled by all of eve online which yeah it sucks but its life and we all move on there are many alliances that hold their own ground without conforming to these 34 alliances such ascva sure they have friends but it doesnt include bob or goonswarmmany alliances in npc space sure they dont own space but the willhave pandemic legion operates on its own many many moreso no its not one coalition of alliances right now the game mechanics just dont support one coalition of alliances eve is too big and too small for this right now its very possible to operate on your own you just cant be huge when you start hint start small then expandso no supportisaac
im quite sure there are hidden agendas and political discussions you are totaly not aware of between smaller alliancesits in everyones best interest to take on the bigger power blocsbecause they can do one thing they cant build super capsand thats a strong motivational kick in the pants
thread has derailed into trolling and off topic repliesto the op  please feel free to use the skills section of the forums to talk about skill related issues i would suggest that you post in proper english if yo do not want your thread to go off topiclocked
t2 bpos only provide an advantage in that for the quantity of stuff that can be produced for them a tiny fraction of the demand of the entire market that stuff has a lower cost of production than inventionyou see a t2 module bpo can produce about 1500 items per month if you imagine how many sensor booster iis are sold per month then you can see that the market controlled by the bpos output is a tiny fraction if for example we are talking about ecm burst iis then the demand for the item is less than the bpos outputso what bpos do is ensure is that crappier t2 items are seeded on the market at near to cost price regardless does the bpo owner make a lot of money here no because the entire output of the bpo isnt being produced or sold and theres no invention going on because its a waste of timeisk for an inventor to bother with that itemwhat invention does is bring volume to the supply of the market and why you will always find that sensor booster ii available almost everywhere is the t2 bpo owner making a lot of money manipulating this market no hes making a little more profit margin than the inventor but he couldnt possibly control the market even if he wanted to since he doesnt have enough volume to affect itdont think a t2 bpo is an i win at making isk button its as much a curse as a blessingso its a balancing act t2 bpos and invention work with and against eachother at the same time dont get rid of them as they actually provide a net advantage to the market

id like to bring up the pos fuel pellet idea
hii am posting not because i want or need missiles to work properly again  i am happy running missions in my vargur  but looking at my ancient navy raven i was wonderingwhat are cruise missiles good for nowadays they do have lower dps than turrets they do even less to the vast majority of targets frigs  cruisers they have a counter lowering their dps even further defenders they are still of no use in pvp torps have their users they are expensive  and you need more of them to kill the same targets they have a low rofso this being said i would like a thought being spent on the primary weapon of caldari ships the cruise missile the weaponsystem that does not work without rigs andor painternow its true that artillery is low in dps too but who needs artillery in times where acs can operate in the interesting range up to 50km without trouble just another issue of a weaponsystemi have tried many a thing to get my ravenhull to even work close to the efficiency of a gunship not even the golem gets close its a waste of really expensive ammunition this being said its a plain statement that from pve point of viewmael  apoc  hyperion  ravennavy apoc  navy mega  navy tempest  navy ravenvargur  paladin  kronos  golemthats just due to there being no  no  pve battleshipsized missiles that work actually id say that nighthawk  raven because it can hit cruisers simple as thatthere are some optionsa cruise missiles get tuned to work at least against cruisers again pvp problematicb missions get redone less frigscruisersc you are happy with the way things are and missiles will go the artillery way please switch golem to guns then
i would never change my navy raven for any other tier123faction bs when it comes to missionsand i am not even caldari specced
fact is that the socalled balancing has virtually unbalanced a lotcaldari is a race that is mainly missile based but with the current changes these same missiles have become pretty void in pvpexample 1 an interceptor sees a gunboat and decides to go tackle him he wont go straight at him if hes at range because that would be quit suicidal thus he has to move in a more eliptic manner thus increasing the time to get into warp scramble rangenow that same interceptor see a missile boat does he have to think about turret tracking no he doesntand if he speeds up enough he can just go straight at the target because his speed will decrease the incomming dps from missiles somuch that it isnt even hard to tank thatthus a missile boat will be warpscrambled faster because of the less traveltimehowever if something like a torpedo or cruisemissile hits an incomming ship frontal it actually should be more like damn that thing is allmost the same size of my shi splutyes a targetpainter is nice to use now here comes another thing into play howevera targetpainter is a midslot mod and guess where the main part of caldari defence is based atyes its midslots because caldari are shieldtankerswell go use drones then people saynow here comes another point the caldari state saw this gallente plan to decrease the damage done by their missiles and the need for more drones so they made sure all caldari ships now had a tad more dronebay so they actually could use drones a tad more effectivlythis last line was purely fictional since we all know we didnt get any more dronespacea rokh has a 50m3 dronebay if he gets warpscrambled and deploys drones a few small frigate sized ships can take those drones out faster then he can set them onto a target which leaves him completely helplessgive the caldari ships a bit more dronespace to rebalance a bit and let missiles also insta hit instead of traveling and traveling and by the time they actually hit they might just have been miss due to the speedtanking of the very low explosion velocities of nowadays
vuk lau  try autocannons  i dare yaand i still stand at cruise missiles and torpedos are the only weaponsystem that require 3 lows 1 med and 2 rigslots to work they work okish then
with new expeditions to wspace and the lethality of the sleepers vs drones it would be very useful if there was a way to replace drones from cargoholdsit should be a non combat operation something like deploying a pos structure maybeselect drone from cargo hold select deploy to space packed drone icon appears in space you have options to unpack or scoop to hold if you select unpack the drone open up like a structure you get a countdown timer 5 minutes till when you can scoop to drone bay allow 1 drone to be unpacking per level of drone interfacing skill
moved to features and ideas
something like this would be usefull dunno if it should be unpacking or what but this way you would not be able to do it in the middle of the fight as it should be and it would take a while but in long expeditions it would work well
i dont even think it needs to be a whole multistep process just make it take about 10sec like loading more ammoread eve chronicles the vampire and notice how the drone was laying in his hold and with a few buttons it was out in space it didnt take an act of congress it didnt take an orcas maint bay and yet ccp keeps writing all these wonderful stories and yet boning the players with game mechanics
yes please
do it
yes please change font ccp its such a small change but would be a huge benefit to all of us
i totally agree
kenzoku aaa and goonswarm agreeing on something must be a good idea
good point kenny
yes capitals should have a different jump animation than plebes without jumpdrives
i hate to admit it but the kenny does have a point
itoo want to see old jump animation
i have a list of things i want to come back actuallyjump graphicscloakdelcoak soundbubble visibilitysee related thread in this forumand the classic skin on my hulk yes i know this wont happen
100 agree the old effect is way better then this new one
signed
supportedwhen i jumped my carrier i was like ok show me a cool new effect but was like really dissapointed bring back the coolness
make better effects
soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo agreedjumped thanatos then moved it through jumpbridge very disappointingi love all the other effects
bring back the lightshowsigned
singed with awesomenesswe must retain the awesomeness that was the cyno effect
old effect ruled
signedfor all cyno ships please we payed a lot of isk for them we deserve some bling blingps not necissarly the old one back just somthing a bit more awesome  scalable then the droplet effect bloom and lightening and sparks and ponies and and hell just loads of particles
im wondering if there is some technical reason less lag or something ccp did this because i cannot imagine they looked at this and thought hey thats sooo much cooler than the old one maybe icelanders just have dramatically different aesthetics than everyone else in evei dunnohell i never jump drive anywhere but i love watching it in eve movies not to mention anything that can get goons and kenny agreeing has my vote
i agree that the current cynosural effect is quite lame so yea bring back the old one with some added bling bling or make a new one

supported well thought out ideas rather than the usual buff minmatar nerf caldari and amarr commentsi love the tempest its upright it has sails it looks and feels cool imo but its so hard to try and make it work better than either the phoon or the maelstromlets just hope the designers listen
i like the boost bonus on the maelstrom myself and it makes level 5 considerably more appetizing for mini bs but good to look at the tempest for sure a little grid would go a long way or perhaps a fallof bonus and a 75 dmg or rof bonus
unfortunately this is the sad truth ccp keeps trying to expand the game and add new cool features rather than of making sure that current features work well and make sense
a lot in bob think the csm is a farce and only read this forum from work for the general idiocy actually that wouldnt make the csm half bad moderators 
clean coad and charge 1m isk for every letterword posted therebye bye goon crepes postsbye bye jade wallotext with extra bits of selfinflation
so far there has been a titan dd attempt on sleepers and motherships in wormholes confirmed so i do not know where you get your information fromas for the dd fix it actually points them in line with their original concept massive effects to fleets especially in a focused area wo being the 1 touch i winthink of it this way if a bs has 8 guns and a dd goes off with the heat damage proposal only on average it will lose nearly 2 guns from 1 dd multiple dd remove multiple guns add that to bubbles on a fleet and drones being killed with damage from the dd and you have a virtually defenseless fleet ripe to be smashed by your smaller fleet add in the other effects as well like cap drain and warp disruption for 20s and mwding is even temporarily removed from the picturei mean how does that devalue a dd for anyone other than a mail whoring titan pilot
hey look a particularly awful band of brothers fc arguing in favour of a supercapital boost my word
sorry i would much rather a drone control range boost and moving while triage than the ability to carry around some hacksalthough pouring hacs onto the gatecamps i solo hotdrop would be ing hilarious i see massive potential for abuseedit also your resist and hp changes would make supercaps pretty much immmune to support fleets under 500 people
also some proof here would be nice to show you arent simply talking about  you know nothing about lawl bob with supercaps that arent camped into pr ive personally tried to throw my wyvern through several dozen wormholes that fit capitals with no luck so far
from our dev buddies
and they know everything about their own game hrmmmm didnt i read about a pos exploit recently what they say and whats reality are 2 different things
these ships have maintinence bays for loot why do you need to hold onto it
lawl silly ccp they should learn the in game like bob hasseriously stop posting and lead more hilariously terrible fleet ops
those pesky neuts how dare they defy your logic about supercap kills stupid capacitor weaknesses as for moms and titans it has been done on sisi ive not checked into it enough post patch
it was allowed on sisi it wasnt on tranq the devs even spoke on this curse those devs ing all of your assumptions based off what you heard from a dude who heard from a friend
my appologies ill be sure to log into msn tonight after our op as for the changes youve refuted one small portion of an otherwise solid idea
i refuted several you just chose to argue only one
from the patch notesthe changes they made to the collision mechanics seem to have worked as stated in the patch notes smaller ships now bump larger ones lesshowever there seems to have been an unintended side effect of this change capitals bump each other massive distances at high velocitieswhen does this occur fleet warping from one location to another jumping to a cynosural field undockingas far as i can tell this is the result of having collision activated while clipped into another object which then ejects the objects away from each other this happened before the collision mechanics change but has become much more extreme since thenheres an example of a capital bumpplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthe two selected dreadnoughts were fleet warped to the same location as me in a small group of capitals and were bumped the huge distances pictured above gang warping jumping together or even undocking two capital ships at the same time all carry a significant chance for these bumps which can send a normally very slow ship massive distances rendering them unable to warp for upwards of several minutes and also possibly spreading edges of a fleet past the hard coded lock range limit of 250km if two people are bumped in opposite directions and each travel 150km as pictured above the current mechanics available to move capitals around as a fleet are almost unusable because of these bumpsthis needs to change and it needs to change fast
if its that massive an effect i agree totally
thats insane looks like fun though actuallyyou should probably report this as a bug if you havent already
this is a massive issue fix it
to add to the original post while registering my supportwe tried various techniques to minimize bumping last night including limiting the number of capitals warping to a specific 10km distance interval to as low as 35 the problem is minimized when doing this and when all ships arrive on grid at the same time bumping occurs and its worse than preapocrypha but seemed somewhat manageable when just one ship warps in late to the same location the remainder fly like bowling pins something is seriously screwed up in the mass  inertia calculations herewith only 20 capitals warping to the same point my estimate is at least 15 will consistently be bumped large distances 50 km or more in larger capital fleets the bumping frequency will likely be even more pronouncedclearly this is not working as intended and ccp should begin working on a resolution immediately i hope they acknowledge the issue and offer to reimburse capitals lost due to long range bumps in the interim
motherships can very easily bump caps offgrid 500 km away simply by warping in at the same point or cynoing into the same beacon
wow you said you were going to post a thread about me ctrl qing i cant believe you actually did it but hey there are more whine threads about this than pos warfare so sure ill support it because itll never happen
youre probably right it seems ccp is more concerned with carebears having their way and ensuring their security that and stupid pilots all these people complain that they dont have a stable connection and its not fair whats not fair is that for every 1 person with a faulty connection there are 5 asshats exploiting that saying they dropped
sup i ctrl qed to save the 15b in my freighter what category do i fit in
cap vs cap all the dreads are finedread vs subcap honestly you think pheonix needs to be boosted to allow killing subcaps the hell the only reason moros does so well is the drones even then hotdrop the stupid moros who is killing subcaps and destroy it problem solvedi have that recent vid with the moros doing piracy he had to use faction scrams2 and web just to get those hits not to mention blasters so yes if the pheonix wants the same performance he better fit a web or have someone with a web might i suggest a marauderobviously i was at about 11km or so meaning he could overload and get me however by the time he burns out i have only taken a fair bit of dmg but i go back to tanking oh no doubt if i wasnt in the sweet zone idve been smoked lol
so if cap vs cap all of them are fine why can i speed tank a group of phoenix in a wyvern
totally agreei hate coming back with halfbaked loot and have to select everything just to repair a single item
yes
hello to allim sure this has been raised in many times and in many ways by different people but considering my current eve position i would like to start a thread of my ownbasically i would like to ask that ccp increase the benefits of low and high sec to move people out of high sec and increase the viability of all professions in the lower security regions it appears that eve has become a predominantly carebear orientated game with the latest patches increasing content to encourage people to stay in high security space without providing further incentives to move the influx of newer players into the lower security regions for example the rewards of high sec missioning are far greater than any to be acheived in 00 when you factor in the risk which is also a key elementi am now at the stage in my character development where i would like to go out to the lower security spaces and try out different professions whether it be low sec piracy or 00 gang warfare but struggle to see why it would be worth it when high sec has so many more targets which can be easily war decced or provoked into starting a fight if i need isk its a simple matter of running to a level 4 agent and spending a couple of hours doing missions and salvaging and i can afford a new battleshipwhat i propose is either a new feature which is only to be found in the lower security spaces or rewards which make it worthwhile to travel down through low sec and run the risk of being attacked so that both the carebears can experience new content and rewards and the pvp players will have more potential targets whilst also having the possibility of utilising these features to make isk or gain some other kind of reward factional warfare fyi doesnt cut it as the rewards are pretty much worthless especially considering the alternative rewards to be earnt in high secthere are plenty of whine threads on these forums criticising various aspects of eve whether it be perceived unbalancing of ships or apparent unfair mechanisms but i like the way it is but just want ccp to utilise the spaces that they have and provide an incentive for people to move out of the crowded empire regions hence lowering the lag factor allowing people to choose a viable path other than high sec living and give us some content which everyone can enjoytypical suggestions by the way which im sure people will mention increasing low sec mission rewards lowering the severity of the consequences of having a low security status increasing low sec and 00 mining rewards or an entirely new feature which im sure a member of the ever increasing eve community can come up withplease discuss any potential ideas at will
sorry pal but its quite obvious you have no bloody freaking idea what your talking abouta the expansion set  patch released content for all new eden wh space is in all areas highlowand 00b wh is practically low sec piracy has found a new sport there not to mention a great deal of many rewardsbut at the risk of getting trapped if you push your luckc 00 has many many rewards i know this to be a verifiable fact but only because ive seen and heard from our alliance you obviously have no bloody idea what goes on down there nor do you have any personal experience eitherbottom line i suggest you bother going down there before you cast judgment on something that is way over your headyes there is a valid problem but only because youve read about it play the game first before you make assumptions on a hot topicraising rewards will not accomplish the objective of making it lucrativethat has been proven many times over
if you bothered to actually read my post it wasnt regarding new areas for new eden it was to try and make more use out of low sec which in particular has fewer rewards than high sec as well as 00 which is all the harder to get into as a newer character particularly in small corps if you prefer independence over following an alliancewhilst wormhole space does offer new opportunities i sincerely doubt it will be a long term incentive for carebears to move out of high sec and will become more of a gimmick to a select group of players it appeals toalso i did not claim to be the master of all knowledge of 00 but wanted to simply start this topic as an ideas board for people to contribute to i hav ebeen into 00 plenty of times and still lack the incentive to stay there apart from to shoot up a few idle rattersi agree that raising rewards will not make it lucrative per se but there must be a way for the game to be balanced in such a way that we wont see the current demographic of the majority of the player base living in certain regions whilst others go practically unusedim sure even you will agree the lag over the past few days has been nothing short of ridiculous so i remain sceptical of the latest patch in general surely by providing a mechanic to move people out of high sec then the server would have a more equally distributed load and improve playing experience for everyone
no its not your just not trying hard enough the fact is 00 is meant for alliancessoloing wont do because 00 is typically held by gangs and if you dont have any isk they wont let you do anything you have to find an alliance that will let you do what you wantguess again bub your making assumptions read cp yes i know its ghastly and youll see its becoming a rather intersting incentive to drop poss in wh space for the reaping of rewardsthe trick is getting out again alive and its possible to do with the right amount of ambitionit might help to have some authority on the subject before making conclusions about something you dont know aboutthen your wasting time dont post something without having some sort of solution or it will be ignored or wasted onno i will not agreestop making assumptions about everyone else and start using your bloody headi have not experienced lag and im doing just fine thank you very much
low sec is doomed to suck it has all the worst traits of 00 and high sec combined with no of the benifits of either the moment something is done to change that say make something low sec exclusive you have effectly nerfed 00 which should always by intended design of the game be the area with the highest rewards and risk
well then ill just sit here and enjoy the fact that you are getting so worked up about it you feel the need to capitalise your statements god forbid someone might think its only a game and should pass their opinion on what they would like to see ill just let you carry on ranting might need to raise another thread requesting ccp ban the use of  over and over again
im not getting worked up over anythingyou are by the sheer fact your replying to each and every little response ive madeyou have no opinion you have assumptions your grasping at straws jumping at shadowsas it was so put best the balance of the game is not something to be idlely conjectured on its diverseits complexand ill be damned if i let someone make assumptions and sway other people who think they know whats whati never said i was an expert in 00 or low sechell i rarely ever come up with ideas because 9 times out of 10 they are all crapthis game is very complex you nerf one thing it jacks something elseyou buff one thing it screws the rest of the system outlow sec is supposed to be risky and its made risky due to piracyif it wasnt so bloody dangerous people would go there more often so people who have no intention of losing there hard earned isk will not go there instead they pass it entirelyi however will not i fully intend to strike out in low sec when my agenda goals have been met to prove everyone wrong that low sec can be made useful its just a matter of perspective if i find out otherwise then at least i gave it my bestunlike someone who makes assumptionsat least with wh space theres a lovely distraction and thats just fine by me
speaking for me only the reward of moving out of highsec is being out of highsec if a pilot is satisfied punching a clock for the man working for an agent so be it i could never be satisfied with that and cant imagine that extra incentives are neccessary for pilots to get out of high sec moving out of empire was like moving out of my parents house when i turned 18  i couldnt do it fast enough
op is so failno change is needed

ok i dont know about the big alliances but even just managing a small alliance and its issues takes me away from playing the game so here is my proposals to allow alliance management to be more streamlined1 in the alliance tab add the ability to set the fee for corp membership of the alliance a give a couple of options ie monthly quarterly yearly by corp size b add a date of collection ie 1st of the month c make it automatic as in it sends an automatic bill to each member corp that appears in there wallet on the set date and which they can click on to pay it2 change the standings system so that when you set a standing to a corp or alliance to blue it generates a message to there standings tab request for standing with an optional message field they have the option to accept or reject the request if they accept both entities standings to each other are set the same if they reject then neither entities standing is changed as an addition if one part of the nap or friendship changes there mind and resets there standing the other part is automatically notified and there standing reset to neutral no notification would be given if you where changing your standing from neutral to enemy or unfriendlythis should free up alot of evemail lists and time spent crunching standings3 give the option to set roles and titles at alliance lvl across alliance corps so that trusted people can be given access to set standings manage alliance owned structures and an alliance hanger like corp hanger but id suggest only 4 tabs that should be enough alliance research roles manufacturing and combat roles4 an alliance message of the day system and alliance op advertisement system  bit like the corp recruitment system but internal to alliance corps only can be only used by designated alliance officers using suggestion 3 above again this would free up evemail this would also be handy at corp level too5 automatic paying of alliance bill from exec corp designated wallet as long as the wallet has enough isk the bill is payed warning evemail sent to all alliance designated officers in the case of lack of funds6 alliance vote system for disbanding of alliance and a minimum of 1 week for the vote all ceos of member corps to have the capability to vote only ceo of the exec corp can call for alliance disbanding on failure of the vote the execcorp loses noiminated status and the alliance needs to nominate a new exec corp alliance benefits suspended as per current game dynamics7 ability for all players to set a discount on there market sell orders for alliance andor corp members ie as a percentage off  also allow all alliance members to search the market for alliance members sales  keeps the isk in the alliance and also allows the alliance to sell alliance produced products to its members8 ability to lock alliance mail or assign posting privliges too member corp ceos and directors onlyall in all the above ideas are to make alliance management easier remove the need for alts in a seperate exec corp and to seperate exec corp directors from alliance management unless they have the required roles so improved security improved communication between member corps and more automation of important but time consuming game dynamics that detract the management players from being able to actually play the game and build up the alliance and there corps and most of all remove alot of typing of evemails replies and convos with fellow ceos when u could all be out pvping mining or whatever your enjoyment in eve isaluthinaka gregory condor chief exec of knightraven allianceall critism and suggestions welcome
i cant support this either  it would change the dyanmics of gatecamping too much

i agree with this idea  cloaking ships should not be able to stay cloaked in systems for hours on end with impunity in warfare there is a counter to everything
thisbut im not that ok whit the ideathere should be a counter to cloking but it just dosent feel like this is the solution
heres an alternate fix to cloaking remove local in 00 oh wait

pos shields are nauseatinghavent seen a warp bubble yet im too busy trying not to get seasick while trying to manage my pos fleet 
just went through a bubble tonight and it is identical to being inside a pos shield aka nauseating
define this better im hearing pos shields look like a gian christmas light nowif this is what you saw then for the love of god tell me how i can deal with giant overglowy ball if it means i can see the bubble lol
being inside a pos shield is like being behind a waterfall a low res waterfall at that there is no freaking mistaking it though if you see it you will know itas for how i did it no clue really i have a good machine and all eyecandy settings maxed i also have anisotropic filtering af forced on in my video drivers to x8 nhancer ftw i did notice when i flew 20km away from the bubble it disappeared completely flew back closer and it just blinked back into existence so maybe if your af is low or off it is technically too far away from you for the computer to draw it total wild assed guess there but something you might look in to
screw the box and make it ao
the problem is that some very large retailers like walmart or at least they use to refuse to stock games with ao ratings it would bad business decision to make the game ao and possibly lose massive sales over an exotic dancer
i seriously doubt the idea to make a box for eve was a good one since most people that would pick it up will not keep playing for long
agreed id like to know this too im completely against any irrational censorship whats wrong with halfnaked bodies ffs its not like people cant just google pron and get about 08 internets worth of nakedness and to be honest i dont like the idea of ccp changing their game just to get a t sticker that might attract a few more noobs 99 of whom will quit after the first week and their first encounter with evil griefers aka other players the players with the maturity to stick to the game will almost exclusively ignore the t sticker or lack thereof
confirming ill be scamming and griefing any new players i encounter in order to prevent them from getting permanently scarred by naked women oh wait
speaking of censorship what about the cockpit you know the place where the pilot sits while flying
geez dont get a teen rating the reason people play this game is because there is a considerably less amount of whiny annoying chavs
well i took the time to read that entire thread and i agree with the naysayers the original idea as presented has the right goals and achieves none of them ive fueled a few poss in my time and i dont see how this is a benefit to that process maybe in empire it makes things easier but outside of empire it does notthis idea could work with some adjustments using a pellet in place of consumables isnt a bad idea in itself requiring the pellet to be manufactured and requiring the ice products to be present for that production are the main problems the isotopes need to be removed from that process to make it viable even then its still an extra step or an extra cost to do what people are already doing tldr 5 steps is more steps than 4 steps no matter how cool the name fuel cells soundsif the people who plan to present this toat the csm meeting really want to improve eve they should make sure that the problem they are trying to solve is real and that the solution addresses that problem correctly is it really a problem to have to do math to fuel poss afterall there is an in game calculator provided for those things lets say that it is a real problem in that case i think outsourcing the math at a cost in return for a magical fuel pellet is an ok solution however forcing people to deal with the pellet system just so a few people can avoid math doesnt seem right we need a solution that makes pos fueling easier for those who think its hard while not making it harder for those who think its just fine as is
anything that would help organization
when i started eve with my friends we had a corp of 5 members after 3 month we got wardecced by some selfappointed griefers and guess what we eventually beaten them we decided to ruin their gameplay with guerilla warfare we were using noob alts as eyes afking days if camped but only engage at least with the same numbers and odds they were running out of patience they made mistakes we used them out eventually they lost 2 bs 1 command ship 1 battlecruiser during the war against 3 month old noob characters without losses on our side and of course they were the one to retreat from the war eve isnt a game for whining there is always a solution just need to find it everything that doesnt destroy you will make you stronger and of course there is hello kitty online for the weak
signs graciouslyhere on the forums is where the mass majority of the eve game community participates in discussions about the game whats going on in game and various in game actions buying selling trading asking for help discussing future changes to the game etc community is the operative word if the csm are meant to represent the community than they should be able to bring up how ccp can make a better game as well as improve relations with the community and that happens on these forums
please reread the original post and what it is asking the vote to be about also look up the definition of purview getting a stated reason why someone has been banned should be a complete different issueivory
in the context of the op purview means means oversight not control
well every organisation govermental or otherwise that has a oversight committee has control
this the goon conga lineop has a point but forums isnt exclusively in game or out game it has eg the out of pod forums as well the corp recruitment forums the parts that are relevant to the in game real of new eden automatically are covered by csm anywaycsm at least should be able to comment on this privately and publicly without getting moderated besides mods shouldnt be allowed to play eve to avoid any biasi dont think this will change anything since your avg paranoia will continue to scream bias anyway csm oversight still will be very limited even then
supported i have also posted this and other alliance management tools here alliance management tools
a minor issue but one thats been annoying me lately when you buy and sell with both personal and corp orders the transactions window helpfully colourcodes which ones are corp orders and which ones are personal ordersblue and white respectively but theres no similar scheme for the orders window id like to see the same system get applied to the orders window as well to make the two types easier to distinguish
you have my thumb sirvery good idea
1 create a new ui element consisting of a single button alternatively this could be built into an existing ui element like the overview2 add a context mention option to certain entities eg bookmarks celestials stations poss and stargates called set warpto hot button that will set that entity as the current destination for the button3 when a player clicks the button one of two things happena if the destination is in the same system the ship will attempt to warp to the locationb if the destination is in another system the ship will attempt to warp to the out gate based on current autopilot settings warp to 0
this seems unnecessary the autopilot already highlights gates for wtzing and if the destination is in system you can just click on it and use the existing selected item interface to do this maybe make bookmarks selectableand alignable but thats an entirely different issue
agreedits just too easy to right click and warp to bookmarks as it ismake bookmarks easier to usebut otherwise not supported
yes nerf nonconsentual buddy listthat said the info it provides is fairley usless anyway p
you should stop going in and out of wormholes so often its bad for the mental acuity
since the dockingundocking games are becoming ever lamer each day i think its time for a slight revamp this is a 2 parter part 1if we are allowed to hit station services the docking point should be added to this system obviously you need to be able to dock so rather than break until repaired it should become a redocking time game based on ship size bigger ships would have a harder time moving through the rubble trying to redock a message would warn people of the hazzards of undocking as well so that the carebear nation of 00 could manage their emotional outburst of hatred for this idea keep in mind npc 00 would be left unchanged unfortunately the gayness would survive thereif offlinefrigates 30s redockcruiserhac 2 min redockbattleships 5 min redockcapitals 10 min redocklogistically the removal of this station feature would hurt alliances quite effectively strategically the undock pvp games especially with rr bs and carriers would be all but removed i personally am just sick of the carebear pvp huddling around the station 00 seems to be turning into as of late if youre gonna fight fight if youre gonna fight fightpart 2now the 2nd tear of this is related to just that notion of pvp without any station service feature involved if a ship aggros outside a station their flag time before redocking needs to be increased based on ship size npc or player owned stations alikeso if a player deems it necessary to aggro outside a stationfrigates redock 30scruisers 1 minbs 3 mincapitals 5 min half a siege cycle of timer allowing for hot drops if theyre so stupid as to aggrofrom a common sense perspective a big ass ship undocking would naturally take longer to redock in the first place so from a simple role play perspective this makes more sense but to a further extent it removes the  tease pvp that station camping is turning into
i would rather see all undock timers be 2min minimum nothing based off ship sizes though also not caring if you shot someonebut there should then coupled with that have an ability to see if someone is uncloaked ala overview outside your station
2 minutes isnt enough time for a mistake to be made in a capital and most times in a rr bs group this is intended to force more sense into doing something rather than the haphazzardness with which people play in 00 npc is left unaffected and all of 00 is left unaffected unless youre under direct attack requiring you to actually defend yourselves god forbid you shouldnt be able to pvp and use docking as a tanking method
just make the redocking timer based on the sig of the shipsmall ships redock almost immediately larger ships take longereverywhere
how about you just say undocking timer based on and cut out the melodramatic craphonestly i dont really see the reason for all of that unless you allow multiple undocking pathwaysthen you can use all the timers you want
well that would be a pretty annoying feature  think of it just a simple example you are going after your friendly fleet of bs allready in late by 2 jumps you undock and realize that u left your favourite exotic dancers  your lucky charm in the station your most important attribute in fleetbattles is your name and your luck so you dont get primaried now if you have to wait 2 damn minutes by the time you undock again the fleet is allready 8 jumps away and you probably will end up dead because thats the fate of straglersall i wanted to say is that redock should be aggro affiliated if u dont aggro why to waste your timeand of course i give my support for the rest no docking at least for 5 minutes if uve aggroed
yes a delay to docking but as with freelancer u have to request docking permission before waiting a set time before being towed to the station
this
agree with the op
a more proper solution is to look at the current station dock radius and make sure that it is relatively same distance 3 km to the undock pointright now we got some stations with 0 distance between undock and dock point and other stations with 15 km  ridiculously huge dock radiusalso in the past a good way to counter docking games was to use bump mechanics with nanoed hacs and battleships since the nanospeed tactics were removed from game bumping has suffered a great decrease in potency its nearly impossible to bump a carrier from dock range with current speeds and agility
that too needs to be looked at i agree there are some stations with 30100km undockredock radius the docking feature as a whole needs an overhaul this is just my contribution to what needs fixing
while im almost tempted to say thatd be one of the best things possible for the game itll never happen because of marketing requirements theyll keep trickling out improvements over time like they have been and well get there eventually also dont assume any amount of testing will get you a bugfree product some things just dont show up on test server scales  either nobody runs into it or the problem is only existent at a scale that the test servers dont reachie anything that downs jita sometimes putting it up live is about the only thing you can do to debug it
i can see it now the marketing add we fixed all the bugs and game play issues finally its safe to play nowi would not mind at all if new content was postponed to ensure it works properly and does not create any new issuesbugs due to short sightedness as well as fixing a lot of the broken mechanics
i am willing to deal with the occasional bug as long as it accompanies everincreasing levels of awesome so far so good  i think ccp needs to keep on keepin on

small fast ships up front with scram  web  small guns frigsmedium range guns  ecm  extra webs in center cruiserslong range ships sitting more to the rear with dedicated long range ecm capitals at the back engaging at max range or providing logistic supportremote reps at all ranges and dedicated logistics ships free to move throughout the fleetwould look cool and if properly implemented in a fight could possibly be maintained in larger fights  25 vs 25  small fleets would never maintain formation though so it would only be nice for pritty pictures
ccp made it clear enouf befor the pachthere will be atleast 1 wormholewormhole sistemthis mite lead to known space or to a nother wormhole sistemit mite not have the mass to let u pass but there will always be a connectionso keep scanning
no
are csm being paid to be totally flaccid impotent and generally ineffective i wonderthey remind me of rl politicians
oh fun vague allegations of stupid conspiracy theories being shouted from the rooftops congratulations youve managed to oneup the jpsc people dont care about the csm so im going to protest them by not voting whiners
you havent tackled missiles ships with an interceptor lately you cannot tank them like before speednerf everything cruiser  bc will kill your orbiting interceptor slowly where turretships wont hit after all even skilled ravens without neutralizers can kill your interceptor why after all a small ship like an interceptor should be able to outmaneuver such big things so the missiles dont even explode yes and tracking enhancers  damage mods  passive eccm sensor thingies use armortanking slots whats you problem exactly unlikewhat you know other ships drones get popped the same way at the same time unless the player sits in a moros dominix ishtar vexor arbitrator curse pilgrim did i miss any so if missiles hit instantly why not use turrets anyway also missiles dons miss they hit no matter what what unless you are out of range
maybe as an extra role for logistic ships or especially for drone boats so all ships could reconfigure their dronebay at a droneboat  logistic ship

signed  new effect sucksi loved the old cyno effect it was even more impressive when 50 or more capitals cynod inout together
bring it back for both capitals and jump bridges
agreeing with this kenzoku dude that the old cyno effect was way cooler
in my very early days i was lucky enough to see a mothership jump it was incredible now wow ccp i think one blemish on the new graphics
so many nice new efffects yet you remove one of the ones that was actually really cool from the old setbring back the funnel or better yet an improved version 
old cyno effectskreeeeeeeeeepeeeeeow followed by the rumble and a lightning storm as though thor himself was descending from the heavensnew cyno effectshloopthis sucks change it back
if their was more added to the new effect when used for a cyno jumpi think that could be an acceptable compromise but atm it lacks any sort of impactand is a move in the wrong direction graphically
hell yea we need a better cyno effect i loved tearing space appart as i jumped before apoc now it looks like dropping a pebble in some water UFFFDUFFFD
the old one is so much better its hard to put it into words
yah
hell yes this new effect is a total pice of shi the old cyno lighting was just wow evey time
no support current cyno fits with current warping effects also it reduces lag and strain on graphics not hearing 50 dreads cyno in is also a plus kakakakakakaboomkakakaboom boomkakaka boom boom boom yeahanyway unless op can come up with a better idea for an improvement to current cyno effects there is no support for this topic as all it does is say please ccp change it but to what i dont know you do it so i can complain about version 30rightisaac

too bad this isnt entirely true yes the cyno jump bubble effect does imitate gate jumping however the gate animation is also a part of the gate jumping process cynos basically need to have their own gate animations in addition to the jumping bubble effect

physicsissue capital bumping is now completely absurd
1 need love and definitely need 1640mm arties
1 very good post
great job pattern
sounds great for snipers but i swear to god that if my maelstrom loses its shield boost bonus there will be hell to pay id rather see them give large projectiles about 7 more damage all around change the rof bonus on the mael to damage bonus it would keep the same dps as now but would gain a lot of alpha with 1400s and would eat less ammo with acsbut for the love of god dont touch that shield booster bonus
its generally quite hard to explain how a 10 shield hp bonus is actually pretty powerful in both pvp in small gangs and pve hint it can tank 800dps passively right now 50k shields hp bonuses stack with extenders unless your able to do the math my advice is to trust me
please fix this ccpps anyone championing this cause will instantly become my best friend
there is no game mechanic difference at all between empire and pirate agents and standingsfaction standing from storyline missions cannot be shared with a gang no exceptionshaving 20 or worse with a faction after skills blacklists you for all agents in all corporations of that faction no exception
sigh necro with outdated information about a bug that had already been corrected at the time
not later not eventually not never fix them nowhere is a good step in the direction of making them usefulregular drone damage bonus of 1015 per level of carrierregular drone speed increase of 20 per level both mwd and normal speedincrease drone control range by 30km per level of carrierall drones armorshieldstructure hp increase of 20 per levelewar drone effectiveness increase of 520 per levelincreased remote repcap transfer range bonus to 100 per levelincreased calibration to be able to use 3 t2 rigsrole bonus that allows them to move while triagedthere you go ultimate drone ship that is still very killable no increased hp no increased resists just more utility in what the devs have stated is its role
yesthis is a much more balanced proposal than the other supercapital change thread easier to implement and less likely to break something while giving motherships needed improvement
also i will support my own thread
motherships dont need to get bonuses to their damage they arent suppose to be an even more powerful and imbalanced version of the morosincrease remote transferrep range per level yesincreased amount or decreased cycle time yesmove while in triage probably isnt possible but would pass on thisincreased calibration id like to see 56 rig slots for super caps and 45 for capitals in general really maybe not the ability to throw on half a dozen t2 rigs of your choice but 5600 calibration and 56 slots would be awesome even if it just results in massive ccctrimark stackingthe mothership isnt suppose to be the ultimate drone ship more like the ultimate fleet support ship i dont ever recall them saying the motherships intended role was to be drone death incarnate thats what people simply want to see it become
why wouldnt it be possible to let them move while triaged the triaged module gives you a 100 speed buff you simply turn that off the same you turn off targeting delays for stealth bombers uncloaking we want it given a role currently it has zero role that cant be filled equally by a much much cheaper ship if they want it to be high end repping make it that if they want it to be drone  incarnate make it that but being a very very expensive carrier whose only major differences are clone vatlololol no one uses those remote ecm burstawesomely fun and a few extra fighters takes out any real value of owning onefor the cost of one ms you could buy several carriers and a character fully skilled to fly them
sounds good to me
seems like a good idea to make ms actually worth something
this isnt the perfect solution but for the love of god do something
hmm yes a role bonus to remove the immobility penalty on triage for a ship that is immune to ewar what a fantastic idea i too would like a ship that is immortal so long as it is near a pos shieldbesides that these are reasonable changes but motherships will still be too weak for their cost
id just be happy if they tripled the carrying capacity of motherships that alone would make them quite worthwhile both cha  sma
supporting dis
endlessly circles a can at the edge of a hardened pos shield while in triage mode making shooting a pos take 4 hours longer
ya its a shame you cant already do this with a bs fleet a titan a few carriers or any number of other things also im not really sure what sort of mothership you flawlawl none ever but youre not going to orbit  every fast and youre still susceptible to being bumped and nueted down to dead as you come out of the shields
motherships being able to move in triage is a great idea they still cant warp or cyno out but they will finally be fill the roll of offensive repping which is done better by a triage nidhoggur and a bump ship right nowas for the other changes all carriers really need extra drone range control for all drones
nope sorry the changes they need are defensive and support in nature not offensive repping is the biggest joke introduced to carriers since well anything in this game so thats pretty fail too what good does moving in triage do either people dont like using moms bc theyre predominantly offense and wo any decent lvl of defense they dont want to field them for fear of getting pop shot by dreads in under 5 seconds
agreed
i approve of this message
totally supported these ships are not worth one 10th of there cost and nobody is particularly afraid of them any more the op has the correct combination of pwaneg and vulnerabilitythough i am not particularly bothered whether the improvement are identical to the op the op is a cracking example
tbh youve designed another tier of carrier and not really a mothershipanother 3 types of carrier could really be created as teir 2 transport logisticsdefensive and offensive where as moms should be something else entirely even still the jump between carrier and mom right now is akin to that of frigate to interceptor
yes but only in the same way as the jump from battleship to titan your lines of thinking are fundamentally flawed  supercaps are supposed to be the end all why would you want another tier of things that are better ccp already stated they wanted to work down at this point not up
not supportedthis will not work people did not post in the summit and it died caod exists as a public forum if you want a private and further restricted forum ask for the summit back then it can die again from lack of interestyou cannot achieve this goal in a public forum format it is simply impossible
still time to give your support p
i pay a subscription fee i get to post on caod if im in a corporation alliance or organization
meh not supported caod is highly amusing and i like it as it is atmfor serious alliance and corp discussion most sane people just use shc
while i think motherships and titans need to be looked at i dont think these changes in particular are very good at all voted no
i agree with this post
this is a horrible idea
you forgot to ask for titans to be able to also permanently warp scramble everything in range of 250kmthey should also have huge speakers on the outside and broadcast propaganda not that anyone would hear but would still be cooland they should glow in dark
anyone supporting this particular proposal needs to have their head examined
a well balanced proposal that the csm should seriously consider
definitely valid concerns that need to be addressedi also want to say that i am disappointed with the bumping nerf mechanics for smaller ships bumping while unnatural offers very interesting tactical situations bumping a carrier out of dock range with battleships and hacs used to be pretty fun and balancedthis is one of those cases where we shouldnt make the game more realistic instead favor the fun factor strong bumping mechanics add an extra dimension to combat making smaller ships more valuable against larger ones
the patch definitely broke the hell out of bumping and it needs to be fixed to preserve normal capship combat and operationsedit and even with reasonable measures to stagger warpins and avoid this one or two ships getting flung across the grid into an indefensible spot is basically inevitable
i support this unless they bring back pos bowling then keep it in pls
this is a huge problem supporting this issue
totally broke
no its cool i love trying to shoot pos anywhere from 20km to 130km from my original warp in it adds a whole new level of wtf to the complexity of this game
i cant imagine what is happening now was an intended design decision by ccp
ridiculous

make the capitals well capital sized right now a carrier is about the size of a tear 3 bs yet it can fit two tear 3 bss in itself i think i heard they were bigger at one point but got smaller due to a performance issue or something so if its possible make them bigger not asking for stats increase or anything just a bigger model i can dwarf people with also show support for the cyno effect being revamped
youve never seen a naglfar undock from anywhere have you
supporti understand that the scale was origionally levelled off due to technical issues back in the day id like to see if theese issues can now be addressed using current technologiespossibly an excuse to rework the rather scatty collision engine
i be happy if the phoenix could again battle with subcap ships and do some real dmg too them but i be happy if they just fix the issue where a moving target the size of a titan can speed tank a group of phoenix dreads its just sillyi looking at number here if i had a group of 10 phoenix dreads attacked by 15 battleships the phoenix crew would be whole sale screwed while on the other hand any other dread in a group of 10 could at least pose a danger too the enemysame issue when you scale up too capsno group of ships of any type or race should be useless simply as your target is moving
the op has in fact hit on the central problem to lowsec risk vs reward theres no reason to move to lowsec where the bulk of the gankers gather for the simple reason that i can make far more money with far less risk by not leaving highsec spacewhat would need to happen to change this is to make hisec less profitable not losec more profitable id probably start by cutting the rarer ores plag omber pyrox and kernite out of highsec space altogether yes im a miner yes that means im left with veldspar and scordite but theres only so much you can manufacture with just pyrite and tritanium and while tritanium may be the highest profit mineral atm i guarantee you would find some miners willing to take the risk to mine in lowsec  and charge incrementally more for those minerals that are now available only to those willing to take the risks to mine themthis would also teach the carebears guilty as charged to operate in packs for self defense and protection pvp in the game would go up meh i can take it or leave it but its occasionally fun as mining groups fought over asteroid belts which i think was kind of one of the points of eve and against the piratesadditionally this doesnt nerf nullsec because it doesnt take away any of the things only found there like the rarest of ores and of course sov howeverm it gives players an incentive to move out of high sec if they dont want to artifically limit their own income streamsit is indeed about risk and reward in this case its far more lucrative to skip low sec altogether and go straight into a nullsec alliance or stay in highsec than to try and operate in lowsec for any extended period of time
low secbs ratsmany more signatures and anomalies compared to highsec also less competition no real politics in lowsec as superlarge alliances have no reason to kill you in lowsec so guess what smaller corps can move out here and operate pretty successfully my previous corp didroids are better than highsec end of storyyou can make the rules without a lot of concord interference so yeah lowsec isnt super rich but it isnt super poor it has good risk combined with ample opportunity to make isk you just have to be creative about itno supportisaac
last 2 posters hit the nail on the head dead onthat is rational and makes sensehowever low sec risk may have changedtheres an increase in pirate traffic headed to whs so i would suggest taking a breather for a couple weeks and see what happens eh

ive been playing eve for a few months now using the classic client and i was always surprised to hear people say how ugly minmatar ships are i always thought they looked quite good well they did on the classic client after downloading the patch i logged in to find my rupture looked horrible it was one of my favorite ships in the game and now im embarrassed to fly it it would seem im not the only one almost all the minmatar pilots i spoke to who used the classic client said they hated the premium versions some ships like the hurricane are almost identical like the so dont really apply herebasically id like ccp to implement a poll for players to decide which ship models they would like to see ingame i think this is only fair seeing as so much of this game is player controlled
nodont care how loudly you crywhinegripethey will never do it
and why not from what i understand its the players who have made this game what it is why shouldnt we have a say in some of the aspects of it im not asking them to do this now but to consider the players who pay their subscriptions every month to continue playingplease refrain from posting in this thread if youre going to be ignorant or insulting
yes lets have ccp occupy their time with useless menial tasks because you dont like the look of certain ships minmatar ships are not famous for their asthetic appeal fly another damn race if your ugly ruppy is such an issue
ill refrain from posting when you grow a frakking brain and start using that grey matter for something useful other than stupid postsget this loud and clearto say such an asnine statement as this ship is ugly is like saying your face is ugly and i demand ccp change itget megood now you can do this 1 of 3 ways1 you go back and accept the fact that minmatar ships are duct tape with bailing wire and enjoy the fact that they are badass and ugly enough to make people laugh until they realize they just lost there armor to a hail of artiliery fire2 you reroll and pick a race that makes you look more attractive3 you quit the gameif there is one thing worse than a whiner its one who refuses to take into account that ccp has more importaint things to do then to fix one stupid paint jobthere is a grapihcal error in the malestrom class battleshipscheck the left rear of the ship and youll see a hole in the shell of the shipthis could be my graphics card but it shows up in the mac book pro as wellso yeahbut instead of screaming at ccp as i tend to be anal about such things i accept the fact that there are bigger fish to frywhen you reach that stage then youll be heardnot until then
ships varied thats the point
minmatar ships are ugly thats one of the reasons i love them they have that lived in look that makes star wars so much more appealing that the antiseptic cleanliness of star trek minmatar ships look like someones been using them for somethingthough tbh the rupture does look like a pneumatic nail gun
wow really your complaining about visuals why dont we complain about the gallente dominixclass battleship or the ospreyclass cruiser those are ugly so we should obviously waste devs time to make them look cool no support i dont know why i bothered replyingisaac
i have always taken to the minmatar ships  they look like somebody found a banged up concrete mixer on a scrap yard welded it to an oil rig and bolted a warp drive to it there donethats their charm  it is also very much in line with matari lore exslaves who freed themselves and who built their own boats to a people like that what it looks like is not even a consideration that it works though that very much is the pointif you want to talk ugly the old client made gallente ships look shiny which i found pleasing now the ships are matted which gives them an unfinished look but that could be defended because the ships are put through the rigours of spaceugly have you seen a brutix lately even in their siny state they looked like someone squirted toothpaste into a blob and thought now if we could make that into a space ship that would be neat i havent seen one with the matte finish but i guess now theyll really look like a cringe fest and you know what i dont care it adds characteri want to see what an imicus looks like now matari ships look like a slag heap with a warp drive and a porta potty smile and be happyabulurd bonifaceme meceocaldari ships though way too angular for me but hey thats eve why worry about something like that
i love minnies looks dont touch em or ill hunt youi also quite like the new dommie tbh
they are the prettiest ships in my view i even like the blackbirdmoa
get a grip the way they designed the older shipsstory line based that isoldminmatar  old rustbuckets if it does the job its good enoughnewminmatar  actual ships look at the hurricane and maelstrom they are products of the new minmatar republic thingieamarr  hulls to showoff their divine right it doesnt only have to work it needs to impress ppl and put fear in the heart of enemys so shiney gold and smooth looksgallente  a peacefull organic look but a battle interiorcaldari  whatever makes everything fit in the hull it doesnt really matter what it looks like if some ships look anything remotely like a bird then its fine raven blackbird and osprey for some examplesso some ships look like teh sex others look like  i for one never flew minmatar because how horrible they look but i love all the differences between the races
minmatar  an guy falling down the stairs in a wheelchair thats duct taped and held together with bailing wire and spit while shooting an uzieand the funny thing is they do it gracefullyme leans on his malestrom fitted with 8 1400mm cannons and thumbs the massive kill numbersproud to be the ugliest bastard in the gameand a deadly one at that
i lold and lold
normally id defend the maelstroms looks but i fly a hyperion now pstupid topic is stupid
to each his own efrim to each his own 8 o and yes the malestrom is a beaut of a shipi love the thundering 1400mms
everyone knows that matari ships are held together by some futuristic combination of paper clips glue duct tape chewing gum and rubber bands
im not for this idea entirly perhaps cloaks have more of a proximity mechanic if they are spying on ships for to long slowly their cloak degrades say they can hang around a fleet for 5mins before the enemy ships start to detect you also the closer you are the faster your cloak degrades this would mean that you could still sit in system and go afk for hours but if your activly spyin on ppl at gates your operational time is reduced and you have to warp for periods of time to allow your cloak to strengthen just an idea but im happy with cloak as it is just throwing it out there 
no support currently cloaking penalties and such are fine as it is unless ccp sees a reason to change how cloaking works i dont see why we need a counter also why does everyone get stressed out by the afk cloaker just dont ratmine on your own and youll be fine isaac
or you can ignore them that works tooterrorism is powerful when you give it attention

you dont sit in a cockpit in eve youre in your capsule connected to a series of tubes which probably get clogged sometimes
i thought i was playing a game for grownups
i honestly dont know many under 15 year olds actually for that matter under 18 years old that enjoy this game enough to be offended by contentcensorship of eve is stupid at best ccp is not going to attract teenagers to this game even with walking in stations the game is an adult game too slow moving and too complex to attract simpletons keep to your fan base ccp keep to the older generationwhoever the marketing guy is saying we need to target the younger audience fire them for stupidity and move keep it 15 at least
considering this is in the game and got overhauled with apocrypha too this whole issue is just an over inflated blowfish
i had rather seen the changes as followingt1 base chance to succesfully salvage 5t2 base chance to succesfully salvage 7salvaging skill 100 chanceskill lvltech 1 with skill1  52  103  154  205  25no change with what we hadtech 2 with skill1  72  143  214  285  35and since skill 5 is atm mandatory for the t2 salvager it would have a 10 increase over the t1 versioni would bring the required skill down to 4 like with miner i  miner ii and leave skill 5 for the die hard salvagers and possible for a specialized salvaging ship
thunbs up herepretty crazy pre req for such a small bonus
one or the other might be reasonable but both is just making it too easy salvaging was fine before and itll be fine after the change too even if you never get the t2 module this is far too trivial an issue to be worth implementing  yes you might have done it differently but youre not a dev theres nothing so obviously wrong with this system that it needs fixing
personally i feel getting a tech 2 salvager is a colossal waste of iska scant 2 increase is just not worth it
i hear this all the time almost every tech 2 shipitem miner iis being one of the very few exceptions requires a skill to be level v tech 2 means you have mastered the equipment not just good at it also 7 from 5 is a 40 increase in chance to salvage using a tech 2 salvager not including the salvage skill  level v you just want free efficiency for doing not work and not putting in any training time either do the work to get the skills or dont
yo i just be seein dis  an id like to be voicin my suppot aight one love

id like to see ecm changed so that when someone is jammed they only lose the ability to lock someone that hasnt aggressed himher in the last 60 seconds anyone that is shooting you or recently shot at you would still be vulnerable this of course would also include the falcon which would make them a lot more vulnerable to tacklers since they wouldnt be able to just jam them and get away a well coordinated gang with multiple falcons would be able support each other against tacklers however its important to note that only players that have recently attacked the jammed player are still lockable by the jammed if you are jammed and the enemy gang is shooting your gangmates but not you you would be unable to attack anyone that has not attacked you in the last minute then ecm would be useless for ganking the solo player since he can still shoot back but would still be of use in gangs if your guys know how to focus fire ecm would be a way for the outnumbered to fight back not a way for the blob to gank with impunity
um no this would make rooks completely unusable as combat ships and falcons would be destroyed by the snipers completely removing the viability of ecm in its entirety
you are a tremendous got and i pray nightly for your death
sweet ive got a fan
encounter a falcon that kicked your ass recently i take itgrow up learn to play the gameyour idea is stupid and poorly thought outwhat your saying is ecm should never completely jam anyone the whole point of ecm is to jam your ship ecm is based on a random roll of the dice sometimes ships like the falcon will have more dice which means more chances to jam you successfullyyour saying you should still be able to target someone dont work that way kidso time for you to get out of your pampers and grow up
it does sound like a good idea but i am afraid it would be to overpowered when it comes to largescale fleet battles
why is that you can already warp to fleet members
but hostiles cant d
as it stands heavy drones in wormhole space are completely useless sure it is due to the higher iq of the ai however this limits gallente pilots severelyim not sure what the fix for it would be maby a drone hp bonus or something of the likei just would like to see drone boats like the ishtar and dominix to be viable in wormhole space wo useing up your whole dronebay in a single site
im sorry but this seems utterly hilarious to me
as gallente pilot i recognize your issues but i am finally happy to see npcs with improved ai drones are ment to be vulnerable to your opponent other player or npc
drones work fine against sleepers you just have to watch them you cant use them like youre fighting normal dumb rats im in unexplored space in a pilgrim and my drones are doing well
drones tend to be overlooked as serious threatssleepers obviously are not as stupid as most rats are  o 
yah sure your tiny mediums are doing fine they can return in time you ever try heavys at 30 km away there is no hope of recovering them b4 they are blasted to death and because the domi and ishtars primary dps is drones the sleepers are smart enough to take them outmy only point is that theese ships are not viable for sleeper space and causes a balanceing issue over the diffrent reces in evei do not wish to see the rats as stupid as the old npcs in fact i find the whole idea refreshing and fun i jsut wish there was a way to make gallente as viable in sleeper space as other races
in my experience sleepers are just as stupid as any other rat they just work on pos gun airotating targets instead of rat aifixed targets drones get aggro a fair bit but its not exactly crippling  i flew a domi around at least a dozen anomalies and didnt lose a single drone reel them when they take aggro and only use drones you can reel easily  sentries lights mediums if they get in close the problem is on your end the ai is as pathetic as it ever was
i agree i trained t2 heavy drones so i can launch mediums and sentrys out whatever i give up im training for a raven like every other carebear noob out thereon a serious note they do not work on pos gun rotateing targets at least not in my experiance reason they can shoot 2 targets at once and seem to aggro whatever is doing the most damage a pos does not do that and i will try sentrys dont have that to t2 yet but it is still worth a shot ty
if you want to fight dumb ai then stick to missions
and i bet you trained them to use in your ishkur too right after all its a drone boat man just think of how ed off the guy who trained carriers to do his cn missions more effectively must feel not every skill is used all the time there are some skills even a typhoon cant make good use of the problem isnt that t2 heavies arent goodthough they still can be  pvp defences any time you let a bs get in close enough reeling is still possible etc its that you expect them to always be a win button that was never the purpose of t2 heavies or any other skill for that matter use what fits the task not what you invested the most sp in and if thats not something you feel qualified to do then dont do it your domi still kicks ass in l4s keep it there if youre not willing to adjust it for viability in wormholes
the magnetometic sites are too weak of a signal strength for the new probe system to pick up in anything other then a covertopsi have level 4 of all the probe skills i also have the probe implants i also have sister launcher and two gravity capacity rigs this picks up every other site apart from magnetometic with that setup you can only get to about 95 you can never get to 100 this is with the probes so close together and set to 025au and even 7 of them deployed this is not some sort of learning curve issue the highest i can get no matter what i do is 9405all that needs to happen is magnetometic sites need a signal strength boost 10 should be goodim going to buy some sister probes and see how that turns out since they are 10 more base sensor strength it may be enoughi dont think its right that you have to use a covertops for scanning down sites now im not talking about wormholes or any other site just the normal exploration sitesout of all the improvements made to probing this is the only thing that needs to be looked at in my opinion just buff the mag sites signal strength a little
supporting my own and having to wait a minute in order to support it
how are you arranging your probes it could be a problem with your configuration see this thread for more info
like i had said this is not a learning issue or something that i dont know how to do i understand the system the math behind it just fine the issue is the signal strength is simply too weak to be picked up in anything other then a covertops shipas evidence here is a screen shot of the probesto give you an idea on how close these are this is the system map zoomed in as far as it can go and the probes are set to 025au as you can seeand before anyone comments on it no the probes are not too close this is as close as i can get them before it disappears and if i move them away from this proximity the signal strength gets weakerif you dont believe me try hunting down a mag site in anything other then a covertops trust me this screen shot shows 40minutes left on the probes however its probe 15 which means i have deployed two sets why because i had to i had to recall the probes the first time because it had only 5 minutes left on themafter well over 90 minutes this is as good as the signal can get the only change that needs to happen is to bring mag sites up to the same level of signal strength as radar grav and unknown sites havent found a ladar site so im not sure what they are likeedit link correction
consider this issue closed it is doable you just need sister probes to do it
i totaly agree that interface on alliance level must exist aswell as the other tools for alliance interaction this is on my todo list to prepare complete document about it to compile all usefull ideas from this forums and then to raise issues i think that we had 5 or 6 threads including aluthins one about alliance tools in last few months and none is complete hopefully i will have it finished soontm dtill then feel free to post your ideas
sadly they already do this they just do it in the wrong placelook at the orders and corp orders tabs on the market window
yeah i know about that and it helps sometimes thing is it really ought to be done correctly everywhere theres only two people who do corp orders in my corp so its not too bad but can you imagine sifting through the thousands of them you might have for a decentsized industrial corp just to figure out which of your own orders are corporate

how about just removing the extra character slots nothing worse than alt scouts with no risk 
im in favour of making those 2 extra slots trainable if it needs to be paid for so be it but it should be less than an extra account or 2 because an extra account has more benefits then just the skill trainingi would love to use my extra slots but never did because i dont want to slow my first character down lets face it training skills takes long enough so if nothing changes i will probably just play one character until i cant think of skills to train or i get tired of himand i wont take a second account until ive filled all 3 slots and want a 4th ccp
they pay me with viagra
we are being paidwhy didnt anybody tell me
ill take your free holiday to iceland if you dont want it
people are getting free holidays why didnt i get one
if you ask me i think that rl politicians are cool
says the guy with joe by in his sigedit oh for the love of god stupid robot censor ill be in my cockpit
it is true we are paid vast amounts of money sadly the pay is currently in the form of icelands isks so given the baggage restrictions and the total lack of value of the currency we all left the multiple duffel bags of icelandic money in our hotel rooms when we checked outseriously i think you need to spend some time understanding what the csm can do for eve we cant be every players opportunity to drive random odd feature requests into eve we can however provide oversight which i think we did a great job doing with the pos exploit and we can affect medium to long term plans that ccp might have for game directionyou might not believe it but i can assure you i think we were very effective in our discussions with ccp in iceland in shaping how eve will evolve going forward does that mean for example the csm got ccp to stop everything that they were working on to1 immediately fix black ops2 change sov mechanics3 change how poss work4 insert your favorite idea hereno it doesnt we did however discuss most everything that was raised to the csm either officially or in informal settings i think we were heard and i believe that in the future those meetings will make eve better than it would have been if there wasnt a csmive talked about this before and it has been mentioned more times than i can count that changes are more involved than you might think and often the best order to introduce changes is not obvious to someone not directly involved in developing the game just because something isnt in the next patch is no indication that it isnt in the queue somewhereso more to the point about the csm as a player in eve you can choose to believe that the csm has a purpose and can make your life in eve better over time if you think that find a candidate that seems to view life in the verse the same way you do and vote for them or run yourselfif you dont believe the csm has a purpose id propose you ask yourself why not giving the concept a chance is the right choice i would still suggest to you that you find a candidate or run yourself and try and make it matter what do you have to loseand ill end with this my trip to iceland was anything but a vacation the travel for many of us spanned days we went in the winter when there is only something like 4 hours of sunlight we spent almost all the time there in meetings about eve when we did socialize it was more towards fast food than fine dining in some cases the members actually got sick and were not enjoying themselves at all jet lag was a big issue for many of us it was work not playif you want to see iceland and i think it is a great place to add to anyones vacation destination list go sometime other than winter if you want to make the trip include a lot of fun eve content then the fanfest should be part of your plans if you want to go to iceland for fun the csm is not the best way to do it so if you run for the csm please do it because you want to make eve better not for what you think is a free vacationissler
somewhere in this wall of text there was a challenge by somebody to the effect of what didnt issler eat or what did issler eat that you disagree with i will happily respond to that comment think this thread needs a moment of levity nowhere do i see where issler ate cheesecake one of the prime foodgroups needed to support life in eve i have petitioned ccp to allow the cheesecake factory to open up franchises throughout the eve universe i particularly like chocolate coconut cream cheesecake coconut cheesecake with chunks of chocolate topped with layers of coconut custard and whipped cream all on top of a chocolate macaroon crust you can find this here
should i choose to run again and somehow get reelected i promise to eat cheesecake regularly and champion the spread of cheesecake and other desert type foods including other cakes including cup cakes pudding flans custards cookies brownies frozen deserts truffles fruit and pie throughout eve i will also encourage the research into the creation of t2 deserts for advanced desert enjoyment issler
yes
hell just tweak the problem characters that were listed in the op to make them more distinct and ill be happy well in addition to an option to change the font scaling in all windows not just context menus and the text inside the chat window
yes
supportedplease make all ui fonts scalable like in chat windows
i skilled guessing v which helped a bit but id rather actually read it
dont know why this hasnt been implemented already
supporting a goon idea
bring back the old effect or some cool new sort of tunnel effect the little bubble doesnt cut it
new effect is boring
agreeing with my space enemies
its good to see a lot of positive support for this esp from a csm member and from aaa and goonsd but isaac is right to bring this upi wasnt quite sure on what the effects of the old cyno jumping had onto the game and in fleet battles ive been hot dropped a few times but not seen a fleet of 50 dreads and the like drop out and that into something the point that lag graphicly and all that is very valid so actual ideas well considering we can change the overview and remove brackets and reduce effects to remove the graphic lags why wouldnt this work too obviously you would need a base effect please correct me on this im no compwiz so what would it be well why not the current one as normal and an optimized version of the old one as a shock and awe effect first the bubble that we currently have encases the ship then simultaneously that lovely lightning directional warp portal opens up and whoosh your gone on the other side it the bubble is returned and it opens up with an explosion of lightning all aroundor again just an optimized version of the above and if you dont want that effect just turn it offim being descriptive but remember we dont want to over do it as isaac has said there is the problems of lag and graphical lag that have to be addressed with something like the above you provided you know what youre doing can choose to turn the graphics down to jump into cap fights or if youre going to be hotdropped or if you wanna show off to some friends or random newbs or even just wanting to see it yourself you can turn it on and chaaarrrgge hehe i hope that suffices as ideas of course im just putting this forward as a general idea im certain others may have some
signednew effect is sorta disappointing bigger effect brighter colours is the way to go i think
im sure the good folks at ccp will be able to develop a similarly scalable and blingey effect without our input its our job to tell the csm to tell ccp to raise the priority of that blingey effect
signedmade a post about this in the game development forum about 1 week before apoc came out no one gave a  found it
incredibly excellent idea
while i agree that minmatar bss need work i just dont like these ideas tbh projectiles needs some work too but lets not worry about that if we were to just change the ships themselves i see a breakdown something like thisbtw im not a mathematician so im sure the values ive listed need some work especially when it comes to mass the basic idea is this typhoon  slow heavy tank or heavy damagetempest  very fast and agile sound damage with turrets alone passive shield tankermaelstrom  dedicated fleet ship very high alpha competitive rangeso whatever the values need to be to make that realistic and fairtyphoonthe first in the minmatar line of battleships was born from desperate times advanced subsystems and reliable sources for component parts were not then consistently available to the republic the typhoon therefore was built on a simple modular but sturdy structural design and employed the whatever we can bolt to the hull weapons philosophy though the phoon does not have fancy defensive systems or sophisticated weapons optimizations it makes up for that lack of refinement with thick armor and an abundance of weapon hardpointschanges55 turretslaunchersshields 5469armor 6641structure 6211mass 105200000velocity 105tempestwith increasing access to more sophisticated subsystem and the emergence of the move fast and hit hard minmatar philosophy the tempest was designed to be a nimble turret based skirmisher capable outmaneuvering other battleships in order to achieve unparalleled mobility in a battleship class vessel structure and armor we traded for more advanced shielded systems reverse engineered from destroyed caldari vessels moreover because the ship needed to move in and out of engagements quickly weapon subsystems were focused on a fast firing turret based delivery systemchanges5 damage to large projectile turrets75 rof to large projectile turrets60 turretslaunchers865 slot layoutcpu 560pg 1450shields 7500shield recharge 2000armor 5469structure 5469mass 96000000velocity 135maelstromnow established the minmatar republic has found itself engaging in more traditional fleet vs fleet conflicts military leaders recognized the need to have bs capable of engaging at fleet ranges but still wanted a ship that fit the matari philosophy that a good offence is the best defensehit them hard first and you wont have to tank themchanges5 damage bonus75 optimalmass 100100000signature radius 440locking range 83pg 2700
this is falsedata centersif you screw your standings with any empire faction and all its friends has been done you can turn in rare pirate tags to a faction data center imho this is a balanced method to achieve forgiveness for past transgressions it has however been made more expensive since the introduction of factional warfareto the op i would support the introduction of data centers for pirate factions afaik they do not exist and they should for example turning in rare gallente tags to the newly created serpentis data centers could gain one the same factional gain with them as turning in rare serpentis tags to a gallente data centerthis would solve the problem with a scalpel instead of taking a sledge hammer to the current standings mechanicsmy 02 isk
dbl post
tier 2 carriers would lay somewhere between a current carrier and a mom with carrier 2 being the required skill hence tier 2especially they would be specialised ie one would have more damage less tank and less range another would have more range less of the rest as so you had a little variety in the cap ship line up
so what would you propose for fixing a currently broken class instead of putting hundreds of manhours in to put a new class in because you dont think its fit for it
your fix is to just improve its current role which is what people dont like the problem with moms is that their role is pointless for their cost when carriers are far cheaper for similar effect not to mention that its not easy to swap bt a mom and another ship moms need advanced roles that make them the mobile platforms they were designed to be they and titans are ment to be mobile bases and at the forefront of front line action right now theyre the big bully that cant take a hit or do more than swing wildly
and i am telling you your idea would make them virtually unkillable in low sec or against any but well coordinated groups in 00 thanks to the other buffs you want them to havebetter coordinated than your alliance
pretty much this
wait yaay i know youre an idiot but do you really not see the point in having motherships move in triage
yes i get it you want it to be a moving ed ship with more repping and virtually no other abilities rather than a stationary one it still does not make this ship independent of carriers in any real way to make the ship viable it has to be useful to fleets of people as its designed as such even with movable triage it doesnt make it distinguished from a carrier its just a glorified repping ship carriers do it cheaper and with insurance and with the option to swap ships easily motherships need a more useful role to fleets and making them a mobile station with fleet jumping abilities like the below link with harder tanks makes them more useful to people right now theyre just giant targets for dreads and fleets to pop shot and grief people for their only real bonus is related to sovereignty not even the shipits the same ed argument as giving titans siege sure it gives them defense but at the cost making it just a glorified dread for 45x the cost
so why not give the mobile station role to the ship ccp has repeatedly called a mobile station the titan motherships are carriers much in the same way titans are not dreads so your attempt at relating the two is wrong when i go into the market and click on carriers guess what motherships are there too for motherships at tier 2 carriers trying to make them something radically different simply because titans are unlike dreadstitan doesnt even require the dread skill is misguided also do you really think giving supercaps a 75 bonus resists is balanced in any way at all
yeah uh xttz did this all the time and its even easier now so shut up youre the dumbest mothership pilot in goonswarm perhaps in all of eve
not when bs fleets and dread fleets are what they have become today these 300400 man bs fleets and 100 dreads fleets would melt you before you went back instop trying to troll bu 
just let them dock 
ya this would be nice but how ed would undock games in a ms be i mean come on  i guess not much more than in a carrier except i am probably easier to bumpalternatively i can dock and slam any carrier playing undock games waaaay out of dock range just by undocking but seriously the fact we are the same size as a phoenix but are unable to dock because we are too big is a bit weird
what would be more interesting would be to change warfare modules to provide area effects around ships and possibly remove warefare booster effects out of fleet structurethen you make the command ships motherships and titians give varying multiplier bonuses to the module effectiveness and rangeif you make mother ship bonuses and range sufficient enough to boost combat effectiveness of a regular fleet you then may make it very attractive to start getting them into the field and more useful than a carrierthis of course may break roquals but you you could give them effect raduis of 16au to remedy this
bump i refuse to let this be forgotten

i cant believe i never signed off on this not that it will ever matter see im using reverse psychologynow ccp will have to take actionmuhuuuhahahahha
supported ill be able to fly a nag in a few months and i wouldnt mind if its still the worst dreadnoughti just want it to only be the worst by a tiny bit so ccpchange it please
rightbecause those closeranged dreads hotdropping on the sniperranged dreads and obliterating them thats totally not tacticalive read about more than one fight where dreads were not fitted for range they seem to win then hmmisaac
i hope this isnt intended fix please
supportin dis
this is a game breaking issue and needs to be fixed asap
fix this and many other things you broke tia
seriously its like we coated our dreads with really bouncy rubber or something
absolutely
yo sup
supporting this needs to be addressed
do this
this needs to be hotfixed asap capital fleets are hilariously broken right now
i ended up 189kms off station today in an anshar becuase i undocked along with a revelationafter i got over the laughter at traveling at 10kms in a freighter i was lucky enough to be able to cyno out instead of have to warp somewhereplease to be fixing
this is ed and a huge slip on ccps part
needs fixing
this is ridiculous
giving mah thumbs up

ouch
need fixing
real big ouch if its this bad something needs to be done fast also desynch
useful
i support this
issue raised
poop i support the ideadiscussion w poop rofl
i do kinda like the 4k speed lol but yep u have my support on this
fix please this is just crazy
yup fix this
as hilarious as it is it needs fixing
change
this bug is critical to gameplay and needs to be fixed immediately
reminds me of bumpageddon
yup
needs to be done
agreed
thumbs up
im down with da op
fix this
hotfix this seriously all capital ships are amazingly broken this should be a priority like fixing the pos exploit was a priority
ya i was in a thanatos hyperion came beside me and im thinking just from the looks and size hyperion has to be larger then my thanatos in volumemega side by side with thanatosthey are basically the same size but megathron can easily fit inside the thanatoscarriers do need to be made bigger the dreads i think are sufficiently large
a phoenix is bigger than my wyvern but i cant dock what gives
bump with basically everyone supporting so far or at least most are remembering to check the support button
i really dont want to see decloaking happen other than by current mechanics
we all know attributes arent integers but are modified by the learning skills by 2 per level 10 at l5 learningits confusing for some users especially now with attribute remapping to not be able to see the real attribute valuesthere is no good reason a 2052 19108 or 2090 1911 to both display simply as 20please add decimal point display to the attributes in the character sheet
or better give us the option to turn them on and off  so we can see whichever value we wantsupported
either way is fine i suppose as long as you at least get the option to see them hate it when i have to reexplain the hundredth time to some newbie how to calculate them or why he doesnt train as fast as he hoped for and so on
yes truncation is a bad way of displaying the information i even see veterans who are caught out by it now that respecing is possible
i could agree with a slight increase in retrieval chance but no to lowering the requirement to 4
the huge number of people buying t2 salvagers already seem to think salvage 5 was pretty good not supported as already stated pretty much all t2 goods require at least 1 lv5 skill no effort  no reward
good pointbut at skill 5 you be at 30 on a t1 and 32 on a t2 and that is not so impressive anymore hardly the 40 you made it out to becompare again to miners miner i base yield 40m3 miner ii base yield 60m3 i have never heard anyone complain that this 50 increase in yield was overpowered
supporting because ccp need to stop slapping level 5 skills as prereqs on everything just for the hell of it espeicially on a new player profession like salvagingtbh i dont care that much about this particular case but in general enough with the level 5 prereqs already its not big and its not clever
ugh is that how they work the bonuses well then yeah i am wrong about that 2 is barely anything the 1km range is ok but not that great problem is that the bonus needs to be multiplicative kinda of like almost all the other skills in evethey could do something like keep 57 and make the salvaging skill give 100 salvaging chance per level so salvager i  level 5  30 and salvager ii  level 5  42 id support that but you have to keep salvaging v for the salvager iiedit which is lolol what the op wrote as well changing to support
somewhere in ships and modules it is said by someone that uses the t2s that the bonuses are calculated like this then it may be the usual poor wording by ccp on the skillanyone can confirm the values on t1 vs t2 from actually fitting them 
here is a list of the things that need level 4 or less for t2  every rig in the game  eccm  ecm modules and the signal distortion amp  projected ecm  sensor dampeners  sensor backup arrays  webs  target painters  tracking disruptors  warp scramsdisruptors these only need level 2and thats just from electronics there are plenty more in the other sectionsfrom my experience there are a lot more modules requiring only level 4 sometimes less than there are that require level 5 i cant be bothered counting up the exact numbers right now so i cant say for certain which of us is right
give us the option to set a fee to send a corpmail same goes for alliancesaid fees go directly to the corpalliance who set them
facepalm
only if dedconcord gets charged
its not a completely awful idea if its an option but i still see no good reason to implement it
yeah this would be ok and also maybe being able ot block anyone from using it without a certain rolei wouldnt particularly like it but it would be a good mechanic to have since options are generally good
short id like to be able to scan enemy pilots to see what implants they have inlongthis is a pretty rough version of how to evaluate ransom situations there is still lots missing from this
or you could just have them pod you
im not sure what drugs youre on but you may want to have the doctor check your dosagesno as in never
i dont know too many pirates who even use ship scanners when ransoming i doubt many would use pod scanners either its not worth a slot
ummi really fail to see the point of this scanner its a lot faster to just lock and shoot rather than lock scan and then shoot either way the pod loses its cash isaac
another class of carrier is needed we need a carrier that is just that a carrier we need a ship that has no done bay what so ever but it has a massive ship main bay this ship needs to be able to carry ships fitted with pilots in them ready to strike after a jump just like a real carrier no real offensive ability but its defensive capabilities are something that would make even a 4 dreads in siege mode a pain to take out
i really fail to see the point of this ship the carrier already does this so why do we need to have one like thisno supportisaac
more to the point the ms and titan do it better
no new carriers are needed thxbye
the carriers we have now are just drone boats this would be a carrier that can only hold and transport ship with pilots in the ships with the current carriers pilots must be in space and then remove the ship from the carrier this would make it so that a task force can be droped into the battle with out the use of a titan
ive yet to die to a falcon though i have missed quite a few kills do to them no normally im the one using the falcon alt and killing people and its just too powerful the falcon should be a good tool against an enemy gang not a lone enemy pilot unless you are only trying to defend yourself not kill himand ecm would still prevent someone who is not under fire from attacking in gangs the primary target will be able to shoot but if everyone else is jammed they would be unable to fire until fired upon against gangs it would still be an indispensable tool due to it being able to remove multiple people from the fight it just wouldnt be a trump card for ganking solo players without any risk
no support worst idea for changing falcons and i dont even fly em this would completely nerf them isaac
so in other words anyone the falcon jams can shoot at least the falconhell what a horrible idea lolseriously falcons are annoying but pvp is blob or be blobbed and falcons fail at blobsworst case scenario the devs simply need to beef up eccm with something useful sensor boosters are the counter to gallente recons they arent completely passive relying on the fact that gallente recons are going to be there thats the problem with eccm they only work if theres ecm trying to jam you its a waste of a slot otherwise even then with eccmi personally had a privateer dominix permajammed in my blackbird while he had 2 eccm overloaded at least up until i moved my ecm onto his neutral guardian haha silly empire wardecs both the domi and guardian died success
didnt you propose an idea against like the op
yes the idea is against falcons but essentially do nothing to the balance of falcon plus ccp already has stated they want to make eccm more useful so its not my idea
i support the concept but not the proposed implementation i dont think local should be used for such things
i dont know where to file this request forgive me if this isnt it could we get a separate forum section for wspace exploration even if its temporary it sure would be nice to have everything under a single topic
this is where ccp intends for you to put itmissions  complexesfrom missions to cosmos sites exploration and complexes this forum has all you need to get a head start in pvebut if you think that wormhole space deserves its own special unique snowflake place you might want to make the suggestion here since getting csm to do it will take months
ive heard that remote repairing your sentries is a good tanking solution
i dont see the issue i have all my skills at lvl 3 with cov ops 4 and i found 2 mag sites in 20 minutes in wspace and no i dont use a sisters launcher just a standard core probe launcher

it is pretty weak
i agree  we need old effects for cynos backor if they want to upgrade it  use the old effect as starting point
signedi went on sisi to do my first cyno jump ever and after that i was like this is iton tq i saw the old cyno and it looked much better then what it is right now
its really crap
want a new effect that is epic like the old one
signed
completely supported its a video game and we all like our eye candy and giant ships tearing holes in space and time and spacetime should make everyone aware of their presenceif you cant modernise the old jump drive effects make the new ones just way more violent im planning to get into capitals myself soon and right now id get the same thrill out of jumping as skimming pebblesjust that the pebbles dont skip they just sink 
what was wrong with the old effect it was pretty cool
yes  defenitly hopefully rework the old one into the new graphics
give back the old effect or create a new one caps are supposed to bang in and out not shimmer this gate animation is nice on jumpgates but its unfit for capital ships
welcome to the wonderful world of developer arrogance if its any consolation were not the first mmoers to suffer this puts on bards hatonce upon time there was a game called star wars galaxies
the new cynoeffect while being nice simply does not capture the awe and majesty which the old cyno effect evoked in people new and oldplease bring back or rework the old effect
the new effect needs to be drastically reworked or droppedthe old effect is what people want thanks

this issue hasnt been corrected unless your privy to information us lesser mortals arent
if you run mission for them you should get a security standing decrease basicly if you run to much of them you will reach the 100
one period to rule them all and in the darkness bind them
i see what you did there
ya i thought about this but giving each specific ms a bonus to mindlinks much like command ships a viable option to boost your entire cap fleets fighting power without half a dozen commandships piggybackingi am trying to stay away from changes that would cause ccp to have to totally rewrite how something is donelike gang bonuses as i see that very unlikely to actually happen
i am going to give this a thumps up so that something can be done to make motherships more viable havent agreed with a goon in a looonngg timei like most all the suggested changes of the op though like others in the thread i think motherships tier 2 carriers need a change in role from highvalue repper to something more useful for their cost to build and put on the lineivory
if you have any further ideas or alterations to whats already posted please post it here for further discussion aiming to move away from things like hp buffs resist bonuses and things that require reworking of how the game runs
bumping dis
hittin this too beautiful ships that are ty they need some serious love
this is part of the reason i can use t2 large projectiles but not minmatar bs  theres absolutely no reason to train minmatar above bcthis is a step in the right direction
signedi have a minmatar alt and love flying the race but the caps need a lot of work
this i think the training time being high might be something to look at and reevaluate just because i tend to think of cheap ships as beginner ships for their category but he is emphatically correct that all ships dont have to match each other on the battlefield or in the eft its nice to have cheaper ships
agreed in full with op

supporting the dd change anythingh is better than the current dd version
now playing elbow  the fix
it feels a bit like billiards in space the immersionbreaker of ships bumping into each other at all is one thing but a mothership clipping another cap for a second on jumpin and being fired off at 15kms 150 times its normal cruise velocity is another entirely and the randomness of it just causes frustration not fairbutrisky gameplay
representing with a thumbs upivory
add to the list of things to discuss next week with ccp
most certainly needs fixing as it will make supercaps almost impossible to kill titan tackled no problem warp in a dread or a carrier and watch the titan out accelerate anything else in the game off grid
need fix
please dear god fix this
yup obviously the desynch this causes too is ridiculous
try jumping a rorqual and jump freighter at same time woo hoo bump city
yah at this point the capital bumping is beyond stupid you cant even cyno in to a system or do a capital warp in without bumping capitals 50km away from each other if ccp actually intended this than its obvious they have no one on the dev team that actually flies capital ships in real combat
supporting
hooray for unintended consequences
so that is what happened to me on the jita undock my fenrir got rammed back underneath it when another freighter undocked right in front of me
while im happy to build capitals for people that lose them this seems like a to easy way to take out capitals
this seems like an easy 001 patch inclusion
i dont even fly capitals but this is just dumb and broken
fix this holy crap fix this
dont stop here remove shipship collisions from the game entirely and solve more lag issues than you can imagine
this needs to be fixed asap
do fix please
i love pinball as much as the other guy but this stuff is just ridiculousfix it
lol the bumps now a days are beyond hilarious until it means the death of your cap due to crappy game mechanicsya fix it
i suspect that capships bumping to 400km from where they warpedcynod isnt an intended feature of the new patchplease fix this ccp before i dare to undock my carrier
im gonna bump thisjust had a aaa freighter vanish while in hullfor every 2 people that actually has a propper disconnect you have entire fleets logging off to avoid combat this is a bad mechanic fix it
agreed limitations on size shouldnt be an issue anymorei think a lot of the scale could do with a look over but absolutely when it comes to carriersstations their just to smallwhere the dreadstitans dont couldnt fit ships inside so thay look right as they are i always amused at the fact u can fit a mega in a thanatos yet side to side its just not going to happen same goes for all the carriersmoms though
i very much agree with this proposal make capitals capital sized
im sure i already posted this in the assembley hall but either way im going to support this though i honestly think all ships need a rescaling
bumpand what way should we go buff the missile it self or add a bonus too the ships that use it
dreads arent supposed to be bigger better bs they are anti cap and tower ships they dont need scaling for sub bs youre supposed to deploy them with support
i agree that the explosion velocity is crippling the problem is that all the other capital weapons systems have a longrange lower dps and short range higher dps version but not for missiles a citadel cruise missile launcher is needed and damage done needs to be based more on signature radius and less on speed this will mean that as long as youre not using an mwd on your bs you should not get wtf ganked plus the phoenix would be useful at shooting other capital ships
it should be noted that objects one can siege are supposed to be immobile if your target is mobile you shouldnt be in siege mode i thought that was obvious
nice idea
nice ideasupported
yup that whole repairing thing needs some love its the most unintuiative of the station interface components at the moment
sporting tha cause
i would like the option to inject a skill into my character without needing to meet the its prerequisite skillsnaturally if you inject a skill before meeting its prerequisites then you will not be able to train it until you have trained the prerequisites you will also not be able to place it into your skill queue until all the prerequisites are either trained or queued up before ityour thoughts 
this would be nice but something tells me this is one of the reasons the devs didnt want to put the queue in the first place hope i am wrong
sounds good not very important though
im not going to badger the op or insult his intelligence but in eve there is a stigma that pirates are around every corner crouched and ready to pounce should one cross that high seclow sec linewhile this may be in some systems for the most part its just not true there are even some systems that dont see a single player for daysthe ironic thing is the low sec systems that border high sec usually see the most pirate activity the deeper you go the less activity youll encounterbut i do agree that the risk vs reward ratio needs to be improved
disincentives to people staying in high sec will not make them move to low or null sec it will make them unsubscribe this is not in ccps interests the problem with low sec is that the name is misleading low sec combines the disadvantages of high and null sec without providing any real advantage in return high sec policing is provided by concord in null sec its provided by players but you cant lock down a system with bubbles on the gates in low sec and you cant practice nbsi there without eventually losing your access to high sec
incentives wont do anythingive been in 00 low sec and enjoyed myselfbut having become a first time dad in real life i now spend my time in high sec as i just like to chat to friends make new friends mine or run missions in what little time i have spare to playeve is best in the diversity it offers in the way it gives you a very good choice of areas to make isk very like real life you make your choices and either live life in the fast lane adrenaline pumping as you keep an eye on your overview for pirates trying to jump you in 00 or low secor you play safe and run missions or mine in high sec in an npc corp so u cant be war decdat the end of the day incentives just unbalance the game as its about choice and making your own opportunities or working with others to do itjump in a frigate with a jumpclone and no implants make sure your clone upgrade is upto date fit a cloak and go explore theres plenty of systems out there in low sec that are quiet and off the beaten track u just have to find them same in 00 not all of 00 is taken and if u look hard enough ull find somewhereanyway not supported

one other thing fix poss so they can be setup for better usage at alliance level ie allow the option to set a corp hanger array for alliance member usage as currently it dont work and its annoying
sort of agree yes for prototype cloaking devicedifficult to detect improved cloaking deviceimpossible to detect covert ops cloaking devicei would like to see a cloak jammer similar to how a cyno jammer works but only if the cloak jammer shows up like a beacon on the overview for everyone to see
allow to set some default container to fitting screen so it would try to fetch modules from there
yesterday i saw my first postpatch heavy interdictor bubble i really had to look for it and it was almost impossible to tell where the edges of the bubble were i could see a faint swirly patterns coming from the ship itself and getting fainter as it moved out more visibility is needed pilots should know when they are inside a bubble
yes i can not see the bubbles eitheralso anchored bubbles nolonger appear on the overview which is another bad change
out of curiosity  how many of those who are screaming omgz cens0rshipelventyone actually looked at the linked picturedont just go i know the quafe girl so i dont have to look at the picturelook at it then tell me why you think this is suitable for eve or any game not specifically designed with adult contentsuggestive poses and text which leaves a lot to the imagination is fine  but this doesnt leave much to the imagination
actually the 1418 age bracket at least in the us is one of the most lucrative for any kind of gamin because they have the largest percentage of disposable income  that is all of it they dont pay bills they dont have mortgages and they dont hopefully have kids to feed and clothe so theyre free to spend their money on whatever strikes their fancy be it eve wow or itunes downloads my 14 year old routinely spends his allowancebirthdayholiday money on cellphone cards and itunes downloads cardsfrom a purely business perspective it makes perfect sense for ccp to try and get a slice of that the price of that of course is that you have to make the games palatable to mommy and daddy and to an extent the retailers yes i am one of those horribly unreasonable parents that wont let her kids play grand theft auto or any of the other blatantly violentadult games halo sure shoot all the aliens you like dear just dont get any on my carpet hookers ahno i am quite sure they get enough of that crap at school sadly enough
im pretty sure that they needed the game to be rated by the esrb to get onto shelves in the shops
make it so concord wont defend your  unless you have certain standings with the entity whos space youre in or you pay a certain amount of isk per week if you do not have the proper standings you get a special flag but attacking those players still drops your sec standing standings would degrade over time so you cant just grind up and stop characters under a certain age would be immuneyou would be able to contract sec standing to other people at whatever price you saw fitthere would be a several month warning of this so nobody can claim they were caught with their pants downthis would make the line between empire and lowsec less defined and cause pvp to be more widespread but still give people the ability to opt out while in high sec and create another isk sink in eve that there are so many threads crying about
bump
god yes as a long long time domi pilot i support this so much
come on man like ratting was not boring enough but now after warping to a belt you have to wait like 20 seconds before you can even start shooting because the rats are bloody warping inwhat is ccp trying to do to us man bore us to death come on for christ sake is there not enough time sinks in the game as it is to add this one is beyond me every belt we warp to we have to wait 1520 secs to lock something for the rest of our eve life why why would you do this to usif a system has 10 belts the amount of added time just sitting there waiting will be like 3 minutes sit there for 3 minutes doing nothingboring isnt it now add those 3 mins up over the daywhyplease sort this out
this post makes me hope the rats start warping in slower
the idea is to be constructivetake your pathetic whines elsewhere
so all the belts i land in with rats already in them arefigments of my imaginationi sense an epic fail of a thread starting here
while i hate the farmer ravens in 00 there are a couple things i am concerned about1 the new npc warp in creates a delay that reduces overall profits of npcing in 00 thus it is a slight just a small discouragement of going to 00 instead of doing level 4s in empire and i was under impression that we needed the 00 rewards improved against the empire its not a big deal but it is noticeable2 i noticed an increase in desyncs occurring when killing npcs i suspect it has to do with new bumping mechanics and the fact that when npcs warp to a belt then dont have the 25 km random spread like player warp does they all warp to same point that makes them bump each other and cause desync it also happens if they warp into roids
e UFFFD    UFFFD f tears the new jumpfuel
i honestly dont get what the hubbubs aboutso the rat takes longer to get to you whoop ti doso prime your weaps and be ready to kill it when the speed of light catches up to youduhdesynch or not the rat will get there so you have to wait a few secs moreyeah torture

the interbus shuttle is using the same texture as a normal gallente shuttle and the ib logo is pasted on it as a decal of sorts and is not part of the texturethe kronos megathron navy mega and so on all use the same textures toothis uses the original navitas texture where is the blueccp would be lying if they say that ship painting and logos is impossible because theyre already doing that all the blue on gallente ships isnt there by default it wont add any lag anymore than flying a kronos or navy megathron or interbus shuttle does
1 spell check2 youre wrong if you make it cost a significant sum of money to color up your ships you create another money sink as well as more color varientsanyway i personally love gallente ships but hate the tealish colors they spray on everything the ability to make them blood red enyo or maybe a black like the navy mega would make my fraking day
either the module needs a major boost or the required skill should be reduced
should be dropped to level 4 requirements its pointless to get literally a 7 bonus over level 4 skill with t1 salvagerlevel 5 salvaging gives you another 5 the salvager gives you an extra 2 for a grand total of 7 considering i already have 70 chance spending the time to train to level 5 and buy the salvager iis for what 10 overall bonus i think not70 chance based onlevel 4 skillsalvager tackler ii x3hardwiring implants

i propose that ccp make evemail eves ingame email system accessible during downtime each day i think it would be a perfect time for people who are free at those hours to do their evemails because lets face it if you have limited time to play the game and pew pew is an option guess what gets done and what gets procrastinated yup i would say being able to do the evemail through the eveonlinecom site somehow would work fine sort of like how the forums work eventually an offline evemail browser maybe third party would be useful too
this might actually be a good idea
given that a thorough overhaul to the mail system is already in the works i cant imagine this is worth doing as a stopgap  itd be too much work and not last long enough as a solution better than the status quo yes but id rather just have a real mail client than one token fix to the thoroughly broken status quo
id have to concur with herschadditionally downtime is strictly a maintenance functionallowing a portion of the system to be made available could potentially be risky to ccp
with the new implentation of saving fitting i find that i also create folders for specific fittings sure you can do it manually but you have to add modules mutiple times after moving them to specifc folders i think this would be a great addition to the saved fittings without directly searching the marketedit dang hit enter by accident
forums used to be moderated by players crc answerable to ccp the player volunteer mods could only moderate not ban in response to the csms concern back on page 2i always thought the decision to eliminate the player moderation team was a poor one that has contributed significantly to the decline in the quality of the forumsso supported for some form of oversight by players mods need to be answerable in some form to the people who use the forums
the csm should be able to advise on forum policy but not specific cases

ccp has stated before that the reason we dont have ships that are mobile stations in themselves is due to complications if the ship blows up what happens to the other members in the ship and the ships theyre in if applicable if the pilot disconnects what happens to them then what about the people who logged off in the ship before it was destroyedthe issues are going to be hard to fix and the whining will be immense if they do implement that dont get me wrong id like to see gunners and such but its not likely to happenand regarding the carrier we have many already there are 8 different carriers alone not to mention the rorqual and orca which can haul ships yes carriers have drone bays get used to it because its not gonna change anytime soon
disagree with needing another carrier class however you could get around multiple pilots within carriers carrier dies all ships ejected with or without pilots carrier pilot logs off all online pilots are ejected pilots can not log off inside a carrier must log off in spacewould really make for some exciting uses if you could have pilots in ships inside carriersmotherships could jump with carrier if docked inside too awesome not like you can stuff a battleship fleet in them or too damn many hacs carrier jumps in solo and local says 7 hostiles just entered guess whativory

i still prefer active tanking twice that no matter if i am at full shields or no shields while also having a web a scram and four gyros while in an inexpensive fit thanks to dirt cheap shield resist rigs unless you are able to do the math on active tanking my advice is to leave my ships shield bonus the  aloneyour passive recharge fit would be terrible in any pvp situation much better to go for shield hp if that was the bonus instead and get well over 250k ehp while still doing good damage i still prefer an active tank however
i approve of this product andor service i support the idea of giving the ability to move while in triage as well as the majority of the other bonuses with the current mechanics they dont really serve much of a purpose for the isk they cost

currently fly a nidhoggur and getting into a nag next week tbh i have no issues with the nidhoggur could use slightly more cap and a little more pgcpu but its nothing gamebreaking really it remote reps like a mofo and serves its purposethe hel has issues but thats not a racial thing all motherships need addressing as much as each other so not really going to discuss it here ragnaroks gang bonus is pretty crappy but really as oveur said its just a big  if youre flying it solely for the gang bonuses you have bigger problemsthe main issue that everyone can agree with is the nag tbh i would be very happy if they did somethinganything to increase the dps im happy if it means i have a slightly sub par tank but for that i expect to be top damage not 2nd from the bottom i quite liked mia kahns idea of making it into a bit of a big tempest though the comments in regards to the autocannons are as much of an issue with all races reallyanyhoo some sort of update in regards to the issue would be nice and this threead gets my support 
sweet christmas
signed this cant possibly be working as intended warp into a pos and spend 20 minutes getting the dreads in position not cool
not sure if ive supported this yet but i doid like to see aggro prevent people from vanishing regardless of whether or not theyre currently logged in
so exactly what does it take to get csm attention to this matter
regarding ops scenario sounds like some kind of desync problem  i noticed a lot more of those since last big patchi do support rewriting of logoff mechanics  to make them more favorable to pvper it gets pretty bad right now with some of the tricks people pull like loging off then logging in a minute later and immediately log off again then log in again and warp to a safe point instead of the original place of log off in some cases log off makes ship invulnerable to lock people jumping into systems and logging off at same time  gives attackers only 30 second window to destroy them people logging off as soon as they see that they are about to get tackled thus bypassing the aggro timer by a couple seconds giving attackers just 1 minute to destroy them if they dont get hit by the invulnerable to lock bugthe most important change in my opinion is to make it so people can get aggro timer during the 1 minute their ship remains in space without aggro basically  if anyone shoots a ship it gets aggro doesnt matter if the char is logged in or notthis would have most significant impact on people who abuse log off mechanics to save ships while having little negative impact on people who have real connection problems
emphasis added on truthsupport
i think u need to rename this topic fromproposal cap sizeto proposal capital ship visual size  scaleorproposal capital visual something regaruding mesurament of scale
quoting this  the fact that when zommed out with brackets turned off i can get a hyperion confused with the carriers its parked near is a bit of a problem though there really are much more pressing issues out there
yes please i want my dread  carrier to look like it barely fits in a stations hanger and i want my ms to look like it cant fit and would destroy half the station if it ran into it
yes time for the super sizing to begin size does matter
yes yes quite
a titan speedtanking citadel torps  thats just ridiculous
lol its silly and one of the main reasons im avoiding ever using a phoenixnot only that but if you compare dpss of each potential dread the phoenix numbers are out done by the others according to efteven if the target is a pos
phwoar go the minmatar speed tank who said minnie caps were broken but seriously thats pretty ridiculous unless something is sieged or a pos youre pretty much ed at the moment def needs to be changed

i like this  it lets a queue work much more effectively i wont be surprised if ccp shoots it down but its certainly worth inquiring into
removes all risk of transporting skillbooks if the idea was to inject skillbooks that had the prereqs already in the skill queue id be all for it tho sorry no support from me
supportedif i want to make a queue that includes something i can train in5 hoursi canta bit stupid
transporting skillbooks honestly you may as well remove them as items  one would think theyd be available online were in freaking space
the pubbietears theatre company proudly presents why this wont happennewbie look at me ma im injecting heavy assault cruisersnewbie omfg i cant train petitiongm  you dont have the prereqs have a nice daynewbie what why did it let me waste isk to inject the book now im space poor and i cant sell the skill ragequitthe queue is only 24hrs long anyway just wait a day and use a jita jump clone to buy skills so you never have to worry about transportation
yes that would be why the game has warning messages besides this isnt about transportation for most players its about using the queue to its best effect
sorry not supported while it sounds logical and would be handy to have theres too many downsidesissues with it some have been mentioned already
no support  due to removing the risk associated with transporting expensive skill books
not supported adds to the lazy man effect
apart from importersexporters who this doesnt affect anyway who the hell are all these people transporting skill books about the placewhy are people buying books they dont yet need apart from maybe a handful of new players who dont understand the mechanics and havent yet trained jumpclones and are anyway futzing about in high secanyone flying skill books around 00 or low sec without the intention to sell them on is a crazy person who should seek professional helpseriously
it wouldnt make you warp faster that is correctits utility would be great though
true but more hotkeys are always a good thing far too many worthless hotkey options when we could really use a system where you can map almost any action to any key that would be awesome
what he saidto op you cant be serious
op is basically saying he doesnt like macgyver time to break out the pitchforks and torches
minor but i can see it being really handy that said could well be a bear to code  i dont know how the code interface or database would work for having default containers in every station to draw modules from maybe just have a pair of checkboxes  check containers and check corporate hangars that players can use to at least get most of the functionality you ask for without it being too much of a nightmare for ccp to code
how about check open containers for fitting 
this although i disagree i see no problem with adult content in eve the average player is 25 or older i believe even if seedy bars were implemented with ambulation you could still choose to not go into themi disagree since everytime you sign on the esrb says content online differs its kind of a big joke really since theres no single player content to rateesrb ratings have always been off for mmos since theres no way to fully regulate the behavoir of humans who have privacy and the freedom to say and do things they normally would notwhile the post that caused this red scare was bogus and an excellent troll i might add the issue of censorship is null here so stop getting scared people ccp has shown no signs of making this a kiddy game yet
no no no isk sinks arent needed searching standings as an integral part of combat is terrible gameplay and ccp will never implement any system that makes the highsecloving players a majority of their income stop playing the game
ya but its sure fun to freak them out
heh privatize concord and make standings matter for things like response times pvpers would have to check up on their targets to see how wellliked they are by the local police kind of like an empire tax for protection
no no support at all highsec is made to be safe no if ands or buts isaac
lay off the drugs you silly goongo back to delve and pew pew less stupid ideas
supportedthis problem cuts into the heart of the disparity in empire00 productivity discord 00 industrialists either have a time or isk drawback at establishing their own protective cartels whereas empire is given it for free either 00 manufacturing has to be raised in productivity and efficiency or empire productivity needs to be hampered through methods such as this
theres this thing called wardecsalso keep in mind just who builds your fancy toys too pal
uh we build all our fancy tools in house also this is something outside war decs entirely kind of amusing to see the only complaints coming from people afraid of engaging in what this game was designed for 
im not the idiot whos got the convenience of an several hundred corp backing him either
you should retype that and try again
you kind of lost any edge you had in this thread when you basically resorted to bickering to keep bumping your lame idea to the front pagelike most goons youre annoying and youre just looking for another way to grief go hide behind your wall of idiots and leave the real thinking to those of us with some cognitive ability in our grey mattergo play in a wormhole
saferdnc
so bickering caused me to lose any sort of edge by bickering and you quickly follow that statement up with thattruly genius but thanks for the bump  more bumps whining are appreciated
whats genius is the fact you fail to recognize that not everyone has an entire alliance with massive manufacturing capabilities at there disposalany credence you had goes right out the doorbut your not smart enough to figure that out as efrim so eloquently pointed out
actually any credibility you had you lost when you first started posting on eveo i cant think of a time when i havent seen your overly long name and thought i wish hed just stop posting

link to the original thread original nighthawk needs a powergrid increase threadthis was voted on passed and has not even been discussed the issue is years old now the original thread is coming up on a year old as wellget this fixed
it was discussed and according to the minutes from the meeting with ccp they agreed to look at it when they review those ships
thanks for the quick response oz i knew i voted for you for a reasoni looked through the minutes and found no mention of it are these minutes youre referring to public yet or have they yet to be released
theyre from the first csm and its getting increasingly difficult to find them on this forum were working on getting everything into the evelopedia tho
on another note the minutes said the nighthawk is not designed to fit heavy assault missiles or micro warp driveslinky
you mean the results from the boost sisi issue might be posted as well me you guys are fast these days
wow pretty freaking stupid given the fact that the nighthawk is designed from the ground up to be an antisupport platform not one range bonus for missiles and its designed to take down smaller targets but its not supposed to fit an mwdamazing
guess this isnt much of a hot topic mehconsidering how little work it is to do i can only assume and considering the benefits i wonder
sounds logical before attrib respecs it really wasnt an issue but now that we can alter our attribs it just makes sense to see the actual value rather than just an integer
it is spelled grief not greif
empire wars are one of the main reasons why ive been playing eve for so long
good corps survive wardecs stonger for the experience bad corps dont
from what i understand they havent really changed other then instead of just appearing out of thin air space they now warp in sounds like a good effect
give me your stuff and go play wow fixd
yeah this is nothing more than a whine fest not even appropriate for these forums go away crybaby no supportisaac
this is something id love to see too but limited i think too corp and alliance colour schemes that should cut down on any issues of lag and npc corps should be given just the basic scheme1 at alliance level apply the colour scheme and alliance logo changeable only by ceo of exec corp2 at corp level the same ability to set a corp colour scheme and apply the corp badge too the ships  changeable only by ceo 3 give the players the choice when in a corp in an alliance whether to have the corp colour scheme or the alliance colour scheme but with both badges onmaking it simplelike the current badge design processa limited colours ie black red blue gold yellow silver green and orangeb limited areas painted ie main hull sub hull 1 and sub hull 2c corp badge and alliance badge location to be set in appropiate place for all ships with no player ability to changeas mentioned its the clientside that renders the graphics so to limit the information make the corp and alliance color schemes only changeable once a month that way your not overloading anything and also allow the ability for players to turn off corp and alliance colour schemes in the client graphics section this only turns it off on there screen and those of us who like realism within the game can leave it on 
jesus guys i have no issues with macro miners they make an easy target for flipping me then pockets the ore
only issue i have with macro miners is if they are farming for an organisation in rl that is making a profit in rl money on what they mine ie isk sellersforget trying to spot macro miners just catch the people selling and buying isk in breach of the eula as they are the ones ruining the game at least with gtc trading the majority of the money paid for the gtc goes back to eve and is reinvested in the continuing development of the game wheres isk sellers dont put anything back into the game but do affect the internal prices of items on the market as peeps who buy isk will buy at over inflated prices so stopping the cost of items coming down to more reasonable pricesive never used a macro and never will and i run 3 characters at once mining ice or ore in high sec i ignore local most of the time as i am usually chatting in alliance or corp chat too m8s whilst also watching tv or a film and to be honest most convos in local in high sec are nothing but spam or something else i have no interest inone thing for sure am glad of is the orca as now i dont have to worry about thieves flipping my can overall as many others have said on here there is no way to catagorise a miner as a macroer 100 and thats what u would need to do to be able to ban a player as otherwise ccp would end up alienating a part of there customers and no company wants to do that
with the exception of primary weapons systems and hulls pretty much anything t2 that has been in the game a long while has level 4 for t2 any recent t2 has gone in at level 5 because like all mmog developers ccp eventually caught the grind bugits the same lazy design approach that leads developers to concentrate on t3 and cap ships rather than adding more options at t1 and t2

do a pipe in it
i am aware of this and if i cannot garner enough support from the residents of this fine forum then i shall seek some sort of resolution with other potential delagates much like the situation with the democrat presidential nominees last year i would prefer to see myself as the potential obama in any such showdown although being white english pipe smoker with a moustache may count against me in this case

agreed to scallingps i cant whait till the titantheread about capital ships geting bumped more then they do now because of size  btw u can fit just so many at a jump to cyno locationaprox 25km range bubleso be carefull what u wish forit mite just happen

been posted many times ccp would need to add a capital ship undock port if they wanted to rescale ships to their actual sizeits probably very far down the list of things to do after ambulation and shiny planets but it would be nice
most people here can agree that a siege phoenix should not be made null in effect by speed of other cap shipsat this point 20 phoenix dreads in siege would be unable too deal with a group of 5 carriers
bump this needs fixing
does anyone else think that its funny that you can speed tank a dread at all really if ther is one thing that a dread can hit it should be another dread
the issue not dread vs dread issue dread vs anything that moves and can fightwhile the gun dreads will miss a lot they can land a hit every now and then and deal a nice bit of dmg too a target while the phoenix can land every hit with its weapons what good is it when a raven hell i say a caracal does more dps then you do
lolphoenixthis does need looking at dreads of all sorts should still do loldamage vs a moving bs with good transversal however the numbers need to be adjusted for capital ships
from the point when the ambulation project was announced ccp have claimed that they are looking for ways of putting it to a goodor any use i think it would be great to improve new player experience through the benefits of ambulationthere are a lot of people who love eve not only for internet spaceships but for a very detailed and complex worldand i personally think that ambulation should cover all those pretty things that should happen in eve and which are not directly related to blowing ships in space basicaly idea is followingafter creating a character you do not end up in a hanger with a noobshipyou start in academy which you have chosen while character creation and before you are shipped to your station with a noobship waiting for ya lets say you get introduced to aura and get a chance to access loads of holoreel eyecandies with sexeh aura voice on particular parts of eve universe background  history  races  weapon types  etc brief and prettyyep i know that there are walls of text and bookworm erotical fantasy on eve website or evelopedia but this scares off a lot of peoplewhen introduced to the game i think best way to get a desire to be part of the universe is getting a brief eyecandy teasing on all aspects either than receiving chineese wall of text with overwhelming ammounts of information pros 1 puts 1 use to ambulation yay2 who dosnt want to know how an elite academy for podpilots look like 3 gives player better feeling of eve universe and particular stylebackground and envoirnment of the race they have chosen4 as i remember some interviews from fanfest  one of the most fancy spectacular ambulation feature scale of ships in hangar comparing to the avatar was removed you can put it in here with some meaning for instance you academies can be put on a planets you will be able to look out of the window and see some fancy planet background  which will also give you feeling that eve universe is not just about void space and after finishing your briefing on a planet you can be shipped to station5 you getting into pod experience can be described or visualized6 aura voice is sexehcons 1 its not a vital or neccesary feature fix the lags first and whining like this d 2 pretty consuming feature for art department considering it non vital but so is the ambulation itself d3 who cares about new people 4 roleplaying sucks 5 this probably will be bettereasier to be instanced from technical point of view which is considered the greatest evil in eveokay now you can throw rocks at merly
fixdtry to avoid double negatives in your proposals confuses the hell out of people o
with some polishing around the edgesnot a terribly bad idea
i wont throw rocks i agree with you about starting out in an acadamy or at least the hangar in avatar form however your cons are all a bit stilted personally they need to just implement the fraking thing thats the only thing keeping some of my friends from playing the gamealso linkage to the dev blog where they dropped scaling
i support the idea
for the love of chribba please do somthing about it loading lots of build copy invention and soon reverse engineering jobs daily is driving me nuts

good idea should be a easy fix too
hell yes why didnt someone think of this earlier
great idea
i like the idea most of the time people transporting expensive skillbooks are doing so for another character so injecting it will not help it would make the sq far more usefull
if they quit over that chances are they will find something else to quit over lateryes that is an option but lets say you have a longish plan with multiple levels of prereqs for example training t2 large beams when you dont have any t2 lasers trainedfor this example you would have to jumpclone back to jita 3 times first to get small beam specialisation then you train to level 4 and jc to get medium beam specialisation then you train it to 4 and make your third trip to grab large beam specialisationso thats 3 jumps with a 24 hour wait meaning you are out of action for 3 days instead of just 1 if you could inject before meeting the prereqs meaning more time doing what you enjoy doing in evethus it rewards planning ahead with your skill training if you know what you want you can spend less time waiting for the jump timer to expire because you injected them beforehand
a lot of programming for something not that nessesarysoo no not really 
i like it but some very good counterarguments have been made too
if you look at an anchored giant can it says 29days remaining or whatever how about a jetcan timer so you know when it will pop x minutes
everyone knows these cans expire in 2 hourswhy make it any harder than it is on the devsseriously try to put a little more effort into thinking and less time on just meeting your quota ok
its not a ridiculous request its simple  its something that the servers already keep track of and just dont display to the end userthe workaround that everyone uses is to name their cans with the time it was created which works it would be convenient if it were automatedits a very minor issue but people who deal with jetcans frequently would appreciate itsupported
style over content it seems aside of causing headaches for those who spend a lot of time around them and making people seasick with the fluctuating shield bubble the new effect interferes with numerous other mechanics particularly visual effects things that spring to mind are warp disruptor effects bubbles nos effects etc these more or less depend on the colour setting of the space background of a system but more often then not it is pretty hard to identify  happening in a visual sense as was pointed out elsewhere anybody who has to zoom out to maintain overview cant see what he or she is doing never mind what anyone is doing in space behind the pos itselfpos shields used to be nice and calm and not visually disruptive now they are severely in the way of the experience theres even reports of csm who want to hurt kittens when they warp to a pos and we really cannot have that im perfectly fine with csm folks hurting people andor stuff this is eve just not kittensit strikes a lot of us as a case of favoring style over content design over usability sure it looks great the first time but once youre working in or around them it gets severely in the wayas such it would be an example of sanity and common sense to drop the new visuals however since this cannot be done for reasons of marketing and juicy advertising screenies i would settle for an option to just turn the thing off showing not the cheesy eyecandy but a normal low res static bubbleto clarify we do not want to throw the current bubble in the trash but we really could use an option to turn the thing off possibly switch to a low res static alternative
simply confirmedi work with some poses and normaly im zoomed out but now with how you call it premium lite its a marple ball and i cant see what im doingplease move back to the old grapics they where perfect
i agree we are living out of a pos and the new model is very annoying please bring back the old onethe previous one was calm and neutral i feel like we live in the centre of a storm now
thumbs up from me new shield graphics are out of place and annoying
disagree love the new pos effects
dont misunderstand i really like the new shield bubble in the sense of nice design it just gets in the way hence why it would be a big improvement if we had the option to switch the visuals offfor instance a fallback to the old bubble visual or heck even a static fishbowl which in many cases in 00 would be strangely appropriate as a choiceat the same time this would give a nice touch to folks with less powerfull machines since the loading sequence of the pos shield bubble on exit warp can  as i understand from a bunch of alliance forums throughout eve  be quite taxing
confirmed please change before i have a seizure
indeedso much of these graphical improvements this last patch are eye candy that either induce more lag are either too subtle or too obnoxious
fix needed badly
i love the effect for a few seconds while flying by or approaching a pos but working inside ours is also giving me a headache  please allow us to tone downturn off the effects without removing them altogetherthanks
supported i suppose though i love the new effect and i have yet to suffer from it and yes i hang out in low sec poses
totally agree with virtuozzo please give us at least option to switch back to old pos  dictor  ect field visual effect
i support this new pos grafics are totally overboard
hate the new bubble especially the way it loads onto grid as you warp inoption to drop to low rest supported and signed
believe me mate actually living out of a pos makes them get old very quick and while its nice to see it does cause its problems
bump for something useful
how exactly is the requested feature different from this existing featureor is it that you want bookmarks to be added to the overview so that you can warp toalign to them from there
very briefly lets take a look at a few issues some of which have been addressed some of which have not a amarr need i say moreb black ops shipsc countless weapon balance issues both current and pastd low sec intereste drone region mineral problems ie trit shortage etcf nighthawk powergrid shortagethe list goes on and on some of these issues literally took years to address that is not an exaggeration some of these issues have been problematic for years and there is no foreseeable balancing in sightgranted i understand that balancing takes time i truly do however some of these issues are taking long enough to be addressed that they probably exceed the amount time some people are willing to wait to see them resolved i suspect people have left this game for greener pastures after having waited for one of these significant issues to be resolved and never seeing itthat strikes me as a serious problem other games have addressed balance issues of this magnitude within months while still providing new contentwhy is it that some of these issues are put off indefinately why is this not only tolerated but obviously seen by ccp as acceptablethis is a problem and it needs to be fixed sooner than soon tm
i partially agree  it has been a long long time i do see things from ccps perspective though having been party to their development systems and team structure on the csm though and its now clear that even while we were presenting issues last year they were already gearing for the apocrypha schedule crunch i guess what we really need now post apocrypha is some movement on the queued up issues speaking personally this is the major reason im not running for csm again in term 3  because i honestly want to see more of the issues i championed and presented entering the solid development cycle before asking people to reelect me on the past record of the things you list im keenly awaiting black ops improvement lowsec interest and several balance issues  as well as a number of important combat dynamics and movement on 00 sovereignty im pretty hopeful they will get there in the end but i do agree with you it would be nice to see more of this stuff receiving significant development time in the near future
no ermmmm and nowhats the point anyway u can still only use one character at 1 time per account fork out and get another account or 2 or 3 i know some peeps who have 7 accounts and run them all at once hats off to them i think they may be octopusses lolnot supported
noskill training is the limiting factor what keeps you from being able to do things until youve earned the right in eve levels and experience are the limiting factors in many other mmos wow guild wars etc none of these games let you log on to the same account twice so that you can level two or three etc characters at the same time eve does the same by restricting passive skill training to one character per account its not news in the mmo industryyou think wrongtldr other mmos do the same thing but in a different wayedit fail quote tag fixed
saggy glandssaggy glandssaggy glandssaggy glands come onseriously
big fat no no other mmo does this show me one legit mmo and then ill allow this idea isaac
ill support it if they disallow char salesi wont support it as is due to its free isk for all chars
dont go thereits bad enough people try to compromise a system that is unique to itselfthis is the mmo lets make sure it stays that way
you claim that there are mmos that allow you to train multiple characters on the same account at the same time so you must know of some name themapart from eve all the mmos i know of only allow you to train a character when it is online and since you cant have multiple characters on one account online at the same time you cant train them at the same time instead to train one you must first log out pausing its training to train the other
id prefer to see a more fleshedout analysis of the pros and cons before i support this for now ill have to decline
woot  i love it now i can train 2 research alts and sell them at a time oh wait and i can finally have that titan pilot i always wanted and since i have 15 accounts that can all train characters at the same time i can have 30 hulk pilots and 10 research and 3 titans and a freighter  my orca and mainwait no this is a terrible ideanot signed
ill make it easy for you1 think about what would happen if you could train all 3 chars on one account without penalty2 think about what the next guy will do3 think about the worst bunch of guys will dostarting to sink in yetgood because if you cant figure that out you dont belong herelook ill be the first to admit that would be cool but it would be a total nightmaredeathmatch out there easily abusedexploitedyou people where given a damn skill queue now you want the bloody galaxy yeah i get itgreeddoes the body good eh
the idea about being allowed to have alts at all or more then one account is already destroying a main and very importent aspect of the game the same is charecter trading shouldnt be allowedit removes the unique identification which this whole game is build upon reputation it is the only thing that can be dmg for scamming and doing stuff that no other game would allow and the alts etc are removing that one penalty and i find it very wierd that they are allowed to do so when the system is build like this
whats the difference between that and now you just need 3 the amount of accounts only difference is that you pay more and can log them all in at the same time i see that as a bigger problemwhich should be corrected
supported in general but would like to point out alliance level management roles and tools are non existent and that is most of the problemyou need to be in an alliance to claim sov but instead of alliance being a seperate window laid out like the corp tools window it is stuffed in with the corp window like an after thought with no thought or care put into itother posts have raised this issue and i believe the ops points should be included in them
denied now that it happened i want to be able to destroy the enemy alliances has they did to usthe mechanic is bad but i hope that i can make my revenge
not just the shipsp
not supported dont waste development time on this besides i like the way they look as i am sure some others do too
hi im decided minmatar pilot and i like look of my ducktapestyle ships i like when my enemy have to face those uglymeanlooking shipsalso keep in mind some ppl dont want eve to be candylook like wow 
current mechanic is that you are physically unable to tow another persons wrecksi would like to see it allowedhopefully it would result in aggro from the person that owns the wreckpotentially it could involve concordinationhowever it should definitely be allowed physically in the game
only if it allows aggro to be picked up when salvaged not just lootedotherwise noits bad enough we get ninja salvagers invading other peoples missionspublic areas i never have a problem withthey have it way to easy now so easy it hurts
as long as they get aggro  yes but not because it makes mission runners lives unfair the mechanic currently forces a salvager by trade to balance risk with reward he cant tractor wrecks that means he must fly to every wreck to salvage it closer if he wants loot that takes time so he could get a faster ship but faster ships tend to have less tank and npc aggro is a risk factor in mission salvaging ie ninja salvaging bring a tanky ship to reduce risk from mission rats and have fun with the time intervals insteadeither way a trade gets made that is the neat thing about it imo
well if you get aggro when towwing then thats problem solved right
potentially its not really clear to me what effects this will have
no one said you had to tractor the wreck to salvage
should course agro just as if you had attacked the player you are towing
so i saw the new scan time and i was suddenly thrilled that ccp decided to finally make combat probing match up with player reaction much to my dismay i find that combat probing is using the same gimped out mechanic that the new probing system is with good skills and 7 probes on grid you simply cannot get a hit the result being that its pretty much annihilated one niche role in fleet battles the combat prober who would provide snipe spots and warpins its now highly impractical to expect that much less catch people at safespot this is a vital element of several types of gameplay and its a shame that ccp really neglected the change it brought with the new expansion and how it effected this play style
somehow i think your not doing that right
weve had no problems scanning people down since the change you must be doing something wrong
its not so much that you cant find people in safespots any more you can but that because the system requires you to spend a few minutes fiddling around positioning your probes you cant easily catch out people at short notice before apocrypha you could jump your covops into a new system drop a spook or fathom and 30 seconds later you could be in warp to the hostiles locationnow that you need to spend time dragging your probes around the system scanning and rescanning different areas for hits forming and reforming your triangulation patterns narrowing down the target until you get a 100 hit that is pretty much never going to happen on a prepared battlefield where you have your probes out and positioned eg at a pos coming out of reinforced its great but the new system makes it much harder to get warpins at short noticethumbs up for the proposal of making the new system easier but id prefer to tweak what we have now for example have a setting to make probes automatically move into predefined triangulation patterns rather than forcing us to manually drag them out every time than revert to the old days
would be nice to put all your gear for your various fittings in a can and not have to drag them out every time you wanted to change fittings i dont think this would be easy to code but if they could it might help a little with db lag as you would only get the call to move an item from one place to another when you actually fitunfit items rather than also having calls when you moved your mods in and out of the cans to access them got to say that this would be just as easy if players could have tabs in their personal hangers like the corp hangers
over the past few days theres been as goons would say on caod a lot of hurf blurf on this board about the fact that scanning in the way its implemented now is fairly userunfriendly which mostly manifests itself in small wspace systems with a high number of signatures so ive taken the 30 seconds to think of what could be done and i think ive come up with a solution that a doesnt penalize players that enter small systems with tons of signatures and b still retains the difficulty of scanning in wspacethe solution make any site that you have scanned down and spawned important appear as 100 on any subsequent scans that overlap that site make this a sessiononly feature  if you log off or get dcd you still have your bookmarks but now you have to scan the sites down again to get the same function same functionality as system beacons for spawned sites at the momentmake this a single client feature  if you scan down a site only you get the benefit of the 100 scan if your fleetmate was in the site but hasnt scanned it they have to scan it down before they get the same benefiti think this should solve the problems and also remove the need for people to have to get their panties in a twist about things like i dont want to scan gravimetric theres too many sites and my favourite the sleeper turret ate my minercommentssuggestionsflamesmoved this from general to here
this would be a great addition imo it is rather annoying atm when you cant really keep track of what you have already probed and found down in those small systems
this feature is already implemented if you have a brain bookmark the site if you have scanned it down adn spawned it on the solar system map you will see a little pin bookmark icon at that spot if a twoprobe circle result overlaps on one of your pins you know youve already found that one deviation can throw you but not enough to make it too confusing  what are the odds that another unfound site has enough deviation to show up exact overlapping the other site while your original sites result is deviating far enough away to not look like it
yeah i know it is however from the point of view of the gameplay it makes 0 sense why your ships sensors cant tell a repeat signal that you have visited and know its parameters from a new one also if you probe in wspace often your probe will land in the middle of a couple of signatures that will often have overlapping circlesim not saying that the way the current system is done is not workable  far from it however something like this will be incredibly helpful in sorting through the wspace and the many many many asteroid belts that come with it
sounds reasonable and helpfull

i got the chance to experiment a little yesterday with my shader set to low i could not see a heavy interdictor bubble at all there was a very faint effect around the ship itself but absolutely no edge to the bubble or indication that it was even a sphere i set my shader to medium and there it was  a nice round bubble like id expect to see so im thinking this must be a bug either that or the plan is for people running in premium light mode to get killed at gate camps more often and that doesnt seem likely

why exactly because you dont like being vulnerable in whats considered a harsh galaxy or because you think that being in empire its the game mechanics job to protect you from pvp no matter what
no what is it with you are you that dumb the flaw is your idea concord is not some independant mercenary group they function as a united nations they do not do what they do for money they do it to preserve at least the semblance of peace in empire spacepeople are already vulnerable in high sec if your idea was so great youd be generating quite a bit more support as opposed to you know one alt and another goon
now i know the un theoretically plays an impartial 3rd party to conflicts around the world but im afraid that just isnt the case any institution that involves humans involves favoritism research the un a bit and see why many people think it should be completely disbanded and perhaps you can try that one again
yes concord is supposed to be similar to the un however they have no favoritism cannot be bribed or corrupted they keep the peace as best they can read some eve chronicles so as ccp has already written it down that they are an impartial 3rd party it is so ive lived in all sectors of space btw highsec has some nice things but i prefer the lowersecurity areas i dont see why people should have to grind standings with concord to be protected the secstatus system works fine in this area your above 1 and they dont shoot your below and they shoot we dont need to change this isaac
show me someone without a price and i will show you someone who simply hasnt had their price met 
no actually it isnt
arguing with a goon is like arguing with a hes too prideful and stubborn to think straight and only cares about griefing never mind the mechanicsyour better off ignoring this thread and letting the goons and alts of goons make an ass of themselvesagainand againand againand again trails off
your right drake dunno why i even bothered thread yup threadisaac
getting the thread back on topic a person in highsec can simply drop corp or stay in an npc corp and manufactureimagine two manufacturing pos one located in say perimeter one in hemin curse i through whatever reason forget to fuel my pos and it goes offline in the first case i risk someone suicide ganking my pos for whatever ive left in there though with sec hit its unlikely anyone can finish the job in the second i merely have no recourse other than to defend it arguing that wardecs are a means around it ignore the fact that its not a question of the attacker but the ancillary costs borne by the producers that currently hinders 00 manufacturing by increasing the risk or in lieu of that increasing the cost of avoiding risk itll at least provide more incentive for 00 manufacturing
nice point however in 00 all you need is a good solid alliancegang and your able to gather resources not normally available in high secincentive or not all can be worked with to some degree or anothersystem works as intended in that context
in your low sec pos you can react gases react moon minerals moon mine and have less fuel cost no faction charters so you have several important advantages for a serious disadvantage unless you place it in 04 systems where you have only the disadvantages but then the problem is your brain not the posseem balanced
youve illustrated the point i have to pay for the defense so much so that the defensive upkeep is well in excess of whatever benefits are accrued from being in a different security sector than the highsec pos if my goal is simply industry theres no economic incentive to remove production from highsec
that may be the case but you cant construct everything in high secyou cant gain access to certain materials in high sec that would make your industry more lucrativeone way or another it is not a free ride by any meanshigh sec industry is not free its expensive just not astronomically expensiveyou people keep thinking in terms of relative stance we little folk here have to start somewhereif it was that easy id have a bloody pos in every bloody 5 system and then somebut i dontso might want to put things into a rational perspectivenot to mention you still need a corp a corp that can be wardeced a corp that needs standings fuelchartersetcetcetc
such as
well obviously capital ships for startersother than the freighters and orcasand thats where the big bucks are in 00if all your doing is small fries fine then but in lowsec and even 00 you have total freedom to manufacture whatever you want with the appropriate equipmenttwist my words all you want not everyone has resources you proclaim to have even implied
hmm okey if they also instant kill anything with  standing and you got 3 standard for killing another sooo i guess you wouldnt like that hu
supported for the purposes of csm discussion  though personally i would like to see the same rules throughout all of 10 to 01 space with the concord repsonse time as a function of your age standings with concord and the systems security level
would be hilarious but stupid

please
organization is good
okey every one have tryid to put something on the market and 2 min later some one have althored the price on their order to 1 isk lower then your order so you have to do the same etci think every one can agree how annoying and frustrating this isso i think we should make some kind of system that removes thisthis is the only solution i can come up with and this is how it will workyou set up a order first it will ask you about start price then ask about minimum price then it will ask minimum amount to react on then time it will be up forso this is how it worksstart price  the price it will start to showminimum amount  the minimum amount in 1 bunch before the it will start to lower your priceminimum price the price it will drop to as minimum before stoppingnow here is how it works when some one else sets a order up that meat the minimum amount and are under yours the two bunches will start to lower the prices 1 isk at a time untill one of them hits the minimum price and the other will be 1 isk lowerwhen a order have been set up it cannot be cancelled after 10minutes as a max after that it have to run out its timerit should ofcourse be a clik on so you could ask it to do so or not although you should never be able to take down the order before times runs outthis needs some thought too be thought about some exploids in the system like buyers setting up orders for one day and press down the pricealthough this would not be a problem by just adding in a minimum amount of days before reactingso what do you think about it tell me about the wholes and cons you see here
first off i suggest learning english spelling and grammar no im not the one to look to for that but its obvious your having troublesecondly if i understood you correctly you dont like being market snipedwell sorry thats tough get a helmetthe market is so diverse and rapidly changing its not going to matter whether you sell or notodds are someone is going to buy your product anyway regardlessall over 1 isk seriously big fat woop thereim not that stingyworks as intended dont turn the market into ebay with auction sniping pleasethe only thing i can see here thats even close to rational is a time delay rule on price changesbut that is where it stops no further than thatyou place the sell order you pay a fee to change the price or its locked for 24 hours or somethingbut dont get carried away
sorry you gotta be more precise where again is it that my gramma is offand i am not whining just saying that it is annoying that you have to constantly modify your orders when you could have a system that would automatically do this and it seems so rediculess that you can do this looking from a rl market you wouldnt change prices every 5 minutes your suppliers would be ed if you did and so would your buyersthis would be a optional to click on or off so it wouldnt hurt you if you dont like it dont click it on do it manually if you like it set it onso if you got a rl and cant be on 247 set it on your problem is fixedso where is the bad things in the suggestion i dont see you pointing anything bad out you just seem like you wanna whine about a system that would make it better for people not being there 247it would be a positive thing for most people and only a negative for the few sitting 247 on 
im going to give you one more chance to read my post carefully if you dont understand prepare to be trolledi made a very strong suggestion and i already pointed out the obvious threat of messing with the balance im not going to babysit everyone i see here sorry not charitable right nowall your doing is encouraging a lazy mans approach to a market that is very easy to manipulateif i where you i would start learning to anticipate price drops be a bit more aggressive competition wise dont do 1 isk increments try 10 to 100 isk increments typestop being lazy think outside of the boxi can tell yah right now very very few people dont give a damn about 1 isk differences on the marketall they care about is 2 things1 where the hell it is2 and is it going to bankrupt thembeyond that most dont care about penny pinching unless eve is populated by ocd pilotsadditionally set up your sell orders in systems that are not market hubspick mission hubs insteadfree tipill send you my bill
i can see you totally missed my pointthe whole point is people dont give two isk about that 1 isk or some of us even 1million isk or for some 100million isk etcbut the fact is that the lowest price is the one that is showed as the buy when you are not in the details which most people are notwhich means the one with the lowest price even if it is 1 isk will be the one boughtand here is the problem people set it that 1 isk lower and it is very annoying that you have to do thisalthernatively you could set it so you cant change the price less then 35 of the total isk amount so at least you wouldnt see people doing the 1 isk thingi did read your post and i dont see where you point out the problem with this system it would make it easier to set up market orders for every one and it would give a more rl feeling of the market
not designet to fit an mwd it is like hacsbs were not designted to hurt enemies
the ship is not designed to fit micro warp drives  the ship is not designed to be used in pvp
well as everybody noticed after apocrypha and new exploration system you cant make width of your direct scan smaller i loved my scanner narrow and not taking too much unnecessary space on screen if we can resize overview chat windows to be much more narrow why cant we do it with direct scani guess it have something to do with new system scanner in this case cant you just make direct scanner to be alone window that i can drag off system scannermoon analysis and resize then like overview just and idea how to resolve unresizable direct scan but it would be much more usefull if user would be able to make everything smallerhow do you think do you like resizable direct scan too
holy crap eve has a hardtouse aspect of its ui supported
gawd yesso many of the new ui changes this patch were a step backwards in functionality but they sure look pretty now if only they were practical
supported
if you bothered to read the devblog about the scanning system you would read that ccp has every intention of working on the directional scanner they just didnt have the timeresources to work on it before apoc although i support this change we dont need to bring it upisaac
agree minor change that helps clarity its bad enough being so reliant on an external fitting program needing evemon or similar for seeing our stats just adds more complexity for newer players
very much like a mini corp hanger allow players to rent extra tabs for their personal hangers this would address the several things i have seen brought up here and in features and ideas such as some of the container complaints and the recent thread about allowing us to autofit from containers seems like this would be an easier fix for the most part
the correct solution here is to make containers work properly  station containers ought to work this way they just dont i like your goal just not your solution

im posting
shouldnt u be fighting a war instead of posting  on cp
didnt you read they are giving up i mean umm no they are giving up
they failed at war is that why they are starting to fail on forums too
it is dying
who are you
ill vote for him since his video with the techno sparta remix to smartbombing militia was the funniest thing ive seen in eve ever
 name
i would vote for you over a high sec salvager and an alt any day
if you could include a little mickey mouse in the backgroundor best imitation i would most likely switch over
amy nooooooooooo
this
what if he was a high sec salvager alt thats got to be better than one or the other right
this
given that captain pompous has not had a visible presence on these fair forums for some time i feel i may take upon myself the mantle of official csm delegate nominee for cp
an interesting turn of events this just came to my attention and it should make things very heated i fear the results of this may be that neither you nor pompous get in but i do hope one of you doeswhatever the final result i feel at pompouss return an official cp debate is in orderid be happy to organise it at the appropriate timei feel quite saddened to say tchells hopes seem to have withered awayit would make things that much better if we saw a returni will still be backing pompous as despite what the fools think he is still a strong candidate and an excellent representitive of cp values
as is often the way with youngsters he went too fast too early and climaxed too soon after ing in his pants i doubt hell have the stamina for another go any time soon
i have published my manifesto link is in this threadplease enjoy
the first change that i think deserves to be made is that npc pirates should no longer give a boost to security status for killing them their rewards are already more than sufficient and why would your security go up if it cant go down in this region this would also serve to have player pirates remain in lowsecurity space to boost their status giving the other players more and juicier targetsplease tell me thats a troll please tell me that entire site is a troll edit its pretty apparent that highsecurity space doesnt need any advantages to be attractable to others but some changes can still be made in this region to help it out ank already did us the imminent service of making suicide ganking harder to do but it doesnt have to stop there one of the ideas ive already outlined under enhanced missions will help out  that of having aggro on anybody not in your fleet that enters your mission area the ore distribution also gives people a way to mine for their own shipsa carebears wet dream that site is
please note that this guy is refering to the link above his post not my manifesto
confirming thissorry for posting it in your thread lark i didnt forsee that posssible outcome
i know me not dumb me can read you definitely have my vote lark
oh my god
lark take a look at my new thread please
lark will you put unban bai zongtong from the forums as part of your agendaninjia edit doesnt need to be all caps
im afraid i cannot accept that while bai zongtong is an excellent troll and outstanding forum poster i feel these things must run their course i myself have been in receipt of several bans from the forums
got my vote
direct link to my blog for the lazyit also includes my sexy visage
how long is left on his banpage 4 snypah
o wtf i missed the snipe90day ban 30day left x
ill vote 4 u if you abilitately maneuver to diplomatically but firmly convince the establishment at ccp to finally release the pir8 population from their pain and anguish by seeding smurgleblaster as part of your otherwise interestingly formulated and succintly presented lowsec boost agenda i would also like to congratulate you on the very cheerful and spiritually inspiring colorful signature that you have put forth in order to bring forward your csm candidature and wish you prosperity and long life in this fantastically exciting endeavour
well youre gaybut thats never held you back before so you have a shot
nothing wrong in my mind with being a salvager or an alt or both it is unseemly when a player regardless of their occupationingame becomes a selfcongratulatory poastaholic additionally despite nonconsensual group activities on the part of the probably salvager alt in question i fail to see how that person and hisherits group has any principled stand on anything other than their own best interests or from the point of view of a pirate whatever that may besrsly if larkonis trassler has a passport a modicum of ability to think critically and at least one limb already assuming the latter is true then i vote for himheritto date larkonis trassler has demonstrated vastly nay immeasurably more worthiness than other cp candidatesbtw most excellent corp name lana torrineditmodicum  really
nice manifesto some good ideas  can you add murder ed carebearssimply because of that bunyip dude been so frustrating
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesi laughed irl at this
alt post poster posting about alts and posting
one of my campaign team has been nice enough to set up a blog thing for me i have published my manifesto and my application is in the process of being submitted to ccpplease any questions or comments in this thread
how effective do you feel your stand on gms can be
i dont intend to make a stand as it were as i stated the gms do a fantastic job however in light of a lot of recent events chribbas high sec dread being moved for example there does appear to be a lack of concrete guidelines regarding certain aspects of the game in dialogue with some gms i have had to explain certain aspects of game mechanics to them some language issues have also arrised i have on occassion dealt with gms who have had less grasp of the english language than a grizzly bear leading to frustration for both parties im sure i would like to see an expansion of tools for submitting petitions in addition to pushing for the csm to at least have an overview of how gms operate and if possible give suggestions on how to improve the services offeredpetition response times this affects us all and is simply an issue of volumeresources short of ccp hiring many more gms there will always be a backlog in my experience most serious petitions that are well worded are dealt with in a timely manner
what do you believe should be changed on falcons to make them more inline with other ecm ships on a similar note what if anything is wrong with using eccm as a counter to falcons or other ecm ships
excellent question in an ideal world i would like to seefalcon jam strength bonus dropped from 20 back to 15 or even 10scorpion jam bonus increased from 15 to 20 this is a battleship class war vessel and should be the mainstay and powerhouse of any jamming fleetintroduce a new skill sensor hardening rank 23 510 bonus to sensor strength per level every other ewar type has a skill that will go some way to countering it although additionally helping you out when not being affected by these ew systems be it extra cap locking range speed tracking etc why not ecmecm though chance based if successful will completely remove a ship from a fight he cant operate any offensive modules on his enemies or any defensive modules on his friends if affecting a battleship he has to spend significant time relocking his enemies in order to kill them and his friends in order to remote rep them to that endecm does not break a lock you are still able to lock on to targets and maintain your lock on existing ones if you want to inhibit someones ability to lock then use damps while under the influence of ecm you cannot operate any offensive or defensive modules lolrpyour main computersensor array is still able to lock on to a target but your individual module computer subsystems are unable to lock on to the target lolrp however drones are still able to be used unless they themselves are jammed this means a ship is not completely impotenti would also have the mechanic changed so if a ship loses lock on a target either through warping off cloaking or exploding the ecm cycle is immeadiately canceled on the target though the module still has to cycle on the aggressing ship this will put an end to the frankly quite frustrating falcon tactic which i have used myself on many occasions of sitting at range decloaking getting off a jam cycle and recloaking before any offending ships can lock you up and deal with you usually the oft quoted tach apocadd a stacking penalty to ecm like other ewar the first or highest strength jam hits for full strength second less third even less and so on and so forth falcon pilots in gang will need to coordinate better and solo pilotssmall gangs will still have a chance to take something out should they run afoul of gangs who have packed lots of ecm at the expense of other ewar much in the same way as they could do currently if they run into a hypothetical gang where instead of ecm they are packing lots of tds damps or painterseccm gives more bang for your buck than any other counter module it is also completely useless if you dont run into any ecm boats however no other ewar is as utterly devastating to a ship as ecmremove signal distortion amps from the game or alternatively give target painters damps and tracking disruptors their own low slot boosting modulescurrently ecm and in particular falcons are the defacto ewarship combo for small to medium gang warfare when a gang of ten includes three falcons at the expense of any other type of ewar ship then something has gone wrong somewherefake editapologies for the wall of text
i may have misread her manifesto
lana torrin u best be trollin
and the last of the ty alts jumps on the bandwagon
tbh id say at least give her a chance of reading this before claiming shes jumping on the bandwagon

self ownage is the best ownage
thats not what you ment at all damage control ii
does ccp pay for the inflight meals and tickets to iceland or is it up to the voted csm to get there on their own dime i dont really know all the rules and perks of getting voted into office or where to find them
dear god not another tara threadnought at least they are funny i guess
i can support thisshe would add some much needed weight to the council
dammit i lold
huh
lol ask him bout thathe got the boot from snigg
is tara wilde an alt of cat 0ninetailsthe timing and personal philosophy are curiously coincidental
well that didnt take long
i refuse to believe any attractive women have ever played eve of course if you really are an attractive girl maybe we should webcam later i dont look anything like tadesae though so dont get your hopes up kiss
apparently its not okay to rage at people about how  they are
awww i think you misunderstood me i was saying the the goggled image of tara wilde was quite ugly and apparently a  star who knew but not you i know your not the same person you are pretty hugs
did you guys know the average age of a person who plays eve is around 28 years old and at least 95 of the players are males of course im really a hot chick too everyone give me your stuffsthe bit about looking for a boyfriend who plays eve is priceless
yay im over averagewait
the thread lives on
yup its never gonna give you up and never gonna let you down
right4 pages of 
well im sorry but im leary of anyone playing eve who says theyre an attractive 120 pound hottie looking for a boyfriend maybe its just me
no its everyoneits lolrly
so are you guys gonna vote for her
no
shes already said shes not going to run im not going to vote for anyone now out of protest
its an age thing called being grownup might even have something to do with nondiscloser agreements
one hitpost  sighted
what are you talking about im over the age of majority and i can sign a legally binding contract like the nda just fine
i think your z key is stuck that or your high on methdont do drugs and fly ships its a bad for your health
currently the csms do not represent the playerbase interests and concerns they only represent the tiny minority who voted for them or in the case of a large alliance that will not be named elected by mandatory alliance voting in their favorwhen the general playerbase raise a concern it is often ignored when they demand the csms bring it up to ccp theyre usually shot down with shut it noob you dont know what youre talking about gtfo l2pand heres the point the same issues that were around before the csms are still around now other than repeating everything ccp says like a parrot the csms do almost nothing or to put it more accurately they do almost nothing under the public eyeso you tell me then why do you believe the csm program has any value i see noneingame polls are the only true method of determining urgent andor important issues
the first csm managed to accomplish a little bit but i dont even think the second csm did anything other than go on a trip to iceland and repeat what ccp was saying about the ferrogel exploit if you were actually going to represent the players then why the hell havent you all done anything people post topics to the csm forums all the time yet only a select few terrible ideas ever make it to a meeting picking favorites on topics isnt the way to represent the players if you actually want to do something that represents our opinions then let us vote on what should be discussed at meetings i approve of lavistas idea since that is about as close as the average player can get to making their thoughts known to the csm and in turn ccp
dont forget 89 either
my 3d dlp wants a font larger than 1 pixel wide 
yes please
i agree i miss the old effect so much
nothing more needs to be said
signed
signed old effect was awe inspiring bring it backat the least give the players an option to choose which effect thier screen displays
i have to agree we need atleast an option to choose
signed
should be looked at while the old effect just felt like a big ship breaching the space time fabric it now looks like well it doesnt look like anything reallybring the thunder back
i agree with this the jump animations such at first i thought they were cool but not any more the old stargate jump and jumpdrive jump animations and sounds were the bomb you really got the feeling that the gatedrive was really tearing a hold through spaceand the zoom of the stargate as it sent or received a signal and the pow of the drive as the capital arrived really was bad ass in my opinioni dont mind if they give it a better looking graphic but definitely bring back the zing the whole affair brought to the tablekaiden
agreed if not the old effect completely then at least the loud bang and the blinding flash with some lingering aftereffects
signed im all for it
edit to limit confusion with instation personal hangers im renaming the idea to the public storage arrayoriginally proposed by clansworth on 32308 in this threadtldr purpose from other thread1 a method is required to allow non corp entities to rent corporate facilities factorieslabs2 a method is required to allow a more manageable method of permember storage in a pos gscs anchored outside the bubble is hardly manageablepublic storage array starbase structurecapacity 1400000mUFFFDrental units 140 blocks of 10000mUFFFDwhen rented by a character this array operates as a simple container it will appear as my locker when installing a personal si job at the pos to be usedwhen rented by a corporation this array operates as a corp hanger using the roles of the renting corp hanger access x other it will appear as the hanger name when installing a corporate si job at the pos to be usedrental agreements are initiated as follows renter approaches array right click and chooses apply for personal storage or apply for corporate storage window is displayed allowing a quantity of blocks to be chosen price initial value filled in from array defaults set by owner and a comment block notification is sent to owner starbase managers of the new application owner views application and either approves or counter offers once both parties agree on terms the first weeks rent is collected and a recurring bill is set up in accounts payablerecievable and the array begins functioning for the renterif an entity has more than one block rented in the same facility it will display as a single hanger with tabs if corporate of the total available capacityto prevent app spammage the array can have a min standing requirement to even apply if the owner so chooses also normal pos usable by mechanics will still apply thereby limiting to corpallianceeveryone if so desiredoptions for item reconciliationthe concerns seem to mostly be over what happens to my stuff when the owner goes under i have a proposal for this but others may come up with something bettereach block is its own selfcontained secure container so a hanger could theoretically be jettisoned when it becomes a floating secure container owned by the renter and is bumped outside the bubble this jettison can be triggered by either the owner the renter or by destruction of the arrayalong with this proposal i would like an unlocking timer on secure storage added currently secure storage sticks around for 30 days of nonuse where it then disappears i propose that instead of simply disappearing it instead unlocks at 30 days items losing any ownership rights and the unlocked container sticks around for another 30 days before disappearing would not really be a huge increase in space junk with this change as hangers after 30 days would most likely be emptied rather quickly the jetisoned lockers are not reusable items cannot be added to them like loot cans and once emptied disappeararray destruction should also cause a percent chance of item destruction just as normal ship cargo destruction normal initiated jetison does not have this risk a nice way to cleanly evict someone so an array could be unanchoredofflined
renting things in other peoples poss noid rather have it be a small hanger similar to the corp hanger but is owned by only one corp member who can set the rights on itit would use alot less power and cpu compaired to the corp hangerthis would allow larger corps to have seperate hangers for people rather than have them share corp hanger slots at the pos
i think you missed the reason for this change this is proposed as a fix to the inability to properly rent out pos based factories and labs as there is no innout location for the jobs this array would provide that ability guess i should add that to the op
either this or a complete revamp of the pos mechanics 
well incase if you would like to unanchor it with items inside do you have to get it empty of all the stuff left after all previous renters right
one of my goals and reasons to be on this csm is to improve playercsm communication and since i couldnt get in touch with yarr and the evelopedia all the csm related content is currently hosted on my private server hopefully it can get moved in the future thoughall content from csm 1 is now finally integrated and the issue part of the wiki is now complete and up to date minutes are still in the process of being wikifiedyou can now review all old as well as ongoing csm issues see what the csm is currently discussing and nag the csm if your pet issue isnt on the discussion list for the next meeting most of the old issues have a link to the minutes with ccps answers and work is in progress to get the new minutes integrated as wellview the site hereit goes as followsif a csm member wants to raise an issue it goes into the open issues category which means it will get discussed and voted on the next meeting once it has passed the vote it goes in issues in process where it will remain until ccp dealt with it if it fails the vote it goes to rejected issues resolved issues are the ones that ccp has answeredyou can also view who raised what hereplease see if your topic has been raised already before posting new threads just do a search on keywords or view all topics here

ya in eve we can lock an energy shield but not our ships how does that make sense
then you ewarp out difference is if you are pointed when you disconnect you dont dissapear how about we give you a little flag you can set so if you are worried about a gpu overheating pc crashing or your neighbour finaly securing his wifi connection and disconnecting you every downtime ccp replaces all the ships and implants you lost while it was set 100 effective never lose a ship to a discon ever again
then make is so if your shot at any time you recive the 15 min vanish timerthe problem here is that while you have a legitimate problem entire fleets are logging off when they dont like the odds
if you had looked at my idea people who have that kind of problem wouldnt be affected unless it happened within 5 minutes of login as it stands now if you get aggro then disconnect youre stuck for 15 minutes anywaythe fact is that it only protects exploiters and abusers of a bad game mechanic to leave it as it is no viable justification has yet been offered the some people have legit disconnects argument fails because of the rarity of the event coupled with the fact that a legit disconnect already has the 30 second protection in that you vanish utterly unless youve been aggressed
oehw shiney
yeah sureit needs a lot of polishing i just tried to give a basic ideathanks matenot a native speaker wasnt a devblogit was one of the fanfest interviews if im not mistaken they mentioned that there was no sense in seeing a ship in hangar while in avatar form so it wont be implemented
i will support this i would make a alt just to see this
all im asking for is that they move the check for prereqs from when you add the skill to when you go to train it then some slight modification to make it also check the skills that are in the queuemaybe keep the prereq check during the injecting step but when it fails pop up with a warning saying something likeso where will all the extra programming come from 
so this basically hurts who the 00 people i have to go 2 jumps from my home using my t2 shuttle ofcoarse00 guys have to carrierjf skillbooks to them or jumpclone to empire and get stuck there for 24 hours funor you could buy all the skills now inject go off to pew pew delve newbs dont worry about such petty things
definitely supported and ive even proposed elsewhere there is already a check when skill training is started that prereqs are met i have seen it in action if something happens and you lose the prereqs podded without clone or the prereqs change in a patch you cannot continuestart training the skill just remove this check from the inject skill command and all will be fine someone said there would be a bunch of bad effects to this but i really cant see any
would be very nice yes im currently training for caldari ships and having to wait purchasing the cruiser and battleship is annoying jumpcloning around too likewise id love to have all the hybrid specialization books injected as theyre sometimes hard to find
makes sense to me as long as its unobtrusive convenient and its something the server is keeping track of anyways might be some hidden lag bomb associated with it but its certainly worth asking for
the unknown time of jetcan popping is a nice little piece of jeapardy added to some often reasonably tedious aspects of the game a timer would also seem out of place on as aspect which is supposed to be random due the ravages of space etc those with smarts already label cans with the time a timer just seems so unreal
not supportedtoo minor an issue and really only affects lone miners as group miners now have the orca to use so jet cans arent there long enough to worry about the timeas one of the others stated there destroyed by the ravages of space due to being of a flimsy construction this should be variable and is to some extentas far as i know if you dont name your can it will last about an hour if you do name a can it will last 2hrs max but you want to make sure you empty it at least 10 mins b4 that and naming a can doesnt take long to do with the time included and then any fleet m8s hauling can then see your time in the overview andnot have to click on anything
this
jetcans are designed to eject rubbish you dont need to know when they pop because youre not supposed to place items of value in them
whats wrong with a change that only makes life easier for solo miners theyre players too its not a career i do more than a token amount of myself but i have no objection to ccp helping other people too yes and nocxium is supposed to come from miners in lowsec hows that working seriously though jetcans arent for rubbish theyre for things you dont want in your cargo hold right now if you say jettison cap boosters to grab pvp loot you still want them back just later knowing how much later you can get them back is known information and very useful information in some cases it should be easily available
signedat least the option to select which one old or new effect your computer displays please to make everyone happy the visual interference with other effects and constant headache from seeing the darn thing for hours a day kills
firstly it does actually cause a certain degree of nausea at least for me it also makes normal operations significantly more difficult onlining bars and labels distances in posses are very difficult to read and it is in general distracting distractions such as this are the last thing need when trying to concentrate on the task at hand for perhaps hours at a time i can spend up to 5 hourse dealing with our 40 or more silosthe graphic is nice in principle but needs toning down substancially removal of the lightningsparky matrix effect would be a help and perhaps far more transparency on the swirlng effect perhaps there are ways to salvage this which do not require major recoding the old effect was calm certainly although somewhat simplistic as well something in between is needed badly
ya i liked the pos shield before im happy with the new effects i have been sitting in a pos all day because i ran out of ammo while ratting up my sec status and then got booted out of alliance for drama crapnotify you cannot jump through the jump portal because the tower is set to consider you someone who should be attacked on sightoh yaaayya did you see bubbles before then now huge improvementso i dunno if i support or not
confirming this
they stand out way too much right now and it really doesnt fit with the rest of spaceif they tuned down the transparency a lot making them not stick out like a christmas tree but still keep a subtle rippling effect it would still have the eyecandy but look so much bettersupporting this

yes please

i guess that sounds pretty good
check
as it is now you must buy each item you want from an lp store by itself one at a time if you have 100000 lp and youre cashing it in all at once for your next run to a market hub it becomes very tiring buying a specific item 10s and 20s of times i would simply like to see a quantity option where you can specify that you would like to purchase x of one item from the lp store
i was wondering about that when it came to starbase chartersdef supported
simple useful supported
sound idea i had the same problem with crystals supportedisaac
as i understand it the proposal is a keyboard shortcut with the same functionality as the button on screen the buttons already exist on the screen but its more convenient to use the keyboard just the way you can activate modules using the cursor on screen but its more convenient especially when theres a lot of action going on to use the function keysif theres suddenly so much going on on screen that your monitor is having trouble keeping up with your cursor and therefore its hard to get it to the button or navigate contextual menus if youre trying to warp to something thats not in your overview  which is a very realistic possibility when something happens very suddenly that requires you to warp away  a keyboard shortcut is a more efficient and more reliable way of getting the command entered sooner rather than lateri remember from my n00b days wishing that i knew of such a keyboard command in an emergency its reassuring to know that i can hit a particular keystroke and if its possible to warp out i willstill supported
except that the ops proposal required using the mouse as well if youre using the mouse just select it and spam wtz a keyboardonly shortcut would be a worthy addition but if it needs the mouse its inferior to existing functionality
i hope ccp will see that ghost training is a necessity
nope nada and no way pay to play in this case pay to train skills i stand by ccps decision for ghost training isaac
supported but it wont happen  theres too much money in play
look everyone point and laugh at the idiot that postedx o d
new content has been delivered ccp how about fixing the things that actually bug your current customers nowfair play jade constantine for not standing again until some of your issues start getting addressed but the job of the csm i thought was to represent players and if no other candidates are championing the causes of balance you should stay on and make that your platform and goal
this topic will be on the list of discussion next saturday and i think i can touch on some points raised in this thread at the same timeif not then just raise it as a seperate issue
thanks ankh as much as i agree with unfinished content needing to be addressed as well my vote on this thread is more to do with the title than the specifics the op has mentioned and while i agree each needs to be addressed i think there are many many more balance issues that are being ignoredin fairness to ccp i also concede that many parts of the game now are more balanced than ever but why stop there i would even be happy with just a statement from ccp detailing what they will address or consider in the neartm future  the silence is deafening  i mean should i train a falcon alt now or what
we also talked to ccp about their internal processes in regards to balancing things that were prenerfed like blackops i honestly dont know if they really took it seriously or not but i think that they got the point
i agreed with everything but the nighthawk problem i hate that ship and personally i think its powerful enoughstill supporting the 95 of your post that was on the money
the difference is your paying for the privilegehonestly theres no purpose to an alt other than to cause troubleif i had it my way you should be only allowed 1 personalty per accountwould make things a little easier on everyone and honesty would be valued
now theres an idea i can get behind
signed
meta gaming is properly against the eula generally the meta gaming people are doing is illegal in most countries hacking into ventts servers forums accounts etc all illegal in most countriesmeta gaming should not be part of a game since it is something that the game mechanic cant handle and let you take care off hench you will need rl interference to deal with this and wupti again we properly got something illegal going on soo meta gaming bad and should be banneble
didnt even know they did that but this is pretty obviously a exploit and should get a lot of people banned at least in my oppinion anyway sigh
voting nohaving a timer on kicking a corp would allow the directorate to prevent one guy from nuking the alliance theres a post on this  support itthis would really remove the power of leadership in an alliance which is not a good thing makes for a less dynamic game
youre doing it wrong
what exactly are you trying to say hereis this code that belongs in coadstop trying to be clever or whatever and just say what you want to say unless you couldnt think of a reply but you simply had to put something
suspect it was something along the lines of what you meant to say ie as long as their is a goon in the csm the eve community will never get an unbiased representation
sorry no support if you cant trust the people in a position of power dont have them there wow genius if a ceo of an alliance decides this alliance should no longer exist guess what he can do that its lifeeve under current mechanics its working fineisaac
there should be npcgiven medals for certain ingame accomplishmentsaccomplishments would include succesful completion of an epic mission arc completing bonus objectives killing the nidhoggur for example in epic mission arcs getting more than 9995 standing with an npc corporation being the top weekly killer in factional warfare being the top weekly plexer in factional warfarejust to start things offthe alternative would be to make medals grantable to people that are not part of your corp after which i would hand them out to anyone meeting the critera but ccp said that that they arent likely to do that due to people going to grief eachother yeah really pay 10 mil to grief somoene with a medal if you can just mailmessage him makes sense so were not likely to see that happen any time soonso now the request is for npc granted medals shouldnt be hard to implement as they already have the mechanics to award decorations to players built in the fw systemyes i understand that a lot of you consider this vanity but believe it or not there are actually people interested in collecting shiny items a medal in the top of the items requested as reward for completing the epic mission arc for a reason its probably a carebear thingie though but whats wrong with that
care is needed here  your list risks the medals becoming banal annoyances instead of actual trophies equally problematic you risk irritating people in nonmedalled professions who would feel left out if you reward some things and not others it also seems to be begging to be turned into a ccp specialty halfimplemented feature that gets abandoned for the next five years all that said in principle this does have some merit there are some real achievements that npcs would track and reward and the game modeling that seems perfectly reasonable to me ive got a lot of concerns but in principle i support this
i disagree with the ways skills were reorganised however these are fixed in a short time and some things are more difficult with the new system again time helps there some of these things were hit and miss before and not much different nowbut there are also great advantages to the new system and certainly it is somewhat early to propose any drastic changes i certainly need some time to adjust and then perhaps will better see tweaks that are neededits different primarily and as such it means this tool will take time to learn to use effectively indeed i have found completely different objectives in scanning
no way you have to have player skills to play this game thats just stupid aint i right wrong sorry but even the old scanning system was bad the only reason you found people is because they were sitting in one place isaac
i like the appearance of the new probe system and the visualization of how its usedid like to see the ui improved though  remember positions in the same manner as bookmarks so that you can quickly revert to previous setups and so that you can quickly deploy probes in a systemif someone could come up with a bunch of suggestions for a reworking on the probing ui that would be really nice
first off your doing something terribly wrong scanning with 7 probes so i suggest you read dev blog about the new scanning system if you havent and else read it again slowlysecond i dont agree with reverting back to the old scanning system id like to see a change to the currentwith normal core probes you can now find a cosmic anomaly in the first hit without the whole scanning process now of course cosmic signatures take a lot longer as you have to pin them downwhat i suggest is make people easy to probe just like cosmic anomalies with 1 probe and making people in deadspace hard to find by still having to manually triangulate with 4 probes
i support this in a session by session basis dock log change systems you start over but otherwise it should remember what we find
yes agree with this
sounds goodthough why should we have to spawn a site to trigger this shouldnt getting a 100 signal strength be enough 
repeat scans are a headache supported
so what youre saying is that people are stupid and guilds have drama and you propose game mechanic changes to fix this
yes the same reason we have all kinds of other limiting game mechanics
yeptheres so many good things about this its pretty obvious
the only reason members get that cooldown period is because of roles for whatever reason the same doesnt apply for corpsif a corp were to become seriously opposed to the alliance it was a member of overnight something that does happen forcing a 24 hour cool down would give that corp open license to screw over that alliance for 24 hours do you really want people that are ed with you or that youre ed with sharing your standingsalso if that new corp ceo happened to be jason edwards main then i would have done the sameplease stop posting or atleast give some consideration to both sides of what you do propose for once
okay but what does this limit do you still have stupidity it still causes drama you just have the game displaying people who are ed at each other and not really allies as blue for 24 hours what does that solve
no support an alliance should be able to quickly remove a corp if it turns rogue and begins acting against the iterests of the alliance imagine the damage a renegade corp could do during that 24hr period
agreed no support im afraid
you can program all the damn mechanics you wantyou cant fix stupidnot supported
not only is the 24 hr cool down a bad idea but i would support the idea that corps in an alliance should be on a dead mans switch 
new grafic for ew sucks in general it is very hard to see what is going on and what you are hit by without clinsing to the overview and yes bubles have become invisible as good as very annoying
i havent encountered the new effects ingame yet i never thought to try it before but does turning on tactical view define bubbles more clearly
nope
it seems there are 2 different ways to go about graphics1 the artists way  make everything pretty smooth without much care for function2 powergamers way  make graphics follow strict utilitarian model where emphasis is on clarity of functionwhy not have both we could go to eve settings menu and choose what kind of graphics we want to see for the 2nd option it would be enough to take graphics from the castor days
i think ccp went overboard with their new space warp effect putting it in everywhere they could think of jump drive and warp bubble effects need to be changed the first one for bling the 2nd one for sheer practicality
currently there are 2 different rules regarding thisjoining a corp which is at war in order to take someone by surprise and kill them is an exploitrepeatedly jumping to a different corp even with the same name to avoid a war is allowedjoining and leaving an alliance in order to remove war decs is an exploitnow these 3 things seem to be very similar all 3 involve joiningleaving corps in order to enableavoid wars with no delay or warning for the other side i am interested as to exactly why ccp take such different stances on these 3 activities these rules do not even follow a logical goal of risksafety in highsec since 1 and 3 are almost directly contradictoryi would like to hear peoples opinions on this issue and preferably get this issue raised in the next csm meeting i dont mind which rules get changed but i would like to see some consistency in either having corphopping in all forms declared allowable or an exploit
wardecs are a paytogrief system according to ccp so i wouldnt expect any changes to these policies until wardecs in general get a review of sorts
one can be used to avoid wars on a massive scale the other two cant dont really see the confusion herei mean thereotically you could get a massive amount of players to go to a new corp but they can just wardec that one the amount of effort involved versus one person removing the corp from the alliance and joining is massive also changing people from corp to corp doesnt save any pos the corps may have put up leaving an alliance does
theres really people in us that actually check that kind of stuff before purchasing a game oo we have pegi ratings in eu but no one i ever heard of would decide if a game is worth its money by age ratings kids that want to play gta4 will buy gta4 regardless of whats written on the boxand btw eve is totally not a teenfriendly environment the best way to have parents associations beating the crap out of ccp on the media is having low age requirements other way kids will buy the game regardless if they want to and parents wont be able to complain
qft your average 15 year old will neither have the maturity nor intelligence to cope with the game and will more than likely end up just spreading rumours about how terrible eve is after he loses his first ship to pirates the solution isnt to make eve safer or change the game in any way but it is simply to accept that eves target audience is primarily the 18 bracket if the game is marketed as having adult content then the people who buy it will be prepared for a cold harsh world with occasional nudity btw skin  nudity rather than expecting another wowclone with more grind than skill
id like to see a graduated response10 not in my doughnut shop aggressor popped before the first volley lands09  07 concord response time slows down06 concord turns up to pop the aggressor but usually to late to help the victim05 faction navy takes over responds with excessive force but the aggressor might be able to get away once in a while04 navy responds quickly but is about as dangerous as gate sentry guns03  02 size and timeliness of navy response drops off quickly01 navy frigate turns up after a few minutes flees if anyone targets himadd random navy spawns in low sec theyd warp around the gates and stations for a little while attacking people if they had a bad enough security standing but despawn if nothing caught their attentionremove insurance payouts for losses to concord or faction navy if the character is over a month oldoverall this would make high sec slightly less safe and make low sec actually low sec instead of totally unsafe and unsecurable the pirates would hate it of course though i suspect theyd adapt it might be enough to lure more people out of high sec though
as a pirate id like to support the principles behind this post the 10 suggestion is unworkable im sure but the principle is wonderful
if you want to allow carriers in to hisec thats fine with me
if you want to make stupid assed responses thats fine with methis has nothing to do with what ships are allowed in high sec or noti was talking about manufacturing
sup mr vocal minority how are things today
how about we removed the npc goods and make the fuel pellets themselves the new npc good for the one all requirement primary non racial fuel cell needs
i think thats a reasonable suggestion less shopping but you still have to go to the same place to do it on top of that it should be easier to calculate for since its a single item with a set rate of consumption per tower size
i guess that sounds pretty good
so what youre saying is you dont like price competition seriously though your system doesnt work at all first off you suggest 1 isk increments which is ludicrous on things like tritanium also this is where i say something like so youre the guy who keeps making me type in the same old 99 every time i update my orders but thats neither here nor there secondly step back think about this for a second how do you choose where to buy something from irl well theres price product quality theres side benefitscontests free throwins etc theres location and theres the reputation of the seller if youre in jita 44 looking to buy a dcu ii most of those dont exist theres no differences in product quality or location theres no addins of any kind and you dont know who is selling it that leaves price and only price as determinants even without the game mechanic of forcing people to buy from the best offer theres no conceivable reason not to buy from the lowest and save yourself 001 isk your system wont change that instead itll just take price competition out of your hands and put it into someone elses i get that the 001 game is frustrating  i play it myself to some extent and it really is a bit of a pain but you cant really change it not that ccp doesnt want to per se but i dont think its actually possible to improve upon the fundamental mechanics i wish that it was and that i could press a button and have all my orders fill for me whenever i wanted but thats not a market thats just a bad skinner box
it still wont work the way youd like it tolet me give you an exampleyou set up a sell order for something at 1000 isk with minimal price of 900 iska minute after you did that comes a guy and sets up his order for the same thing but sets it asstart price 99999minimum price 89999now what would happen1 your order decreases by one and is now the lowest order2 his order decreases by one and is now the lowestrepeat above 2 steps 50 times and what you getyour order stops at 900 his order stops at 89999 exactly where you started just not at the start price only at the minimum price and you have caused a lot of automated database changes which no one would even notice but it just strain the market hubs morenow the only difference is that you cant change your order for 10 minutes and neither can hebut you can get this without the automatic decreases of the price or you can just block any changes to market orders once theyre set up but then youll get a lot of people cryingthe only place where something like this would work is an almost dead market where there are very few orders but in a place like that you can do it manually anyway
no what i wanted was that you couldnt change the market order at all before the time runs out you set it up for 1month you gotta wait this means you wouldnt have the constant changing of price and staying in the same area etcand i cant see where the flaw in this isyou would get the minimum price any one is prepared to sell for and thats ityou wouldnt have to be hanging around 247 to althor it 1 isk every 5 minutes and you couldnt change it after it was set up and you would have the possibillity to say no to this option so you wouldnt you it and could do everything manually as you are doing now if you prefere thatpersonally i see no reason that this is not in the game already it is just stupid as hell that there isnt something like that
how about you just research the market enough to learn a price that will sell then you set your order to that price and let the others undercut you because you know that they will sell out meaning that your order will then start sellingthe 1 isk games are played the impatient the people who set an order and leave it get more isk because of the higher price they sell for and they dont have to spend time watching the market the only thing that can screw them over is if the price has a drop that it more permanent than the usual isk gameswith max skills you can have up to 301 trade slots either they will be using too many slots to play this game over they enjoy the 001isk game they have spare slots or they need to train up some more skillsor are you trying to tell use that someone can monitor all 301 trade slots to play the 001 isk game while still playing the parts of eve that they enjoy yes this is a slightly modified copypaste response from here but you would know that as you watch threads that you start so why didnt you reply to me over there 
learn to read kid learn to read
not supportedreasons why1 adds complexity too market system and database call ups ie lag so wont meet the need for speed initiative of ccp and most of eve2 theres a skill that allows you to remote manage orders from any where in a region if you have it high enough i do believe3 the whole point of eve is too play the game hence why we dont have automated mining automated fighting automated year long skill queues etcoverall the idea sinks before it can fly theres alot more important changes needed out there for alliance management exploits and poss that are more worthy of the time required by ccp to code and implement them and more people that would benefit by itin rl the stock exchange still requirespeople there to buy and sell its not done by computers so why should eves market be any different
because pvp without mwd isnt possible btw you dont have to support this topic as they already said they will look at cs in general
i dont care much for good ol larkonis he looks like a guy named lrd byron ingame who is a nub
cccccccccccmilitary experts are calling this a win of my vote
as a member of a merc antipirate corp id like to offer my supportpirates make lowsec and now also wspace a fun lively and interesting place to be i may not agree with some of their demands for changes to the game mechanics but i do think its important that theyre properly represented on the csm of course the real question is if the pirates themselves want larkonis as their representative
reading past all the jibber starting at end of first page to last i vote cccccccc ccccccccc cc ccccc
i trust serial killers more than i would trust you
the trust fail runs both ways tbhwhatever he has done to the united im willing to bet that the pilots that count in your corp still view larkonis as a damn fine pirate and leaderits about having the best representative for cp as a whole and not what he has done personally to you and your corp
 thisthe scuffle between united and neos doesnt detract from larks person as a whole at the moment hes looking like one of the if not the strongest candidateif we dont get a decent cp representative in the csm well have to contended with whatever awful plans the bears have got such as boosting sentry guns blah blah blah
i like what i see so far in your manifesto darlin dont tell shigs i called you that he gets so jealous sometimes  youll get my voteand can also have my voice literally for any campaign ads that feature audio if you want to include some feminine persuasion will give your campaign some love on my blog toobreaks out pompoms and warms up her cheering voice
get some lark we behind ya 100 miss ya mynxee 
ccccccccc you have my vote
i would have stood too if id known about that also endorsing the lark 4 csm blog love idea o a pirate for pirates elected by pirates what more could you possibly ask for
lol save your shock for when i get on vent after a few drinks sometimethe inbrainoutmouth filters stop working at about drink 3 sexiness but hes got that too looks like were golden here
you had me at falcon lark100 getting my vote on this and no doubt the consensus of turbo too there just has not been enough representation for those of us who enjoy pvp away from the powerpoint slideshow battles in 00as a corp and a person that i have had the utmost respect for in my time as a blinky and now as a general pvper you share the same views as many of us who actually get to see pvp from a gameplay based side over the requirement to defend ones spacewe are quite frankly tired of getting falconswarmed by opposing fleets when we simply want to bring a fight to them in their current state they do not swing the course of a fight they prevent themenough about my views though expect to see a lot of club bear and trpla voting for you this time and i wish you the best of luckand hai mynxee i have cookies for you 3
ill support you in the voting booth ill shoot you in space
i fuly support larkonis trasslers veiws andor product
100 support from me mate everything you outlined really makes sense and i like your measured tone seems to me youre gonna be brandishing the pillow of balancing rather than the nerf hammer
will tell all of my mostlyinactive carebear corpmates to vote for you d
ccccccccccccccccamidoinitrite
i hadnt put much thought into the csm till you came around a keyword serious canditate to represent the scoundrels pompous is fun and all but im glad cp has a candidate wholl take the job seriouslycouple questionson falconsecm i like the ideas youve expressed so far stacking penalty changing the strength bonus etc would you consider nerfing ecm range falcons should have similar range to other recon ships 4070km skill dependant so that it becomes necessary to fit some sort of gtfomechanism and you cant dedicate every medslot to ecm your thoughtson gate camps i dont think that the system is horribly unbalanced at the moment for gatecampers but id like to see sentry guns only targeting ships and not drones this would allow every class of ship an equal opportunity to camp gates youre talking to a diehard dominix pilot so i might be biased curious to hear your opinion on this
well for the falcon range idea i think you need to keep the range just because gateguns have range of 150km from the gate and if its 4070km it is gonna pop so it will be hard to use for pirating at all
hi there i dont know you as well as id like to but here is one concern of mine im wondering if youll coverim mainly a solo and occasionally very small gang pvper i am in low sec only and been living there for months now for heart pounding fights loose or win doesnt matter as long as the fight is good over the years pvp has gone more and more into blob warfare and ships that will ruin a solosmall gang day ecmyou gotta agree that engaging 1 vs 5 or more and getting a falcon or sometimes even 5 decloaked on you is just booring will you support and maybe try and get something done to encourage more small scale warfare even if you wont support that youll most likely still have my vote since anything for pvpers will most likely benefit me one way or another
yes and there are new and more colorful versions available if you wish to use them although i prefer the alpha version myself
eh id vote lark or tchelli want some cp in my failboat csm
is tchell even still alive ive not seen a post from himherit in over a week
tbh the only thing i dont agree with is your perception that the falcon is too powerful theyve overused yes most likely due to ease of piloting and quickish skill path eg you can fly one semiproficiently if you only have ship and ecm skills they still get torn up like a piece of paper if something thats not jammed looks at them and with the new scanning changes falcons that are sitting out post 150km are able to be killed even more easilyother then that your ideas seem good and most importantly are reasonable
i wont dispute that falcons are easily killed they are not powerful on their own but they are the death knell for solo players and small gangs 24 players who are unable to dedicate ships for anti falcon work unless they bring their own anti falcon falcon in which case it boils down to who can jam who firstby nerfing the falcon boosting the scorp and changing the jamming mechanics so that if you warpcloakexplode players are left with a choice do you want the durabilitypower of the scorp or the mobilitystealthyness of the falcon
larkonis trassler official cp delegate nominee there fixed my fix of your topic subject captain pompous iz a lozer
lark for that csm thingnow wheres my check
youll have my votes larki agree with you regarding the response time of gms for petitions some petitions naturally take longer to research and reach a conclusion onthis is an inescapable fact of life ive submitted only a handful in the two years ive been playing all were dealt with in a timely fashion even if the outcome of some was not what id hoped your ideas on falcons are food for thought your blog mentions not wanting to cripple them like a racehorse headed for the glue factory i agree with this what wins horse races often times is not one horses superior abilities but rather skillful positioning and tactics by smart jockeyseven those mounted on the less capable horses rather than nerfing the falcon itself i think id prefer to see one or two countermeasures to that ship boosted while perhaps more complicated to implement that approach seems to offer more choices and flexibility for more pilots but im no expert on these matterswhen a hostile falcon uncloaks i usually start looking for the outgate if im not pointed alreadyamong the other topics in your manifesto the ones im particularly looking forward to discussion on are low sec boosts to attract more people there and expanding the war dec mechanic
pomp is a clown he has no manifesto and no direction whilst it was funny for a while the constant forum spamming with very little else got very tiring pomp isnt this persons main character either not a great start for a csm candidatelark on the other hand has already published his views for all to see  clearly and precisely hes put forward some good suggestions and is willing to listen and take into account additions and amendmentslark has my vote thisto be a half decent ecm pilot takes a bit of doing and its not always easy and they do get torn to bits quite frequently before hitting anything with the nerf stick well maybe a bit like reducing the ship bonus slightly lets give pilots their own way to counter using tactics and intelligencethere are ways to counter ecm now quite successfully with the right tactics lets give people the tools to do it rather than handing it to them on a plate  imo anywayi know the falcon is a hot potato but lets not make it the sole focus as there are plenty more important things out there first
this fellow seems topnotch
please be sure to include the rook in these plans it once was a great ship and deserves a niche
any reduction in the falcons jamming strength will be a boost to the rook by default
you forgot sporty aswell like sporty spice from the spice girls shehe said you know the one who suffered from depression coz she was so ugly
doublepostduken 
all hale the mighty doublepostduken
you guys have nothing better to do than post in a silly thread about me guess i will have to post a picture of myself to make you all shut up after all
what is this irony you speak ofcan it get my shirts ultra creasefree
dont wink at us you lecherous backhoe
confirming takes deep breathyoure most likely a male doing a great job of trollingif youre a female you are incredibly defensive which indicates low self esteemyou make alot of hypocritical assumptions including the idea that since someone doesnt believe youre a hot girl they must be ugly and undesirablethere are a handful of average to above average looking women that play eve as well as other video games and they typically carry themselves better than youif you want to keep this troll going you should invite people to a public ts to hear your voice and then have your sistergirlfriendmom do the talking would be epic people would actually belive youre a selfloathing loose woman in california oh and when you post that pic make sure its a pictureinmirror or somethign thats not obviously from a magazine might take a while to google a good one though910 for a good troll 1010 for successfully picking it back up after you dropped it in a previous thread
i am just going to let this thread die not worth it to keep talkwing with you guys think what you will of me i know what i am and specifically what you guys are edit if i do ever decide to post a pic it will be me holding a sign saying tara wilde eve online i think that would be good enough proof yes
sigh you still talkingis this like the third time you said this thread would die you keep promising me these things but it just keeps goingim dissapointed
i didnt start this thread im not the one trying to troll me so shut up and blame yourselves
i think you are i think you did i blame you for alll of the fail in cp plus starvation in third world countries for the sake of the children stop eating
the sign thing doesnt really work in most cases its very easy to photoshop a sign to say various things perhaps if you held up your name spelled in i dunno legos or something maybe some scrapmetal art you know something that a 10 year old with photoshop couldnt duplicate
ahhhhh spend the hole day out in town with my m8 enjoying the lovely weather  nicefind out i got a new web project coming up for a nice sum of money  greatcoming home to find this thread still lives in all its glory  priceless heres the deal chubachunk you could post this wonderful sexy lovely photo of yourself and its real and your super hot who cares  what you have gone around saying the threads you have tried to highjack begging for attention and generally acting like a  and claiming ur a hawt female who was hopeing to find love on eve and your capaign of super trolling will still standi asure you im not shy round women and never have been and in all my life and all the female m8partners etc i have known the hot ones with personality think there ugly and are insecure the desperate mingers however always think there hot and like to go out every weekend cramed into there mini skirts and boob tubes leeching on drunks when there judgments impared and thinking they are the do you know the pyscological damage you people cuase when we have flashbacks

 so fat she deepfries her toothpaste
 do you support espionage do you support scamming what is your stance on the 24hour delay on most alliance and corporation actions milk or lemon
lemon
as larks official spokesmen until he finds out i will answer these questionsyesyesits despicable is what it ispie
im not larkonis but i feel i know him well enough to answer this and any other personal questions you may have on his behalf the answers are yes no yes and yes in no particular order
 yes like to spy on supermarket checkout girls secretly applying lipgloss when they think no one is looking yes ripping off grannies and the unemployed is awesome bad thing let them rip i like the milk of a lemon
yes via all means and mediums i was drawn to eve after reading about the great ghsc heist in a pc magazine i was most interested in a game where such dastardly acts were possible eve mirrors real life more than most mmos and certainly allows one to observe and explore the human conditionpeople complain about so called meta gaming spying by means of ts and forums however using these means as a corp is in itself meta gaming ccp provides tools for you to coordinate your corp via corp mail and eve voice though these arent the most efficient methods to do business especially when running a large corp or alliance they are there and slightly more secure than out of game alternatives even if out of game utilities were not used i am certain there would be complaints about eve voice spies and corp mail leaksyes while i do not have the time or patience for it myself and my personal code of ethics would prohibit me from taking part in such activity though every man has his price i do wholeheartedly support this i believe it was a goon who statedif you have more isk than braincells well equalize that eve is a game where you must have your wits about you at all times if something is too good to be true then it probably is most people learn this early on either through their own actions or for those lucky few reading these fine pages and learning about them through the victims or confidence men themselves those that dont learn these lessons early on well the bigger you are the harder you fallunfortunately many of us are unable to live in eve 237 or more recently 2257 see i made a funny insta wardecs insta alliance join and leave to shed said wardec insta kicking of corp members etc etc would be detrimental to the game and would probably open up a whole can of worms for real hardcore griefing of the non constructive varietylemon my diet has plenty of calcium in it from grinding the bones of my enemies to dust and making a hearty porridge from it the vitamin c contained in lemons helps to ward off scurvy and keep my immune system in check so i can fight off anti pirates carebears and aids
i need those lemons me hacks up a lung
with hybrid ammunition the ccp team stuck to elements lead tungsten uranium etc etc and picked good elements for the ammunitions rolls then you get to antimatter and it just doesnt flow with the rest of the ammunition in its class i suggest the name be changed to arsenic metalloid atomic number 33 its a very toxic and deadly element and would fill in the slot well antimatter  low range high damagenot something thats really important but for me personally it makes the experience of the game flow a little bit betterrespond with your thoughts please
im pretty sure that the age thing wasnt referring to the nda
you are right it had nothing to do with the nda
but boozterz make me shoot so much harder i know itz againzt the law in empire but hey everybody doze it from time to time by the way here iz a stuck z key zzzzzzzzz thiz iz a working z and s key in alternation zszszszs or szszsz all done while on boozterz and blazting away at a target with my lazerz pleaze by all meanz dont use drugz and fly we wouldnt want you actually hurting a fly
a its not 2 or 3 mil its 5376000 with all at 5b saying they should be removed is silly i like 10 to all of my attributes and everyone can train them so its no advantage i just bought the game first what mmo do you know of where the older player doesnt at least have the chance for an advantagec stop whining and train your learning skills
im doing my learning skills now pretty dull i think i should log for a couple of weeks its pretty unrewarding easy answersleave learning skills in give them another property that would be of pew pew use to a new player it doesnt have to be significant but enough so that my immediate eve future isnt wow if i spend 30 days doing this it will only take me 40 days to get into that ship i wantkill learning skills reimburse older players for their time by applying a training bonus good for the next x skill points where x is equal to the number of skill points that said older player has tied up in learning skills edit i should qualify that theres nothing totally wrong that i can see thus far its just kind of road blocky i was having a good time leveling into new ships learning how 1 skill going up by 1 level can drastically improve some aspect of my shipnow i have to take a big break from that fun to do this im not whining it just is kind of a buzz kill
why csm and not direct democracyostensibly giving every account a vote is dangerous because 1 the majority of players dont really have the knowledge and experience to make informed decisions 2 people with multiple accounts can have undue influence on issues pertaining to their own interestsfor example in the real world if you give people direct democracy they will vote themselves more benefits and entitlements because the poor always outnumber the rich why steal from your neighbor when you can vote to redistribute his wealthin eve if you have a poll  should highsec piracy be nerfed 100000 carebears will vote yes 1000 pirates will vote nobut if you refer that question to csm even the most carebear pacifist nonaggressive csm player will generally study the issue and say hmmm i dunno highsec shouldnt be 100 safe lets nerf hisec piracy just a little bit but not too muchthe 100000 carebears are happy that their rep stood up for them the pirates are happy because the more bloodthirsty csms voted not to nerf hisec piracy ccp is happy because they didnt have to put in any manhours and everyone goes home warm and fuzzynewsweek writes an article about online space democracy or some such tripe eve gets free publicity more players more hardware more more morethats pretty much the goal of the csm project imo
im a n00b this is my first post on the forums just as an observation i would have absolutely no idea who or what the csm is and does if it werent for the fact that i read the forums and occasionally read massively or something i dont even think ive even heard of its existence in game maybe it gets referenced at the log on screen or something in that random babble of news that has nothing to do with me now again this may already exist but im a n00b so i have no ideawhy not have a localized csm rep or something ya knowtell n00bs that if they need a little more personalized nonrookie chat help see your regional csm alderman or something give the guy a bank account so that he can help them out a bit and he can go ahead and encourage at least some political involvement it obviously wont do jack for the older crop of players but at least might guarantee that newer players areat the very least  tangentially aware of csms formfunction but im a n00b so i could be totally mistaken
i would like to see missile speed increased a little mostly because missile boats are ineffective in sniper fleets it should not take 20 seconds for your missile to hit thats just to long to be balanced with the current dps of turret based ships max time to target should be 510 seconds max at range turrets rarely miss and get instant damage why must missile users wait for their damage to be appliedalso please take a look at stealth bombers they need some love

fully agree with a kennystarted topic the old effects were awesome the new effects are complete and utter crap free stucks
agreeing old effect was significantly better the new effect is a step up for gate jumps but a step down for cynos
signed new one is underwhelming
looks like a dingle hitting the water very unbecoming of the noble capital ship
signed the new animation is totally bad
i dont really miss the old effect as much as i miss the really thundering boomy sound that played always enjoyed the minor earthquake my sound system provided when a bunch of people bridge or cynoed into a system
c
bring back shock and awe
agreed completely old jump animation was way better
lets get the old graphic back
this new cyno effect makes the 4chan favorite shoop da woop laser look like a god sendplease make it better looking then what it is now or the lack their of
white noise posting to signal my agreement with the op
do it
while i question how much experience any kenny pilot has had seeing cyno animations since the patch came out i have to agree it is silly
not only that but im being forced to agree with bfm signed
i generally hate pubbie  like this but yeah im gonna go ahead and sign nothing at all epic about the jump animations now
leave gate effect change bridge cyno effect bring back the funnel
check
bring this idea back to ccp and dont accept no for a answer
i just wish we could build what the lowly npcs can currently build in deadspace large complexes with cargo platforms shipyards everything interconnected in a more realistic way
i like the idea but maybe should wait to see what ccp does with pos revamp
if you didnt know op they have this ingame alreadycorporatehangararraypos settingscorporations andor alliance requires trust you thusly can do it that waythough being able to select a specific member who can take from the corp hangar would be good
anything that provides me with a way to offer personal storage at a tower gets my support having to drop containers everywhere is sad sad sad it wouldnt be so bad if i could open containers inside of a corp hangar array but well yeah
trust me i am fully aware of the current pos mechanics i stated two reasonings for my proposal at the beginning of my post of which the current cha regardless of how it is set up does not fulfill the ability for out of corp memberscorps to store items at a pos primarily for the use of publicly available si facilities is my primary reason for this change the added benefit of the way this is implemented is that it also would allow for personal storage for corp members or even noncorp members if so desired which has been requested in great numbers with high frequency in game and in the forums
this seems like a useful module to add supported
jason try reading before responding okgood idea only 1 question what of pos shields seems a bit of a security risk in some aspectsother than that supported
liking and agreeing with the last 5 or 6 posts and giving this a bump to the topivory
none of those bonus changes really would make any difference motherships have a role they just arent very good at it because of the poor implementation of clone vatsthe role of the mothership is to act as a forward base of operations allowing the fleet to resupply it has a large sma and cha for this purpose maybe the sma could stand to be a bit larger but as it stands it can hold 4 replacement bs the main problem is the clone vat bay can not effectively allow podded pilots to return to the field this is because of 3 flaws1 can not be used to hold medical clones2 the 24 hour jump clone timer3 can not jump from the vatfixing these issues and possibly doubling the sma size to 5 million m3 would allow motherships to fulfill their intended role and be useful allow death clones to be set to the mothership allow jump clones to jump from the mothership and bypass the 24 hour timer  set it just dont check it when jumping tofrom the ms 
arguing the status quo is fine because most serious discussion occurs on a non ccpadministrated forum is a pretty poor argumentccp markets eve as a political game and clash of vast space empires if it becomes impossible to follow the process of that game on the official forums then the time has come to clean up those forums and ensure they are fit for purpose that is precisely what the proposal in this thread is designed to achieve and i hope that somebody on the csm will have the courage to bring the matter up before the council
you wrong boy
support for 2 warning bans then permaban

it would be great if the effect for pos shields was slowed down a lot in its current form it makes me motion sick
signed put the old model back
definitely signedi logged on after m10 and found all my pos had been turned into a cheesy disco and sadly i spend all too much time dealing with posnot only is it nausea inducing it is far less practical to work in as others have noted for instance it is now much harder to read how much time is left to online a silo or whatever i actually have to swing the camera around now so the countdown timer has my dark brown transport behind it else it is unreadabletruly this is a step backwards the old graphics were subtle and elegant and functional this 70s inyourface disco thing needs to go

that thread of mine was not filled with opinions i provided hard numbers and plenty of evidence to illustrate that the nighthawk does have a powergrid problem i understand that your personal opinion is that you hate the ship however the numbers are there fact trumps opinionthanksps support forgot to do so in the op
part of the problem is that ccp doesnt have anyone who is good at understanding game balance  as evident from their mega nerfs and patches maybe tomb could do it tho if they brought him back
i have been in eve awhile and i wonder if ccp has some hard and fast rule that they simply do not mess with balance issues till some time a year has passed there have been many instances where players identified an obvious problem and are even all in agreement that the problem needs to be addressed albeit they may disagree on what the actual fix should entail once upon a time it was amarr and went on for well over a year black ops are another everyone is in agreement needs some love despite all this ccp seems to simply refuse to move at anything other than a snails pace on these thingspartly i can understand that it would be bad for ccp to be in a reactionary mode jumping at every little tweak players cry about there is value in letting things play out a bit and see how it all settles before making a change i also understand that they have a lot of things on their plate new content is great and necessary to keep the game fresh and attract new players all of that said though some of these issues seem to be on the back burner for far too long
ccp has long emphasized adding new features over improving old ones which is fine as far as it goes but they push it way too far so far as im concerned the two most important things ccp could do to improve the game are a usermoddable ui and a complete overhaul of possov mechanics neither of which is a new feature a bit further down the list are such things as assorted balance issuesmost notably lowsec a complete remaking of the various gamesupport featuresforums mail browser etc a rejig of corporatealliance role structures cleaning up the default ui for things like science and corp managementas well as the game generally bringing in a sensible bounty hunting system rearranging mineral sources to make mining more useful visavis missioning and of course fixing teh lagz none of those are new features yes new features are good and often add a lot to the game  wormholes for example were a genuinely great addition to eve yes its far easier to market the game on the basis of shiny new stuff than it is on the basis of look we dont suck any more i understand that there are good reasons for doing it the way that they have in the past that said its bad for the game balance problems are created intentionally and then ignored for years  see bombs and black ops  and that just serves to sabotage the new content and ccps reputation a halfimplemented feature is often worse than no feature because it destroys the incentive to add it in properly makes people dislike and distrust ccp and doesnt actually add much of anything to the game the whole approach here needs to change
well the fact is i watched nighthawks wipe the floor with most ships during the alliance tournament and they are becoming very popular because of their effectiveness in wormhole spacemy opinion is that all the issues you listed are major and should recieve attention right away the percieved failings of one command ship arent quite up to par with lowsec interests in the grander scheme of things just my two centshowever again i think this issue of response times is worth seeing the light of day and im glad to bump it again p
totally agree it is just not right that it takes them years to actually correct very importent balance problemsjust to say a few missilesamarrhow long time can it take i mean it is a whole race and a whole weapon system which needed fixing why did this take years before addressed and really it still have some major imbalances rockets amarr stillso yer full support
just a side note tournament pvp is not representative of actual game pvp tournament has specific rules and objectives that arent enforced in actual gamefor example in one of the tournaments stealth bomber gangs were completely dominating yet in actual game they are terribly inefficient and hardly ever usedand i sure hope that ccp people are at least smart enough to understand that
bingo

this most of all
we need a choice in what graphics client to use this new graphics on low settings are a eye strain and causing me headaches my game play has dropped alot and the game is getting less and less playable i run dual montiors with 2 accounts and with the latest patch the game now lags the graphics are just way to much i am 5050 with this patch i do agree that alot of the graphics they added are nice but unneeded i have been playing this game since 2005 with both toons the lag was never a real issue and i could play forever eve is not wow and shouldnt be turned in a polish new shiny toy bring back the old dirty eve that made a name for itself please do not follow blizzard and copy their ways stick with what made eve eve bring back the old graphics and allow the player to chose whats best for their machine and their game play
this is mainly for the pveers so pvpers you will have no interest in this and should skib it okey so here is why i think there is a need for more high end lp rewardspve in pve missions primary there isnt really many things for the mission runner himself too use most of the stuff simply isnt worth for him to equip so mission runners just buy too sell i think it would be extremely nice to have some high end lp stuff that you could work towards getting with your lpso i propose some new state issue mods quite like we have now with navy just with state instead for those of you not familiar with the state issue ships take a look at em they are a lot better than the navy issuesthese mods should cost in the range of 500k2500k lp  some specific tagscertificates that you would get by completing some missions they should be around as good as the second best officer mods of their kind but not the same maybe higher req for cpupgrid and they should have full lvl 5 skill req too use so a state issue cruise launcher would require cruise launchercruise specializes 5 support missile skills all at lvl 5 again a thing that would make sure that they would not take over the officer mods functionthe req etc is just as a fast thought i just want to see something i can you those lp on for myself actually i wouldnt mind some kind of binding certificate thing for these modules if it was to force people to earn them themselves if it waspersonally i would love to have something to look forward to use my lp on dwhat do you pveers think yes primary the pveers and the pvpers not really interested in the pvpers since modules too 15bill a piece isnt something you would fit on a pvp ship in most casesif this is something that could be of interest i will start to make a short list of how this could look in stats or if some one good with numbers want too they are more then welcome 
i think the loyalty point stores are kind of shabby and there arent much uses for a lot of the high end dogtags either so you have a pointhowever id like to see some discussion first before id advocate it
personally i see the problem just by looking at the navy stuff that is there if you look at the stats compared to the normal t2 maxed skills the increase in dpstank etc is soo little that most mission runners will not be bothered with it and much rather just sell to buy some officer mods insteadit would be nice too see mission runners actually using some of the stuff they can get from the lp stores and some very high end hard too get items that you could work towards as a pveer that dont want to go into 00 to try to farm a faction spawn although not to break the balance and make any alliance in 00 cry make the items very high skill requirements so there will still be a high demand for those officer if you are not a very dedicated mission runner pverer
so what youre saying is you want achievements

i use probes extensively and while it takes more effort and im guessing the op is alergic to effort hence this thread its more rewarding and more of a profession now things dont get better if they get easiernot supported
i disagree the previous system of probing someone in seconds was complete bs and was one of the reasons 00 and lowsec got emptied of smaller groups and solo playersthe system before it when probing was some kind of arcane art and people left ships in space for months wasnt the greatest either but probing should take at least a couple of minutes a safespot should be reasonably safe and i think this new system is a good compromise because it relies on player experience and skill rather then chance
the new probing system takes skill  player skill i like it backwards changes are bad
it takes far too long and is far to annoying  false hits cant identify target until youre on it  to be practically useful ships need to be treated more like anomalies are where you can easily get an accurate hit with just one probe and identify what it is right away

to my knowledge lasers have always had different colors depending on the type of crystal being used i like it personally if nothing else it lets you know what kind of crystal is being used and it adds some visual variety

falconsrooks dont have an alternate ewar method i feel that nerfing their range in addition to what ive suggested would cripple them somewhat unlike rapierspilgrimsarazus they cant really add anything extra to the gang by moving in from long range to closemedium range either in terms of additional dps negligable at best from the caldari recons or secondary ewarwhile on several occassions while on the gate in a smaller ship i have found it useful to launch my drones as chaff i would like to see sentries agress ships only drones are expensive after all
i share your pain my suggested ecm changes are located here you cant really encourage small scale combat without introducing instanced or size related fw battlegrounds which really go against the grain its human nature most people will be out to win with minimal loss if that means hotdropping a ratting drake with twelve carriers then so be it theres very little you can do about the game mechanics its more of an issue with player attitudes ive blobbed and ganked and been unhappy when ive gone out solo and been blobbed and ganked its just a matter of finding people with a similar attitude few and far between
hi i like small encounterslets make love in space
moved to jita park corner
i would also vote for you  if you think you have the time
i shall vote for you
why was this moved
there are currently 7 proposals for changes to the falcon or the way it operatesthe mechanics that affect it in your earlier reply  thats quite a lot for one sitting wouldnt it be better to implement some of those with a view to others in the future without some trial and error on some of the changes we could indeed end up with a horribly gimped shipsmall balanced changes are the way forward unlike some of the knee jerk nerfhammers that ccp have previously dropped on us in the pastas for the falcon ganksquad theres nothing that can be done about that because players will fly what they want to fly as you said in a post earlier or on another thread you go out with the intention of maximum damage for minimum loss example hot dropping a drake with carriers  excessive but funny example  sure ganking a mega with 5 falcons and a few frigs is a valid tactic albeit slightly sucky  but it has the same resultmost of the tactics employed by falcon pilots are for survivability  we all know its tinfoil thin and falls apart when you scowl at it too many tweaks at once could render it unsuitable for its taskim not saying this is all bad stuff or lambasting  your proposals on the manifest are great and i think these are areas which do need to be looked it and have been neglected in comparison with other proposals raised though the falcon does seem to come off worst and under the most scrutiny you already have my vote  just playing devils advocate here
i was just throwing some suggestions out there and i wasnt referring solely to the falcon but ecm boats in general and by no means can they all be considered nerfs i want to boost the scorp for exampleas someone who spends a lot of time working solo or in small gangs and flying a falcon myself when i can put up with the mind numbing boringness of it i find it a constant source of frustration running across what looks like a good fight and having a falcon or five decloak on me or my gang as i said its human nature and people will try and win at all costs but use of ecm boats on the current scale really burns my man nipples i remember a time when damps were the ewar of choice for smallmedium gangs with a skilled arazu pilot able to lock down 2 bs to sub 10k locking range and lollerific lock speed damps recieved a real kick in the balls i dont want to see the same happen to ecm i still want to see falcons have a role in gangs but i dont want them to be the must have ship that they are now much like arazus used to be
nice the cp csm candidates are getting better first pompous who started off funny but became rather dull after hundreds of spam posts by him and his followers then tchell taking a much more professional approach and now larkonis who even has a campaign programthat manifesto looks good to me if you add boost stealth bombers to finally get a role besides reprocessing it will be perfect
how nice i have indeed a manifesto though not a formalised one yet  i might suggest looking at page 7 or so of the thread from cp that was moved here to give you some inkling of what i intend to do does it really matter who cares i can gladly do without your vote lol

does this mean mitnal has talked her in to running
i am honored i guess ccp sees me as a worthwhile addition to the playerbase i am not sure if i want to run but seeing this thread moved to the official forum makes me consider it althogh i will not run as a representative of the crime  punioshment section of the forums i do have some ideas regarding eve which i would like to representif i do decide to run i would raise the following issues1 space cleaning i see a lot of cans with 1 unit of gun ammunition or other assorted stuff with no value in local in front of stations like in amarr i got recently killed because they bothered me so much i tried to take them and dispose them so my guess is that these cans are intentionlly put in front so people can shoot takers this i definitely want to change stuff in cans has to be worth something before the game allows you to shoot the taker i think 2 million isk or so would be good2 mining i mine a lot this is how i make my money in eve and one of the things bothering me is that you have to mine into a cargo container then pick up your mined ore with a ship which has a big cargo bay this cargo can is vulnerable to stealing i think a computer shuttle or transport service from a station would be good you pay a certain amount of mined ore maybe 3 and a computer transporter comes regularly and picks it up for you so you have no need to switch ships and are not so vulnerable to thieves anymorei have some more issues which i might raise if i do decide to run after all
you are lame and do not represent see and pee in its entirety so i think you should not run imo
i dont know why im bothering since youre probably just trolling but if all this is serious you should probably read more and post less at least until you get a better feel for whats going on as harsh as that sounds i very sincerely mean it in the most helpful sort of way assuming youre serious im sure there are people around here kind enough to help a new player learn the ropes eve is full of good people willing to give advice or spend some of their time explaining things to someone who wants to learn if youre just trolling for laughs you fail at life go out and meet some girls or somehtingedit i think mitnal just has a good sense of humor were not laughing with you were laughing abut we really could be laughing with you youre just failing at being clueless right now or youre a bad troll shrug
increase the slot limit up to 6 in an ideal world i would like to see the privateer wardec nerf reversed privateers was a blast and no real threat those it targeted if they kept their wits about them i would like to see ccp and gms do more to tackle corp hopping but at the same time introduce a surrender mechanic with terms dictated by the deccing corp obviously measures would have to be put in place to prevent mass extortion by ransoming a corp then all hopping to a new one and redeccing although heartily lolzworthy it would probably do more harm than goodi think its all looking pretty good at the moment the pirate faction ships except sanshas particularly frigscruisers could do with a bit of love dramiel and daredevil spring immeadiately to mind yes theyre niche ships but thats no excuse for giving them rubbish turretmissile layouts and anaemic grid and cpumore better quality resources give people things to fight over and they will come mining in lowsec is currently economic and literal suicide you can make more money mining veld in high sec than any lowsec ores and most people know this hence you seldom see well organized mining ops in lowsec the market is player driven and nothing can change that however id like to see a nerf to generic t1 junk dropped from missionbelt rats and perhaps a nerf to the mid end minerals refined from drone alloys a move of higher quality level four agents from high sec and perhaps the more profitable missions would be of benefit not just in terms of increased rewards for those running them should they move to lowsec but it will increase player interaction there are a couple of lowsec mission hubs where the residents make it very difficult for the solosmall gang pirate make it very hard to kill mission runners if you give people a firm push into the more dangerous parts of space much like a loving bird matriarch pushing its young out of the nest they will either spread their wings and fly soaring to new heights or spastically flap their arms plumetting under the influence of the gravity of their situation to their doom i find putting people out of their comfort zone forces them to adapt and find ways to excel coming out of it better off than before too many carebears are risk averse either due to a bad experience as a noob or unwillingness to jump in the deep endthrowing a few additional r32 and r16 moons into lowsec would help out tooi do love fish however recent health warnings regarding the levels of mercury in oily fish have forced me to cut back and i cant say no to a good bit of roast topside or a rare fillet steak
larkonis on the subject of a wardec surrender clause i propose the followingsurrender conditions are set by the wardeccing corp in a manner similar to a freeform contract where they can ask for anything they want and if the victim corp accepts and pays the fee then the war is over and they are not allowed to redec for xyz number of days it would be specificed in the terms of surrenderthe way to avoid corphopping would be to have every character who is a member of the aggressor corporation unable to join a corporation or alliance which is at war with the victim corporation until the number of days specified in the surrender clause is up to avoid them joining a corp and then that corp declaring war a corp would not be able to declare war if it had a single member who was bound by terms of surrender not to attack the given corpthat would 100 stop griefing and i cannot think of any exploits but obviously i just thought of it so it is not ironclad
moved to jita park corner
i would also agree that the dramiel and daredevil could use some love but mostly because i think they are beautifully designed ships that really should have more real ingame useas an additional boost to lowsec and a way of actually using the high trit prices as an incentive i would like to see a revisit of illicit mining crystals make them work only for the cruder ores highsec ores mostly with diminishing returns as the ore quality increases they are only usable in lownullsec but provide decent yield bonuses to lowend ores this would do a few things it would make it a bit easier to justify mining lowends in 00 instead of compressionimporting it would provide an increase in trit to the market stabilizing a bit and actually lowering highsec mining productivity it would also bring lowsec income up a bit to be more in line with the risk
 or ass
larkonisas far as i am aware all of lowsec has similar security measures gates and stations have the same amount of turrets no matter if youre fighting in a 01 or 04 system this make lowsec space bland in my opinion do you agree that lowsec space should be more diversified securitywiseeg when aggressing on a 01 gate youd have to tank less turret dps than when aggressing on a 04 gate
i agree with this proposal
i am voting for thiz guycaptain pompous

i like learning skills please add more i want rank 8 learning skills
this whole discussion is too funny its simple l1 learning skills to level 4 and l3 learning skills to level 3 takes 5 days with the added skill training speed its not like you have to train anything in this game that you dont want to if you want to mission or mine train the skills firstits not hazing a test etc its your option to train those skills when you choose to i just started training the l3 learning skills to level 5 on a 50m sp characterill tell you flat out if you are not patient enough to wait 5 days to train up learning skills to 43 then this probably isnt the game for youoh and by the way the new attribute remap more than makes up for any skill point training deficiency that you might have as long as you train a select set of skill ie just spaceship skillsi thought i was in the caod for a minute while reading this thread
learning skills serve a purpose not all have the patiencetime to get advanced level 5s while others do them  and in the long run have it pay off its an investment they do just like some train certain skills to level 5 to get a minimal benefit over others that train level 4 skillsin that sense the learning skills makes perfect sense you can compare that to why almost every combat pilot in the game has all shipweapontank skills to 4 while some oldermore hardcore has got allmost to level 5 the benefit of armor comps or t2 gunnery skills at lv5 vs a lv4 is minmal still theres players doing it just like some do adv learning 5s
the only reason some people have an issue with learning skills is that the majority of human beings have mutiple ocds i cant figure out why people lose sleep at night because something they do in a game isnt optimized to 100 efficiency lets give  5 implants for rewards on lvl 1 missions while were at it sheesh
i believe the csm thing has its use unfortunately its use lies more in the ccp transparency than in player involvement in game development it was after all mostly hatched as a way to garner trust from the player base after a few scandals i believe in that it works as was evident with the recent pos moon mins fiasco i dont think there would have been as thorough an investigationreport made public if the csm hadnt been in effectthat being said i do think there will be quite the decline in csm candidates as time goes on more because of rl issues than because of anything on ccps part i for one would love to be on the csm but im pretty sure it wouldnt work for me in rl im sure im not the only oldtimer in this situation
might it not be possible to launch the drones from the cargo hold in an abandoned state then scoop them to your drone bay after which you can then launch as normal this has the effect of being limited by the jettison timer you also run the risk of losing the drones to someone else who was faster
i think your idea is best i was thinking along the same linesnot overly punishing to the person doing it but still involves some risk
i think we had a similar thread to this one 2 weeks ago but signed anyways
yes
you cant see the diffrence  buy a new monitor for anyone with a better screen than a 14 cathode ray tube there is no such problem
this end the torment for the love of god
oh please god for the love of all thats holy change the font op forgot to add d to the confusion betweeh 0 and oits you isnt it you designed the current font 
yes

i respectfully disagree theyve sat in shields quite often as our capfleet cynoed in on top of them and blew up the pos they were hiding in then cynoed on to the next system surely they could tell the difference before and after the 10thsigned
this isnt caodbut in the spirit and all didnt i doomsday your fleet yesterday and oh look our dreadswell well well
yes
this seems much more inline with the look and feel of eve than the pos system that we have now
cmon do it already ccp p
resurrecting this dusty old topic for the next round of csms to accomplish nothing with all the old arguments are still the same
i think that would be of relatively limited risk what does someone gain from obtaining a pos password in highsec no cap ships parked openly inside if you were going to offer your services to the general public its a risk you would have to take i still feel the prices you could get from especially lab slots would well be worth any slight isk youd have of letting people in
yes please
edit fixed closing bracket of quotethank you for that wiki been reading it the last hour two humble concernsa some issues categorizied as rejected seem to have been rejected by ccp not by the csm eg dynamic agent quality was turned down by ccp in session 12 or was this particular issue a resubmit and has thus been turned down by the csm for being turned down by ccp before anyways the categorization doesnt seem natural to anyone not very familiar to the mechanics of the csm and ccpcsm processes first of all the ordering on the wiki pageisnt the order of how things are done rejected should be above in process having rejected beneath resolved implies rejected having been rejected by ccpwhich brings me to second resolved should be subcategorized into maybe taken into by ccp high on prioritylistalready worked on taken into by ccp but put on backlog rejected by ccp these infos are ofc in the minutes but having them on the front pagewith the issue list would make accessing that info alot easier and thus could help reduce re and reresubmissions of issuesb in light of this easier information access i would like to see the csmvotes on csmrejected issues shown as they are shown on the resolved issues thus i could base my next vote not only on who brought an issue up to ccp but also on who prevented an issue that i might care for or might dare to be brought up i could then check my own judgement of that issue against the judgement of my representatives and determine who is mostleast in line with my train of thought again this info is already in the csmminutes but not as easily accessible i realize that the wiki is work in progress so take the above as humble proposals and keep up the good work  ahro
1fixing an entire class of obsolete weapons and ships should be priority
cruise missiles are completly useless if there is a lag in fleet fight they even need much more time to reach the target like 1 minuteeven if you shoot the terciary target your missiles possibly wont reach the target in timemake them insta dmg weapons ccp  less lag or dubble the dpsdmgor make sure missiles will hit targets maximum 10 sec after missile is firedalso if missile hit target from aheadtarget speed should increase its dmg not decreaseif you run into a wall it will hurt you but the wall has 0 explo velocity p
sorry but even with those changes clone vat bays are little more than jokes also why claim the their role is forward base when you can do the exact same thing with a few carriers and a rorqual for much much less
not even shamwow can clean up coad
but at least we can try
watching a tcf fleet land like fireworks last week was awesomenot really fix this plz
funny as  and nerfs blobs keep it lol
its a shame that the 2nd biggest ships ingame arent bigger then the normal sized cap shipsthis isnt rightai for this topic
signedmissiles need to be revisited
no not reallymissiles are fine as they are for all frigcruiserbsbut capitals needs a look at havent been in one myself but numbers speak for themself a carriermothershiptitan shouldnt be able to speedtank missiles thats just ridicolous and stupid 
i watched a battleship speed tank cruise missiles on sisi when the qr changes were first implemented that is just as ridiculous as the above missiles should be hitting the targets they were designed to kill for full damage
stop the caldari hate give missiles some lovewhile your at it give the stealth bombers a kiss
i have been thinking about this myself it would be a nice feature
it needs a fix
omfg yes the first time i warped to my pos after the patch i was like wtf is this soap bubble monstrosityfrom the warp drive shimmer to the bubbles to the sheildhardener effects someone went totally ape shyte over the shimmer effect on things like ships they look ace though my ships sometimes end up cloaked with only guns visable but on things as large as a bubble theyre completely game breakingi dont have any visually stimulated health issues but after working in my pos for an hour i was distinctly seasikdid the box set ship with dramamine
agreed this is a pretty straightforward ui fix
as a refined english gent i find the lack of representation amongst my social class lacking in potential ambulistic exploits thus i proposecigars for the more boarish of mencigarettes for those of lower social standingciggarettecigarello holders for refined ladiespipes for those of us who appreciate classx up for participation
look for aproved buff large acarty from first csm meeting is it done yet nope
i fully agree that apparently unfinished features in the game are annoying to the extent of being outright disappointing balance issues are undisputed as well even though they are likely to be discussed more controvercially as there will be one opinion against a nerf or boost uproar and discussion garanteedstill rework effort is piling up and imho jademako said well that the relative silence of ccp about addressing them is a risk to longterm fun says a pilot who graduated five years agonow csm representatives have shown more tolerance to the reasons of why issues are delayed at ccp  simply because they know more details one may assume hence that ccp has valid economic reasons for their schedule such reasons might not be pleasant for the existing player base yet a new major expansion surely is more pleasant to the market than a bug fix releaseto conclude the csm should be used by ccp to publish more insight into the schedule and  of course  listen to the csm and prioritize some issues higher than they have been in the past
i think psot 18 sums it up pretty nice also not fixing bugs does have price tag i have seen players leave over unresolved bugs unfinished expansions and bad public relations ie devs failing to respond  missing insight on the development cycle these quittings werent omgemorage but slow sad goodbyes some are still following the dev blogs every once in while so there is hope  and the general consensus in my peer group has been that ccp has gradually been changing for the better lately there has been an amazing that is if your expactions have been shattered before amount of bug fixes and things we were never expecting in the last expansion
logical all ceos need to vote in order to disband alliance or any other major change or lets say take in a new corp for examplethe only reason anyone can be against this is because its in some very inlogical way supporting bob
while pretty a lot of these new graphics are so lag ladden for lower to mid level machines let get that post expansion optimization patch put out ccp or go back to the far more functional graphics of old
i would suggest not trying to run dual monitors with dual clients if you cant handle it and youre right this game isnt wow although the fanbase whines like it which is why it isnt a cruddy looking cartoon game meant for the lowest of the low end machines ram is dirt cheap nowadays mid range graphics cards are dirt cheap if you can afford 2 monitors and 2 clients then upgrade
previously i could only run 45 accounts on one machine this new expansion makes me able to run almost a dozen so long as im not in a 700 man fight perhaps you should take a look at your machine or god forbid lower the graphics
allo i joined eve about a week ago and im loving it but im having severe issues with the market ive bout things on it several times and the money is taken from my wallet but the item is never delivered and the purchase never appears in my transactions most recently i bought an exequror for 3 mill where i had 2 million and when i lost my ship it gave me 1 mill for no insurence then my rl friend who got me hooked gave me 5 mill to buy a new one the total was 8 mill in my pocket i made the purchase i now have 5 mill and no ship this is rather upsetting especially for a new player like myself who cant afford errors like thisim also having issues with the petition system i opened a petition 3 days ago and nobody has gottten ahold of me or mailed me with a solution and now ive opened a second one for this marklet error and im worried that i still wont get any resolution i mean 3 days is a long time to wait for an answer or a solution is there anything i can do
i started laughing when i got this farallow me to give you this little tipclick on the button called assetsand please dont start posting here until youve played more than a month
petitions can take some time especially now since a new expansion always has issues and the gms get swarmed with petitions the more thorough and clear you are in your petition the easier it will be for the guy looking at it to resolve it also helps if the petition is filed under the correct section im saying this just because you posted this in a forum section that it really doesnt belong in chances are that your petition could be suffering because of the same problemi would recommend going through your wallet and assets tabs thoroughly to make sure those items are truly missing both have search function but youre so new they should be easily found by just browsing common mistake is buying items from remote locations and assuming they magically get delivered where you are they should show up somewhere if the money was taken from your wallet if they are truly missing and not just delivered in a way you did not expect you should not have issues getting reimbursed
to preface this i have some wrist problems and one reason i play eve so much apart from the fact that i love the game is that it isnt an intensively mousing gamehowever after recently joining in pvp i find myself needing to continuously pump the scan button every few seconds while in a fw plex waiting to see if theres just one destroyer coming or a full fleet including griffins needing to manually pump the scan button every few seconds to be effective in pvp is just pointless imagine if you had to do the same for your overviewthus i suggest that the directional scanner have an autoscan option using the given range and direction settings possibly one that cycles every 23 seconds at that rate the scanner may actually cause less lag than a person manually pumping the button more frequently and save many players wrists
supporting my own topic
make that 1020 seconds and it may be viable the database lag from every single person who has their scanner open scanning every 23 seconds would kill the servers
all rats beltmission shouldnt drop loot simple l4 doing per hour will do same mineral yeld as hulk doi purposeremove all loot expect tagsfactionofficerdeadspace gearadd named bpc drops from rats instead of named module dropsincrese bounty from rats to compensate
nowhere near not only do you need to kill everything but you need to come back and collect it all too which takes just as much time i also ask why is shooting infinitely respawning roids floating in space any better or worse than shooting at infinitely respawning npcs that theoretically have had other people shoot those infinitely respawning roids for them to make their stuffi do not want an increase in rat bounty it will just lead to inflationand a hulk will collect far more minerals if that is what you are after than loot drops most of the cash from wrecks is in the salvage for missions runners not loot and reprocessable mineralsnot supported
try ratting sansha in a station system you will be astounded at the mineral value of the loot  i know i wast1 basic loot should be removed from the drop tables
im down for this although i can imagine most will cry foul
anything to make l4 less profitable than good 00
id agree to some kind of high end lp store boost but only if it is available from low sec corps only  corps that have no agents in high sec at allone thing for certain  the high sec empire does not any additional rewards
i agree with this i recently sold all my lps to a private capsuleer at 1k per lp but i wouldve loved something to spend it on that was more worthwhilehowever this is an issue for the balance team to scrutinize carefully if you could make some mods that mission runners would enjoy such as the sisters of eve proberecon launcher but not pvpers you mightve hit on solid gold here regardless i agree with this issue
well i have no problem with it being something any one can use i just dont see what pvpers would use a 5 bill module on their ship unless it is a super cap usable module but only a very few of thosefrom the of it only to be able to get this from lowsec agents well no this destroyes the whole perpose since lowsec mission runners are not pveers it is primary pirates that want something to do while hanging out or pvp orienteted people that are okey with doing pve as a incomethis was to make it so that the mission runners themselves could get something awesome that they could work towardsso that they can look at the store and say damn nice if i can just get 2500k lp and 15 of these mission sequence complete certificates and 100 of these tags i can get myself a state navy raven yer yer i know that they are not comming in ever because it is a collectable item stupid in my oppinion to wasted designer time on something like that but it was just a example for something that a mission runner would really want and yes the mods will be very pricy but mission runners if pure pveers have no problem with using those 5 billions on a mod they really want and it doesnt feel as that much of a grind of they can buy it from the lp store and feel like they have worked towards it instead of just grinding isk to buy something that some one else have foundeditactually this would make the pve grinding much more encuraging since it would give it a direct purpose
supporting this on the condition its changed to have lp offers completely looked over only a handful of offers atm are worth it faction frigs should be going for about 1015 mil for example
well it would more or less make a overhull of the lp stores all lp prices and items would need to be adjusted for what they find as a reasonable price for the ships is up too them although i do agree with you that the prices for the ships are quite rediculess as they are now just a ex a bs faction cost 350mill isk to buy to pull it out of the lp store it will cost 12bill so the lp prices are rediculess and needs a look too  since lp goes for around 2mill per 1k
if your talking about making stateissue ships the ones that exist right now im putting my foot down those should only be given out viaccp not another ship that is commonly used for rich people as for having something nice yeah i kinda agree with this but i dont think we need to add more ships to the game viamissioning isaac
adding bigger rewards wont make them stop sucking if you look at isklp ratios its all the big flashy obvious offers that are worthless these days  i really want to know who the idiots are that cash out in navy battleships because theyre getting next to nothing for their lp going for bigger numbers wont stop people from farming them to worthlessness itll just mean fewer runs to jita to cash out im not opposed to such offers being added if theres a worthwhile reward for a plausible cost but im not going to support it just because as for your two somewhat interesting ideas onestate gear is faintly ridiculous and the other certs for mission completion is somewhat worthwhile but already largely implemented with items like zors dna not supported
maybe we can start with getting people like you out of an npc corp then we can get you to work on getting player ceos to give out medals acknowledging such achievments
no eve  console game
first of all what the secondly what the what youre proposing is just designed to make your epeen longer and serves no actual purpose much like achievements for console games which this seems to be based off yes i know tf2 but you actually get stuff with those achievements why should npcs reward people for playing the game whats next getting a medal for passing x million skillpoints if this is the kind of  we can expect from you running for csm again then i will certainly question the sanity of those who actually do vote for you
achievements are overdone as iswe dont want that in eve
sounds pretty cool
on a side note shes already served 2 terms and cannot run again afaik
thank godshows how much i care about the csm though i paid a bit of attention to the first one but the second csm has been useless in every sense of the word
eve doesnt need achievements the novelty is more of an annoyance and something like the tok from warhammer would be crap for eve it might be good for keeping achievement farmers for more profit and whatnot but i doubt it highly see warhammers hemorrhaging of subs
i agree with your topicideaas stated before warfare has counter measures for everything and there should be some kind of counter measure against cloakingi want to know when big brother is watching mei think the ones who dont want this acw must be afraid of equality
they need another t2 destroyer hull anticovert warfareit can only do it while cloaked and it takes a long long time 10 mins or so of just sitting thereafter xminutes you can pick up the ship with your directional its there but not where after another xminutes you can get a range and finally after the full scan has completed you get a range and direction the ship appears on the acw ships overview but its cloaked it cant be targeted the acw ship needs to either run over to the cloaker or launch some shipspecific probemissilewhatever that decloaks the target ofc using it causes the acw to decloakthe acw will also be able to probe for ships including cloaked ships but once it gets to where they think the cloaker is they have to run through the sit and watch routine
yes because clearly this wouldnt be yet another nail in the coffin of stealth bombersgallente reconsessentially you want to add an iwin ship that allows you to completely counter 6 different classes of ships and more if you include ships which can fit a protocloak all of them every gang in eve would need one of these ships to be competitive and as such covops ships would become completely useless except for the possible exception of falcons ecm and covops probingalso by fun and interesting i assume you mean click button  wait 30 seconds  warp your whole gang on top of that lone recon
yes after getting endlessly blown up in my newbie days it needs a change

thumbs up for larc
not to turn this into a flamefest i can do it if i believe but no one is going to vote for you unless you reveal your main write up serious policies in written up in a decent manner in a location where everyone can read it and then make some proper threads which arent filled with spam infested circlejerking
are we to understand that you are suggesting that ccp implement macro hauling in a macro mininghauling filled universe now
1 youre not that bright are you2 theres this ship called an orcai think ill go elect someone with at least the requisite half a brain
i am not suggesting macro hauling i am saying ccp should implement a computer service to haul your mined ore for a fee from your mining belt to the stationoh yay what about people who cant fly the orca yet i think you dont have a brain
i hope you runi would love to see you fit inside a portrait

i support this candidatechip m for csmak
what is your solution to this that doesnt involve some sort of instancing i am very very much opposed to any form of instances in game
when i first ran for the csm i had a certain segment in mind that i hoped to represent this is the peaceful industrial or pve player that often times are dismissed as a care bear many of the more vocal posters on the eve forums would have you believe that these players have no place in the verse and are not a part of eve ccp ever intended to createi think a large number of us know that simply isnt true there are those of us that choose to live our lives in space believing that eve does not have to be zero sum game that we deserve to enjoy the experience on our terms and not those dictated by a vocal minority that believe eve can only be chaos and not harmony these are the pilots of eve whos views i have attempted to representplease note i do not advocate forcing my preferred experience on the rest of the verse my record has shown i have never advocated that the fundamental elements of risk verses reward the exist today be changed i believe ccp understands this balance and my direct interactions with the ccp reinforced my confidence that they know the value of we care bears that said i think it is key that the voice of the bears continue to be represented in the csmso to that end for this election i would like to call for the creation of a formal political party that can become the holders of this torch i ask that any pilots that support these basic ideals show your support in this thread and that you offer possible planks for the core party values if you are a candidate and this idea resonates with you please indicate your interest in joining this party and gaining its endorsementso let us all join together and find our voiceissler dainzefounder of the voice of reason partynote the first thing we could all do is find a better name
i agree with the point youre making but i think that youre overstating it pretty severely yes there are people who mock the carebears and consider them beneath eves dignity we call these people idiots and theres not really that many of them theres a lot more who want to fly with lean pvpcentric corps and want people putting their sp into shooting things but most of that crowd ive talked to have plenty of respect for the industrialists they just dont want them dropping their combat efficiency a pirates ship comes from jita in the same way a persons food comes from the supermarket and they know that i guess im just not sure what your party is really pushing for here industrycentric improvements dont really need any attempt to form a broadbased movement and the electoral structure of the csm doesnt allow for a conventional party to work as a tool for getting its members elected  in fact itll likely make it harder to get your people elected if you try to put too many on creating a manifesto as a litmus test for candidate support might make sense but im not really sure what statements it might contain that would really be useful in telling industrialists who to support and who not to its not like the people who make all the ships in the game are important to the continued functioning of the game economy is really a controversial statement and theres no real hotbutton issues affecting industry right now i understand where youre coming from but im not really sure what this will ultimately accomplish aside from getting a list of people willing to sign their names to a statement that ultimately amounts to saying i am generically in favour of industry if you have any good ideas here id love to see them  im interested in what sort of structure we can get on csm voting and how candidates can better reach voters and help them understand the vast number of positions taken but without a concrete direction for this im not sure youll achieve that
i think what im saying is that there needs to be a voice in the csm for a particular groups of players often derided as being carebears i am trying to form some political center of gravity around that group of pilots in eve so that their voice is clearly part of the csm processthats pretty much it but this post was about getting some feedback about what a party based on this player base would call its basic tennentsfor example some things i would say would be relevant1 improving the riskreward realities of eve an example of current problems would be low sec2 making sure that eve feature roadmaps include mining industry and pve3 making sure that the economy continues to be healthy and balanced4 that the csm keeps ccp honest and particiates in oversight5 that casual play continues to be an optionthose are some things that come to mind when i think about it but i am asking others for ideas as to what matters to the players in this segmentissler
crap i click on an issler thread expecting it to be about her nonnis policiesim disappointed
i hope the party will embrace nonnis and the range of deserts including pie necessary for an optimal eve experienceissler
a carebear partyone would think average iqs are high enough that one wouldnt be neededwhere do pirates think ships come from the storkyou know i just came to a sad realization missions are almost the only fun thing to do in eve besides pvp and by fun i dont mean take your clothes off fun i mean i was able to click the mouse around for a bit and avoid falling asleep funsince you need pve to grind cash for pvp id say pve needs a major boost of funor better yet find a way to turn pvp into a profession so one isnt forced to do pve at all maybe a bounty on all player ships or something or maybe make faction warfare pay a salary some kind of veterans pensioni dont know all i know is that if there were some way to do pvp 100 of the time eve would be a better gameand yes theres absolutely nothing wrong with not participating in pvp if it doesnt float your boat if you want to be a 100 miner full time far be it from me to criticise youthe eve theme is freedom
i suppose you never heard of the take care party that i set up in response to the csm when there was a call for a voice that would represent the silent majorityerik finnegan is the new representative of the individualists small corporations and industrial stuff on behalf of the take care party and will continue what i have started back in 2008 its not like take care will die when i can no longer run for csm its a long term project that im glad to have started and glad to hand over to its next protagonistanyway good luck to you too two is better than one
arent politicians bad people i think someone said that danyway gl both issler and ankh
i read this thread while watching an episode of south park and quite frankly it could have been a script for the next episode
i have major issues with people who entertain stupid arguments like the one sitting over there where your fellow posters are griping about goons attacking your allianceespecially ones that come up with crackpot ideas like thisno thanks ill pass
since you arent who this party intends to represent your absence would have been expectedissler
i would personally propose the creation of a liberal party dedicated to keeping eve as much of a freeforall sandbox as humanly possible wouldnt a carebear party be naturally conservative
id like to propose a new ai addition to the game the option is to add rats who can drop bubbles and force players into combatthese rats would target quicker and could station bubble traps that they respond to at gates they couls either be present or else the bubble could act as a trigger for them as they idled far off and respawned at that location after a time framethis could also tie in to the presence of certain complexeshaving these in lowsec could attract new players seeking a new and exciting challenge
bubbles dont work in lowsec silly
antimatter should have the longest range as its energy potential doesnt decay unlike plasma then again with the negative polarity railguns would have to invert their polarity as well and thus propel the thing at slower velocities making them less accurate at long rangeunless it really is an underwater simulator
tldr all of that  but issler is yet another terrible csm on this terms council see ankehasudsja  bunyip
oh noes i have failed the nexus kinnon testmakes me want to run again to try and win him over so nexus take a moment out of your busy life and explain what you think the csm does and what would make a good onecan you site something specific i have done for example to be so poor at itissler

oh god csm please bring this up the lack of animation is really disappointing
bring back the old jump effect this one is very boring
posting cause i was told to and iUFFFDm wasted but yeah hooray for the old cyno effect
i concur the old effect was amazing the new one is mehthird edit hi enjoi
change it back
old cyno animation
do it nao
stronger and more intimidating
the new cyno just looks like youve diappeared the old one actually looked like you were going some where in a really cool waywhy should cap pilots have the same jump effects as everyone else
play nice joi joi  ill gladly take any smack from the goons in return for there support in getting this through d its good to see the support in this and im hoping some csms and ccp will start looking at this

ya current pos look like crap even with the new bubble pos should look like a weaker version of outposts really not some massive force field in spacereally i mean it goes against the idea of space ships because if it was possible to have that massive of a force field i would strap it to a titanso ccp get working on making this work soonsigned
can only support it fury missiles got a little use in some cases but for majority t2 is inferior although i did support it alreadyto the ones saying faction is for freeno it is not 1 lp can be invested elsewhere for isk 2 they cost money too 24m for 5000 hybrid l for example 3 minerals for t1 ammo isnt free either they cost exactly the amount of is youd get for the minerals on the market if you sold those  slot cost 8only a few thousand though

supported although i want 50 of the veldsparyield it makes
hahah
signed missiles are indeed quite useless in most casesthey need a totally overhull to work in both pvp and pve
if you are going to use a extra person as support just put some one with a couple of remote tracking computers and the turrets will once again outpreform missiles no prob besides you need a webber ship more then target painter to get your full dmg now
i see no downside the security risks would be identical to the existing hangar system and would be managed the same way if a given alliance felt the risks were too high they would not have to use it
fix ittt 
arg would be a horribly way to lose a capital
whist i agreed totally anything that upsets this many goons can only be a good thing as such i cannot support this totally reasonable proposal
fix it

first of all the skill que is awesomebutexamplei have a specialized miner alt meaning mining is all he is going to do so i dont really have a whole lot of other skills that are usefull to him to fill up the training que with now he is going to finish astrogeology v the prereq for exhumers i at 2am on a weeknight however i cant inject exhumers and stick it in the que because he doesnt meet the prereqs yetso as it currently stands i will have to essentially waste 16 hours of possilbe training time 2am to 6pm which is 47 of the time that it will take that character to train to exhumers lvl 3 for the hulk now 16 hours is nothing to qq about and in the end its really not that big of a deal but in a game where training time is a major major part of how its played 16 hours is a big deal some of you might say sign on in the morning and switch to exhumers then but then im still wasting 7 hours of training time some of you might say que up a bunch of other skills then but like i said i dont have a bunch of other skills to stick in the que because all hes going to do is mine he wont even be refining so they would be just as much a waste of time as not trainingim in full support of thisas for what drake saidno it doesnt add to the lazy man effect in fact it takes away from the this is a pain in the ass effect which is what the skill que was designed and supposed to do in the first place im all for keeping the game somewhat difficult and complex so that you actually have to put forth an effort and also use your brain to play instead of vegetating in front of your computer screenbut the skill que had one major goal and that was to keep people from having to sign on dozens of times during the day or in the middle of the night just to change a skillnow i would never get up at 2am just to change a skill in a game sleep is way more important to me however as it currently works the skill que in some situations would still require players to do what it was designed to prevent us from having to do in the first place again i would never make a big fuss about 7 or even 16 hours of training time as i do have a life and this is a game however from a functional standpoint the addition of a skill que feature did not fully address the issues for which it was developedheres the way it should work1 if you have all the prereqs trained then you can injecttrain a skill2 if you either have all prereqs trained or in the skill que then you can inject3 if you have a prereqs qued up and you inject a skill your training should be locked and the que should be frozen so that you cannot pause training or take anything out of the que before the prereqs finishyes it would take some extra programming but if ccp wants this feature to do what they said that it was supposed to do this needs to be fixedpsever since my first day in new eden i thought it made much more sence to take out the physical skillbooks paying for them makes sence but the necessity of flying to a station to get the physical book never made any sence to me i mean if we can implant microchips into our brains i dont understand why were still reading paperback books i would suggest that they integrate training into the shops as part of the walking in stations expansion ie in order to purchaseinject new skills you have to stop by a shop inside a station to get it that would also make the shops a little more meaningful or maybe do it for certain higher ranked 8 skills only
personally i like the new graphic however i can definately see where it can be an issue to some working at their posperhaps an alternative would be a clientside checkbox in the esc menu to disable new pos shield effectsso kind of halfsupport
only needing the mouse to select one thing and then spamming the keystroke is better than needing the mouse to select one thing and then go to the warpto button above the overview the fact that you have to click on your target doesnt make the function keys worthless as a means to activate modules but i see your pointperhaps this could be paired with an ability to designate a default location in a particular system that you would warp to with this command im fine with that idea but i expect pushback from pirates who think that would make it too easy for a victim to escape

my experience has been that he new client with graphics turned all the way down is far faster than the old classic client if set right this should have improved your experience perhaps you havent turned everything down
you just need to upgrade your computer you cant keep running new generation games on windows 98 buddyalso you know what is an eye strain that dam text block you just wrote
if you want to transfer a character you need a credit card with  20 on it but what if you dont have money atm but you have a 30day plex in hangar of character you want to move plex in game are tax free i mean real tax free because banks are not involved in operation on existing virtual items already in game so it will be enought as a payment and a new option under right mouse button menu on plex something like convert into transfer fee in addition to slight modification of eve account management page  transfer character using credit card old one transfer character using converted plex new
im supporting my own proposal
im going to go out on a limb and guess that ccp will never support this 30 day plex doesnt equal cash your just going to have to use a credit card or wait for actual money to come to you and if your this low on cash what are you doing playing eve onlineno supportisaac
youre asking them to lower their fee a few bucks2525 which they likely wont support i like it in principle and id be in favour of asking them about itsince the above poster is fundamentally wrong the beauty of plexes is that you can play without spending rl money but this is a low priority for the csm because ccp will likely refuse to drop their prices for this service given the number of more important issues that dont get passed along to ccp i cant ask the csm to raise this one
so ideas to prevent it lagging too much  warping or a session change will disable your scanners autorepeat  if the autorepeat has been running for too long a message will show up you then have another minute to hit the autorepeat button otherwise the autorepeat will stop no autorepeat for afk players
i like the idea of seriously nerfing scrapmetal processing cap it at 75 and you will get a 25 drop in mission sourced minerals on the market as well as a decrease in the effectiveness of mineral compression 2 birds with one stone
lowering loot drops and switching from drops to bpcs increases the needusefulness of producers which is good lowering the overal income for missions is always good
theres a lot of need for a change in mineral drops from rats but it has to be done carefully in a way that ensures things actually settle down reasonably afterwards this isnt care this is a bomb dropped right in the middle of the eve economy a sensible proposal in this vein id likely support but screw it all is not a proper method of implementing an economy tweak not supported
no not well thought out and is simply a bomb in gameplay not supportedisaac
thisi agree that mission loot reprocessing is an issue for the economy especially seeing as im primarily a miner but it needs to be dealt with carefully not with this ready fire aim crap
this  the other 2 comments echoing this postthis reeks of unbalanceistic foolishness
excellent idea would balance a lot of things
this is a bad ideamany people rely on t1 named mods instead of t2 for combat as well as npcingif one was to remove named drops from missions and such you would create a major vacuum of suppliesalso a large portion of minerals that help run this entire game come from reprocessingrunning these missions allow us to get the minerals required without spending hours and hours of time mining for crapi do not see how your proposal would help at all in any way the mineral market as it is now is doing fine there are plenty of minerals for new and old industry pilots to use so there is no shortagedoing what you propose would sky rocket all mineral prices with that being said new industry chars would never be able to start off in their new profession due to the cost and would give a monopoly to well rooted industry pilotsas for the increase bounty that alone is a horrible idea inflation in this game is at such a high rate that without a loan new pilots have hard times starting out and usually take months before they can afford decent shipsfittingsif anything ccp needs to implement new isk sinks into the game to help reducing inflationplus i dont look kindly on making all pvp ships even t1 more expensive to flylose
you fail to understand reading its said add named blue print copies droped and as you stated you do missions for minerals see why mininer profesion isnt profitable new playyers wont be effected much even if prices would increse 2 times which i doubt cruiser would cost like 10mln and eve dont have inflation it have deflation llok at all shipsfaction mods droping constantly in price t2 minerals exploit removal only made inflation
i agree with your broader point though your arguments are kind of weak but i really have to take issue with this point ive had buddies who were in decentlyfit battlecruisers while they were still on trial accounts and thats without any outside support purchasing it prices have been dropping constantly for over two yearsat least until the reactor exploit was fixed that brought them back up some but theyre still way down and its far easier to get established now than it used to be
the cnrs which the market is flooded with come from a different place than lp stores i dont know if thats a cosmos site a complex or some hacking sites but there are people who sell dozens of cnr bpcs each week of course they wont share their secret they make tons of isk while cnrs are not an option for missionrunners and together with a few more factors it causes a constant devaluation of lpthis is especially annoying for lvl5 missionrunners since lvl5 missions dont give bounties in most cases lps are the main payment there up to 70k lp per mission therefore i generally support the idea of items that require high amounts of lps such as modules mentioned in op or 67 attribute implants faction battlecruiserscapital ships or even a state issue raven for 50 million lp or something that stops lp from losing their value even more its annoying that empire lp which were worth up to 2000 isklp before the lp store was introduced now sell for around 500 isklp when being cashed in in huge amounts
had an encounter with a gang consisting of 4 battleships and 3 falcons this type of gang with excessive ecm is ruining small gang pvp my dual eccm domi was jammed several times vote for lark
hopefully all of cp l gets behind a single candidate so they have a chance of getting in that candidate should be lark
and rats dont get concorded i think this is an idea which would enhance the quality of the game while slightly increasing the challenges that players face in lowseclowsec is a training ground where players can learn about new and exciting features of eve and its mechanics having angel gatecamps would be a wonderful addition to any lowsec adventure
last i checked amarr reactors ran on antimatter so it must be fairly common
the one thing that bugs me is the sheer amount of nerf ccp applied to antimatter ammunition especially when given what happens when antimatter and matter make physical contacti remember a documentary on the discovery channel i think that gave an example about what would happen if two equally sized masses of matter and antimatter were to collide in this example they used the shows narrator as a baseline for the mass of said matter and antimatter packages the depicted resulting explosion would destroy everything on the earths surface and leave a goodsized crater behind as wellso i find it hard to believe that antimatter ammunition is used as the most powerfully destructive ammunition for blaster and railgun weapons i could see them being used for weapons of mass destruction but not for normal naval ammunitionbottom line this aint star trek online folks
not only different but plese bigger fonts made possible12 isnt big enough in alot of cases14 16 18 20 should be poossible toodont say 1620 would be too big its tha players choice after all
yup
please
is there any offical response from devs 
old effects by far superiorpretty obvious that ccp wanted to improve fps on massive capital jumpins etc but these new effects are just lame
new effect is a bit lame i for one want a terminator style effect eve needs more blue lightning 
yup the new jump gate effect is awesome well done but its doesnt fit for a jump drive seeing a wormhole open up in space was incredible so would be good to see it again
im actually supporting a cheater wtfi feel dirty
i miss the weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeechowbring it back plz
new effect is pretty dull looks like low budget bsg style stuff
there is nothing wrong with long range tech 2 ammo the scorch tracking penalty may not matter much at optimal but your opponent may not let you fight therethese ammos have a purpose and get used the short range ammo was a bit poo for minnie for whom it added a noticable ammount of damage over gimped emprfemp and pretty horrible for the other races with the web changes the trackingrange hits make these ammos pointless most fo the time i know i have removed hail from mostnot all of my loadouts in favour of more boostersempbarrageexotic dancersquick point to the cry abies complainging their tech 2 guns are not good enough get a griptypicaly 8 damage from spec raw stats equsal to best namedlower cost than best named for most weaponsvery large for lasersoption to use both tech 2 ammos including the usefull onei also dont see the point of the hating on the free faction ammo it taks normal ammo  isk  lp to make and the sell price has been forced down to tiny margins only way to make cash with it is to shuip it to places where people want to supply without going to a hub and thats no different to anything else
t2 ammo needs a boostremoval of stupid penalties only t2 ammo that is actually used are some javelinnull types range and barrage sometimes rage hams are good too but situational
i dont completely agree with this for a number of reasons while i do think some faction ammo and some t2 ammo is a bit screwed one way bear in mind theres also a screw the other way for example while obviously for a vagabond faction emp is normally best for close range work you would never choose pretty much any other faction ammo possibly phased plasma at a push because for slightly onger range work barrage is just insanely better than anything else there is a similar story with long range guns yes at close range faction empantimattermultifrequency is better than quakegleamjavelin but then at long range other than very occasionally when using hacs to kill frigates where tracking might matter tremorauroraspike is way way better than faction carb leadradioiron due to not only its extra 20 range but also its much improved damageat the same time faction guns now suck because of some t2 ammo being overpowered and someone even suggested faction guns should use t2 ammo which i approve of my alternative to that would be make faction ammo for faction guns only however give some of the faction ammos some quirky bonuses anyway i will sign this because i would like faction guns discussed and that involves faction ammo so perhaps this will bring faction guns into discussion toofinally the ammo issue really boils down to the fact that when t2 ammos were nerfed the close range ones got hit way way too hard and should recived more damagemuch less negatives than currently and they have more negatives than long range ones and yet no real positives and possibly some positives like for example a speed boost on hail or void since you need to burn in to use them not a redction
depending on situations yes a rupturecane with hail will wipe the floor with one using rf emp for instance another use is when youre shooting something 1 size larger than you t2 always seems to beat faction thenthat said i agree t2 ammo needs a small unerfing read remove some of the negative effects remove tracking penalty would be awsome also shortening the insane build times would be nice as well
blast from the past here i know some of my thoughts are plastered all over page 1 but that was all negative ive done some thinking and heres some actual suggestions instead of arguing weve got three types of ammo t1 is cheap simple and boring faction is expensive simple and does a lot of damage t2 is expensive complicated tends to do a lot of damage but is generally nerfed to hell and gone the only t2 ammo that sees use is the stuff that gives you something novel at a cost that isnt unreasonable  spikeauroratremor give you reasonable dps at gargantuan range and scorch gives you the ability to fire pulse lasers at lowend beam ranges without sacrificing dps the other eight however are garbage  voidconflaghail give tiny dps increases for massive penalties nullbarrage give range bonuses to weapons with no range and javelingleamquake are just voidconflaghail zoomed out of the six range ammos four are good and barrage is salvageable likely by upping the falloff bonus null is problematic but really a 200 optimal bonus or something isnt totally unreasonable for blasters and thatd sort of put it in the same category as the others of the six damage ammos youve got a grand total of zero that are genuinely usable and three that see some use in hyperspecialized fits or more realistically eft pimpingive even been guilty of the latter myself at times this says to me that the raw dps niche should be left to faction ammo and t2 should find a new one many are possible but the first that comes to mind is tracking if hail instead of nerfing range and cap recharge to get dps instead did the same or less dps than emp at the same range but had mods of 50 sig radius and 100 tracking speed then it might see some use it certainly wouldnt exist solely as a trap as possible side benefits you could quite conceivably make some kind of capless ammo for lasers and hybridsno capless lasers arent broken when they use ammo or a smaller charge size so an effectively limitless amount can fit in the guns or even a lower rof and a higher burst damageespecially on the artillery ammo to up the alphastrike damage maybe mix around the damage types somewhat too  who wouldnt like a projectile round that did all four damage types equally these arent definite suggestions but they are ideas for a direction the devs could take the currentlylame t2 ammos in that would see at least a little bit of use doesnt step on the toes of faction or t1 and doesnt require being nerfed into oblivion

so basicly the veldatar doesnt need to be moved into amarr to join its son the veldnaughtwhile this would cause me epeen to rage throughout new eden im sure it would also be a good tourist trap i am faily confident that such a move would cause the major ccp favorism waggon to run on mwds  so the proposal is that if the veldatar cannot be moved to the favorism reason the veldatar could be seen as a gift for the ego of chribba becoming a monument like the luminare titan with my name attachedwe would then have created the howthehellcanccpletpeoplespend90billionisktogetingamemonumentswaggonwhat this basically means is you have seen other dreads and carriers in high sec but want to be spesial

each race pos has bonuses to their own racial weapons such as minni to projectiles and gallente to rails etcthe caldari tower give bonuses to ecm which is awesome btw but also to missile arrays the missile arrays are not bad if you look away from the non insta dmg etc but they have one problem which makes it impossible for them to be practicalthey use cpupos mods that use cpu like tackling arrays hardeners etc go offline when a pos is reinforced and cannot be onlined while its reinforcedmods that dont use cpu such us guns on the other hand stay online even if the pos is reinforced that means even if your pos is reinforced a fleet cannot just sit and camp you inside your pos but has to deal with the pos guns as wellthis is most critical for when the pos comes out of reinforced where online guns can especially when manned add thousands of dps to cover the repairing of the tower  launchers would be offlinemy suggestions would be to either remove the cpu requirement on launchers or give them a special role allowing them to stay online even when the pos gets reinforced even tho they still use cpucopied from the game development forum
even ignoring the cpu and even ignoring the delayed hit missile turrets are still the worst pos defences in the game a cruise launcher does half as much dps per unit of pg than any other pos defence in the gameeven on a caldari tower it does a whopping 17 dps torpedoes are lower dpspg than any turret and have mediocre range citadels arent as offensively bad  they do the most dpspg of any longrange defence but they take a lot of cpu and take as much as two minutes to hit still its clear that missiles need a complete workingover  either dramatically cut their rof or give them something else to compensate for how much they suck at present and yes a role bonus letting them fire when the pos gets reinforced would be a good way of removing at least some of the suck from their cpu use
i can really only see more nerfs to pvp coming with future patches fixing this exploit would be counter productive to that process and as such ccp isnt going to fix this issuekeep fighting the good fight but its a waste of time
if you actually get disconnected at the wrong time what the hell makes you think you should be 100 safe if you disconnect in a level 4 mission while rats have you scrambled do you log back on in a pod if you disconnect while trying to solo a hac in a t1 frig do you survive then why should you be safe if you disconnect when you jump into a gate camp or at a ss while the guys you just took pot shots at are probing you out  happens if you really disconnect and get killed too bad suck it upthe following needs changed desperately to put a stop to entire fleets logging off and the 3 wads that have been hanging around our space all week logging on ganking someone and logging off with total impunity and other such ation1 no ship should ever ever ever vanish while it is locked scrambled and being fired on ever2 fix the log on and immediate log offon again exploit to avoid coming back to where you initially logged off3 fix the jump clears aggression timer exploit  yes it still works 4 increase the non aggro vanish timer from 30 seconds to 2 minutes why every other game balances log off timers to prevent you from getting away if an enemy is close to catching you if you had not logged off anyhow even without aggro you should stick around just long enough for an accomplished prober who is already looking for you to find you if they were hot on your tail and you tried to ditch you should be toast5 like every other mmo when you quit the logoff countdown should start and you should be able to sit there while your ship is waiting to vanish at the safe spot if you get attacked then the logoff is aborted and you can defend yourself if not then the client closes when your ship vanishes and you know you will be safe until you log on again
this is the first most basic thing that needs to be done i dont see how that would be too much work for ccp so that shouldnt be an excuse
yeah no  we need that
yeah once i fly a capital it should be capital sized where would it lead if a epeen doesnt get bigger 
i would much rather see the anchoring skill to allow the onlininganchoringunachoring of multiple modules at once per person with the number of modules being dependant on the level of the anchoring skill 1 per level for onlining modules you might need to have the ability to online one from the start this would include the ability for multiple people to onlineanchor thins with no limithowever at the same time because of the ability to onlineanchorunachor multiple things at once i believe doubling the timers for silosharvestersreactors ect which are allready 20 minutes fo unachoring not sure about anchoring any increase would probably need to be smaller as 40 minutes is extreemly excessive and people cant allways be on that long for most such actions would balance things out a bit so at level 2 you could onlineanchoruachor twice as much but with double in most cases time so you would end up the same as now and only at lv3 would you save time over now while lv 5 will only make a big diffrnce on poss that take 56 hours right now
u mad

i would like to see an aggression timer or just a plain jumpdock timer posted for the pod pilot just like they get in empire spacecurrent game mechanic1 you cannot use gates because of aggression just like in empire  but are left spamming the button becuase you have no clue where you stand time wise2 you cannot dock because of aggression just like in empire  see abovewhat i would like to seethe addition of an actual timer like in empire so i know when i can go through the gate or dock up
noedit see below  opinion changed after thread was edited
the whole point of 00 is the fact there is no lawthat means no aggression timer that means no concord sanctioned law enforcement let alone faction enforcement on stargatesin short noin 00 there are no rules do as you please lets keep it that way
this has nothing to do with rules  its about the game mechanic  if there are no rules as you say  why cant i dock or jump after i shoot someone ever try jumping through a gate after shooting someone  well you cant  be it in 00 or empire but for some reason  in empire you get a little timer and in 00 you dont which leaves you guessing when you can jump  in short  youre a douche bag
no one said eve was easyoh and thanks for the compliment
im not sure the above posters understand this correctly or if the op edited after the responseswhen you aggress something you get an invisible 60 second timer during which you cannot dock or jump this happens in all security ratings of space ditto with the 15 minute timer and logging off mechanicop is simply asking for that timer to be displayed somewhere on the screen why wouldnt you want such a timer displayedit really doesnt make sense that a pvp game wouldnt have the rules of aggression someone on your ui but if you aggress an npc rat oh a big yellow aggression timer comes right up it would help out new players understand game mechanics support
well in that case makes sense so long as the mechanics arent changed i dont have a problem with itbut i dont think your going to get anywhere with it either theres probably a good reason why there isnt one
okay now that i actually understand what youre asking for i can support this i thought you were suggesting a mechanical change  if its just an issue of the time not being displayed properly then i of course would prefer that get fixed
yeah why not we have the session timer already why not also have the 60 sec and the 15 min aggro timers
a visible timer would be nice especially for businesses such as docking and undockingthe only way to tell if your timer is up atm is to spam with lots of mouse clicks so i think this is a useful addition
a small simple change i would support 
it should have always been displayed regardless of the sec status of your system rules apply in all systems information available in all systems
signed
like most of the new stuff except for the pos bubble let me turn it downoffsigned
its totaly unecessary so i wasnt going to support this but that bolded section is the most tragic thing i have ever heard so thumbs up on this one its not like it would hurt having more bindable controls
yes for bs v over the hols
you dont really think ccp will implement drugs rolleyes or something to their teen rated game somehow i dont think we have many teens playing this anyway but hey not my problem
well that would be smoking in stations and id rather have jumpdrives instead of gates however that doesnt exclude being able to smoke in ambulation now does it
agree with you sir time for balancei would like to propose 3 more thingsn that i would like to see in the list ecmcaldari reconseccm t1 frigatescruisers such as breacher purifier navitas scythe augoror could use some love the ability to use passive shield tank very effective on ships that supposed to armor tank such as harbinger brutix myrmidon ishtar curse to an extend
stealth bombers black ops bombs posses faction ships the entire citadel missile system just a few to name of the endless list of being fixed soon tmthere are lots of things that need fixing asap
no i did certainly not get that impression in fact that we discussed that ccp needs to define a period of time after which they are forced to revisit new features like black opsthe csm was quite explicit that this was a good idea it will have to be left to be seen if ccp takes up the idea but i really hope so
agreed and in general access control methods need improved significantly so that a corporation can choose not to place such vast power in the hands of one personoh and an abstention does not count either way so if only one person votes yes and everyone else abstains the vote is carried
i absolutly support this but i also support the disbanding of bobr everyone has to play by the rules this mechanic was legitimate at the time so lets de legitimize it  what bob got was not legitimate
here is the mechanic you are looking for it already existsdeclaration of executor supportall corporations in an alliance can declare their support for another corporation to fill the executor role if the present executor does not have the support of more than 50 of the member corporations he cannot act on behalf of the alliance the corporation and its ceo will still be listed as the executor but all administrative functions will be disabled this is indicated by an error message that is displayed whenever usage of such a function is attempted by the executor this means that the alliance is effectively powerless until such time as the support of the executor is restored or a new executor is declared through gaining more than 50 of the support of the member corporations the system will attempt to activate an executor once every 24 hours only when the established executor regains support or a new one is put in place will access to the administrative functions be restoredas the executor of an alliance is in a position of power he must be replaced in cases where he does not possess more than 50 of the support of the member alliances has stopped playing the game or is otherwise unreachable note that changing the ceo of the executor corporation automatically entails that the new ceo is listed as executor the procedure through which executors are changed is based on the declaration of executor support which is a simplified form of voting every corporation in an alliance can modify their support for the executor at any time the default setting is to support the current executor a declaration of support is only valid if a corporation has been a member of the alliance for seven consecutive days the declaration of support is confidential and is only available to the ceo and directors of the corporationthe alliance system constantly checks whether an executor has 50 or more of the support of the member corporations if support drops below 50 the executor will be informed of this through the display of an error message when attempting to use administrative functions
finally a logical change thread although i think the 1 week max voting time is a bit too long  but i can understand it if the ceo is afk but then again that would be a serious problem in of itself
anchoring pos mods especially outside the shield is an annoying process as you can not focus your camera on this mod it becomes increasingly difficult to place a pos mod the further away you place it from the center of the towerto make this system more userfriendly i suggest thisanchoring modeanchoring mode would mean that your camera will be fixed on a pos mod from an isometric view picture example underneathplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesfrom this view you can move the pos mod along a grid on the x and y axis with the arrow keys if you want to go up and down  z axis you simply press the shift key and the up or down arrow this would allow you carefully and precisely place your pos mod on the desired location with amazing accuracysome things i feel that should be implemented the green box should stay but the arrow removed also make the box red if you cant anchor the module like this ofcours this should be a 3d grid but thats not very easy to draw please visit your user settings to reenable imagesthe stick is the tower the blue circle the pos bubble and the circles indicate a gun mod being place correctly and incorrectly make anchoring mode only available inside the pos shield and make the ship of the player go to a speed of 0 ms exactly like in siege or triage this really screws up the current system as well since if you move the pos mod box moves as wellall comments supports and criticism is welcomeon a side notethis is meant to be an improvement on the current pos mechanics i am aware that there is a topic running about modular posses but this require an entire redesign of the system which in its current state still seems unlikely
i personally find it easy as likely for them to patch the current system as it is for them to redesign the whole thingedit how did you draw the grid and the nice circle looks neat
you are very right on them redesigning the the entire pos system but it has implementation problems how do we replace the floating mods into one structure without breaking the already existing posses is one of the biggest questionsthis is why i think making the pos system more user friendly is the easier step at the momentphotoshop
in another demonstration of developer misconduct ccp renamed kenzoku to band of brothers reloaded this has never been done for an alliance character or corporation ever please vote up to disband bobr
totally messed up ccp what the hell were you thinking
disband it bob must loss it sov
consistency is key
i wouldnt be so hasty to label it developer misconduct as we dont know what happened yet it could have been a gmi am however supporting this id like band of brothers reloaded to follow the same rules as everyone else thanks
yes
if a gm made a mistake they can just change it back but this thread wont really have any effect on ccp at all

yes to a disband one rule for all
wasnt the csm program initiated because of the last time bob was given preferential treatmentstupid default character mistake zangert

also posting with alts is forbidden so i vote for your ban
i feel as if they are getting preferential treatment and have circumvented game mechanics by not losing sov and not paying 1 billion 1000000000 isk
stop the favoritismkill the favorite
how embarrasing ccp what wrong with you didnt you learn a lesson last time get you house in order plzseriously
they should be forced to disband their alliance or at least reset their sov as any other alliance in the game should have to do if the alliance wanted to change its name
pretty sure kenny wasnt misspelled they hadnt had a problem with when it was a pet alliance support
1 game 1 rule
agreedo
yes or just give all of us the option to rename ourselves and give us all the batphone
noone should be above the rules
t20
get a grip  this blows
t20 reloaded
whats up for the next time theyre disbanded bob revolutions supported
unsigned the bob name was only lost because of ccps poor game design its ing stupid that a single person could ever do that especially someone who isnt even the leader of the alliance so they have every right to make up for their mistakes to some degree and restore the alliance name
1 game 1 rule
i support
i already made a bet that someone would make a post like this thanks for making me 100 mil iskand if it wasnt for a poor game mechanic you know disbanding an alliance in a second when you cant even leave a corp in 24 hours then there wouldnt be a need to a renaming
oh look something that the csm was originally designed to deal with
1 email internalaffairsccpgamescom2 3 profit
i support all alliances being treated consistently by ccp do we have any official info on how this change happened im not in an alliance so im not the most educated on alliance game mechanics is it impossible for alliances to change names and keep sov
i disagree if they want their name let them have it you still have their space so why complain over a name
oh wow
does this mean that next time someone gets alliance director access to an enemy alliance they can simply kick out all the existing corps accept a few alt corps into the alliance and then take over all space and sov from the old hostile alliance i think not if kenny wants a new name he has to pay and wait 
why so serioooooouuuuusssss
ahuj9
i support this
one stone to rule em all but one rule to stone em allthis is messed up
there has been situations in the past were something as simple as forgetting about the alliance bill has force alliance to restart an alliance and start regaining sov its unfair for an alliance to circumvent the rules which other alliance are forced to follow
smelly at best 
most public blatant favoritism ever displayed by ccpundo it
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
more more more by the gods more
this really doesnt matter bux if you wanted to have another name you should do what everyone els have todo dispand make a new alliance surdenly this happend and you argument was it was unfair that you lost the name in the first placewtf eve isnt fair life isnt fair but we follow the rules as stated we dont go cry to our gm friends to help us out cheat and unfair for all the other players you should be ashamed and so should ccp
there is a mechanic preventing this your leaders decided talking on a microphone made you trustworthy so they removed this in favor of instantly unlocking or locking of bpo or other corporate tasks one such task is kicking corporations and stealing the wallet dont expect your debit card to not be used when the pin is written on the front of it when its stolen
wtb internal affairs
why cheat
no tinfoil hats here but if a unit or individual within ccp has decided to start ignoring otherwiseuniversal policy again it needs to be ended early thanks
why havnt we seen any posts or replys from ccp yet they must be bricking it
tired of favoritism in this game
this does not seem right 
its not the name its the blatant favoritismtwo of ccps rules were broken with this act and by themselvesviolationsccp does not do name changes upon player requestccp does not allow naming your player corporation or alliance something that parodies an existing player corporation or alliance band of brothers reloaded is a painfully obvious parody of band of brothers the corporation that existed prior to band of brothers reloaded and yes im well aware that this corporation was created by goonswarm specifically to block the original band of brothers members from reclaiming their name but not one single aspect of this was done using exploits or any other even prohibited meanstheres no explaination for it other than favoritism the name kenzoku was not a violation of the tos thus it was not eligible for a gm name change
i fully endorse this proposal
yeah but a flawed game mechanic that will only have one victim bob isnt messed upplease explain why it takes 24 hours to leave a corp takes 24 hours to join an alliance takes even 10 hours to destroy a characterbut it takes only a millisecond to insta pop a whole alliance please explain in a legitimate way without bias how this is isnt messed upi am all ears
why does this not surprise me anymore 
or just change the name to band of developers or just officially bring tanis alliance into the gbc either whatever
and if it wasnt for a poor game mechanic you know disbanding an alliance in a second when you cant even leave a corp in 24 hours then there wouldnt be a need to a renamingthis is the  that makes everyone so angry while goonsawrm used a valid in game mechanic to remove your alliance broken or not you got what no one else has ever gotten two wrongs never make a right and certainly  petition to change the sov mechanic  but you dont deserve special treatmentits not about whats fair  this isnt hello kitty online  its about he rules and making you play by them
same rules should apply to everyone
supporting this idea 100 they can rename all they want but they still have to follow the same rules either set them back to kenzoku or drop sov and do it right
i support this currently have 4 petitions over 4 characters on this because this is the worse thing ive seen on a mmorpg ever
anyone know if this change will affect sov timers in already contested systems will they reset etc in a vague attempt to give kenny an advantage in some way as before
eve have tons of poor game designscam contracts etc why all idiots seats there and cry but only bob get restore yeah it can change alliance name but it must pay bill and loss sov
explain why he was left with the roles after being absent for so longi am all ears
special consideration for a special alliance makes me sick
one rule for all
yea how does this affect possov timers and such
straight from the rulebooksthe executor of an alliance is given the authority to act on behalf of the alliance in all matters this authority is subject to review by the alliance council the limitation to a single executor simplifies the operation of the alliance system however it also places a great deal of responsibility on the member corporations to oversee the actions of the executor at present there is no formal alliancewide voting system on alliance actions and policies in place and while this is in development the use of a single executor corporation offers a suitable workaround when combined with the declaration of executor supportthis would include kicking corps out of and disbanding alliances it was not a quit it was a disband abd those takes seconds and a mouseclicknot a flawed game mechanic but simply a mechanic
seems like there is a substitute for internalk security  ccp gmsdevs
yall should just calm down and send a friendly email to internalaffairsccpgamescom and explain your concerns
if you think that something happened which shouldnt have then contact internal affairs rather than trying to cause dramaits bloody obvious that thats the entire point of this
quoted for the less intelligent i can look at all of the threads that goons post and can see crap loads of people with all intents and purposes doing what amounts to parodies an existing player corporation or alliance i dont see anyone ign and moaning like little girls about that nah because they are progoon its that simple this amounts to nothing more than a tantrum
disband them
not the only victim and its no ones fault but molles for throwing around roles willy nilly if sov attacks are so awful can ccp put the 100b finfleet evaced from a goon station a short while ago back into a goon station
disband the cheaters
wow as if the prior favoritism and devs in bob spawning  for them and other  they do it again gg ccp gg
umadedit much too serious post
i want my name changed to sandy vagina
hahahah like these threads in this forum ever accomplish anythingwhy dont you all emoragequit over it instead would defo keep the forums cleaner of all your drivel
dont like this at all 
i want to be able to change my name too 
ohh damm we killed kenny
poasting in a beaverriffic thread
please explain why it takes 24 hours to leave a corp takes 24 hours to join an alliance takes even 10 hours to destroy a characterbut it takes only a millisecond to insta pop a whole alliance please explain in a legitimate way without bias how this is isnt messed uphours to join an alliance 24hours to destroy a character  101 millisecond to instapop a whole alliance priceless
now i know that my small contribution to ccps coffers makes no real difference but this is likely the proverbial straw which if left unaddressed will break the back of the camel that is my continued subscription to the eveonline servicei am continually losing confidence in ccp as a company in the face of incidents such as this which show blatant favoritism the fact that bob got disbanded due to what some consider a flawed game mechanic has nothing to do with it it has been ccp policy that no name changes occur and this is a complete reversal of that policy to add to this insult the fact that this alliance was able to circumvent a 1000000000 isk fee as well as sov reset well lets just say that i am not exactly happy with ccp at the moment and am feeling the desire to find something more productive to do with my 45 a month in subscription fees and time spent playing eveccp please address this glaring circumvention of established rules if the unwashed masses are forced to follow the rules so should bobkennyrebobwhatever
so how does it feel to be in a group of cheaters i mean its obvious it happened once again and you cant really deny itso how does it feel
your new short name bob is parodies to a existing alliance short name bob it is not the bob corp under goon rule it is and empire war dec alliance lead by maximum yarrage
i donUFFFDt talk to headless man 
awaiting devblog explaining this new feature where any alliance corp or player can change their name
i support the fact that all should be treated equallyedited after reading post made below me
i never thought something like that would go over my lipswellmy fingerswhateverbut the goons are just ing right1 game 1 rule
simple the mechanic you speak of is a quit not a disbandthe quit mechanic is so people cannot wardec and avoid wardecs simply by quitting alliances and corps the disband option has no such exploit associated so it is instant and the executor corp and that ceo is empowered to do anything up to and including disbanding the whole thingfollowing is why he was still allowed to do so bob was complacent and should have payed attentionquote from ccp rulebooksdeclaration of executor supportall corporations in an alliance can declare their support for another corporation to fill the executor role if the present executor does not have the support of more than 50 of the member corporations he cannot act on behalf of the alliance the corporation and its ceo will still be listed as the executor but all administrative functions will be disabled this is indicated by an error message that is displayed whenever usage of such a function is attempted by the executor this means that the alliance is effectively powerless until such time as the support of the executor is restored or a new executor is declared through gaining more than 50 of the support of the member corporations the system will attempt to activate an executor once every 24 hours only when the established executor regains support or a new one is put in place will access to the administrative functions be restoredas the executor of an alliance is in a position of power he must be replaced in cases where he does not possess more than 50 of the support of the member alliances has stopped playing the game or is otherwise unreachable note that changing the ceo of the executor corporation automatically entails that the new ceo is listed as executor the procedure through which executors are changed is based on the declaration of executor support which is a simplified form of voting every corporation in an alliance can modify their support for the executor at any time the default setting is to support the current executor a declaration of support is only valid if a corporation has been a member of the alliance for seven consecutive days the declaration of support is confidential and is only available to the ceo and directors of the corporationthe alliance system constantly checks whether an executor has 50 or more of the support of the member corporations if support drops below 50 the executor will be informed of this through the display of an error message when attempting to use administrative functions
give them all the special treatment you want ccp its not gonna save them and its not gonna make them any less of a hollow husk of an alliance of hasbeens v0v
unf unf unf
i shall be writing a very angry letter to ia about this
molle to alliance  not to fear i will just pick up the bat phone and ccp will help us outwonder if this is t20 strikes back
support this they should have lost all sov if they wished to change there name eula even has a section regarding changing name if the name is offensive the kenzoku alliance name is not an offensive name if you even check in google should ccp decide to keep this they will lose a number of subscriptions due to ccp showing a bias in this decision to allow a change as small as a name to an alliance known for strong connections with ccp eg moon exploit  having 20 control towers setup the same way in 1 system then the moon exploit came out and the towers came downt20  bpo spawns
cookies cake cream and pie was better anywaythis name sucks supporting this because the csm is a farce and cant do crap about this anyway o
quoting dis cause im down
it would be nice to know the developer individual responsible for this decision
cry more post less
traitorme gets the pitchforks
i am for one raging about this particular matter
gotta agree with goons one game one rule

just wait till april 1st guys this is obviously an april fools jokeright d

sorry please dont phone a gm about it 
nobody in eve has a second account brohamjust sayin
says the guy who is the only one to get a mothership back by petition the irony
i support this bandwagon
supporting this
this just in  after careful review ccp has determined that band of brothers reloaded exceeds the alliance name character limit and has corrected the error by shortening it to band of brothersi mean we wouldnt want to break any rules now would we voted 1
hrghrhg damn forums and their ty software
there all bloody engaged atm think its your faultme shakes fist
yah except there is a policy of returning ships lost due to bugs there is also a policy of never providing requested name changes which seems to have been ignored for youi dont expect you to see why this is wrong as bias as you are but it is
dont blame bob but ccp
the issue is not that ken tried it  it is that ccp allowed it broke all the rules in the book and blatantly disregarded their own eula
so does free t2 bpos from devs bob will die soon and proven to an alliance of fail that cant make a stand even with devs help move on goons kick this cheater out of eve
haha i love how you all  over a name change
has it been confirmed that this was ccp intervention or is this just speculationif ccp decided to start providing alliance renaming services what are the rules to request one and how much do they charge
what i would really like to see is a word from ccp just an expl how it could come tothatsure chance is low that it wouldnt make most people here laugh their a offbut anywayand it would spare bob from inventing excuses and pretty empty phrases

ship reimbursement is much like alliance name changes in that both are handled by lhauglhalughaughlaguhlaughlauglhuuhlghulaug
awwww drats did you try the bat phone worked pretty well when haargoth was picking on you
itt bod tries to gain sympathy about use of legitimate game mechanics on thempathetic ccp
bobr should be changed back to kenny they picked it they keep it
why did they get special treatment and be allowed to rename their alliance ccp wouldve told any other alliance no this is just another example of ccp bowing down to their pet alliance
there at least needs to be a full investigation and explanation into how this was allowed
to those threatening to quit can you please for the love of god quit already your inability to emo rage quit properly and not just use it as some kind of pressure tool is the reason that were currently having to cope with lag festsso emo whining gots you are the ones ruining my game now get out traderjohn quit already youve quit when t20 got outed youve quit when you lost your aeon and your alliance got spanked harder than ever in a less laggy situation than whats normal in todays eve and yet youre gonna quit again
who are bobr cant find them ingameno alliance can be found with bobr in the beginning of its name
shame on you again ccp
voting yes not because of goons v bob but because favoritism in the application of rules kills games dead
oh dear im sorry i didnt know i should register on your killboard to post all the ones youre missing im sure it was just an oversightedit i actually have been away for a bit on vacation
band of brothers reloaded is 25 characters long as per the eve online naming policy
what is this bat phone you speak of is it bat shaped or an actual alive bat that has been cunningly implanted with a phone me shudders
maybe your right however ccp did reimburse a bob titan from the eo fight in tribute so maybe you need to check this one aswell thanks
why the  are you whining arent you supperior to them in military might ordidnt you achive glorious victory no you didnt so stfu and fight they are waiting right now and you know it so when it comes down to it goonwagon aint nothing but a bag of stale airlike everyone knows even your buddies will set you red in a while to control the moons you so gloriously got hold of
oh and this is what i meant before 
my vote was to become barbie is 50 then next week become wolverine then to switch off to transformer 2 this summer this is of course while we all play
pretty fuggin gay im sure everyone says they will unsub or this will cost ccp money but tbh we are all still playing after all the other bs thats happenedstill tho this is pretty sad ccps little sandbox not ourshad to edit to quote this little gem i know its your own little special bobgoku meme but i just have to ask how how are you better than anyone dont get me wrong i know you guys started saying it back when you were better than others but now that you are pretty much the same as everyone and havent done jack  of note in ages what have you done to prove to anyone that your better staying docked in pr for a month i guess that makes you better at spinning ships than everyone or what
cue ten gabillion goon and allies alt voting any whiningnot signed
simple dont cheat bob for once atleast
jesus i hope you tards that are complaining quit the game less idiots to listen toincoming wahhhhhhbulancewe are still better than you 
burn
this will be dealt with
bad slave bad
yothats all stuff that happens in game its coolspecial favours from the devs for favoured alliances arent the same thing theyre not so coolkenny dont need dev help theyre better than us
whats up ccp
perhaps they just did it to  you off but your politeness is disturbing
better at self destructing your moross and logging with aggro ive killed you both times when you tried these stunts no its pretty clear that youre failed iteration of terrible alliance isnt even better than atlas or c0ven
only character names that are deemed as inappropriate are eligible for a possible name change names will not be changed for any other reason null
it is not just goons upset by this ccp is giving special teatment to a group of players above and beyond the status quo gbc members should and are just as outraged by this as this is disegards you as a player and basically says the rules apply to most but not all
mayeb kezoku meant somthing very very dirty so got changed but seriously name dont matter we aint going away
says the guy whose alliance leader got totaly legitimate titan loss reimbursed just because gm team is worse then isd deptas my friend justin timberlake said  what goes around comes around we nailed it again gm team still didnt replied to my petition that his avatar loss in 8waz6 should be reimbursed aswell so we could kill it again and again

same rules for everyone
it appears that those who cant win cheat nice one ccp
im so sick and tired of this crap
when i get home from work im gonna make an alliance called band of brothers ed because im witty like that
support fist 09
bias in my eve surely you jest
fully support this looks like ccp will never learn
do it
not fair
disband them please
yes the name doesnt matterthe ignoring of established precedent regarding character corporation or alliance name changes the circumvention of the usual requirements of remaking an alliance spending 1 billion isk and resetting all sovereignty claims ccp preferential treatment yet againthose matter
exactly
while this was most likely just a single employee going off the reservation and can be fixed without disbanding it remains an issue that should be addressed publicly by ccpsupported in the sense that i wish to see rules applied evenly across all players and to see those that cannot be held accountable for their action
heh
so many rules broken this should not have been possible this is not how it should have been done
as csm im not going to touch this with a 10ft pole as person i think this is messed up
i remember after bob were disbanded people sadly joking to each other wait till ccp rename the new alliance back to bob right well even sadder its happened and well this is now headed to easily be the largest csm thread which says a loteveryone should play by the same rules any inconsistency in how these rules are enforced entirely breaks eve as an ecosystem and environmentthis decision should at the very least be reversed whoever is responsible for this within ccp be it a gm dev or isd should be at least named and shamed and if not internally disciplined this is what ia was created for its time to see if the loss of some of eves greatest architects who left due to the creation of ia andor the seachange it instigated in ccps ethos was worth it if no action is taken against any employees or the decision is not reversed it will be a sad day for eve this will be yet another documented publicly displayed im just waiting for this to hit the blogospheremmo news sites example of ccp or someone within ccps favouritism towards this allianceon a side note the maximum character length of an alliance name according to ccps policies is 24 characters why is bobr allowed 25 characters
enough is enough quit with the favouritism
this needs to be investigated
dear bobryou got screwed bad but you also failed to to secure your own executor corp properly if you had properly maintained your own house this would never have been an issue the failure is your own when you let someone whom you have admitted should not have had director roles have and keep them ultimately this is your failure not ccps and they should not give you special treatment when they have acknowledged that nothing improper was done you should lose your new name or pay the price to keep it
unless everyone else can change there names now which in the past we havnt been ale too this is not acceptable and there name should be changed back if they want a new name they need to form a new alliance
seriously i am glad to see that the ccp believes in equal treatment for all
fail exception from the rules is fail
sreegs
i approve this message
i expect rules to apply across all players equally be they friendly  hostile  neutral
shame shame
this is precisely the kind of arrogance that comes from knowing youve got the devs in your pocket has ccp learned anything at all from t20where is the transparency we were promised why are things like this still allowed to happenyes its a dumb rule and really not that big a deal its not like the new name is even good but you know what decisions like this are a sign that maybe one day ccp wont care too much when the rule broken is a big deal and thats a problem
they had several sov 3 systems they should have to sacrifice not to mention the 1 bil alliance forming fee so it does matter since other alliances dont have this optionsame rules should apply to everyone an alliance that has previously been the beneficiary of developer misconduct isnt a particularly smart choice for receiving special treatment

that is delicious and to expand on rule number fourplayerrun corporations factions organizations and playerowned items within the eve online game world are also subject to these rules and policies players may not create promote or be a member of a group that violates the policies outlined herein membership or participation in such a group may result in character deletion temporary suspension or termination of a subscribers accountso basically all of bobr must disband or be bannedyeah your choice
right because we care
ass clowns cop oneditdunno how to give the golden thumbs up thing sry
bob getting unfair treatment from the devs well i never
ccpget your act together you cant keep favoring one group and allowing them full run of the game without having to follow the rules i dont care which devsfounderswhatever you have in bobr it needs to stop
i would really like to hear what kind of explanation we will get about this if we get any
arkanondo your jobedit after ccp grimmi posted the lead gm positionthe problem i have with ccps rationale is 2 fold1 the kenzoku alliance already was in existence before bob disbanded i know i fought them as kenzoku and watched them diebefore the whole haargoth fiasco just because new corps join does that allow them to rename the entire alliance can goonswarm do the same every time a new corp joins2 other alliances whose names have had mispelings or captilization errors were told to re do it from scratch stian alliance  sudden death squad but former bobkenzoku gets to find a gm willing to bend the rules just for them when ars caelestis my former corp was forcibly disbanded by our ceo he camped the corp name so we couldnt reform under it ars ex discordia didnt just emigrate en masse to an alt corp though we reformed under our own new name ars ex discordia after putting a days worth of thought and effort into it ccp would not let the 200  players keep the corp name over the single ceo that had taken it from us but we made do and grew from it the fact that bobr or bob or rkz or whatever name they want to be called this month cant do it and need to have gms interfere on their behalf is not only disingenuous but also shows faults with the way in which their leadership  the gms involved handle things
signed
finally the csm can do its intended job
3 violationsa if a name is deemed inappropriate gms may be able to change the characters name in some circumstances this is solely at the discretion of ccp andor its representatives based on but not limited to account and player history and the severity of the violation there is no guarantee that the name will be changed only character names that are deemed as inappropriate are eligible for a possible name change names will not be changed for any other reasonbfrom

how to fight loneliness
why would ccp give preferential treatment over something this foolish do the developers and moderators ignore the rest of the tos this travesty must be addressed
smile all the time
one game one rule
are you guys from wall street or something how out of touch can you get ever heard of appearance of impropriety im theorizing that such concept does not exist in icelandic culturejust rename this game to bobs playground and get it over with
shine you teeth til meaningless
the same rules must apply to all players
inb4 ccp comes in and bans everyone who supported this and then renames eve online to bob online where you have to have a history of mmo exploitation to register an accountedit in after the ccpbob man orgy
one game one rule
while i can understand the concern with ccp potentially showing favoritism towards bob especially given past incidents here i do think the whole alliance disbanding thing was somewhat of a mitigating factor still if its a serious issue to some people i could see a demand for action although right now it seems to be primarily bobs enemies and alts postingwhat i dont understand is the demand to disband bob even the original post quite clearly states that this would be a case of developer misconduct and the solution to this is totake it out on players how does that deal with developer misconduct if you were calling out the person who approved this and whether that was an unbiased decision sure but asking for bob 20 to be disbanded is just silly and to me screams of ulterior motivesif you lose a ship due to a known and confirmed in game bug and petition it should the gm simply destroy all ships you own if he feels this wasnt a bug after allthis basically screams like another forum attention stunt by the goons  co
interesting how these things tend to break in favor of one group
alliances cannot be renamed if an alliance wants to change its name it must first disband potentially losing all its sov then reform under the new name  if it doesnt want to risk it then the old name standsthis is the way its always been and the rules have been blatantly ignored in kenzokus favor whats so hard to understand
its pretty bad that we even need threads like this
change the name back they can be called whatever they want imho but they should do it in exactly the same way that the rest of us have to
waaaah no
the point isnt to delete the alliance to be punitive but rather that kenzoku would have had to disband itself and pay the fees  lose sov to reform disbanding bob reloaded merely mitigates the damage donesure it isnt a big deal but its fair
so whats up with beaver bros anyway

oh silly beavers
this is unacceptable ccp havent you learnt anything from the t20 incident
sometimes i wonder what you guys would do without bob in the game you would have nothing to blindly lash your anger out at people in all nc alliances have been fed such crap and rumors they cant see they are a worse plauge on this game than any other entity ever was or will be
yes bobs ability to manipulate ccp into maintaining a second set of rules on bobs behalf is out of control and has been abided for too longthis should have happened after t20 or when molle cheated his first titan back from max
if we decided to change our alliance name to remedialsucks rsux without losing sov id be ed too
seriously all this crying is making me lmfaoyou already disbanded bob once and to prevent them to counter anything you want to disband them again the most that you could demand is to change the name back disbanding the old alliance under a new name you goon muppets just made me lol  internetspaceships in front of a girl p
i vote no unless ccp wants to let me change my name to nose mcgillicutty id prolly still vote no tbqh
without bob wed have a game without a group of people being blatantly favored man what a crazy world
sticking to old graphics does not make a game turn into world of warcraft it turns a game into ultima online eventually kills it off and turns it into something only weird fringe groups of players enjoy for years to comewith the latest upgrade eve did just make up for the amount of visual quality that it fell behind in comparison to state of the art games from what i have seen from what ccp has shown and from what needs to happen for eve to remain successful there will be much more drastic improvements in the near and medium futureyes at some point your computer will no longer be able to run the game that is the point where you have to make your twiceadecadeupgrade to your hardwareforcing one player to do that including the risk of losing him is insignificant to the chance of gaining ten new players ccp is not a charity crib and support of outdated graphics would cost a lot of money without any relevant additional yield

i know this might come as a shock to you but some people actually play this game to get away from rl money issues the only reason i can play this game in fact is due to etcs that i buy with isk dont get me wrong i love this game but im the sole wage earner in a family of four so money is tight in this house and eve is a great escape without costing a fortuneif the op means trading in most or all of the value of an etc for a character transfer im supporting this thread
i tend to agree with this while its a nice idea and all there are more important issues
no there are ramifications being overlooked herenot supported
there is ramificationslike ccp making more money because of the decreased barrier to entrythe increased velocity of isk it will cause trough the plex marketwhat is being overlooked i could say that you overlooked something too without even substantiating my claim thats too easy
use you head manthink about ittrading characters with plexsthats just the startits already way to easy to generate iskbypassing ccps fee would make it very easy to kick chars around without restraint
it merely decreases the barrier to entry as far as im aware ccp still makes the money from the plex someone eventually have to pay for the feeyour statement inherently assumes that trading characters is bad while theres a point to be made you dont actually make any
your assumption is wrongi said it was way too easythat alone could lead to problems
too easy in what sense i dont see any reason that this ought to be difficult its a 20 fee and some information disclosure asis this would just change the fee from 20 to 17475 and let you pay someone else isk to cover the fee for you itd be about as easy as before its just a lot more convenient
awesome idea you should also be able to pay with regular gtc if you do so you get a transfer and 30 days get added to your subscribtion
you are wrongplayers pay 20 euro but ccp never gets all of it because you are using a credit card you are making a transaction and charge tax from that transaction is already included in character transfer feeno one will charge you or ccp for using items already existing in game in your hangar for example plex so yes plex equal character transfer fee
get over itthank you that is all
most useful thread on the forums in 3 years
hey guys look at me im the worst fc in beaver
scared and isnt that the pot calling the kettle blackyou all emoragewhined your back into your precious name of bob even thought ccp has never allowed a name change of anything at a player request ever
i just want to know what are the new rules for requesting alliance renaming and how much do ccp charge for this servicei really dont care what exbobs decide to call themselves i just want to know what the rules of the game are
hello we were pooned by those terrible metagamers we should get our alliance back right now we have never done anything to deserve this

thank you captain obvious even a guy without 10 years in mmos xp can figure that little tidbit out my problem is that my stuff isnt appearing there or at the place i bought the item ill post when i have a problem and cant figure out wtf is wrong thats what forums are for to bad if you dont like when i started or how much xp i have ingamethanks dest yah ive looked through my journal and assets the money was taken out but theres no journal entry stating when or why it was taken out and nothing has appeared in my assets though 16 hours after i posted this the ship did indeed appear in my inv why it took so long is beyond me
oh maybe you forgot to check and now your covering it upwelcome to eve
i wont talk smack like drake but i will say this  whether your problem is real or not you picked a terrible way to deal with it petitions bug reports even other forum categories are better ways of dealing with this than submitting a badlywritten and unclear bug report to a group whose turnaround time for even the smallest of issues is several months i dont know whether it was a problem with the game or your stupidity and really i dont much care but i can tell you that your issue is not one the csm can deal with sanely and youre wasting your time trying this is an agency who deals best with systematic problems  bug reports have no place here unless theyre on that scale
i think it would be useful to be able to set how emergency warp behavesfor instance a delay option would be useful for people who still suffer the socket closed error on a regular basis or simply dont want to go to warp if they disconnect for whatever reason one to have your ship activate all modules that do not require a target or charges would be useful as well
making logoffski even more overpowered you saynot a chance in my mind
too much potential for abuse no support
how does staying on grid make logoffski more powerful you have an immobile unpiloted ship around that cant activate modules  thats significantly less powerful than the status quo im against this if it is actually abusable but im not seeing it at first glance
the post mentions to active all modules which doesnt require lock or targetso basically activate the tank
if this can be done without increasing lag i support it
totally unsupported pumping the scan button is only a mouse click just like all other funtions and sorry about youre wrist and all but this is making it a lot easier for low00 sec dwellers to stay safe spamming to scan button is not hard to do and the ones that dont know how to use the dscan are the ones who get caught out this would be a nerf to pirates and pvpers etc and a boost to low sec missioners and ratters
i support this on general principlehowever the onboard scanner needs some severe changes anyway in time for the upcoming 00 local nerf the new scanner would hopefully include autoscan as well as other features
delayed mode local would be an enhancement not a nerf i cant wait
heres the problem it probably canti dont support this topic i think local and intelligence gathering needs an entire overhaul patching up by automating a task for the player is not my idea of how to fix a problem
the overview is somehow able to work in autoscan mode without any problems up to a point pulling significantly more information from the server than a scanner ever needsperhaps the overview needs a scan button to place the action burden on the player and alleviate some server stress right
why dont we have this the thing where you hold your left click down and make a square and select multiple items if anyone wants clarification
good idea i would prefer this over the shift select option which we have now
all the new shiny stuff is nice and all but i care more about balancing the game eventually we might have so much new content in the end it will be very hard to balance it all so please start balancing the game not everybody might agree on some areas but there is a need of looking into this stuffthere is alot of issues that needs to be adress overpowered or not  ecmcaldari reconseccm artillery minmatar bscapitals blackops marauders for pvp shield tanks on armor tanking ships currently you see shield tanks on armortanking ships more often which is just wrong such as a harbinger brutix myrmidon  hyperion t1 cruisers such as the scythe  augorour that need a buff so you will see them used more in pvp  other areas make them usefull instead of forgetting them  stealth bombers blastersthis is just for pvp but i can imagian there is some stuff that needs fixing in industry
and ofcourse i support my own idea
ah matar fanboy there i seei support the rebalance of the game but not if that means to even more overpower matar ships
ah amarr fanboy there i seei support the rebalance of the game but not if that means to nerf my awesome versatility of the fotm amarr
overpoweryou obviously dont know minmatar ships do youthis coming from an amarr known to be the largest dps output race in the gameyeah thats rich whats next jovian tech needing to be introduced
and dont forget blasters being unable to track anything in their optimal since the web nerf
ill add that to the list
i really think that ankh was kidding i sure hope so anyways
i dont use blasters so i dont know just making a list that should be looked into balanced or not if he was kidding thx for ing up the thread
how about we try to stick to one thread instead of creating others that way we can get this issue taken care of more quickly and efficientlyoriginal threadthanks
im sorry m8 didnt saw that one  going to help you out with this one please ignore this thread people
1 ok add named bpcs for modulesthat means every missioneer would have to go through an industrialist to get his modsnice thought so industrialists get an even bigger share again2 mining profession not profitable hmm lets see its boring but not unprofitable its about willing to pay you miners could try to sell trit for 8 isk now that shutles are out of the way but you dont its a free market system so dont try to ride it out on other professions3 no inflation but deflation where do you live that might be true for easily available t1 t2 and faction stuff from the lpshop mind you but not for everything thereive seen annoyling increase in prices over the last monthsand while farmable stuff like cnrs etc are going down the loot only deadsapce and officer stuff is increasing even more not that the stuff should be common ofc but the isk flowing into the system allows for higher prices there 4 hmm cruiser costing 1015m hmm and where do you think should a new player get that money from instead of grinding two weeks for a cruiser now a month for the oloder players 5m more or less isnt the question but cruisers are a beginners ship too but hell what do you care
i think youd be better off saying that level 4 missions give out too many minerals which makes mining rather redundant and fairly pointless rather than giving out your own fix let ccp decide how to solve the problem definitely supporting that level 4s give out way too many minerals level 4s build all of my battleships quite easily with the exception of a little bit of zydrine 
i assume those are in response to me 3 the overall economic data accumulated by dreyjog indicated steady and prolonged deflationary tendencies in the economy dating from essentially revelations in late 2006 and barring t2 prices in the wake of the dysprosium supply being cut by a third that trend seems to have continued from all the various market data ive looked at trit is up because the low prices of it were always artificial but all the other minerals are down and t1 ship prices are edging ever closer to insurancescam values  battleships have all dropped 1020 in the last year and a half since i started looking at their prices im not in the market for officer gear so i cant comment on what prices have done there but really its a sideline to the economy as a whole  meta 05 is 95 of the economy and if prices there are dropping then i call it deflation i dont care nearly so much what happens to the price of an old l4 missioners pimpedout officer fit as i do what happens to the price of a cheap pvp battleship a newbies first cruiser or the meta 35 fits of the above4 most of the players i know who have gone through a newbie grind well had 10 mil in their first week before they got into their first cruiser in order to have some fallback cash if you play decently do things intelligently and sell your drops at a profitand jump on a lucky drop worth 5 mil which happen often enough even in l1 missions youre fine for money admittedly most new players arent my gamergeek friends who optimize in their sleep and dont have experienced players to give them tips on how to progress through the game but it is certainly possible to progress quickly as a new player even if cruisers were somehow to double in pricewhich incidentally is an outcome nobody even mentioned as a possibility before you suggested we were asking for it new players managed to do just fine in the early days when ships sold at far closer to base pricesie millions above where they are now it wouldnt cripple them to be in the same position again now that said im not advocating cruiser prices doubling itd almost certainly be bad for the game i just dont think itd be a catastrophe like you suggest and i certainly dont think itd happen under any conceivable change to the economy

that is a good question i dont think it has to be i think the party could make its goal to maintain the freedom to enjoy eve with the widest variety of styles of play change can be good as long as it doesnt interfere with that goalissler
so if industry is thriving and wellsupported but pirates are getting the shaft from ccp this party would be fighting for their play style to get more love instead of your own somehow that seems unlikely  even if that was how you wanted to do things you couldnt sanely call that an industrialist party its always tempting to state your goals broadly to make yourself sound unassailably virtuous and pluralistic but its really not accurate to do so youre not forming an industrialist party to make sure that the widest variety of careers work youre forming it to help industrial careers work theres nothing wrong with that but its not the same as what youre saying here as for pengins question i see no need for a bear party to be conservative  for example removing item drops from npcs is a thoroughly radical proposal and yet a lot of the industrial players seem to favour it strongly similarly many bears were thoroughly opposed to the status quo on suicide ganks several months ago and lobbied hardand successfully to get it changed theres no real reason why a party with a goal that is not the status quo needs to embody the cautious approach towards change that constitutes a conservative mindset
let me say this first im a carebear and proud of it however i think a carebear party if you will is illogical there will be some representation from carebears in any council so long as the industrial sector actually gives enough attention to vote if not the pirate party will win the election easilythat being said there are some hot button issues for the industrialists  most notably the t1 manufacturing sector removing t1 meta 0 loot from npcs  still waiting on feedback from ccp and the mining overhaul making it interesting and not an afkeasy activity ive supported these issues and worked tirelessly on ways to implement them but were waiting on ccps feedback in order to progress any further
interesting and very vague start now lets get down to what you propose and how you will vote are you mainly for pvp or pve and no i dont believe you will be evenly split what changes would you propose to make the game better how much time and effort are you willing to devote to the csm as its not an easy job or are you just here for the free tripthese questions will help people better get an idea of who you are and what you stand for answer them or not its your choice

here on barrage you are hugely wrong any decent minnie pilo will tell you barrage is god if anything it is possibly the best t2 ammo around admittedly on frigates the diffrence is less noticable but on even a muninn or ruture wiht good skills barrage will get you a faloff of 1415km rather than 910km and that gives you a huge advantage in certain circumstances not to mention the vagabond where you can get well over 20km falloff over 30kms if you faloff rig it which now post qr is not unreasonable and on larger ships i like cheap rigged tempests you can get 45km faloff while you dont do max damage when fighting in faloff obviously any minmatar will tell an eft warrior that thats where they fight so the eft figures presented are not real not that they every are anyway my point is thats where we minmatar pilots fight and while it is not perfect and i would love an extra 200 falloff that would just be silly vagas with up to 60km faloff or tempests with 90km remember at optimal  faloff you do 12 damage not 0 thats at optimal  2x faloff as for null yes its kind of broken but again 200 would just be silly it would also change the way each races close range guns are balanced amarr longest but low tracking high damage minmatar short but able to go longer but for loss of dps good tracking lowish base damage many minmatar ships have 2 damage bonus while amarrgallente have just one to make up for this gallente short good tracking which some might not believe but check stats and high damage i would be more in favour of a 3035 increase in both optimal and falloff rather than the 25 atm however one problem null faces is not so much that its really that bad but more the idea that blasters must be used at point blank range
there are situations when you want the 145 extra damage and where you will not miss any shot so it has a role a fairly limited one but it still offers an advantage one almost as good as training the specialization skill a level and when you have that at 5 already you look for more opportunities to increase your damagevardemis

i support this for chribba only
i approveplease visit your user settings to reenable images
i think this is absolutely brilliant would be a touch of class if ccp approves this i think would also allow for the noobs to have an epic pilgrimage to come see the mythical titans of nullsec  which in turn means more noobs to gank along the way
this is a fantastic idea
for chribba
seems like a fun lighthearted thing to do
chribba has done so much for the community at large damn anyone complaining about favouritismfully supported
yes so long as there is a doomsday on it in case you fall under attackif you use one of the many services that chribba has set up for us all you should support this1
support  love for this
ok
id never support this because unlike a good few people it seems im not some blatent hippocrite that whines about bob name change in one breath then thumbs this up with the nexti dont care how many ad revenue sites you ownuntil ccp comes out with some proper rules back up by graphs and barcharts properly showing the results for your ingame character has to be considered at least this important to get devs to artificially change the ingame world to the way you want it to be my stance isnt really going to change
dd mining oh yes
chribba is insanesupported none the lessjust cause it would be hilarious if it happened really
avatars in amarr arent unprecedented
this
as a advertising medium the titan would be priceless free chribbaa titan from the shackles of null space
noooo its against the rules ccp favortism
i for one think it would make the amarr homeworld justice
chribba is cool so yes give him his prize if you dont know how cool chribba is i feel for you i truely doafterthoughtif this doesnt happen you can always use the titan to answer the age old question  how many rookie ships does it take to gank a titan in 0104 space5k titan ganking rookie fleet
yes we can
caod was never worth reading
what you didnt like the threads about destroying our onepos industrial backbone and how well never be allowed into 00 again
massive support here even if i dont have a carrier and will probobly never get the mom i want
please fix this insane problem
it is unacceptable that this physics change allows capships to move faster than my rifter please fix
general emilio approves this messagemaybe they didnt bother testing capitals bumping each other since thats not what they were trying to change
this does not only affect capital ships also a rat just bumped with structure and ended up like 160 away from it went there at 800ms
please fix this soon
fix is due out next wednesday according to the patch notes
indeedwe discussed it with ccp this weekend and it was a known bug which was fixed on their internal server
hey thanks for the supportnice to see things getting fixed
supported
indeed missile batteries have long been a bad joke
nobody even bothers to use them another totally useless item in the game please change this
supported needs a fix
please ccp fix this 
i really support this i mean the current system is just absued too much yes a new system can also lead to unfair situations but having ppl roaming around and when they are trapped just log off is ridicoulus its fighting without taking the concequences
well that would be a very welcomed changed indeed hope ccp will fix this
i like this idea as well as the ops also in this thread the log off timer like other mmos that counts down while you stay connected and can see your ship to allow you to defend yourself if attacked before your ship disappears and can be canceled if that situation occurs
1i dont like the ops suggestion but this sorts it
i totally support this
how many more years will the logoffskies have to continuethanks for all the goodness you add to eve ccp but this exploit really needs to be solved once and for alltotally supporting this thread
i will thumbs up this but i have to ask wasnt this a feature we always had up until apocrypha
agreeing i find it annoying to go through the repair menu
makes sense to me
my main incentive to stay out of 00 space is the tendancy for gates from lowsec to 00 to be camped by either pirates or alliances who have control freak issues ove entire regions one has to rent permission at ludicrous prices from these people to be allowed past their doors without being killed and then podkilled on sighteven in a shuttle going outand nearly every access point to 00 seems to belong to someone lately so i stay in highsec and the occasional trip through lowsec due to the inevitable death awaiting me if i so much as try to enter nosec
its not inevitable death there are many ways to get through owned systems its just a matter of a little knowhow and practice despite what they want you to think the alliances dont control anything outside thier own pos shields and the targetting range of the blobs i highly advise joining up with a 00 corp for a while to learn the techniques for flying without concord protection once you learn to survive in 00 without permission from others there is no place in the galaxy you cannot fly

i bet ccp will not do it because it would require them to have some balls just like they chickened out on gambling and mature game content if ccp really passionately wanted to make their game cool they wouldnt let external organizations push them around like that
i too support chocolate teapots and other such completely pointless things with no purpose
id love to support it but given the current state of the esrb rating system and the one in europe cant remember its name offhand you cant show tobbaco use or alcohol use for that matter or promote its use in a teen rated gamei work in the games field and actually had to remove giant floating beer bottles out of a fantasy sporting venue in a volleyball game before it could pass the ratings bar in europeah heckill support it anyhow even if its not going to make it
in the tos they say that you agree that you are at least 18 years or older if you subscribe to the game sounds old enough to smoke in most countries of the world
do not support we dont need smoking in eve
yes please tell us more so they arent very useful atm shrug its not like we have no other ships to choose from treat them like they dont exist yet will get useful one day when ccp gets some nice ideas for them worked out  or not doesnt really matter eve doesnt need those ships theres plenty others to choose from1 i very much doubt they are countless what you probably meant is more than you cared to count which to me translates to probably 23 none of the very important2 you dont really want to whine about past aka fixed issues  do you what would be the point of thatlow sec seems fine to mei can only assume that you think it doesnt give you as much reward as youd like compared to hisec shrug  nonproblemin what way is a trit shortage an issue and not a trade opportunityhere are some ideas that i could come up with at a moments thought1 not everything you plus a bunch of others or not consider an issue is an issue2 some things arent easy to fix even if agreed that it is an issue3 some things simply arent important enough to put limited resources into youre probably right with this onelargely true  i guess though many do come backreally  if anybody left the game because a few ships have design issues or there is a shortage of trit in the drone regions  err  well  good riddanceplus  i dont see how they will manage to find greener pastures  itll probably be a neverending tale of testing new game  oohh  exciting  damn found some issues  next gameits not like other mmos are flawless and most attempt to do much less than evei can only speak for myself here  but theres still not a single mmo on market that  imho  comes close to what eve does ymmv of course so even a flawed eve  for me at least well and close to 300k other people obviously  is better than another probably also flawed mmoi dont follow other mmos closely  but can you give a couple of examples but be prepared to be laughed at if it is a mmo with much simpler feature sets which of course covers most of them its much easier to fix a bike than a space shuttlesee above rather obvious i thinkwhat astounds me about messages like this is that this is so obviously not true

plenty of old issues have been fixed a recent one was speed gone wild    its just that those then are forgotten very quickly  and of course newer players dont know they every existedbut more importantly  its not just ccp being in love with new features  its clearly players demanding them theres plenty of whinethreads about qr lacking in features  while ccp was busy reducing lag  which was the most requested feature everthey ccp cant win thisnew features  fix issues firstfixing issues  where are the cool features is eve stagnatingthanks for providing 2 great example1 user moddable ui i get that this is important to you and why not  we all have our personal preferences to me its a nice to have but im fine with current ui meanwhile to me usermoddable ui doesnt make my top 10 list2 possov  almost universally agreed that this could use some serious changing  including ccp they already said they want to and plan to change it do you really think they keep this on the backburner because  well  why really do you believe they havent totally changed one of the most important mechanics of 00 existenceperhaps  im just guessing here   perhaps because its not an easy thing to change and we dont need just any old change  we need an improvement a big improvement actually to make the effort and disruptions worthwhile hm  sounds to me like a big deal with designers brainstorming over it for months constantly debating consequences devs doing tests environments qa feeding back problems etcerr what new sov mechanics are a new feature or did you just want to finetune the number of days to gain next sov level dont think soand again we have an example of something thats important to some and unimportant to othersimho low sec is ok as it is theres danger when i transport something and theres a decent chance i can find some action when we fly a combat gang looking for pirates yes  i know its pretty easy to make good money in high sec doing mining or missions but  shrug  so what perhaps low sec is not a big money maker most of the time for most people easy solution  dont go there problem solvedto me low sec provides an occasional challenge on route to someplace else or a nearby place to find some limited action if i want to make big bucks i can slave in empire or go directly to 00 again with occasional low sec gate camps on the waywhy actually do you think it needs fixinglist of a zillion featuresissues small and bigyou do realize that the amount of effective work you get out of devsdesignersqa is limited and that the list of such people at ccp is also limited dont get me started on how productivity per person gets down when too many people are on a team  see mythical man month given that theres just no way to fullfill yourour wishlist  even in the very few cases where we all agree on the need for a fix  in a short time
i think ccp have been concentrating on things under the hood such as stackless io new blades and database optimisations these frankly are the most important as they affect everyone in the entire gamein addition they bring out new content every 68 months and are working on wis walking in stationsmaybe they need to continue on the under the hood stuff but slow down their new content deployment and spend more time concentrating on external issues that affect players im sure people would happily have a slower content expansion in exchange for issues being resolved more quickly
glen seriousall what i see in all those posts is you talk like you work at ccp which you dont if so post with your main you seem to be trying your best to make the op a fool while everybody atleast i am understands him we might not agree on surtain details which is just fine nobody ever agrees on the details anyway so the basic idea that the op is trying to bring is that ccp should focus more on balance issues then bringing the shiny stuff but do not act like somebody is uber stupid and you know all better if you really care about the game and the community which you should if you post in csm area i suggest you try to help the op better to formulate his ideaissue better if we would discard every single idea in the game just because one person doesnt agree then this game wouldnt be at the point where it is now to the op i would suggest you remove the list because people will just pick you off and try to make your post like  just bring the issue on table which is there should be more focus on balance
then explain one fact to me  why is it that so many other game balance changes from video game updates to board and card game addendums can be made by other companies so quicklyother games that are just as complex have changes made very quickly eve nope issues that are known to be horribly unbalanced take months or years to addresstake for example autotraining which existed in eve for a short time moving modules to or from a ship would train a relevant skill very slowly adding up to a lot of skill points very quickly this change was added and removed very very quickly take blatant exploits as another example plenty of changes are made very very quicklycommon sense in game design does not require months of mulling over or contemplation for validation nor do the actual code changes take any longer than weeks in the case of even the most complex ccp themselves are evidence of this theyve moved quickly in the pastblack ops are a fine example ccp know theyre broken they came into the game intentionally broken the csm board has reminded them of this do you honestly think it takes over a year to brainstorm a solid design for them if so you havent a clue about game design and youre lacking common senseyour fanboi post is admirable i love eve ive loved it since beta but closing ones eyes and expelling hot air as defense isnt going to get anything done
also a few highlights from your post to illustrate your naiveteso what your saying is just continue to condone ccps lack of action on a balance issue and then the problem goes away great idea lets do what glen says and just wait a few more years ccp can just get to black ops when they feel like it with ambulation on the way who cares about black ops rightthats funny because low sec isnt fine ccp knows it isnt fine theyve known it isnt fine see where your voluntary ignorance gets you you think low sec is fine yet low sec isnt fine others acknowledge the problem you dont is it still a problem yes has it been a problem for years yesignoring a problem is not a solution do you honestly think solving this particular problem takes years of thoughtyour above comment is laughable financialeconomic exploits such as the recent massive pos exploit in eve also present great trade opportunities does that make it good game design in your little worldjust because opportunities are presented does not suddenly validate a design choicedismissing ccps lack of action or simply pleading ignorance to a problem is not going to get these issues solved your hot air and apologetics are sort of sweet in an innocent way but they arent going to solve problems
actually aside from the speed nerf in qr which wasnt welcomed by the player baseit got twice as many votes against as for and the lag fixes around the time of qrwhich i think everybody was thoroughly grateful for i cant really think of any youre right that qr was a fixtheold expansion but it was about the only one also i think most of the flak it got for that was because they promised an industrial expansion and all the industrialists felt let down by the last minute swap in focus not because people minded the lack of features per se 1 on the surface i agree it looks minor that said go find people who play a game that has itmost notably wow and ask them what they think of it and it wont sound minor at all to hear my wowplaying friends talk anyone who doesnt have at least 20 mods installed just isnt trying and the lack of them makes them a worse player it means ccp never needs to touch the ui again and every player gets to play with the perfect interface compared to the garbage we have now 2 i know and i approve but the csm brought it up close to a year ago and the mechanic has been fundamentally the samecapture the flag with industrial stations ever since sov was brought in way back in 2005 yes its a big change and yes it takes a while but my point is that if it was higher on the priority list wed be a lot closer to having it done than we seem to be youre right i cant say outright that it wont come with a whole package of new features but most of the proposals ive heard wouldnt qualify  stargate control a militaryspecific pos these things really arent anything youd stick on a box to advertise the gamelowsec improvements are only unimportant to people who would never go to lowsec anyways seriously have you looked at lowsec ores the single worst ore in the game is lowseconly and all three of the lowsec ores are worth significantly less than stuff you can find trivially in highsec level 5 missions are to my understanding another halfimplemented waste of time that very few people bother with ratting got a boost recently which i approve of and the existence of copying and me lines helps things too but theres still very little to draw people there other than pirates wanting to fight each other thats not good for the game yes of course i realize that this is why im not saying fix these and do everything else you were going to do and i want a pony im talking about a reprioritization here with a full understanding that that means i have to give some things up  in this case the rate of addition of new features and nobody ever said any of this should be done tomorrow i am not a moron i understand that it takes time and that a company like ccp cant turn on a dime im not asking for it all to be patched in over downtime tonight i am however asking for a broad shift in focus that will over the long term increase the amount of old features which get reviewed and improved at the cost of the rate of addition of new features please dont insult my intelligence and try to keep to attacking my position on its actual merits and demerits

ive got two suggestions tied to eachother remove csm altogether relocate those resources spent on csm to customer relation advisor like companies uses a press contact that instructcommunicate with customerspressthe reasonsccp have through the years a multitude of examples where their contacts with customers other companies and press gone wrong ill illustrate a few more famous ones1 t20  the case of a biased gm isnt remarkable in itself its known in several older mmos that this happens whats remarkable is ccps treatment of this situation the player who found this out was permabanned while the gm involved got to stay at work no need to comment more than that its quite obvious how this looks in the eyes of the general publicplease note i merely point out ccps flawed behaviour here no comment regarding the alliance involved2 ghost training changes  it was just executed without notice quite a severe affect on the game as a whole and multiple examples of ccp mistakes including one where their game info describe this is as a feature and during the player uproar this is changed without a wordplease note i merely point out ccps flawed behaviour here no comment on the changes itself if it was goodbad3 boxed game  eve boxed game was released with the information that you would get a gtc and a special edition ship included turns out you need to activate the gtc with a fresh new nonbuddy invited account to get the ship for one and the gtc on a new account makes it pretty redundant as well today you can do a buddy invite and get a 21 day trial  30 day credit on your account ie effectively 7 weeks alt for free the gtc in the box gives a 8 weeks character for the fee of the box so effectively the promised items on the box isnt delivered or at least not specificed for what it really isplease note  im extremely biased in this question as i bought the box for vanity reasons a own box b own ship c use gtc on existing account4 kenzoku goes bob reloaded  this is just another example if we look at it from a neutral standpoint the instantremoval of an alliance is understatement quite a major blow having their alliance name is a major insult and another big blow but still theres game rules that clearly state that name changes doesnt happen unless it violate rules in this case ccp does exactly the same as with the ghost training oops we dont know our own rules eh it was a typo in the descriptionplease note  once again this is ccps mistake not bobkenbobr i merely point out ccps flawed behaviour in this case5 csm  it is the followup of the t20 incident we players were promised an internal affairs group of players that would investigate so nothing fishy is going on at ccp well today it functions as a pr campaign from ccp to divert player attention to csm from ccp oh crap players are unhappy uhm talk to csm theyll bring it up at a meeting and we can discuss it no transparency that was promisedplease note  i merely point out ccps flawed behaviour in this case no personal opinion about currentpreviousfuture csm candidates hell i even respect this and make this post in the fashion ccp reinvited csm to
soi could go on but lets stop here youre bored of this post i am bored of ccp not learning to communicate with players the simple solution would be to just remove csm as they are costing real life money for little payout what ccp badly needs is someone that can teach them how to communicate with customers this is the vital key issuetheres nothing wrong with this game its arguably the best mmo on market the playerbase is awsome and many gms are helpful and do a good job as well personal experience might be flawed but i like emjust put the money to better use hire someone to teach ccp communicate
i agreei dont think anybody will disagree that goonswarms spy games was kind of a cheap shot on bob but you know what it was a cheap shot within the rulesi think ccp just demonstrated a disturbing lack of judgment if they think they can bend the rules for bob again without outcryi didnt have much faith in the csm to begin with but now its patently obvious that they cant even fulfill their primary purpose which was to be a watchdog for developer misconduct
thanksi am trying to keep this off the discussions regarding these issues those discussions are better held elsewhere nice to see you read all points
wrong t20 was never a gm as far as im aware she spawned bpos sure but your argument is fundamentally wrongyou are totally ignoring evidence which was put forward by ccp on the issueim sorry what exactly does the box promiseyou are making assumptions based on things you have no clue about wait till a public statement is made about it you are also ignoring simple facts here like the fact that a gm can change a name on his own discretion mind you the gm team is always being watched by internal affairs so even if it is abused it will be found outwrong the nyt article was flawed this has been addressed over and over again go and read the official csm whitepaper about the role of the csmyour arguments are flawed and biased you dont state fact as much as you state things entirely out of context and often with totally wrong details
i agree with you on the rest of it but what are you really saying here corruption is bad when a gm does it but dev corruption is fine im fairly strident about how bad some parts of this game are but really the 1980sera mail client reflects far less badly on ccp than the fact that t20 wasnt ridden out of town on a rail not to mention the  ban aside from getting the job description wrong op is exactly right about this incident i disagree with his solution of course but its still a problem
too bad they didnt include a tinfoil hat in the box as thats what you really need after reading the forums
the point that the op made was solely about misconduct by a customer support agent note the case of a biased gm isnt remarkable in itself its known in several older mmos that this happens he makes the connection that other games have had biased gms because there was not talk about a gm here its flawedi agree that its just as bad im merely pointing out flawed argumentation
well vista what good has the csm accomplishedim perfectly willing to accept the csm if you can prove that ccp has done anything based on the csms wishesthe ny times article may have been misinterpreted or whatever but that doesnt change that the original catalyst that resulted in the csms formation was the t20 incident ccp said they wanted more player oversight over their actions how is the csm anything other than a useless figurehead if ccp is still allowed to bend rules whenever they want without consulting the csm at allwheres the transparency we were promised gm grimmis statement didnt explain anything and didnt clarify the rules whatsoever it didnt explain which circumstances allow you to petition for a name change it didnt explain why the new alliance name is longer than allowed for anyone else it didnt explain why kenzoku deserved a name change ccp designed the game with safeguards built in so that you cant just disband an alliance bob chose to remove those safeguards to operate more efficiently leaving themselves vulnerable why do they get sympathy what happened to them was fair under the rules and the solution they got from it wasnt end of story
lets see1 orca2 weapon stacking3 skill queue4 plex system as a response to the uproar about 30day gtcs being taken out5 the possiblity of a 00 overhaulsee the csm minutes6 assembly arrays getting a boost7 suicide ganking balancing8 module cycle timerad theres more stuff in the pipeline im sure the problem with interacting with a company is that despite using agile methods that its not all the agile they work on 4 monthschedules which means that csm2 wont see the fruit of its labour till maybe even csm4 takes office so the fact we had so many features already implemented into the game is really excellent imo a catalyst just makes things go faster however thats quite different from causality i agree entirely that the t20 incident made the leadership of ccp realize that xhagens idea for a csm was really goodi think you are speculating a bit too much i have no idea how much i can say due to my nda however just trust me when i say that you are making a wrong assumption i agree with you entirely im not very pleased with the statement either exactly the csms stance is also quite clear on this nothing warranted that the name should have been changed
and wed give this up times x100 if there could be no more dev sponsored cheating in this game
gee trolling conspiracy nutcase on the left csm staff with what power they have on the right who will i trust morei do not give support to trolls and stupid tinfoil hat wearers they should be clubbed down like badgers with a hammer
i dont like stupid people with their stupid replies either
well at least i dont see useless conspiracies where there are none and i dont waste valuable csm time with asinine proposals that serve my delusional agenda
the problem with this stuff is these are features that could have just as easily been proposed via the features and ideas forum or just internally within ccpim not trying to be difficult but while the csm might give a pretty voice to ideas those ideas were definitely already being heard without the csm i dont think a good idea with a lot of merit behind it needs csm support to get noticed black ops are a good example of this everyone knows black ops need a boost and there are tons of threads about it does the issue require csm support before itll get addressed did anything change when the csm brought it up not reallythe proposals for a cargo ship between haulers and freighters was around for a long time before the csm brought it to the devs was the csm really the reason the orca entered the gamewhen i asked for meaningful issues the csm has addressed i think i meant something more along the lines of issues that are outside the gamewhen the reactor bug was discovered and ccp jumped all over it and then released a long detailed explanation of what happened and the steps taken to fix it that is what i wanted but then i see stuff like the bob name change happening and it just reinforces the feeling i have that ccp only pays the csm lip service when its in their interest to do sothe csm needs to have the power to cause problems at ccp until the csms decisionmaking can negatively affect ccp it doesnt have any real power it might sound counterproductive to attack the company we all know and love but without any true ability to affect things the csm is all bark and no bite and will never be a real factor in decisionsbecause this is just a virtual world in a videogame owned by a private company this will of course never happen nor do i think it should really but pretending to have an oversight panel to review company decisions is just sillymaking you guys sign an nda violates the entire principle behind having an oversight group in the first place
first every goonbob and there mother comes out of the woodwork to yell for csm approvalnow we got a thread screaming to tear down csm and treating it like csm are being paid to listen to this crap let alone getting resourcesthis is utter hilarity
and you should seek therapy if you think hitting people and defenceless animals with a hammer is ok
 arent badgers actually really dangerous in real lifei thought they were one of those animals that you dont want to mess with but youd never know it by looking at them kind of like hippos
thing is they werent a queue has been proposed since the game was in beta and nothing came of it until after the csm brought it up weapon grouping was brought up int he context of reload all with type which is another feature requested since the dawn of time again nothing happened for five years and its in within a couple months of the csm bringing it up that it goes live yeah it could be a coincidence but i wouldnt bet on it i think that ccp places a lot more weight on the csms opinion than it does on random forum opinions a forum whiner represents themselves the nine members of the csm represent something like 10000 people they speak with far more weight than even the most eloquent wellconsidered apropos suggestion on the forums ever could because they speak for more people than themselves this is doubly true of issues that have a loud group on both sides like the nano nerf  you cant sort out what the players think by looking at fi debates but you can sort it out by asking them to support people who think like them and then getting those representatives to speak on the topic also the facetoface nature of it helps a lot too
here is the problem ccp doesnt prioritize things as well as the players all the features mentioned were already suggested and most of them were in the pipeline if it wasnt for the csm it could have taken ages for these important things to make it into the game by representing what the players would prefer to see in the next x expansions that we ccp have people with a different perspective to discuss with and do things better tell that to the people who has been begging for an orca for ages the csm got on the case and it was implemented just a few months laterwell im under nda but i got the impression last summer in iceland that ccp didnt really see any problems with black ops the fact it hasnt been addressed there is good reasons for mostly time if ccp had the resources im certain they would have been buffed more than they have mind you that they did address 1 thing about blackops which we talked about the fact that you cant bring a hauler with you for fuelloot that was addressedif the csm hadnt brought it up who knows how long it would have takenas far as im aware we can go to the media just fine
this is why i voted for you thank you for existing
the csm is and always will be a joke a poor one and lavista attempts of spining the facts to save his cheese are obnoxious
what an astounding logical argument that was i guess sophistry still exists even in this day and age
so how exactly am i spinning facts unless you substantiate your view its worth nothing
anyone can argue logic whether they are doing so with actual rationality as opposed to a 3 year old with finger paint is a different matter
im going to disagree a bit on the details i look at that list and in all that i at best the csm might have had a small effect on the order that ccp addressed those issues that said i dont believe that reduces the value of the csm the csm can really only ever expect to do a couple of things1 provide independent oversight of ccp when issues like the t20 and pos exploit occur i think the csm has done a good job making sure that the pilots of eve hear the full details when there looks to be the possibility of ccp misconduct2 escalate major issues that the community is experiencing i am less convinced that the csm is any better than the forums and other community resources can be3 provide feedback about long term directions ccp should consider as they map out new features in eve i think this is something the csm can do better than the players at large because the csm is willing to sign an nda and the discussions can be more open the csm will never be a the way to get your favorite idea into eve there are a bunch of reasons for this1 ccp can read your ideas in the forums just as well as the csm can in fact in many cases that is the only way theu will see them as at this point a csm member has to like your idea enough to bring it up in a meeting and it could be voted down there2 ccp is working full time already on all sorts of new stuff in eve it can take years for something new to make it into eve there are often all sorts of issues that make what seems like a good idea at first not be so good in the end someone outside ccp can never see the whole picture your good idea if it could be in the game todaqy could be a terrible thing in the eve that is in place 2 years from now and you might not understand why till you see something they are alreaqdy doing3 ccp has a much bigger picture to consider when they decide what makes it into the verse they have to consider how it aligns with thier long term vision they have to look at the technical issues they have to look at the business issues they have to weigh all the good ideas against each other because there are only so many things they can do4 there is a reason not everyone designs games for a living it is hard to get right and not that many people are any good at it so a lot of times the player generated ideas just arent as good as something a person that has done it all their life might have come up with also no one outside ccp has the creative enviroment that the ccp lives in they have direct interactions with writers artist other designers and they get to do it full time thats not to say players dont have great ideas sometimes they do but not every player generated idea is a flash of geniusso if you want your idea to have a shot you need to own it spend time on your proposal provide enough detail so that it can truly be understood share it with the community expect it to be ripped apart use that feedback and refine it and if you really have a passion for it keep it on the radar cont
ok lets do a brief analyzis of your arguments in this thread1 someone brings the t20 incident and says that ccp handled poorly a gm abuse of power your argument t20 was nto a gm so your point is invalid yes t20 was not a gm he was a dev which makes the guys argument even more valid if such a thing is even possible the fact that he was mistaken about the post is completely irrelevant to the point he was trying to make as you had nothing to say about the mishandling itself that could redeem ccp you just decided to try and derange the argument into a discussion about a worker position 2 you are totally ignoring evidence which was put forward by ccp on the issue no evidence was given whatsover none that could be verified unverifiable evidence is null and void ccps politics of obfuscation are widely known and you are not naive enough to believe in them you are just on the other side3 you are making assumptions based on things you have no clue about wait till a public statement is made about it you are also ignoring simple facts here like the fact that a gm can change a name on his own discretion mind you the gm team is always being watched by internal affairs so even if it is abused it will be found out in the past ccp has never ever punished an employee for anythind or admited wrong doing and gone back in a poor decision made they are just that arrogant your poor attempt of quenching the outrage is noted but again based on absurdities4 wrong the nyt article was flawed this has been addressed over and over again go and read the official csm whitepaper about the role of the csm  the csm objective is to serve as a free pr department for ccp and allow them to do whatever pleases them whist keeping the appearance of listening to the players it is a joke and serves only for this purposes and the purpose of feeding the naive egos of reality withdrawn people like you it never served or will serve any interest of the community in any significant way you can try and attribute anything you want to csm existence but the reality is anything that has been done with it would hvae been done without it just as well and as fast you are just a bunch of useless brats playing politics
contas to this recent issue with the name change the csm was certainly never included in any discussion about changing the name of the former and now again sort of a bob alliance i dont think any of the current csm would have supported the idea in fact i think we would have all complained pretty vigourously but ill let the rest of the csm speak to their reactioni think you need to give the csm some time to dig into this as this is exactly the sort of oversight i think the csm can do best i hope the csm will demand a full explanation to the community at large personally i hope the csm can help get the decision reversed again thats just meso summary the csm can be a group that can try to keep ccp honest i dont believe the csm is the best mechanism to drive new features into eve in the short term i do believe the csm can use their access to ccp in their nda discussions to help steer the long term direction of eve to match the players the csm choose to represent this oversight and the possibility of affecting the long term direction of eve is why players should support the csm process find a candidate that seems to think like they do about eve and help get them electedissler

rules are for everyone not everyone but one group this isnt 20042006 anymore
this is more or less what were getting at bobr should be under the same rules as all the rest of us this doesnt have anything to do with 00 politics its just us asking that they be held to the same rules as all the rest of us ccp is meant to be a neutral party in the game world a name change is a small trivial thing yes but it is still well outside of the rules that are meant to apply to everyone
restore old name or disband one of the two either is fine
now
i thought corruption ended with t20

this disgrace has violated not one but two rules  change of name and the length of the name either would be a matter for disciplinary action against the person or persons involved that includes the person who asked for such a favour knowing it would be granted despite being against the rules everyone else is required to live under however if this new policy is allowed to apply to all players corporations and alliances i will gladly withdrawal my demands
option 3 since the horse is already out of the barn allow any character corp or alliance to petition for their name to be changed would be great to get the spelling of mine corrected to guillaume i submitted a petition asking for exactly that just a short while ago
youd think after t20
no dice to keep things fair game changes need to be announced to everyone at once not made available to ccps favourite alliance first
seriously how did they figure they were going to get away with this as funny as bobr sounds they should lose sov or go back to kenny
all animals are equal but some are more equal than others and also receive cloned t2 bpos and special treatment repeatedly laffeux
when will ccp learn
signed
voting to either disband rename them to kenzoku or charge them 1 bil and drop all sovereignty as would have happened if theyd changed names legitimately through the usual channels
once cheaters always cheaters
i vote disband
this is almost too awesome to be true
edit left out a notsome groups of players should not receive developer help and features not available to otherseithera the name should be changed backb the alliance should be disbandedc a name change feature should be universally available to alliances and possibly corps
disband
double standards on multiple counts is pretty terrible
this is precisely what the csm was originally created for so this proposal if any deserves discussion
its a bug guys not a feature weve had for the past ever
am i now also allowed to rename my name
fire t20 free kugu
as the recruitment director for the band of brothers corporation now recruitingi feel as if i have been personally slighted by this blatant disregard for the rules shame on you ccp why do you cater to such terrible players and lady scarlet has still refused to share information regarding buffets with me if you are going to throw caution to the wind and break your own rules to change the name of an alliance who dwells in empire space at least name it something befitting like lady scarlet hoardes all our food water is wet etc i seem to remember dynasia explicitly stating that the alliance didnt want that name anyway so why go to the trouble of making it look like bob still has its hands in ccps skirt
fairs fair
wtf ccp
ok im in
petition with the wish to change this inapropriate name sent
sss
pretty bad ccp pretty bad
did anyone seriously think about what would happen
quoting for truth
god damn ccp not again
yo sup dis rere posse in da house why ccp be trippin dem actin like a bad dogg an a bad dogg he be no good fo nobody
imo very bad form
one game one rule
i am saddened by what has occurred this day
not a supporter of kenbeaver or gooni am a supporter of impartial ccp though
i cant understand why they would do this if it is against their own rules as it opens the door for other playerscorpsalliances to do the same thing  really ccp not allowing others to do it now will only fan the flames of this fireis there a place where ccp have this rule written where us players are able to have a read of itto say i am disappointed with this is an understatement  if something that is as noticeable as this is being done  there is rules to say it isnt done for anybody then what else is being done for them that isnt as easy for outsiders to notice
double standards
disband themthats favoritismmust we all be reminded of the t20 incident
10
wow it does remind me of the t20 thing or whatever it wasstop the favoritism
do it
disband thier alliance or else i will have a serious quarrel with some devs when i get to speak face to facesupport
ill take my char rename now something that starts with m please
signedstop the favoritism
haha you guys are pathetic always a good laugh seeing people whineif bob self destructed a 1bil carrier would that make you happy   else i cant really see whats the problem did it ruin your kb stats or something lol keep up dramaing its great entertainmentedit if you think this vote will go through you are either optimistic or directly stupid
wooooooooosh
supporting this
m corp xd
not supportedthis was a renaming of an existing alliance at worst the alliance should be simply renamed back but not disbanded completelyalso its hilarious to note where many of the votes in support of this proposal are coming from keep on hating guysben
i dont speak for my corporation nor my alliance stop making that mistake aswell 
bunch of damned drama queens
indeed
tut tut you cant deny its a little inconsistent ethereal dawn not that long ago had their name stolen and assumed the alliance name black rise later the thieves relinquished the name and ed were able to re assume it the important difference being ye you guessed it they lost sov to do it
votes are votes and this issue will make it to council
we are watching
is it me or are there alot of goon posts in this thread
this is a balls out inconsistency to say the leasti really dont get involved with all this crap usually but time after time ccp seems to make them same ups it really should stopas has been said before consistency is the key to credibility in this industry
so if a brand of toilet paper renames it self why whould the competetor demand the name to be set back or disband the companystop winging goons and deal with itbob is reloaded deal with it
bob is toilet paper
how can this be a legit vote if you cant even vote no 
unfair
whether intended or not it looks like favouritism
is it me or did your alliance gets its name changed in violation of ccps own rules
this is pretty much the biggest bull ever
you know youre right  toilet paper is an excellent metaphor for bobzoku ii electric boogaloo
siding wit goon here
former bob come kenzuki come bob reloaded and allowed to rename their alliance from ffp fail failure productions is total utter s
disband them once and for all
heh mate i just work here nothing to do with meme whistles
i think what was done was incorrect if they wanted a new alliance name they should have had to use game mechanics to get one like anyone else and deal with whatever consequences arise from such a choicewhat was done circumvents the game as it is presented
wow awesome tell you what make a proposal to disband every space holding entity in the game and i will agree with you okalso i believe if you think it is a dev misconduct then you want to go to internalaffairsccpgamescom and make a complaint there or maybe i dunno rage quit some more
waiting for initial response from ccp before raising the issue for next csm meeting
there are rules in place about this the rename was outside of said rules if they want to be bob reloaded so bad they should drop sov and put down a bil like everyone else has to its not that hard a concept to grasp i personally like the new name better anime jokes were getting stale i could have a lot of fun with the beaver gimmick if tau ceti federation suddenly turned into the french connection id petition it just the same the rules are in place for a reason the devs are meant to be a neutral body there shouldnt be any discussion on this
doh stoopidand then they form under a different alliance name with the same corps ergo they are the same but with a different namelet me see when that has happened before
supported if i cant rename my corp my alts or my main then no one should be able to do sowhy ccp why
wtf gms
why so serious guys ahahahamaybe if i put 25 thumbs up using all my alts itll changecry me a river
lol  all of you that think this is just about the alliance name changing no one would have had any problem with their name change if they had formed a new alliance to obtain it just like everyone else has to do instead they got a new name without the penalties mainly sov loss that come with it
signed
can anyone else do iti really dont understand why people cant see that the foundation of the game is fair play goons original metagaming to steal the bob name may have been stupid and against ccps intent but anyone could do it to anyone its dumb but fairthis correction if thats how ccp wants to paint it isnt fair its favoritism and its a big deal what other bonuses do they get that we cant see so publicly ccp has spent years developing the csm and trying to rebrand themselves as a transparent company that values fairness this is undoing a lot of their effort and it illuminates how stupid the csm really is

i agree and support this
forgive my wild ignorance on the subject but didnt bob die out not too long ago
dear ccp to be honest i think you should just rename the alliance band of devs insteadyou have always denied that you favour bobrkenzokubob over other alliances what are we all supposed to think now
no we are reloaded like back to the future2 or ghostbusters 2 or other sequels that were really cool honest
were sorry our server side logs show no evidence of an alliance renaming or a petition thread therefore we can take no action on your requestqui custodiet et ipsos custodes

ccp has been added to my weak as  list sorry had to be said after i lost all respect
mate tbh with you they need to clarify the rules and if i was in your position and sitting down the pub with you sipping a cold one id probably agree and have a laughbut its the whiney omg whine omg whine that is funny thats why i love being a wumbtw pics or stfu
they also have the only alliance ticker with a lower case letter no other alliance can do that via normal game mechanics of course normal game mechanics dont seem to be a concern for some players
oh please get a life although i think bob should pay ccp 1billion isk this is not game breaking it was because of you jerks that they had to do this in the first place get over it ccp did it it is their game not yours isaac
in follow up from my support which is lost in this thread somewhere i must say this saddens me greatly i have many a friend interested in mmos and i would love to be able to show them the joys of eve but time and time again i get told but if the devs favour a specific group whats the point they rightly askmy reply is that its rare and should never happen again sadly you have proven me wrongyou guy have made a work of art in eve you allow scams you have a player diven economy and the pollitical landscape is decided by players now there is no way i would say that the person who have made this great game should not enjoy it themselves imo thats just silly to suggest that however it is obvious that some people in power have a vested interest in a specific groupi love eve but why allow people in your company to damage the reputation of such a great game why risk players over such a simple thing as a name change
in the light of ccps conduct in the past  ccp needs to be interrogated over thisthe members of staff involved in the name change traced  and their actions auditedthe methods used by ex bob to contact these members of staff identified to assure correct channel were usedas such im giving this my nominal support  although it is possible ccp acted in good faiththis really is why the csm was initial mooted before it got watered down  to check in every nook and cranny to ensure ccp staff are acting professionaly i hope the csm members will not be bribed with free posters and bum bags and block out the false we r all mates here insert beer jokehangover quip from ccp and aggressively pursue this issue until the truth is discoveredskunk
oh and btw there is no rule that doesnt allow the renaming of an alliance show me the proof if there is this supposed rule isaac
two thingsfirst of all i understand that bob would normally need to pay the 1b and lose all sov to do this which is the reason for this outcry well thats debatable but thats the front used at the very least they probably asked to have the name changed most likely expecting nothing to happen but it did why is this something bob should be punished for i dont understand why you would punish the person requesting this in the same way i wouldnt understand punishing someone requesting a new ship because a bug caused them to lose their original shipthe fault quite clearly lies with ccp for allowing something they perhaps shouldnt have the fault does not lie with bob for asking if this is something ccp will consider imagine youre still young and living with your parents if you asked them if you could stay out late for one night instead you get grounded for even asking if you could stay late wouldnt you find that to be pretty unfair to me this is the same kind of story they asked theres nothing wrong with asking this it is a fairly reasonable request given the circumstances one that maybe should not have been granted but certainly not outrageous to ask they did not force ccp to make this decision nobody held a gun to their head to my knowledge psecondly im not sure how massive of a rule violation this really is i understand rules need to be followed and im pretty strict on that personally i cannot stand hypocrisy or dual standards for those things however i also have to acknowledge that its impossible to write a rule to deal with every possible situation i doubt that when they decided that no alliance shall be renamed unless it violates the naming policy they considered a highly unlikely situation of a disband like this with the name being claimed by another alliance and everything that lead up to this whole ordeal if there is no precedent for them denying previous alliances to which this happened i honestly dont know if theres not then i dont think its entirely unreasonable to decide that this should be an exception to the rules because of the circumstances which are quite frankly far from ordinary or commonof course the most obvious flaw there is that other alliances might fake a disband like this just to get a name of their choosing although bob did at one point pay for kenzoku and they did lose all their sov not too long ago my point is simply that this is an extraordinary situation and that the rules probably werent written with a situation like this in mind
why does ccp continuously go above and beyond for bob this is outside of the boundaries for which ccp has even stated they wouldwouldnt intervenejust more proof of who gets the preferencial treatment from the developerscsmsand to think that we actually pay to play
freak out much this is ridiculous its an internet spaceship game not real life get over yourself isaac
alliance name  character limitsov maintainedbob was disbanded because the executor corp was setup to allow itccp should revert name  disband  remove sov  charge 1b isk and reprimand whichever employees decided this was a good idea
a bit of transparency here would be welcome
you dont know what you are talking about they lost their alliance due to espionagewhich has been a favored tactic by bob themselves and everything they have done to other alliances has been outside of ccps involvement and within the rules but yet it gets done to them and all is reversedthats bs
look how dumb you are source
check sirmolle ingame its been renamed back to kenny
there isnt but to rename your alliance you have to disband it and start a new one therefore you must pay the fees and lose sov over whatever systems you have something bob didnt have to do
thank you for your commentsi refer you to the quote from the new york times  from hilmar peterson  ccp chief executiveit is indeed internet spaceships but its internet spaceships with a player council originally designed to deal with ccp corruption indeed a member of staff is employed by ccp solely to ensure this is the casethe op has suggested the decisions made were not professional  and he has a great deal of support as such i believe my post and support for the op was in orderskunk
this is an excellent posti wonder if all those gaming magazines and credited critics that gave great reviews would still consider this the high profile player driven game that they think it is if they knew that ccp gives preferencial treatment to a specific alliance and has done so many times ccp why dont you consider the game to move along the way it should move by letting bob deal with the same crap they have dealt out and not giving them the upper hand by having you to fall back on
i seriously wonder if anyone besides bob has asked ccp to change their alliance namemakes you wonderisaac
ccp really needs to stop this favoritism despite their lack of transparency it is obvious that the devs at the very least bend  if not break  the rules whenever they think they can get away with it the whole mention of the bat phone in the leaked irc chats posted after bob was disbanded pretty much solidifies the accusation of dev assistance to bob not that more evidence was really needed from past blundersthis latest act by ccp puts another bad mark on a wonderful game i havent read the article yet about eve being one of the top 5 most important mmos but i hope it is amended to show how dev collusion with the player base is rampant in the game and should be unacceptable in this environment to clear this up ccp needs to correct the mistake ie disband bobr and let them create a new alliance under the proper terms they also need to discipline the employees responsible for basically giving the finger to the rest of the player base i suggest locking them in a room stuck listening to bjorks full catalog and see who eats who first those left alive will then be forced to play wow
cutwristsingame offc
stain allaince
i dont care if its kenzoku bob goons cva ra or even the mgrl one set of rules should apply to everybodyanother example of apparent favoritismremember thisplease visit your user settings to reenable images looks like the special line still existsi feel a full investigation by ia is required for this matter
there is no guarantee that the name will be changed only character names that are deemed as inappropriate are eligible for a possible name change names will not be changed for any other reasonremember this you have violated your own term and conditions
ccp can disband every alliance in eve make bob the sole ruler of 00 and they will still deny favoritism
the only thing more dumb then ccp allowing this is all the idiots defending bob for getting special treatment yet again delve is ours already so none of this really matters however if they had to follow the rules like everyone else do you really bob would have closed the alliance to rename it while dropping sov in the last systems they have yea right youre a moronccp needs to explain why only bob is allowed to circumvent loss of sov due to a name change
please apply your own rules ccp
i fully support ccp undoing any mistake that shows favoritism and failure to uphold their own rules however the op is suggesting that an alliance be disbanded because of a mistake on ccps part this is unnecessary heavy handed and malicious in nature unsigned i will gladly sign a thread which seeks to undo the name change and which seeks to have internal affairs thoroughly investigate the matterseriously folks think rationally dont let emotions and biases cloud your judgement
quick someone check ingame after clearing cache its a rumor that bob is still there but it has been changed back to kenny only ingame so far
violating its own policies ccp has slapped the faces of all but a tiny minority of active subscribers with this action
signed
it seems to be kenny again ticker name shows still bobbut if you or bett i serach just one of themnothing not bob neihter kenny
disband now
a mistake is letting an employee give an alliance a bunch of t2 bpos and not catching it until the community goes ballistic we are a bit beyond mistake at this point and in to obvious collusion territory
disband bobr
 fsckn 
signed thanks for ing in our faces yet again ccp
what happened to the new era of accountability ccpwhat a joke
youve got it all wrong people ccp is doing name changes now im petitioning for mine immediately join the party
if they currently have the ability to make ccp break the rules in their favor as you seem to suggest why in the world wouldnt they have used this very same ability to have bob and sov 3 restored a month ago
want more people to play a good starting point would be to stop giving bob out of game help first the blueprints and now this come on people arent paying for ccp to give free bonuses to another alliance either stop doing it or make the game free because its not fair to the other players
signedyou make me want to quit ccp
ccp we need some kind of official statement here for the second time that has been recorded the alliance formerly known as the band of brothers has recieved treatment that is outside the precidents of the game this is beginning to look very bad and brings into question the credability of the company to keep its employees from bring any kind of special treatment to where they want to playwhile i do not support the disbanding of the alliance i do feel that the alliance should be put back to its old name additionally it is time this matter has a swift and proper justice with devs that participated in this special treatment either being banned from the game or outright fired from the companyccp you have promised up that the past was examined and now everything is above board it is time to back up your previous position
because that wouldve caused even more of a storm than t20 and any other noteworthy event in eve history combined
yeah this ccp  bob nepotism has to end every time you do something this stupid favoring the most hated alliance in eve you make me want to play less
how so mistakes can be made more than once can they not the only reason why people want bob 20 disbanded is because they have stereotyped the entire alliance as cheaters and automatically assume that bob cheated to get this done people are jumping to conclusions here the only appropriate actions at this time are to get internal affairs to investigate and to undo the name changeif internal affairs uncovers player misconduct then the players responsible for said misconduct should be appropriately punished if they discover that this is the result of gm misconduct then the gm responsible should be punished asking an entire alliance to be disbanded because of a single players crimes is irresponsible and unethical just like it would be unethical for ccp to disband goonswarm because of a single players misconductthe only time where it would be ethical for ccp to forcibly disband an alliance would be if they could show that the alliance as a whole was guilty of misconduct
anything the goons disagree with causes a storm nothing new thereif theyre bobs pets as much as people like to portray and put a spin on things just to accommodate bob all theyd have to say is the director account was hacked in a situation like that reversing the damage done wouldnt be completely out of the ordinary and the account hacked vs someone turned traitor is very much a he said she said thing except one of the parties is supposedly unbiased and has all the information while the other party is biased and basing it all on the word of a single person
i see two options here either ccp gives a free alliance name change to every alliance exactly the same way kenny got it or the new kenny gets disbanded again losing all their sovi think goonswarm 2 revenge of z0r this is 26 characters and beyond the normal rules but if bob gets to go over the limit i think it would be fair to extend this courtesy to us as well
if they dont want to be stereotyped as cheaters then they should stop cheating hugaluglgalglug
someone say support fleet
dbrb is horrible
guh
way to keep the playing field level ccp way to keep things fair and even and you know a player run game is a player run game even my friends who never play eve have heard ty things about the game because of the past devgmetc scandals lets not make it worse
there is only one fair solution to your unfair post deleting every single character on that account you posted with and every account associated with itwhy hell i dont know because you deserve to be punished for something you didnt do hold on ill start the proposal
this says it all ccp bias being proved here without any issues

death to beaver
wow 24 pages keep on crying children you stamp your feet enough the grown ups might listen honest
of course one thumb up
tbh youre reply does not suprise me dude pretty much sums up the mentality of youre alliance and leader
i support this
i agree
youll join us once your alliance gets disbanded for being illegal
a quote from eve eula regarding rules and policies so i request a gm to comment3 violationsa if a name is deemed inappropriate gms may be able to change the characters name in some circumstances this is solely at the discretion of ccp andor its representatives based on but not limited to account and player history and the severity of the violation there is no guarantee that the name will be changed only character names that are deemed as inappropriate are eligible for a possible name change names will not be changed for any other reason what i have bolded also includes alliance names kenzoku is not an offensive or abusive name so may i request why it was changed this means that ccp have the right to change it however it also means that they have to give a valid reason as to why it should be changed abusive or inappropriate names would be changedin order to change your alliance name you need to remake a new alliance this decision to change there name has no grounds and it should be raised through ccp internal affairs as would request an investigation i would also request that csa would take up this issue when they conveen with ccp csa speak for the player base of the eve community so their word does count
so the csm is not a platform to discuss transparency and allegations of dev misconductyou heard if the from the bob guy might as well close this thread hes already asked his buddies to ignore it
sorry why is your name the same as a x goon corphowever if you were on the other side where ccp changed your name to an alliance which no longer exists and it is against eula
what really amazed me was that they not only showed preferential treatment by changing the name but they allowed a 25 character name when the limit is 24 characters they should be band of brothers reloade
blatant disregard for ccps rules demands some kind of action
ccp has tried to cover up the t20 incident for years now so this is hardly a surprise
just wowi think this needs to be looked at sent a email to internalaffairsccpgamescom about this but this is pretty just wow and tearing open an old wound
i have to wonder why the bob allies are rushing to defend them so quickly have you not stopped to askif my alliance wanted to change its name to more than 24 characters long or at all  why cant idefenders of bobr are now starting to use the defence this must have been some sort of mistake did someone type into a field in the database band of brothers reloaded and pressed the ok button by accident take a step back and realise that this isnt about bob directly but you as a customer shouldnt you as a non bob alliance player regardless of your alignment with them be entitled to the same set of rules and conduct everyone else simply standing up and saying their bob they did no wrong if goons didnt disband the original alliance this wouldnt have happend doesnt change the fact that anyone that isnt in bob  the majority of the player base got screwed over and it wasnt some simple accidental boo boo by a gmdev etcit may have been a name change to some and again regardless of your affiliation with their alliance you got screwed over and you should be angry about it
either change it back disband them and force them to create a new alliance with the name they want or allow all alliances the ability to do the same while exceeding the maximum character limit even
supporting this
except in that case the person known as haargoth would say i did it and that would really screw up any argument about hackinghth
4realz
wee taaah dead
why the person who hacked the account says it isnt a hacked account but the real player doing it shocker no matter what you do you have no way to prove this is really your account and it wasnt hacked or anything of that nature the people with the most information in that regard are ccp which also happens to be the unbiased source or supposed to bewould this be a cluster to cover up well yeah definitely but so is giving t2 bpos to people and hiding it for so long if this kind of favoritism is supposed to still exist then this kind of coverup isnt all that crazy p
i hope they never allow that i can see it in a few months time kennybob will rewrite their version of history and claim now that it can be done they did no wrong and the issue will get pushed aside as they do with every t20 reference with the rules left as they are they should never be allowed to get away with this
this has nothing to do with goons disbanding bob and i apologize if i come across as suggesting that the name change itself was an accident on someones part i am simply saying that it was a mistake on ccps part to allow the name change to happen and a mistake to not have proper internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happeningjust because a single gm was guilty of misconduct does not mean that all of ccp and all of bob is guilty of the same misconduct if the crimes of a single person fell upon the alliance that person was a part of then goonswarm would have had to be disbanded a looonnnngg time ago as i am more than certain that goonswarm has its fair share of macrominers rmters etc etcanother thing that i should clear up is that i am not trying to defend bobkenny while it is true that i have no love for goons i never liked the way bob presented itself to me when i was but a fledgling noob back in yon days of the pendulum wars i was rooting for ascn back then and i was always rather resentful that bob had crushed themi am also not saying that bob should not be punished if they did in fact cheat as a whole i am saying that ccp should reserve judgement until after internal affairs investigates the situation the last thing they should do is start throwing bans around without proof that the bans are warranted
step back for a second ignore any of the politics involved between goons and exbob okayso an alliance wants to rename itself the steps involved and that have been used to this date are disbanding the alliance mostly just the name and reforming under a new one they give up sov claims even if its just six in this time until their new alliance is formed this has been the case throughout eveback to names kenzoku obviously wanted a new name so they should have disbanded and reformed under their new moniker although im not sure they would be allowed to have an alliance name so close to a nonaffiliated corps name but thats off a slight tangentfor whatever reason kenzoku were allowed to bypass the established process of changing an alliance name including circumventing all of the negatives associated with such an act now 1bn isnt much isk of course even if you dont own r64s anymore however being allowed to maintain sov is a pretty large bonus that no other alliance changing names has been allowed to have and of course this will reek of bias given my alliance ticker but how is disbanding their alliance such a drastic thing when they obviously really wanted this new name which they said they didnt want before p so i would expect they would be willing to pay the appropriate penalties associated with changing the nameunless they were only willing to change kenzoku to bobr if they could avoid the penalties in which case it is hard to sympathize with them regardless v0v
wow one group of players getting favourable treatment from the gmsdevelopers over the rest of the playerbase that surely wouldnt happen in the new ccp with their internal affairs department that was created as a response to this kind of favouritism causing a huge scandal previously cought20coughoh hai its the same group getting the favouritismsomething rotten in the state of iceland and its not the rotten shark that they claim is a delicacy eitherapologies to shakespeare
you are talking to a brick wall its the same people that the free bpos didnt make that much isk anyway cyno dds were easy to dodge titans were easy to kill sov4 is easy to break then they are suprised and outraged when they are wrong and the cycle repeats itself
icelandcripes
if the request was to simply rename bob back youd probably see less resistance of course thats not as dramatic p
nope no sign of one group of players being given preferential treatment over the rest of the playerbase here at all no sireerolleyesfor shame ccp this kind of crap was supposed to have been abolished after the whole developer spawning t2 bpos for his alliance mates scandal and the subsequent creation of internal affairsi hope kieron or whoever else is in charge of both ccp and ia looks into this and that the unemployment queue in iceland gets a little longer this stinks worse than a barrel of rotten shark
25 pages calling for your action ccp the eve universe awaits your waking the  up
no double standards or favoritism this is an easy choice to reverse and it should be done as soon as possible
it costs everyone else 1b and loss of sov this is clearly out of game cheating
cripes indeedin my defence i was watching a tv show about finland when i made the error this is also why you shouldnt post on forums while halfdoped on migraine medications
bets that ccp wont act until the news has spread across the interwebs creating yet more bad pr for ccp
i support this
oo
i support this
i support this
wouldnt it be easier to just reset their sovereignty to level 0
ccp one rule for all
i cant wait to hear the explanation for this one
tell you what ccpallow the change of name and drop sovordisallow name change and allow them to maintain sovshould you choose option 2 then the playerbase demand an explaination as to how this happened in the first place  this is disgusting
1 the game mechanics and rules should apply to everybody2 kenzoku was a much cooler name than band of brothers reloaded3 a spy should not be able to disband a whole alliance in seconds and steal the name thats faulty game mechanics there should be at least 24 hour vote on something like that
fire the guy that did this
in regards to 3 sirmolle deleted the tinfoil shares as he wanted to get around the 24h timer to make things easier this included disbanding the alliance for anyone with the appropriate roleshth

supported not for goonswarm but for fairness and freedom
after the t20 incident i couldnt tell if a just few ccp employees in the middle and the bottom of the company had some massive  to try and pull that off or whether the few at the top had none to oppose it maybe its both or maybe maybe its the other way around
this is brazen and shameful gm favoritism
again throughout our history there have been a handful of cases where our employees or members of our various volunteer and partner programs have taken advantage of the proprietary powers they are granted through access and knowledge these cases have been investigated prosecuted and judgment rendered usually the punishment has been quite simple termination of employmentid say modifying alliance name outside game mechanics qualify
ccp we demand an explanation
fully supported
any sort of official response would be nice too even something as simple as were looking into the issue and will issue a public statement once we know more
i see no problem with this name change
theres been much discussion of character name limits  i would have thought that the corporation name limits were more relevant in this instance
i think the most important thing is consistency which is why im supporting this resolutioni see no honest reason as to why the name was changed it is not offensivethe renaming of kenzoku smacks of favouritism i believe that not only ccp needs to be impartial but that they also need to appear impartialthe renaming makes me believe neither and im very interested as to why it happened
madprops to ccp for at least being consistent
i like cheating thumbs upedited for thumbs up
this is wrong fix it
dubblepoast
wow i would have never expected this kind of behavior from either kenbobku or ccp at least theyre not trying to ignore this is happening like every other time they had anything to do with this game that was a bad idea
i support this disband idea and make them follow the rules is it really that hard
more favoritism from ccp
agreed
wut
we have a strict reimbursement policy that we must follow c ccp gmsnot so strong for someone
signedi await a detailed response from ccp
signedi can has confession from ccp plz
its an outrage
name or not your still going to die enjoy your name with a dead alliance
you just described the correct way ccp should have handled the issue
there are not enough for whoever thought this was a good idea
so why was my petition for a name change several months ago closed without so much as a response
after the creation of the internal affairs department i had hope that what i term the bad old days were overid like to think this was just a lowlevel gm acting out and that ia is all over him if not man you guys look dumb vov
oh great bob gets special treatment again
i too am against developer corruption
and here is the thing they didnt touch it with a 10ft pole either at first lets just say that the csm was nice and was quite clear that when we talked to ccp about it that what had happened was fair and square ccp should leave it all alonethey must have really good reasons for letting kenzoku pick a new name othewise it wouldnt have been the case this post goes to prove that people make assumptions based on so limited knowledge that they have no basis for any kind of conclusions
but is it fair to other players and can they tell us why they did it
post
thats the thing none of us have any idea what happened usually gm actions are not disclosed obviously in this case that might be warranted due to the huge outcryunjustified but understandable in my opinionim entirely against the csm picking up this issue i will however see what i can do to solve the problem
i can understand that and the only reason i posted my support is the more people who complain and support the topic makes it more likely that ccp will respond to it if there is another way i can do this i like to know
no  disbanding is too extreme1 reset bob to kenzoku2 csm rep spanks devpet trousers down next eve fest3 wake up ccp and smell the stench this sort of shamefulness defeats the whole game
i support more t2 bpos for kenzoku

ohgod another goon bandwagon  puts on waders to keep feet dry in the river of tears  not supported
supported because no amount of gmdev necromancy should be allowed to bring back this dead horse of an allianceno preferential treatment and no lame excuses or rationalizations of actions that clearly violate the rules as they are set no exceptions ever

no we do know what happened kenny got their name changed against the stated rules what we dont know is why
supported this type of thing is the reason the csm was put in place in the first place
signed
how about ccp rewriting their own rules as they see fitif they do they at least should inform the public beforehand to avoid whine threads like theseand try it out on sisi first because it seems that they screwed it up somehownow there is this skewed issue on the production database where alliance names and tickers are mismatched for kenzoku and at this unique state the behavior of the game itself is unwarranted and may result in unwanted behavior especially when it comes to sov mechanics most likely disfavoring kenzoku
durp durp
good stuff approved

oh great bob gets unfair special treatment again and the csm is too cowardly to even take up the issue for discussion to mr lavista vista as you should know very well this was the exact sort of thing the csm was instated to deal with the csm was created after the t20 scandal to act as a playercontrol instance and now when history repeats itself you say youre not going to touch the issue wtf
nah rather have a vote on ccp disbanding gs and banning all their playersalts from the gameif you really want to make a impact because as you say ccp supports the unbeatable enemy as gs and the gs alt army called pl are apparently pwned here by the reloaded revival you could quit the game

thanks for discrediting the entire thread i could waffle about mechanics for ages but id put the way that gs dismantled bob in the unfair catagory considering this is a game which at its heart has to have at least some semblence of karma you can fill in the rest of the paragraph

so is ccp just gonna ignore the fact that their gmsdevs are giving certain customers friends special treatment again or can i have my alliance renamed now as well without any drawbacks such as sov loss etc any statement planned by ccp anytime soon or are you just gonna stick your fingers in your ears and hum loudly and what is csm doing exactly during all this guess ill have to think better about who i vote for next time

one more time  post with your main otherwise i have no quibbles in saying that because gs and bob are as bad as each other i nor anybody else should have any problem with them sucessfully using a petition to change a name
oh dear facepalmdo you realize that you whine about a name a few letters of pixels ingame brainfarts ftl nevertheless this thread has a distinct lack of cheese regardscpt cosmic
one last time just 4 u babezconfirming i am doctor penguins main
alright then i guess were agreed if you cant be bothered to post with your main to disprove my point either my point is correct or youre trolling  either case i can ignore you entirely i am arguing about a name just like these guys are arguing about a name ah well
stupid trade alt dmoar brainfarts plz
it has never been done before i would like to know why bobr is beeing treated different
no1 gives a  about the name you muppetthe problem people have with this is the continued unproffesional acts of favouritism by ccp taking away the traditionally level playing field most of us have to play ondont pretend you are so ignorant that you cannot understand the core values of this topic however if you truly believe people mind that some s changed their name to something so embarrasing as beaver ill refer you back to an early post1 shut up2 get out
special treatment is not ok ccpis you think it is i would like to know the reasoning behind it
favorism  special treatment because changing a few letters worth of pixels has such a massiv impact to everyonemore epic brainfarts plz smells delicious
fantastic so here we have two csm representatives that refuse to do job that was the primary task of the csm  holding ccp responsible for misconductmake sure that you dont run again if you can i havent followed your careers too closely or endorse any future candidates because those posts will be remembered and quoted in any attempts of you or your friends to get close to the csm again i dont care about the name change i doubt anyone does the new name is ridiculous and easy to mock but the fact that someone at ccp is messing with the rules again is the big issue here
clearly a case for the internal affairs team  let the dogs loose
name change  okname change keeping sov  not okname change going over the char limit  not ok2 rules broken that we can see what else might there be that we cannot seestop favoritism especially to an alliance that allready had gm favours in the past
i too am gay
this definately should be looked atohwai
what the hell
its only a namewhat goons should be doing is packing there stuff and moving out of delve before bob take it backthe reason goons and friends and crying about this is they know there about to get there ass kicked and there trying to delay it
lets see how ia handle this one eh
interesting point the band of brothers corporations ticker is no longer bob though another player has made an alt corp to pick it up already as far as i know this uneditable in userspace why would ccp alter this
to these two csms i ask the following questionhow does an alliance obtain a ticker such as bob as opposed to bob
the whole point of the csm was originally to stop this sort of horrible bias towards certain alliances
cause its a zero and not a o 00o0o0o0o0o0o0o0oo0o0o0o0o0o0btw loggings are changign for people right now  afther dt it might be fixed  lets wait that and then we can get back to the proces of goon deletion in delvei just got 150 titans and supportfleet of t3 carriers from a gm  so it will be over quick now
whatever juniorlevel helpdesk jockey embarassed ccp like this and buckled to molles crying will be preeeety unpopular with internal affairs right now i bet way to undo all ccps hard work distancing themselves from these cheaters
in a word no stickz and stonez can hurt me bonez but namez can never hurt me i juzt wanted to know if any of you wanted some cheeze and crackerz with all that whine i alzo wanted to know how thiz givez some kind of advantage to anybody in the game ezpecially az the op accuzed ccp of developer mizconduct if any of you are going to emo quit over thiz plz contract all ur stuff to me
meow
this time next year there will be no goons
oh kennysan never change well not when you can get a gm to do it for you
oh dear ccp
yes i mean no
bummer ccp is locking every thread on this subject and pointing people to the cesspool that is caod which many cannot post to anyway may as well drop your post in a black hole as put it there for all it will get noticed by the rest of the universei am currently in the process of dismantling over a dozen pos explicitly for the purpose of an alliancecorp reorganization we have no sovereignty to worry about but it is still a serious pain in the arse had i known ccp would just change it for me i certainly would not be going through the hell of taking down and putting pos upi do not care about kennybobrs name i do care if this was a special favor unavailable to me or anyone else in eveid very much like a ccp official response on how this works
sup
support this causeband of developers cant do what they want
same rules for all
the massed ranks of my corp are solidly behind this proposition both of us
this is blatant cheating

ccp isnt biased towards bobkennybobr whatever oh no never no waysad so sad
disband
bob is dead get over it stop messing ppls fun
ccp do you ever think before doing stuff ive asked to have an alts name changed 5 times over a year and each time you have said we do not change namesccp you lie
poasting in biggest whinefest since cruise was nerfed from frigatesgg ccp single click disband indeed shoulda rolled back when that went down
threads on this topic are being deleted from the main discussion area to pretend there is nothing going on why the cover up why no explanationwhy is some peoples money worth more to ccp than everyone elsescan i ask what other special favours do bobr get from ccp i demand to be treated fairly which is to say equally either ccp is incapable of learning from its mistakes in this matter or they are deliberately goading the player base either way it was a stupid decision to allow this name change

this
same rules should apply to all this is ridiculous
voting just in order to have a ccp reaction about its own rule enforcement
ccp just dont get it  the main reason so many of us despise bob and their what we presumed was former relationship with ccp is because so many bobbits rubbed it in our faces for so long

the fact that they changed a few letters worth of pixels isnt the issue ccp has stated that there are specific circumstances they will change an alliance name if they are deemed offensive and no other now they go and break their own rules for bob this isnt the first time theyve broken their rules for bob that is the issue
disbandobr

well here we are 1000 posts in and still no answer with ccp keeping it off of the front page of gen discussion away from the masses if i remember right didnt kugu get banned for causing work for your gm team or something this must be lots of work toosomeone please explain how this happened it seems not all is fair in love and war

every time we do something you tell me ccp will do this and will do that i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about ccp pressure on bob we the bob people control ccp and the ccp people know it  bob prime minister
no other alliance has ever had this done for them so there should be no exceptionsdisband the alliance
bob is back now its time to kick some goon assso grow up goons stop crying and pack your stuff its time to move to empire

ccp
guk guk look at all of you lame goonies and goonie pets posting lol you think ccp is that stupid to not see your spamming you did not beat bob a former director of bob beat them you guys were just the pathetic vessle of retribution to a shattered alliance after the damage was done so really you guys are nothing
seems unreasonable to have different rules for different alliance anyway we all want to see post starting oh my god the killed kenny you bstards
definantly not supportedalthough the whining and headless chicken ambulation is much chucklesome over my morning java
for gods sake think of the barbies but seriously ccp offers to rename characters at a price is this going to be waived from now on
i am annoyed at what appears to be a blatant piece of favouritism by a random gm with bobr connections i am just plain disappointed by those who put their political alliance ahead of objective evaluation when they say silly things like its only a name or goons deserve it there can be no justification for effectively giving a brand new alliance sov 3 status in multiple systems for free rule avoidance on this level effectively undermines gm authority and creates more work as petition queues are flooded with everyone demanding the same treatment this stuff affects us all no matter how irrelevant 00 politics may seemi have no connection to goons bobr or their respective allies as a relative newcomer i have heard about the bad old days when developers actively aided their alliance of choice however i believed such things to be a relic of the pastheres hoping the player base will get an official answer from ccp at least
same rules for all
i support this and i also take issue with bob parodying our bob ticker please fix this

get over it its just a name and gain no advantage from itstop wasting csm time with this crap
thisthis is the  that makes everyone so angry while goonsawrm used a valid in game mechanic to remove your alliance broken or not you got what no one else has ever gotten two wrongs never make a right and certainly  petition to change the sov mechanic  but you dont deserve special treatmentits not about whats fair  this isnt hello kitty online  its about he rules and making you play by them
errr no alliance name changes have until now required disbanding the alliance paying 1 billion isk to form a new one and losing sov status in the old alliance systems thus bobrs name change is the equivalent of not only waiving the alliance creation fee it also involves effectively giving a brand new alliance sov 3 status in multiple systems for freethat is why people are annoyed about it and making a fuss
a whole lot of sandy vags in here
this should be done immediately before it is all over various gaming sites
imho this is bs and preferential treatment for an alliance that ccp employees have been caught cheating for in the pastccp needs to make a policy statement either they do name changes for alliances who dont like their name which was the case here kenny didnt want to be kenny anymore when they could have paid their 1b and formed bob reloaded the day they all joined kenny or they dont do alliance renamesand to be fair ccp needs to do this for anyone who requests it and do it for free if bob got it for free
yeahhonestly if ccp want eve to be this living universe we the players build which i think they do thats how i read them letting the original disband stand then they shouldnt run around erasing player mistakes
first off i dont think ccp should cave simply because theres a lot of posts in here mostly from goonswarm  friends if they caved to every demand goonswarm set simply because they can forum  a lot this game would fall apart within like a week pthat said im surprised at the amount of people demanding for this specifically if this thread was about renaming bobr back to kenny sure id understand that request thats not what this post is calling for this post is calling for bobr being disbanded entirelythats not a neutral stance where you want ccp to apply rules fairly thats an attempt at using a messy situation and trying to leverage it in such a way you can screw bob over even more thats an attempt by bobs enemies to try and own bob some more by forum whoring and making ridiculous demands that has nothing to do with fairness because the fair approach would be renaming them back and figuring out which gm allowed this to happen and whyas for the rules being broken everybody has to accept that there can be situations that the rules never accounted for when originally written its almost impossible to write a rule and think of every possible scenario that might come up especially in this case when these rules existed well before current sov mechanics its just as important to reevaluate the rules to make sure they still apply in the current atmosphere as it is to make sure the rules are applied fairlyin this case bob was disbanded they lost their name their sov everything they reformed under a new alliance name that they still had lying around somewhere with the 1b paid for when they created kenny and started over at sov 1 they had to reform the alliance on that same day because it had to be done before dt so sov claiming would start again they had no time as an alliance to discuss a new name or anything of that nature simply because of the time constraint is it really that unreasonable for them to be allowed to now pick a name they like better however lame it may be because they didnt have a realistic chance at doing so when they had to emergency reform the alliance certainly some people might still say that yes that is unreasonable and some might say its reasonable saying that this was a clear case of favoritism is a stretch though because i think theres at the very least a good case to consider whether an exception is justified here not because its bob and because they have their line to the ccp but because its an alliance that had to reform under these conditions without having adequate time to decide on a nameeither way i doubt im going to convince most people posting here i dont believe most posters here looked at it from an unbiased point of view and tried to understand both sides of the coin theyre just here to drag bobs name through the mud some more accuse them of more favoritism from ccp and try to turn this giant whinefest into a way to punish bob disbanding the alliance
this is not an alliance vs alliance thing its about fairplay and the samle rules for all im so sick of this 
quoting stupidbypassing existing rules and double standards are things the csm should be very interested inhint try change your name
supported utterly disgraceful ccp
post on the first page summed it upplay by the rules the rest of us play by or dont play at all whether or not a mechanic is broken a mechanic it is nonetheless and until its declared an exploit or not its fair game however your moral stance on it may be
yet another database change provided to bob against the rules and for free from a ccp employeeccp do you not see that you have close to zero trust left from the player base with regards to your integrity and the integrity of the gameif someone at ccp in bobs pocket will do such a highly visible change to the games databases it is beyond question that there have been many changes made on their behalf which are not visiblethe one world model for an mmo was something special and unique unfortunately it is now and forever blighted
this is out of line ccp one rule for allif they didnt like their alliance name they should have disbanded and reformed the original bob was disbanded through legit game mechanicsno other alliance would be able to do this so why bob this needs to be looked at by internal affairs although i suspect the outcome would be a whitewashjust to add i am no supporter of goons in fact i have spent a lot of time killing them i just think this is bs
supported 2nd account again disgraceful
i was rather impressed when the first disband stood with no gm interference but then they blatantly change the name for bobrs personal benefit i thought we had gotten past this crap but obviously not i think ill go for a free name change petition on the way
3rd account terrible play by ccp
one game one rule
something needs to be done
tbh im a little surprised at the eve population i thought we were supposed to be a stoic mature bunchthink about this youre raging about an alliance getting their name changedi honestly didnt know we had this many dry vaginas in eve holy smokes someone call president obama this is an emergency kenny got their name back call the marines call the air force send the seventh fleet to sweden by all things holy this can not standgrow uplook on the bright side you get to kick bobs arse some morewhat would rather have fairness or fun
i share the view of above posteri think this is silly
ccp get ur fecking house in order 
everybody just say  rules are rules
welp after skimming first 10 pages has ccp responded at all
also this thread become a place where we can discuss this issue if you cant post in caod
wow rarely have i seen so much alt posting on the forums
i for one could never in good conscience vote for the disbanding of an alliance based solely on the fact that theyve been renamed as a result of a petition if this renaming is in fact deemed a developer misconduct then at most band of brothers reloaded should be renamed kenzoku  disbanding an alliance any alliance based on a vote would disturb the balance of the game and have far reaching consequencesjust because youre paranoid doesnt mean anybody is watching you
now cry more or emoragequit about it
bla bla get over it peoplefirst  regarding playerbase and no trust in ccp  im part of the playerbase and i dont agree with above remarksi have plenty of trust in ccp and fixing this name issue does not subtract from thatclaims that this would have not been done for another alliance under similar circumstances are so far unprovennames get changed all the time for including offensive words  fixing an annoying consequence of a broken game mechanic is not a bad reason imhoim not a member of bob never have been a mmeber of any bob corp  ive never been allied with them or worked closely with them afairbut i welcome that they will be recognizable as bob again where exactly is the bad in thathow many bps did bob get pout of this name change noneisk noneships nonedyspro moons noneany other material benefit nonetheres no real problem herethat a bored bob director betrayed them and gave access to goons is bobs bad luck that the goons used that opportunity is their good luck and quick reaction good for themthat they maximized their fun by grabbing the name in a newly created alliance  very goonish  wouldnt expect less from them bit of fun toobut imho ccp should have given the name nothing else of course back right away it was an unintended sideeffect of game mechanics aka a buggms fix effects of bugs via petition all the timeof course the same should apply to any alliance that lost their name in the same way to the same bug were there any other cases if such an alliance comes forward and cant get a similar name change  then yes  that would be unfair
well stain empire will get 1 bn isk back 
actually they saved 1 billion isk by having ccp do what disbanding and reforming the alliance wouldve done as well as losing sov which is what anyone else wouldve had to do if they wanted their name changeccp didnt give me back my billion when they decided to frack around with game mechanics
just change the name back to kennyasscake
gm grimmi who else in the past has been the recipient of such a renaming
grown up people live by rules created by other people so actually its more then logical that we protest here when some people somehow are allowed to live by a different set of rules then us where we all apperently accepted the same eula and thus the rules created by ccp to play this gamekicking bobs arse isnt what this is about at all if i kick bobr kenny or bob its the players that i like to fight against so i dont really care that they changed the name but it annoys me that ccp once again favors the same alliance which they have favored in the past to allow something where other alliances had to disband and pay another bil to get their name righti mean why have rules in this game when the company that created them doesnt even live by them
that
total bs noone else could have had this done for them
this comment comes as no suprise to me grow up curso dont judge us by your standardsstupid comments like this only make you look like a child idiot
and irl just like in game people can find over time that there are reasonable exceptions to rules possibly even reasonable exceptions that were not accounted for when the rules were writtenwhat it comes down to is that you trust the entity that is supposed to uphold these rules to use fair judgment in those situations if you do not trust ccp to do this why do you keep supporting them by playing their game
in all fairness its never happened before so thats really just conjecture
signedthis has shown outright favoratism and it shoudent be allowed everthis just proves that some ccp are more than just friends with bob  they are bob
shame on you ccp
i merely ask one question what was stopping them from changing their alliance name just like any other alliance does by disbanding their alliance and reforming it paying the 1 bil isk and dealing with the sov changebecause when i cant do stuff which i want to do ingame without causing my current operations great disruption and losing a significant isk investment i suck it up i dont run off to ccp asking me to do it
i support this motion
to quote wikipedia  citation required
nepotism ftl for shame ccp either let this be something any alliance can do or roll back the change and make bob use the same rules as the rest of us
was a way to remove kenzuko from the corp history
i fully support this
one game one rule
you should try checking the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going onlike your other 1000 buddies
and yet this new gm grimmi post fails to address the reason why it was done why was it warranted what reasons were there that they were allowed to bypass the sideeffects of rebranding that everyone else would have to go through
they should at least be charged the 1b isk
sorry ccp that answer doesnt cut it if it was any alliance without a loooong history with ccp it would have worked but regrettably wont work in this casea company with a history of game involvement by its employees should know better
because the gms felt they should not have to suffer that fate
this is the answer given by ccp kenzoku was not an alliance created after bob was disbanded and the name choice of kenzoku was certainly not due to the unavailability of the name band of brothers it was an industrialalt alliance used by reikoku alliance creation date 20081208 2342exbob corps joined kenzoku to get sov back asap ccp says that the petition for name change came when bob was disbanded which means the name change petition dates almost 3 months after the creation of kenzoku alliance 3 months is not a petition made within a reasonable timeframe gms logic fails just the way ccp does once again by favoring bob and interpreting the rules for bobs benefit
at least we can see how effective the assembly hall is now840 supports and completely swept under the rug by ccp that is listening to your player base at its finest
underlying message implies that the earlier goon action which lead to delve war ii is started with eula breach itself else there is no reason to adjust that mentioned sufferingif any this answer implies not bob is getting a favor but are goons by not intefeering the first time which is only corrected by a name change and not by the punishment deserved for account sharingwhat does puzzle me that i wouldnt want to win any war liek this myself it would be a victory with a stain forever whats next  bribe  hacking  i never had so much fun in eve since war started not the way it started but the actual fun the game provides as bob directors stated on radio  we love the fight itself thanks for thatbut this time now again start with take away their sov  cause we cant hold on to delve we get our asses kicked weeeeee snif mommieee look their name is changed  weeeget a new diaper and login eve instead of forums and lets blow eachother up
special treatment club
if thats maybe true then why werent other alliances favored by this rule aswell from what i read even a once had to disband and recreate their alliance stain empire which first was named stian empire wasnt allowed a simple name change its the fact that again its bobr i mean the disband happened fully within the game mechanics no hacking or exploits were used so why would they be allowed a name change again that bob at the time was incompetent enough to let an afk director in tinfoil is something bob is supposed to be held responsible for now they lost most of their systems and also their name but it is all their own mistake and i dont see why some rules have to be bendalso the reason why i still pay and play this game is because of the people in my alliance and corporation if they would leave id be gone too
thread
this i dont care if its gmcustomer stuff you dont want to post this is simple proof or stfuso they chosse kenzoku as the new alliances name and then petitioned to have the alliance renamed bobr imediately after yeah sureand even if why did it take you 2 months to decide to change the name to bobr if you have done it before why didnt you change it right away then it just smells fishy no matter how you look at it and its your own fault ccpjust dont pull stunts like that if eve should ever get a half decent competitor you would start to pay for stuff like that with customers actually leaving for another game
what happened to eve being a harsh and unforgiving place nothing that happened to bob warrants this breach of policy this just smacks of ccp feeling sorry for themand after the past problems with favouritism this is a facepalm of epic proportions
if 840 supports warranted disbanding an alliance you might as well turn eve online into forum wars onlinehell 840 supports is pretty much less than nothing compared to the total population of eve and almost all the support is coming from goons and friends the alliances currently fighting bobthats like asking the gbcgkcasscakes whatever you want to call them to vote on whether all of goonswarm should be banned from the game or not and expecting a reasonable and unbiased result
why did grimmi not say why they broke the rules and changed the name
nothing against bob but this is unfair and once again showing ccp favortismcheating for bob
gm grimmi thanks for a quick responsewhile we worked onthe petition for about two months we do not feel that they shouldsuffer because of thatwhy not goons played inside of rules created by ccp if you feel those rules are not good just change themof course in a reasonable time framehaving them disband and lose sovereignty againwas not deemed appropriate in this caseif this would be a noob alliance than maybe yes but you are talking about a top  alliance which just failed at choosing a proper directorbecause of some incidents considering favorism eve community is watching you with argus eyes and thats for good reasons trust was slowly building up but now you again stress it why  pr  whats the real reason  we do not feel doesnt sound like a reason to meregards
posts like this are the reason you guys draw so much heat  you might be right this might be a poor game mechanic but if ccp will do this for you they should do it for everyone  coming here after the fact and saying the games broken but it got fixed just for us so deal with it just shows what a tard you arenever met anyone from bob and wouldnt really care except that this is just plain favoritism
christ learn to proofread
its not fair bob should suffer for there mistakes thats just for the other alliances who should only exist to entertain them  official ccp policy poor gm spindamage control is poor
this day you have showed insane favoratism towards a specific entity ccp  as far i know isent that against ur own rules of conduct gmsisd and other ccp personel cannot make exceptions like this can theymight aswell not have any rules if one your friends contacts you on msn sir molle and asks you to do something and you do itever thought about how it makes you lookthe eve community thats aware of what favoratism happened today any right minded person does not agree to what you have done why do you do it
travesty again
lmaopatheticits a game move on whats the real issue herei for one am real happy aboutt this as i get to see the kids wininggo bobhaha
as of the day bob died and kenzoku was populated by ex bob corps the new alliance should as of today have been pegged back to 1st day sov claim at a simple level to see that a system was alliance a sov 3 then after dt it is allaince b sov 3 is against every sov mechanic in the gameregardless of the ramifications for the alliance previously known as bob your change in the database should have instigated a new entry for sov and set them back seems that your relationship with this alliance is still as strong as everand dont use the not intefering with the initial flattening of bob as some form of equality pr stunt you had no grounds to help as everything was done within your own rules and mechanics they screwed up gs pounced on that they usd bugged sov mechanics to create a foothold back gs scuppered that on them as well  using in game rules and mechanics bob have done nothing up to now and have nothing done to them to qualify for any special treatmentnothing
this is wrong its just another attempt to beat the system and please dont say pushing the button again we are talking about another failure of ccp to work to there own ruleswhen are we going to get an official statement without the hurf bluf
got a petition going for my own alliance renaming if kenzokubobr can be renamed  why not me
real grown ups dont have rules real grown ups also dont believe in rights santa clause or the tooth fairy not that it matters but on what do you base a claim of favoritismccp has renamed alliances before and theyll do it again in the future on a casebycase basisso yeah feel free to call the waaaaaaaaambulance just dont expect anything to changepersonally i still say the reloaded name is dumb and kenzoku was better they basically got downgraded to a crappier name
doesnt matter if i like bob  kenny  bobr  beaver whateverbut this is just a giant jokeccp is gone one step to far with this 
well this is a different situation in the sense that they did lose all sov and they did pay 1b for a new alliance its just that they didnt do the disbanding someone else did and they didnt change to the alliance with the name they wanted but a temp one that has now been renamed to what they wantedi can agree that this is a messy situation but ccp felt it was justified and i doubt this decision was simply made because its bob if you feel ccp is still biased and after all the past outcries still favors bob more than anyone else then pretty much all you can do is quit complaining like this while you keep payingplaying doesnt help that much if i am to believe the accusations it certainly didnt help in the past since bob is still ccps favorite apparently despite all past incidentsif i never showed up for work but got paid every month anyway with the only downside being that my boss calls me once a month to let me know hes not very happy with me not showing up im pretty sure i wouldnt be too concerned about showing up any time soon p
what eula breach if ccp found that any wrong doing they would have reset the bob disband and gave them delve back since there were no rules broken they did not give them bob backthis new alliance is a whole different issue if it isnt and ccp is bending the rules because of the bob disband then that is a whole different can of worms
grimmi we all know that youve changed names that have been petitioned for being offensive just like the policy says what we dont know is when youve made exceptions and changed names for being stolen or misspelled or anything short of the reasons in your policy  and in fact the games history provides plenty of examples of refusals to do so stian alliance is the best example but didnt ethereal dawn get namejacked once and have to disband and reform once their name freed up again this entire controversy would probably vanish if you could point to examples where youve made this exception for anyone besides bobrkzbobr where are they and why does it take two months to address a name change petition anyway i have to assume that somebody suspected that it would cause a storm and you had to deliberate over it  why didnt you listen to them
so why was stain alliance which typoed their name to stian alliance not allowed a free rename without paying a billion isk losing sov etc back in the day can someone answer
one rule for all
hell why not
lol so what your saying is if ccp said ok guys we are going to give 1 alliance all the advantage and you can all go to the dogs you wouldnt complain just quit give up and play wow lol no you would complain and that is what peeps are doing this is a breach of the rules and it should be treated as such
well the problem is if all of ncgoons cancelled their accounts today if they got their way and came back they would have a lot less to come back to and we all know it the obvious solution is to make as much noisedisruption as they can and give ccp a real problem to solve unfortunatly we all remember how bitter ccp got when gs hot dropped a threadnought onto their forums my advice is to make sure every player who thinks this is a  move to post somewhere so that ccp realise people are annoyed at this favouratism
why did they use a temp alliance and not create a new one with the correct name because it would have taken time time spent not gaining sov in systems so they quickly jump in this temp alliance to circumvent the delay then petition ccp to change their name to what they wanted in the first placei dont like my name has never been a valid reason for ccp to change any player corp or alliance name hell there are alliances with valid reasons to have their name changed that have had their petitions denied since the game was released ie an alliance with 2 spaces in their name which causes all kinds of problemsthere are mechanics in place to allow for a name change they have consequences that everyone else in the game has to deal with except kenzokuccp
not supportedits obvious from the childish stamping of feet and the crying of rivers via the usual goonish forum spamming that they feel their only true victory was the identity theft this is what upsets them the whole ccp luvz bobz  hatez uz is just a too obvious feintwhen you cut through all the bull and rationalizing when push comes to shove the corp the goons made to steal the bob identity was just that a corp created to steal bobs identity well they werent in da databases yeah sure everyone knows who bob is and youre not them you were therefore impersonating another group of folks which is against the letter and spirit of the rulesi am glad to see bob get their identity back in some fashion
i petitioned to have an alt change name this was done 2 months after this birth i was told that he was to old to have his name changedkennny was over 3 months old when they petitioned and they got thier name changedccp 1 rule for all not just for bob
i support this 
you and others need some perspective too farits a namelittle ascii characters that mean absolutely nothing in terms of the gamein fact id support any petitioned corp or alliance change there is no real reason not to as it doesnt change anything but in this case going from one stupid name to one even more asinine
if bob wanted their identity back why didnt they use the name bob reloaded in the first place if they made the decision to join the kenzoku alliance to get sov1 back immediately they should be held to stick with that decision and not get to change their name to bob reloaded on a whim by breaking the rules
i dont support this sadly there is no thumbs down thingie to tick
just ban all goons nobody will cry for them
supporting
disband the cheaters known as kengoku reloaded
edit double post
i find it kinda funny there are people supporting this but also supporting ccp allowing a titan in amarrsorules
i hate goons but seriously ccp just rename the game to bob online alreadyps  what es me off the most is the lack of an explanation grow a pair face your community and explain your actions
actually they mean quite a bit the reason bob chose kenzoku was because they could get sov1 back immediately if they really wanted to be bob reloaded so much they should have made that alliance and faced the consequences no immediate sov and the advantages that came with itnow they get to change their name without paying alliance fee without losing the remaining sov they haveobviously it does have ingame effects
i support this
why is it that ccp are singularly incapable of appreciating that consistently showing extreme bias towards one group within their game reflects poorly on them as individuals and as a company the pathetic defence for their various actions  rewriting the rules censorship and whitewashing are gallingnow if i was in bob i would be laughing as their members are on the forums this level of direct company support and blatant support at that is simply unheard of and if i was a goon i would be laughing at the ccp given opportunity to lampoon both bob and its ccp membersrestricting debate to caod cesspool and a missnamed thread in assembly combined with an utterly trite statement from grimmi and mitnal in his overzealous locking shows that damage control is already in full swing i noticed that wrangler could not quite contain his joy at goon tears one day after eve as been and gone i would hope that the devs would list all their characters in game sadly i expect some would be so controversial they could not bring themselves to reveal them all all jolly good fun really 
what proof or stfu
the entire alliance was changed its not as if kenny was replaced by beaver its still just a name changethe thing is that when you look down at it all its just a name
i dont know but i sense nothing will change also i am sorry csm team but i think your hands are tied for such thingwondering how long it will take to ccp provide us players true transparency bring this news to bbc and show the world how connected ccp and bob are i am pretty sure it would be nice if bbc post another news like ccp broke its own rules and helped bob to reborni dont care if its done before but it was not transparent to playersdiscussing 
three threads down or sothe same people moaning about ccp favorism at breaking a rule support having chribba moving his titan to amarr thus breaking a ruleso u
they should have to disband if they want a new name this is complete bull
uhm im not sure in which country you live but here in the netherlands we have something called laws and people here also have certain rights maybe you support some anarchy party but i still believe i have to live by certain laws and i also have certain rights you know the right to vote is one of thoseccp as far as i know have only renamed alliances that had an offensive name other alliances like i said before had to disband and be recreated kenzoku is as far as i know not offensive at all since it means something like family or something so i dont see why they get their name changed for free and favoritism i think t20 is the best example about a ccps employees favoritism towards an alliance im not saying everyone in ccp support bob at least i surely hope not or favor bob but there are still certain ppl apparently that think its ok to bend the rules created by ccp
does ccp report to any external authority with regards to how they conduct business
gms i think you guys have forgotten to write this somewhere in the eula  all the crap written above doesnt work for band of brothersUFFFD band of brothers reloadedUFFFD kenzokuUFFFD band of brothers revengeUFFFDif you have done that you wouldnt try to find some crappy reasons to justify what you just have donejust to remember a few things
i had my corperation name changed through petition long before this i accidently misspelled the name i wanted and i petitioned it within minutes of creating the corperation and it was changed by a gm within 30minutesso i do not support this
which is probably the exact reason why the rename was allowed they had to emergency reform in a now proven to be pointless attempt to start regaining sov right away they did not have adequate time to pick a new name for their alliance and ended up being allowed a rename because of this or at least i believe this to be the thought process behind itim guessing the key thing here is that they did lose all sov and pay 1b when bob was disbanded they requested this change at the time and it took 2 months for gms to decide they just didnt form under the new name they wanted because they didnt have time to yes its still an exception to the rules but they did suffer the downsides paying another 1b and losing all sov even if they never planned for it im guessing thats where the 2 month comment comes from the loss of sov was 2 months ago at the time of the petition and the decision was only made now
no you must be a bob alt
actually the explanation is there now go read it p
i dont care what that alliance call themselves but this is not fair nobodys gotten their name or their corporations name changed before it says so in ccps rules that they cant if kenzoku wanted to reform as bobr they had to have dropped the alliance and reformednot to mention kenzoku was an existing alliance separate from bob before bob was disbanded so theres no reason why they shouldve gotten the name of bobr in the first place
a name which has effects in game with respect to sovereignity if they cared about their identity so much they shouldve created bob reloaded in the first place they didnt and chose to use the alt alliance kenzoku which made sense strategically for sov reasons they chose sov over identity it was their decisionnow theyre getting preferential treatment to change their name on a whim that no other alliance has ever gotten keeping their remaining sov while being allowed to change their name it is absolute bull
this is spot on ccp claim that the name was filed for a change before the disband of bob however kenzoku alliance was made 3 months before bob was destroyed so please clarify this one bob corps joined kenzoku to regain sov not to get away from a name their kenzoku alliance still has origional corps in this alliance due to it being a pet project
jesus pubbies are stupidchribba has a titan in amarr space because it was created before the mechanic to keep them out was implemented there are no rules that say dont bring a supercap into empire there are just mechanics that make it impossible currentlyhint if there was a rule that said no supercaps in empire ccp could just move it
ok so 30mins isnt 3 months is that your point
i got my name changed too but only after i got my previous name nerfedfree lube myholes
just did and i am changing my support the explanation makes sense
i support this
in what crazy world is kenzoku a misspelling of band of brothers reloaded 
i hate to say this but just as i got liking you you say something this idioticchribba has a dread in amarr not a titan the titan was just finished and there are people supporting moving it to amarrand just as those mechanics are in place so are the sov mechanics mind you the sov dropping upon name change is a mechanic not a rulealso i might not be a pubbie
who has written the ccp eula rules if you have the ability and decision to break them on a whim when something is needed to changeyou need an answer you community as posted above by someone else saying 1 thing that is faulse and giving no evidence or a reasonable reason behind any change is a disregard to any rules which govern the ccp  white wolf firm
no alliance has had thier name changed however many corps and characters havethe thing is this situation has never happened before where an alliance wanted to change thier name
the new name also breaches the naming convention 25 letters instead of 24needs changing again then maybe to something a bit better
tbh its nothing wrong with changing the name ccp whats wrong is that you once again showed your biaseven with kenny having just a few towers deployed if they had choosen the regular way all shipscap ships would have be ejected from the posses and standings in general would be messed uponce again you played in god mode ccp
so youre saying if they waited to reform their alliance the consequence would have been that they would have lost sov correctin order to reform quickly they had to use this already created alliance with a different name rightso they had a choice either lose sov or lose their name they made a choice to keep sovso what rule is it that says if you dont like the consequence of your decision ccp will adjust the game to fit your needs im sure a lot of scammed people would like to petition ccp under this new rule of not having to take responsibility for your actionswhatever capitalsupercapital veldspar mining craft
rules are rules i say give them the choice to either disband and reform or go back to the old name
supporting this after not being convinced by the gm explanationfavoritism is unacceptable in a mmo
no free go backs for bob  one rule for all
i present something else to the tablewhile we worked on the petition for two months i dont know about anyone else but for me as a software developer who provided a support service to its customers two months is 4000 in wages for this supporthow can that be even remotely justified
stian empire or stian alliance cant remember which made a typo and wanted to change their alliance name to stain empirealliance they had to disband and remake it because ccp wouldnt let them
anything wrong with changeing the name no not if ccp would do this for everyonehowever would ccp do it for anyone else notherfore signed i spent over 3 years in a corp that had a typo ccp wouldnt change it
i feel very frustrated and maddened too please visit your user settings to reenable images
update statements take a long time to formulate hell it took me 12 hours to type that first sentance
pure and utter crap to rename them gm grimmiwhile we worked on the petition for about two months we do not feel that they should suffer because of thatstupid people suffer in eve all the time why should it be no different for them you guys are 1 sided and bias regardless what fancy propaganda you spin on iti agree it should be removed
did you forget the rest of what i said or just decide to ignore itchribbas dread was in amarr prior to the lowsec restrictionthose that are crying omg ccp are breaking rules support breaking those rules these mechanics because the big issue is the sov 3 in a few systems rightso its ok to overlook mechanics for one individual but not to an alliance be it bob stian or whatever else i see
is the 3rd bob gonna be called band of brothers revolutions
i always wanted to have a surname but i misclicked earlycan i have that fixed please thanks
ccps actions display a distinct lack of class
die beaver diebobr lol
funny that you think its about you while its about ccp favoring 1 alliance which happens to be yours it doesnt really matter your alliance in what name or form will die soontm
i support this
at best this is a red herringthose that are crying omg ccp are breaking rules support breaking those rules are you trying to link all of the people supporting rerenaming bobr to kenzoku to some other thread where people want to move chribbas titandreadwhatever to somewhere it cant go on its own psypop
i vote no this gives goons  the 70 of all space holding alliances naped with them something to poast about this whole debacle is made of win imomaybe ccp has had enough of goons  friends its ccps game if you dont like it i know a few wow accounts for sell ccp pulling everyones equality chain is in hilarious something else to raise your righteous swords againstivory
wow ccp is openly trying to sweep this on under the rug like they have so many times in the past and completely ignoring the facts considering the kenzoku alliance was per existing for several months befor the exbob corps decided to join the alliance oh ccp will you ever learn cheating is not the answer if the its ok to be friends with players but when you start cheating like this and the many times in the past you lose credability and to be honest in the end thats all you have
gm could you please give us 1 alliance that has had its name changed without losing sovand please dont use a 1 member alliance that does not exist anymore or 1 that you started to get you guy off the hook as im sure we would all like to see these so called name changes
god ccp sure showed ustake all of our space disband our alliance and troll us into oblivion will you renames alliance you take that goonswarmmmmm argh
this
nout else needs said
dev alt spotted
the tears are strong in this one
this is no surprise
why u let them renamefavoring isnt good disband them and drop sov or rename back to kenzoku
to me it doesnt matter if its bobkennybeaver that had their name changed or even that an alliance did have a name change without dropping sov and paying to reformfor me it is the basic principal that a rule of the game was ignored by ccpwhich rule would it be next and for whose benefit seems to me that the door is now open for creeping illegitamacy in the decision making process of the gms and devsmy vote is for this to be discussed by the csm and for ccp to listen hard to what the community has to sayzos
ah yes so what you are saying is that you support what ccp did and thus dont really care that other alliances have to pay fees to get their names straight where you get to pay nothing for something that was your leaders own stupid mistake i like my logic and ccps is flawd
ccp your gm and dev behaviors are an ebarassement to the mmo community great game please sell it to a smarter company before you destroy it completely youve already killed solo and small gang pvp
not a red herring as much as pointing out the ironythis is fueled mostly by hatred of bobkenbobr and the level of whining and actual threadnoughtthreadspam level shows thisi honestly couldnt care less what they change thier name to i dont feel its any kind of an explot or doing anything on the level that gmsccp has done before that probably didnt make any wavesif ken was replaced by another alliance that would be different id be 100 with you all but its just a name change the old policy should have been scrapped long ago when you look at pos cap and sov effects that have been added since that time its essentially a blue law that would have been better addressed under different circumstancesbut if people here a large majority are so up in arms over this than showing consistency regarding other game mechanics would make this look less like jumping on the bob hatewagonthat being said i dont care about the name change i dislike bob just as most do i just dont see the big deal as nothing has changed but the name its not a new alliance not a replacing alliance but the same oneand as a consequence to this ccp will now or should now allow other corps and alliance change thier name without sov consequencesthat pendulum swings both ways i agree it should be allowed but that it should be allowed across the board from here on out
1 game 1 rule
nobody forced the bob member corps to join the existing kenny alliance they should have spent the money on the day they lost the previous name to buy the new one they wanted ccp should revert this change
supportin this ccp position seems biased here
ok fine then i will disclose its indeed all in the name as alot refer tookenzoku is a registred trade mark name and the name is licensed and protected therefor it cannot be used as the name of a alliance ingame or outside on forums as u can judge from the site itself the  means its trademarked name
crybabies they have what 4 systems with sov 3 they lost their alliance due to crappy gamemechanics get over it
we felt sorry our friend bobby lost his name through legitimate in game action so we ignored the alliance rules which they could have used to create this new name and renamed their alliance for themplease provide 1 example of this happening previously oh thats right you dont discuss petitions because you might be embarassed
hbo would like a word with you
okies heres 1 to throw in the hat say they were war deced name changed war becomes invalid so does that mean we can all get out of alliance wars by changing our alliance name and keep sov too nice work

look at how dumb you are you cannot trademark common japanese words else i would trademark every word in the engllish language and youd have to shut up
yes im sure theyll heed your dire warning i see the jfs fleeting up as i post thisthank you sir
youre missing the point by about a milethere is currently an in game way to change your alliance name several alliances before have had to do it the correct way and suffer the consequences of that its called disbanding your alliance and reforming itthe name change was never the point the fact that bob was given a free pass to get that name change when several alliances before have had to do it the in game and more restrictive way is what the issue here islets see what bob avoided by getting this free name changelost sovereignty1bn isk feemyriad logistics issuesif you cant see the issue and why its a problem youre just being coy as far as the bob hate is concerned maybe that hate partially stems from the fact that this is a second recorded time that bob has been directly helped by ccp outside of normal game policy notice i said recorded time because frankly we dont know what other little favors have been going on behind the curtain well never know
grimmis explanation was garbage ccp and their employees have been shown repeatedly to be dishonest and scheming cheats when it comes to their game there needs to be a audio question and answer session real time where ccp makes a feeble attempt to rationalize this blantant repeated and ongoing favouritismof course they will do none of this and will only do their best to sweep it under the rug while continuing to cheat to aid kenzoku and yet again spit in the faces of their playerbase
disband
dont ever not stop posting ever not stop never
this is some dodgy dodginess
ccp rolls over for love of molle again feet in the air for a belly rub
enough is enough
disband ccp please
its not polite to tell people to shut up dearmaybe u should be thinking of this as if it where a game its supposed to be about fun and frendshiplike that movie flop in the 80s  the goonies i think it was called where a bunch of wannabee adventures u know the geek section at school they slide from 1 accident into the next it sucked so bad but its still huge fun watching them suck at what they doits the same now its huge fun to watch and read wooooo maybe its a really deep consipracy who knows maybe its a goon petition to embaress bob  wooooooolighten up play some checkers and try to esee the humor of it allgl hf
noget over itstop cryingtry another emotional alliance director and do it all again
the whole matter with this is that it shouldnt even be disallowed for that reason even if done in the past changing a name should not affect sov maybe require a 1bn renaming fee the mechanics should be in place maybe im actually just advocating that because tbh i dont really care about ken or what happens in delve as i carebear away these stupidly long cap skillsand there are devs in gs also should we assume that there are shenanigans afoot dont take this as me trusting bob or not hearing you out because i do and to a large extent agree with youthe rule should however be modified to protect sovposs in any case
i support this
yes for a disband
i dont think ccp has a full appreciation of how dangerous a situation like this is to their game it is so ungodly frustrating to fight an entity in game that has developer support its like your fighting the game itself how long will we tolerate this  is it time for another open letter to ccp no its already gone past that point frankly i find this  too hard to stomach spawning bpos handing out motherships  changing the titan memorial rules when molles titan died  refunding titans after saying they never would 2 titans in game died to broken mechanics 1 azn and 1 d2 both pilots petitioned the loss but no exception was given a good policy the game has rules they can change but until then we live fly and die by them people care that its bob you did it for because you have a long history of doing them special favors but it really doesnt matter that its bob most people recognize that it matters that you broke the rules and gave someone special treatment whats even more insulting is that you changed their name to band of brothers reloaded as though by not giving them their original name back somehow it would be ok how stupid do you think we are what a disgusting insultthis action is shameful beyond words ccp your failure to act last time and your continued blatant cheating is a slap in the face to every person who plays the game
the forum activity is pretty light all things considered and this is not fueled by bob hate its fueled by a hatred of cheaters the fact this referes to bob is their choice not my design
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
gm response fails to address why they are allowed a name that is 25 characters long when the rule is 24 characters max
on one hand i agree with you honestly changing your alliance name should be as easy as paying a fee enter name press buttan that said up until about 48 hours ago that wasnt the rule the rule was magically changed on the fly for bob if you cant understand why that raises the hackles of several of us i am not really sure what to tell youthere may or may not be devs in goonswarm i honestly dont know though i would imagine the chances are high we have at least one but heres the difference there isnt an ny times expose article about how a ccp employee knowingly helped us get a bunch of expensive bpos that article exists about bob there is no speculation that developer favoritism might have happened in this case we know its happened for all intents and purposes we now know its happened twice so frankly the well goonswarm has developers they might be cheating to is a strawman at its finest
noi am quite sure it has been done before
true it seems that ccp are worried about losing beaver membership fees change our name or we will rage quit all on msn or ircwhat will we see next jove space opens with bobr already in space with sov 3 and i guess it will be more broken than delve
no examples no proof but i am sure
its been not done thousands of times more then its been done and id still like to see proof of it being done nobody forced them to use kenzoku they made a choice they can live with it as everyone else in eve has lived with their choices if even capitalizing a letter and not changing the name at all otherwise is forbidden then this is too sorry
rabble rabble
i demand justice
even had to go the extra mile and give them an extra character in the name
blah blah blah heard all this beforeseriously if you lot are so against this and wanna make a big enough statementnoise about it just quit dont resub dont log on etc etccause quite frankly all this thumbs up nonsense is gonna do absoultly nothing except get all you guys foaming at the mouth in such a emorage
ridonkulous
threadnaught
disband of brothers
ccp still doesnt get it
i dont care about ingame politics i dont really know any of the players in this what i do care about is that rules exist and they are consistently enforced no game not eve not baseball not football nor monopoly can long survive if the rules are changed to the benefit of one players over another without accountabilitynow we get to see if csm and ia is actually ccp being serious about watching over this game or if it truly was a publicity stunt
does this really matter since their name isnt even on the map anymore atlas holds more space than bob hahahahahahh
this is going to have more pages than the pos exploit thread

worse alliance ever
they are so bad they have to cheat just to hold onto their precious 3 nonstationsystems
disband
im not sure who is worse ccp or bob
no matter what their new alliance name is they will still be just as horriblerise put up more of a fight defending their own space than bob
how about no
how about you are a bob pet and dont really have your own opinion so we are just going to ignore you
just ask haargoth to disband it
1 game 1 rule
supported because the explanation is even more fail than the renaming itselffacepalm
 you ccp
no matter how this become to be but it should not happenwho ever made this has to realize it was a mistake to give preferred treatment to anyone on the game this is a complete denial of the premise of a living universe where every single action has a consecuence on the way the universe and on the players
hey how many alts did you create just to get the votes up on this one
10
the former members of bob chose kenzoku as their alliance name no other alliance has ever been able to change theirs and thus ccp allowing kenzoku to get rid of their terrible name for an even more terrible name is unacceptable this not only continues to prove ccps favoritism towards this terrible alliance but sets a bad precedent of changing alliance names ccp needs to undo this change and make the members of kenzoku either lose their sov and change the name by making a new allian ce the way the game is supposed to work or keep the terrible name the chose for themselves something every other player in eve who made a terrible name has to deal with
meh
youre arguing semantics im sure youre well aware of the fact they lost all their sov 34 considering it was a big factor in goonswarm conquering delve whether they made a new alliance or used kenzoku the sov 1 thing should have happened either way the requirement for sov 1 is that the towers have been anchored for at least 7 days not that they have been anchored for 7 days under the current alliance tag which is exactly why kenzoku regained sov 1 the dt after the disbandso yes they did lose their sov because in this context when talking about lost sov it means losing sov 234 not sov 1 which would come back the first dt after the alliance reform either way
oh my goodness you guys cry wayyyy too much wahh wahh wahhfor the slow people out there i do not support this grow up


this name change is dodgier than the navy issue drake im trying to sell
shut up 
cry more 
gmsdevs have a responsibility to be fair and impartial they should not be getting involvedif the way goonswarm took down bob was legitimate bob should not be given outside help they should have to fight using the tools all players have at their disposal if they want to rename their alliance then let them do it via the same options every player has available to themif goons cheated or used an illegal exploit to take down bob the servers should of been rolledback goons disbanded and their leadership banned permanently as an example of what happens to cheats
this
u shut up too 
rename them back to kenny then let them disband and recreate if they want another name i mean wtf really what happened to internal affairs keeping track of bs like this
my first post after 1 yr of eve playing besides tech supportso imagine how i feel about this
1 game1 set of rules for all
dont worry in a year or two there will be threads about goons
special treatment to bobken is unfairim dissapointed in ccp
dont worry in a year or two there will be threads about goonsif your rightits cuz we got there our selvesdont need help from a ing dev to win a fight
so you are saying they could have chosen to go with bob went it happened but chose kenzoku because it was easier less painful and cost less and for that they get to change their name because they chose the easier way
signedtoo many favours no rules broken to take their name no rules should be boken to fix it
signed
nah im reffering to the attention you  goons  dont geti didnt talk about stuff that you and the nc and drone region guys and fountain guys and creepy directors accomplished as nobody cares about this anymore
frankly if ccp are going to run eve like it was a freeshard where the guy whos running it does special favours to his mates i dont see why we should pay for ittheres plenty of impartially run mmos out there  i dont understand why ccp has repeatedly shown that they cant get their own staff to act professionally
because after all you still play
that can be changed
im supporting this topic disband bobr
before my time with goonsbut another example of ccps lack of edicateetiquette
ill support ccp undoing the name change and then bob can decide whether they want to disband and reform under a new name or keep kenzokui think an automatic disband though is a bit too harsh since all bob actually did was ask for a name change whomever actually changed it was the only person to break game rules
signed
who cares what impact does it really have on anything
im supporting this topic disband bobr
if they get to keep bobr then no kenzoku sov claims should carry over
remove them
yes
70
absolutely support the op
you would think that after past events ccp wouldnt be stupid enough to do it again
disband no special privileges
10
he is right
ccp gives bob more stuff how about endless gm errors to favor bob pilots in the past battles where bob only where given cap ships from fights we won and killed 34 times same faction modules on same ships was not enough t2 bpos and what not 40 billion rip off by gms lead actions from alliances to end certain alliances anyone jebus the almighty christ guys cant you see this is wrong  fix your damn stuff ccp end to all ccp intervention right here make simple rules and follow them suit 100 dont make up new rules as you go along in time as the years of eve time goes on and on let the player elected council end this ccp crap player supported to any alliance from any gms angle of game hax im sorry this is fud voted
disband bobr
 lol  kill kenny 4ever 
1 for disbanding bobr
agree
yes
10
thumbs up
since were excluding voters now you shouldnt be allowed to vote because you belong to the alliance in question
a game mechanic was used to kick your corps out of boba game mechanic was used to disband your alliancea game mechanic was used to even create a corp to keep the name from being used againa game mechanic was not used to change your alliance name gm access or something like it waswhat happened to your alliance wasnt fair but oh well cry more kenny boy
if anyone needs reminding of why we love poopsocking bob this here is p good summationthanks for this

it does by now that thread has 48 pages interestingly these threads are now the biggest two threads in recent assembly hall history some might call it telling that they deal with a similar topic lack of transparency and doubts about the evenhandedness of ccps handling of rulebending eventsyoud think that at some point ccp would have gotten the message yet they keep making the same kind of mistake over and overfunny that
and whos alt are you jane
tldr but i support this proposal
10
believe it or not but this is my main
loltastic this thread is becoming
naturally if i had a band of devs behind me i would laugh too
you afraid that bob is gonna win so you have to disband em again to make you feel like you actually beat them

i support

really pathetic from ccp shame on youoh wait i want change the name of my alliance sure i can isnt iti want to call it red phone t20i can pay send you naked girls or whatever you want thank yourules are for each player no exception
i support
nobody gets special treatment 1
btw you guys need to make more alts to spam this thread tbh not enough so far
i support
no special treatment for anyone please
ah and therein lies the issueyou see sir every player has a right to comment on breaches of the rules irrespective of their time in game or alliance affiliation the rules and interpretation of them should not be exclusive to bobzos
10
band of brothers brothers reloaded developers reloaded ed or whatever was beaten fairly are you i mean they afraid of being forgotten that badly as just another alliance so they have to get the gms to save themgo away

that must be an joke from ccp  remove them 
neither should you for currently being in direct conflict with the alliance in questionif that rule applied and to alts as well that would probably remove like 90 of the votes in here
supported
yeah goons spamming certainly indicates which topics are in need of attention
if only for the drama and to make them feel even more persecuted
shame on you ccp
im a new player who was drawn to this game after hearing about the whole bob disbanding drama the idea of a game where player created countries fight and win by real world espionage turned this game from something id never heard of to something i had to play the true sandbox  game makers set the rules and within those rules players do whatever they want that is tremendously appealingchanging the rules when the rules do something you dont like ruins all of that
to be fair i can think of one notable example of this happening previouslyhowever as bob wasnt involved and in fact the people in question are allies of our enemies i very much doubt we will see a similar threadnaught demanding they are disbandedits a name people the name of collection of geeks in an interweb astrowarrior gamechillaxadded redux would have got my vote over reloaded  just sayin
ccp bob fan boys nothing new

if they wouldnt fix star fraction they shouldnt have fixed kenny ccps got some xplaining to do imobabbette
equal treatment
yarr
my sentiments exactly
noi like all the crying
so youre not content with taking all their sovyoull now go after them for getting a name change jesus christgive it a rest
all of their sov wasnt taken which is why everyone is making a big deal duhps you spelled your name wrong
what a shame ccpdisband bobr
i really cant believe were still seeing this type of treatment how is ccp trying to be neutral youd think that they would have learned their lesson the last oh i dont know 3 times they were caught in bed with bob seriously these events dont affect me directly but it still bothers meand actually i dont think disbanding bobr is enough i think that all corps in bobr should be disbanded and the corp members shouldnt be allowed to be in a corpgangalliance together ever
multiple broken rulesi support this
i keep hearing people claim that this has happened before but i have yet to see an actual example
rules are rules and everyone must follow them
they must lose sov and pay to remake alliance not just change the name for free this is sad
like bob is only one ive petitioned for my alt name to be changed from stupid letters kdkgfjkdjhg to a real name and got it and youd be shocked the favors to certain large carebear corp on reimbursements ah well the squeaky wheel gets the greasegood thing other corps know how to keep their mouth shut when a small favor comes their way

lol thats what this is really all about you guys should be happy bob is here it takes the microscope off all the other alliances doing things youd have fits about
so i am sitting here at work eating lunch and i am telling my coworkerthis food is bland i think it needs some saltlo and behold i run across this thread full of plgsmm and their alts tearslife just doesnt get any better then this1st failure being who you are2nd failure we take our caps back3rd failure your crying about a nameif your scared just say your scaredi tell you i love my alliance and the people the allies that i fly withwhen the alliance got disband and its assets stolen all i heard over ts was people laughing and the top brass telling everyone sit tightplz more salt my lunch is starting to taste that much better and maybe ill be able to save some for dinner
sorry i dont believe this for a second i have a corpmate that was unable to change their name and we are just a regular corp in eve no strings attached and if it is true for you then once again why the breaking of their ohsostrict policy for some and not others either way its a screwup that is the issue here enforcing the rules uniformly for all players
the rules should apply equally to all not at the whim of some gm who decides to break them for someone
hey guys hes right look how much we suck
haha goons failed because you got camped into an npc station for a monththats some serious spin
disband them 
supporting
though if you look at the alliance rankings it still says kenzoku
or maybe even let them keep their new name but change the ticker to t20
oops ignore this post
thats because the alliance number in the server code hasnt changed
shame on ccp
yes disband them
rules shouldnt be ignored for any alliance either let every alliance do it or none
no more preferential treatments
is this the queue for free t2 bpos
cry more it doesnt make you all look pathetic or anythingthis is not the first time something like this has happened but because big bad bob you are all afraid of is involved it must be badyour tears they are delicious
you are correct this is at least the third or fourth time that a ccp employee has unfairly favored bobedit theres plenty of pubbies and even bob pets posting in favor of this it really is an issue that transcends player politics a developer has to ensure that all of their employees act impartially period theres no rational way to argue against that
rename kennie to band of brothers or bobr to bobit was underhand what happened to them and if it happened to any other alliance it would be treated as an exploit everyone needs to get off their high horses and give them the respect they deserveccp should be enforcing measures to make sure alliances like bob dont get stung like this again
ive failed to see a single non gooncoalts postits pretty funny
disband them or sov 0
sure its all a grand conspiracy what could possibly be objectionable to rule changes and favoritism especially towards eves least pleasant group of beardos
also not an alt and too new ao dumb to figure out how to put my corp tribal liberation under my name but looking through this thread i do see a whole lot of people with corporations that arent goonswarm amazing how deep and insidious this goonswarm conspiracy goes
its a shame what is done in the past time for bobstop it right now ccpvoted for disband that namechange

petioned this abuse of gm powers with no responce so far
not that it will make one wit of difference
no actually they fail because we got outgood thing you didnt finish school i would have had to be worried about you
no
was getting out the reloaded part did anyone bother to explain blanks arent real bullets
no we failed to realize that even after you got out you would still just lose caps and not gain any space i think if we had known as much we wouldnt have bothered camping you into pr in the first place
ccp is violating our civil rights someone call martin luther goon
no to preferential treatment yes to consequences
they used kenzoku as an alliance because it gave them a sov advantage day 1 if they dont like that choice there are ways to change your alliance name through nondeveloper intervention
i support this
actually you know what they managed to find a name that sucks even more than random japanese gibberish and it makes it easier for us to scam using the real bob i say let em keep the name
i have a dreamthat all players are treated equally and the creators of our grand universe follow the rules that they have claimed a desire to enforce on behalf of all of usthat those band of brothers would gain the advantage of real stability through professional therapythat each and every player can play this wonderful game without fear of favoritism of one group over another in regards to the rulesand thnx for the idea cipher7hehehe
this issue isnt about new bob name its about a change in ccp public policy that they havent made publicif they are providing alliance name changing services they need to let everyone know how to do it
just to plaster this up again for the beaver fansit is not about the namei mean dont get me wrong the new name is hilariously badreloaded somewhere laurence fishburn is taking the blue pillits about the bending of rules by ccp yet againwhy have an internal affairs department promising oversight and then go bend the rules for the same guysthat prompted the internal affairs department in the first place t20 etc etcand please do not point out gm grimmies smokescreen nothing to see here move along postapparently we are deemed 12 years old no im not p
i support this petition one set of rules for all players no exceptions
shut up
i agree that it will be fun trolling them out of this name as well but the issue here is that ccp bent the rules for these arrogant buttes which is totally unacceptable bob knew the rules when they chose to run with kenzoku and keep sov over having sov take a little longer and creating a name that isnt stupid they should have to live with this choice or do as everyone else does and have to lose sov to form a new alliance im sure hundreds of players have petitioned to change an alliance name in the history of this game and this is the first case of it happening on top of that it doesnt even follow proper naming convention 25 characters instead of 24 and lowercase letters in the corp ticker
i spk for myself and my view does not reflect my allainces view in anyway i hereby place my vote to get ridof bob reloaded 1 rule for all no bias to one alliance period
aye man i hate getting lied to all the time by ccp ccp you did not have a flexible policy with regard to renaming alliances ccp you did consistently make corps and alliances disband and reform to change their names the game is about 6 years old we have 6 years of history to see how things worked ccp bobkennybeaver asked you to cheat they asked you to do something that you hadnt in the past done for anyone else nor would do for anyone else they asked you to cheat for them and ccp you did it you ccp can blah blah blah rationalize and lie all you want but thats all it boils down to plain and simple i dont care what side of the war a person is on i dont care if someone wants to be called prince i dont care if someone wants to be a weirdo and use odd symbols in a name and be referred to as the artist formerly known as prince its not the name that matters what matters is that with incidents like this ccp demonstrates how dishonest insulting and unprofessional they are on some issues this leads to the bigger question which is if theyre willing to act so poorly in the public eye what nonsense are they pulling when they know nobody is watching to those that say out with the conspiracy theories and away with the tinfoil hats i say you are dodging the issue stop just stop its all just blah blah blah to me i and others who are angry do not have conspiracy theories and tales of alien abduction and cia planned coups bob asked ccp to cheat for them ccp did it if ccp did that and other things on behalf of bob they arent trustworthy its plain its simple its public its fact ccp might get some things right but they got this and a bunch of other things absolutely wrong
an interesting thing to note is that issue is a public one  as opposed to private one the subject of discussion is not a character not a person it is a pure game entity therefore there is no reason to hide any gm action or conversation all gm action on this matter should be publicly available because there is no valid reason to keep it hiddenis there a reason to hide this information let people know
give us the list of criterias that needs to be filled for a wish to change alliance name to be approved and the timeframe starting at alliance creation within whitch the petition must be filedif you are going to give silly answeres as in the gm thread atleast have the ing balls to back it up with something other then empty wordsive been playing since 06 and every year some silly  about ccp favouring one entity is brought up and more often then not you can guess who is on the reciving end well not any more since we dont know what the hell bob wants to call themselves next week
ccp your community are asking for an explination as to what is going on and why it seems that you are increasingly bias to 1 faction in eve1st saying in a pre prepared statment that kenzoku request there name to be change when they formed up there alliance however the corps known as band of brothers corps were not even in kenzoku so your statment gm grimmi is false information unless you are saying that they asked for a name change 2 months before there alliance was disbanded making false and unjust decisions against eula when this is what governs ccp is against your own legal documentation 2nd this whole issue is mostly with regards to ccp making rules setting them in motion making them a legal document then changing aspects of it to allow an alliance to control ccp decision making internal affairs seems to think this decision has no bias in this however your own eula rules commented by people in this thread signed by senior managment at white wolf and ccp game is critisized for controlling in game politics 3rd game exploits dont even try to say that band of brothers were not involved with this their own leadership has said if there is a game mechanic we can use so we get the upper hand we will seeing large numbers of towers in 1 place setup the same announcements by ccp of the setups matching these setups used in previously owned space delvethen it comes down to supercapital reimbursement for no reason at all reimbursement of titans because they have lag when further released documentation by ccp games has said that lag is not an excuse to replace ships lost in a combat situation however to reimburse 2 titan class ships to 1 previously mention alliance is getting a little rediclious so through all of this i would like to ask some simple questions is it also fair to assume that a chars in game name of sir molle is a ccp employee1 who does govern ccp and why are they allowed to interfere with in game mechanics who completes the audit needed which manages ccp 2 can we get a statment with a real actual reason as to why ccp games and white wolf felt that a name change of an alliance was critical then to plz also comment why a name is meant to be 424 chars long however band of brothers reloaded is 25 3 plz provide a list as to any alliance who has their alliance name changed in the same fashion as this also quoted in your prepared statment4 will csa be allowed to have interaction with this decision making with this thread now reaching 57 pages which is 1697 posts and alot of posts in favor by the ccp community to not change the name
supportedsomething like this required attention and voting of the full eve online community if one name gets changed due to petitions then everyones names can be changed
this is truely amazing all your posturing all your petty demands you dont get it do you they do not have to prove or provide you anything they have n o t h i n g to awnser for you are not some all powerful agency who can shut them down for noncompliance there are no laws to bend them tothe only thing they would respond to is loss of revenue if you really want them to listenquitbut funny thing is everyone posting thier little thumbs up in this thread and the other 1200 threads wont quitso keep screaming into the wind i wonder sometimes where the world would be if more people went to this length and put this much passion into real life issuesjust lolpsthe csm is nothing more than a sham something to make you think you have a real voicesad really
i think people keep playing because they enjoy the game im glad they play because the game would be a lot less fun without other players even the ones in the alliances we are at war withhowever i think people also want every player corporation and alliance to obey the same rules
yea  you all for demanding clarification on what rules are in place vov
oh no we dont have a spy in the bob holding corp to disband them again lets flame ccp
not supported couldnt give a  what poeple call themselves tbh
law or justicewe all know that the disbanding of bob was done in a way that begs the question of what was intended by ccp policy with regard to the one button option that sort of thing was not intended to be used in the way it was we know thatfurther the letter of the lawis open to interpretation in its applicationand none of you are the judges in this case you are the public
ccp has done it again kenny can have whatever name they wish but they must do it the proper way leave kenzoku and create a new alliance as bobr no problem herebut renaming an alliance is pure nonsense and against the rules guess i ll start petitions to change my name cause well at least i have a valid reason it starts from a and when i began eve i had no idea of what impact will have in fleet fightsdo not disband bobr but change their name back to kenzoku if they wish they can create a new alliance from scratch as the rest of us peasants
registering disapproval at the manner and methodbad precedent especially with the precedent regarding sov mechanics
you are complicating simple stuffdisbanding of bob even though i do not agree with the action was under valid game mechanics ccp is to say what should be from now on and change the specific mechanism but what has happened is history and more importantly within the ruleson the other hand renaming an already named alliance is against the rules of ccp not to even mention the character limit not a game mechanism not even related to button within the game or option of every single eve pilot you got pumpered again on the backs of the rest that cannot because we must follow rules that you do not
plainly said we the community pay the wages of the gms devs and any other employee working on this game so we want answerstaxpayers get answers when a political figurehead screw up this is not much differentccp we need answers now please stop avoiding us and trying to dodge a bullet
oh mister high and mighty whats that make you then why are you special
again either you did not fully read my statement or chose to ignore the point i was making lets reclarify1 they can change rules or policy in the game without advanced notification or clarification2 i was saying the only way to really make them sit up and take notice is a mass cancellation of accounts which in turn would cause a financial statement to the powers that be and would cause serious discussion among the top echelon of executives that govern the policies of the company what most of you still completely fail to realize is that the only true power you wield is the power that comes from your 15insert currency here a month they know that even if 10 of you who have posted quit your nothing more then a drop in the bucket because tbqfh 90 of eves population either doesnt know about the situation or just doesnt really care
ccp is too busy sending all of their money to an unknown offshore bank account to respondwatergate apocrypha
1 yes the goons whine alot jesus god please stop whinging2 yes in this case it is warranted i am not a goon fanboi pretty much goons are pathetic3 can ccp please freaking respond obviously a lot of people are upset and it does appear to be favoritism4 my guess is this is just temporary anyway bob are having fun at goons expense and they will reform under a new name eventually since the remaining systems they have dont amount to much 5 people who think the original bob disbanding shouldnt have been allowed are straight idiots and fanbois it was legit game mechanics gtf over it renaming an alliance without losing sov is not legit game mechanics
the same rule of all of us hum in the old times for sure but not anymore  and finaly not fair for the rest of our community except kenzokubobbobr 
this is one of the most assinine statements ive read yet since you want to compare this to polotics if a polotician screws up yes he must by law awnser for his actions or be 1removedvoted out of office 2arrestedimprissoned based on the sevarity of the actionsthis is a company providing a service a service whos terms can be changed at will by said company in which you agreed to by clicking the accept button on the liscense agreementyour only true recourse is to quit or deal with it
i dont exactly like my name can i has get it changed
actually the prestige this whole situation brought on the old bob vs goon alliances made this known to the whole community they even update it in the in game news networks so people do know look at how many views and supports this topic got what made ccp different from the gold digging companies of other games is how well they pay attention to their customers take away the core players from the game then it will fall like a house of cards one rule for all ccp no favoritism dont allow yourselves to become like one of those companies
how many fsking bugs and poor mechanics are in this game that every freaking player has to deal withyou spoiled cheating piece of crapand damn you had a chance to rename your alliance and you chose that  phailbuffet
this isnt caod
rules are rules cant break them even if its your own rules especially as we all pay equally and so have equal rightsbobs want bob back  they start new alliance and do it the way everyones done it before
im confused what happened again a gm did something to favor bob really a gm so this gm did something epicly horrible and were sure its a gm so and like it was something game changing and unallowable what could this supposedly gm have done change a name dear god black is white up is down bob are goons its a ing game something unintended did happen remember when those guys bumped people out of a pos with titans game mechanics were in place to allow it but zomg it was so haxorly bad and game changing it must stop and it did and players got threatened with bans because of using a game mechanic in an unintended fashion take 2 an alliance got disbanded in an unintended way it wasnt closed it wasnt disbanded corp after corp got kicked until even the executor corp got kicked not left from its own alliance now compared to titan bowling to dooms day a few dozen ships this is a far greater issue when it comes to game mechanics bob lost most of its space 34 of 00 is down here making sure it stays that way weve laughed weve giggled and all thats really happened in the end is we got our name back sorta guys outside your door is this big wide expanse called the outside if you find yourselves really thinking that this is such a huge deal get your fat asses up walk outside and watch the wind blow and the leaves rustle for a few take a look at that real girl jogging down the street take a few deep breaths and then realize that theres far bigger issues in this world than a stupid game name being changed because ffs it doesnt affect your life unless you are a cyber tool who cant let it go
tell me about it so now that ccp are allowing name changes who do i contact to change mine
people still dont seem to understand its not about the name lol if a hooker gave your friend a bj and gave you nothing despite you paying would you be mad sure now imagine it happening a second timeitt learning comprehension died
does the csm have a position on this
nerds whining about their ecivil rightsnews at 11
oops refer to 5 post up please
again  which msn contact was it this time
the mittanni clearly intended to disband your alliancealso this isnt about a simple name change its about the rules
it is a big deal only because with the name change you kept the sov you could have done it the proper way as the rest create a new alliancei agree with you that game mechanics happen to not work as intended and are getting fixed all the time but thats game mechanins alliance name change is not a game mechanism it is pure favorism and that is unacceptable by ccp or any other company that want to see their fixed rate paying customers the same
renaming kenzoku was completely unnecessary i thought name changes were just for offensive names and such not for people deciding hey we want to jump into this alliance to quickly get some sov and then change it to a new name later
again youre quoting rules of a game not even a real sport but a cyber online fun game and even worse nobody is affected by this one bc nobody who wants a name change has a history to back up the logic for their change like bob does grow up you tool
id like an immediate refund of the isk spent when reforming our alliance after it was formed incorrectly the first time please just for the sake of fairnesslets see if that happens disband bobr if you pronounce the ticker it sounds more like band of bristolians now
firtst of all i corrected what you saidactually it was labeled an exploit and then suddenly because of your whining it was not labeled an exploit anymore despite no in game methods being there to stop it then you did it dozens of times a day for a solid month and then the very day goonswarm launched its first mothership thereby gaining the capability to do it back to you the gms suddenly said it was an exploit again and not to do itno sign of favoritism there really
or they could roll back the sov and give us our alliance back this is the far less of 2 evils its not like we didnt suffer initially talk about wanting to kick a guy while hes down
shame on ccp one rule for all
so even you admit that this was special favouritism ccp only shows to bob
at this point this is a 58 page threadof course its complicated the matter is still under investigation by ccp any changes ccp makes will benefit all of eve in fact i could reasonably argue that what ccp has done already has opened up all sorts of possibilities for flexibility in how ccp applies these rules this game is not static
i support this
i like your its just a game defenseits just a game get over the fact were at the center of yet another rulebreaking fit of nepotism its not important its just a game go outside let us sweep this under the carpet with our other shenanigans nothing to see here and then you see a ccp logo in an open closet making humping motions towards a loud slurping noise
the question for me is  would ccp have done this for anyone else and the answer is obviously no
quoting the rules of a game is wrong that shows how ignorant you are like bob does too bad ccp shouldnt be choosing favorites over others a failed alliance is a failed alliance we cant just bail you out because your too big of a company to fail wink wink
mate have they ever rolled back the server not even with the pos exploit that happened and that was a serious problem i totally get where you are coming from if you want to be named koukouroukou band of brothers thats a valid request the mechanics of the game allows you to create any alliance name you want the function that got bob disolved was a a valid mechanism right or wrong but it was there what happened cannot be changed although ccp must introduce a fix or something because it is really not how disbanding should happen but you must follow the rules because atm you didnt and that have impact on the rest you kept sov 3i for example 23 weeks ago i petitioned to change my alts corp history and delete a corp from the list that couldnt hurt anybody yet i got a negative answer stating that characters names and history cannot be changed iguess the gm was wrong after all should i petition again it was pure sentimental value for my alt to just have 1 corp in his history should i be treated differintly
oh snap bailout reference its on
while im not really a fan of goonswarm atleast they dont pretend to be some benevolent alliance of loving goody twoshoes and friendly to all like some people assume they should be theyre s and thats thathowever this does set a relatively poor precedent once again that ccp favors tafkabob whether through the action of a rogue gmdev etc in which this is obviously not a case of a rogue gm since it was not immediately rectified in which it seems like a sanctioned change specifically for this alliance with less of a reason to have their name changed than alliances that accidently made a mistype and have to reform their alliance  fees kenzoku existed for quite a few months before the former bob corporations joined into it to start on their sov fest there was no legitimate petition to be made here there apparently were no complaints about kenzokus name until the former bob members joined up at which point they had no standing they could have easily created a new alliance on the spot with their preferred name costing them an hour of time at most since alliance creation is instantaneous they did not do this when it was an option because they had supposedly bigger priorities and now it has turned into a big pr nightmare for ccp because of their actions in helping former bob members i cannot help but put in my support for this matter as it is an obvious violation of ccps own ethics to breakbend their rules for a singular or limited entity regardless of how big or small the slight supposedly was it puts into motion a very slippery slope of eventsas a side note for those saying paraphrasing here because quoting every single one of them would use up all my posting space bob was the first alliance to have this exploit legitimate game mechanic used on them so they should be given some leeway is a terrible argument for the mere fact that almost the exact same thing happened to maximum yarrage and if you did any sort of research you would know that
please link a post where ccp says that the game mechanic which lead to bob disbanding was unintendedgame mechanic please link that post or blog and i will go away
yup thats right i went there
if ccp allowes this to happen for you then ccp is obligated to offer the same service for all eve pilots characteralliancecorp name changes with just a petition for no apparent reason if that happens then i have no problem with the status of kenbobr then i ll vote the name change of yours in a bling
signedas george orwell said in animal farm all animals are equal except the pigs who are a little bit more equal
actually it isnt alliances before you have had to change their names by abandoning sov alliances after you likely will as well you do not deserve special treatment in any way shape or form i pay the same god damned subscription fee you do
haha easily said by the alliance that gets whatever it wantstry being a normal player and asking for favors
heh ccp does it again
i think they are obligated toofor no apparant reasonthere may be a reason whoever called me mister i am not
agreed can you plz petition to change my name to start with a letter other than the first and last 10 of the alphabet plz because when i started eve i had now idea that just a letter will play such a huge role on how fast i am getting primary and blown up in a fleet battlevalid reason hehedit can i have your number i am a mister
dear god ccp do you not learn from your past mistakes again we see ccp is willing to bend their own rules for a favored alliance the gm who did this is at best allied to the corp formally known as bob and willing to break their own rules at worst he is an idiot who did not consider the ramifications of such a contentious change and should not be doing the job he is doing
poor showing ccp figured you would have learned from the first time around

i like how the bob guys who clearly throughout this whole affair have held this game more dearly than most men hold their own families keep telling those angry at their cheating to grow up get over it its just a game etc theres an irony in there somewherethe people you bob members keep saying grow up to are by and large not part of an omg elite pvp clan they probably havent accrued years on this make believe world and they sure werent crying online two months ago because their lifes work was destroyed theyre probably by and large like me people who are not directly affected by this at all but still find themselves annoyed that the game administrators are so clearly favoring a seemingly random group of beardos by habitually changing the rules in their favor

by your logic titan bowling was legal and legit yet your mates still want us banned for that one
in all the hype over the new mission arc one thing is sorely lacking consideration of gallente standing i have a 521 gallente navy standing i had a drop on a mission an invite to come and run the mission arc i was gunned down by the gate guns the second i jumped into gallente space the invite seeding in caldari must stop most people running missions in caldari will have negative standings with gallente all this is doing is getting a lot of caldari pilots ships blown upi feel betrayed and lied to everything i read in blogs and forums and chat nothing was ever mentioned about this all i want is my hawk back and a public notification to everyone in eve warning them of their standings before they attempt this mission
signedtheir should be a big red sign at the login screen saying when logging into eve you might lose ships  items  whatever if you dont use your ing eyes do not login if you are not absolutly sure how to read what is written
im in support for the mission bitbut the loss of your ship is your own damn faultcheck standings next time you fly into an another empires space
i recall the first thing i ever read about arcs stated that they would be across all four empires if youre at shootonsight standings you cant do it and this is fairly well advertised in the information ive seen about epic arcs now the arcs are lame in a hundred other ways from all i hear  to my understanding its like grinding a l1 agent except with more flying around and less reward  but 521 is your problem not ccps
are you referring to that mission where you destroy a single frigate and you get an item called smugglers warning about sister alitura the description for that readsremember that sisters of eve agent alitura who nearly caught our trail the boss called in some favors and got her reassigned to arnon ix in genesis the good sister alitura may be resourceful but shed need a capsuleer with clearance to all four empires to be any threat and we know how much the sisters love capsuleers i bolded the relevant bit doesnt that pretty much tell you that you need good enough standings to do the mission
i brought up the issue long agothe sheer fact that the epic storyline arc deal is 1 mission thusly no arc at all on top of that people have horrible standings with sisters andor gallente where the mission happensthey responded with yayayay we will do that soon
thisa mission that requires people to read imagine that
this is a good thing
id love to see a new forum section one with a ticker next to it called hidea forum section so exclusive that it would make the forums so much more agreeable to anyone who doesnt really care about why what who or when the goons or bobkenbobrwhatever had an issue with their bathroom soapsnot to say they only discuss useless issues or that some things brought up in these discussions arent valid points but god damn it its turned into something thats worse than a public american election if it were led by chipmunks and all the votes were counted by who got the most tomatos thrown at them within a given timeframe while solving a sudoku puzzle we all know they couldnt do a sudoku anyway thats really all i have to say i dont want to add to the drama and if you have nothing more to say than bullcrap then please shut up in here either you support a new section called internal workings or stationside gossip or whichever name they may choose or find to their liking or you dontmy only motivation to post this is that the alliance discussion boards used to be interesting to read  when like someone other than the goons or bob had a thread there  threads that are majorly more structured and less cavemanesque once they hit two pages quick edit for those who may have misunderstood this would be a section for threads about all alliances that have outward drama or babble not just the two mentioned above
gentlemen of goonzoku reloaded if you could please relocate your drama to the conveniently ropedoff area it would be much appreciated sincerely the managementthumbsup for caods existence and keeping the drama out of the useful forums thumbsdown for the belief that caod would be useful without the drama  seriously about the only things you can discuss there are battle reportswhich invariably disintegrate into bickering over how it actually went down and drama there has to be a cesspool for that stuff and id prefer it all stayed there instead of leaking out
im sorry the rest of you are so completely uninteresting 
sweet a new quote edit rats too big for my sig argoh and this  supported even if it wont happen
if you are referring to the kengokus renaming themselves it wasnt about alliance drama it was about the rules
that bs about renaming is just the recent news you really havent been here enough if you havent seen the countless annoying and brainkilling threads that pop up regularlyand its more often goons than bob to be fair but not like i care i just would like to see some small inkling of something decently readable for once
its drama that happens to be about the rules its not a nice calm thread of people debating the merits of alliance renaming policy  there are some people doing that but theyre getting drowned out by raging goons harddoneby bobs and flaming alts on both sides and thats just in the main thread  the ten parodyrestatement threads add nothing whatsoever to the discourse except volume and yet people keep making them and thats just on the assembly hallunless something weird happens this is the last post im making on this issue its just getting out of hand and nothing were discussing is going to help ccp should explain which of their staff did this and why bob seems to have gotten consideration no other alliance has gotten and the csm should definitely be involved in the process at some level but talking in a thread discussing threads parodying threads about the real issue solves nothing lets stop bumping the tenthread drama bomb and get back to discussing the actual issues of the day
im pretty dissapointed in a lot of things about our most recent patch and im not going to make this a wall of text graphicsnew pos sheilds are ugly as hell too much to look athurts my face i really liked the old graphic can a brother get an amennow all ewar pointscramtracking disrupt looks the same its flashier and prettier maybe but again too much to look at bring the old stuff back plssound the volume gradient relative to the camera and proximity of the ship is much steeper now kinda sucks if you want to have sound but not be in the face of your ship all the time please fixplease consider this leaving some things to the imagination is a good thing i belive your dev team was going for spicing things up or something to that effect but to be honest i think a lot of stuff was overdone if you want to improve graphics i would do it subtly why not fix the sky coloring in starsystems there has always been that pixelated ugly transition between contrasting colorsand effects how about making asteroids or stations hard sprites ie they block turret or missiles lol that has always been cheesyok im about through and the reason that i decided to post today is that i have thouroughly enjoyed the game for several years now thank you ccp and all of the community but i have seen the development of eve take a turn down a path that i dont like with this most recent patch this will never be a game for the masses i hope
why just to show your support for the children in the world who have a hard time
im flipping the main breaker the whole dayhoping for a sunny day as it gets cold here in sweden
you seem like you may well have good intentions here but you picked a bad way of expressing them this isnt the forum for that sort of thing unless youre proposing that the csm officially endorse your suggestion of not playing eve to ccp and see if the devs will agree since that is rather clearly not your intent you may want to move this thread to events  gatherings or maybe eve general and not the assembly hall
you couldnt have picked a worse time to post this people are going to take this thread the wrong way on so many levels its not even funnyrun run far and keep runningnot supported for reasons i will not get into
no these kinds of events are stupid and the effort spend promoting awareness could be far better spend making money to give to these underprivileged individuals i do not see how not playing a game on a particular day will in any way help make their lives better if you really feel that motivated to help a tiny fraction of the species then cancel your account and spend the money on charity instead of eve

no support your crying about a minor thinglock thread pleaseisaac
lol  u
lets let everybody play by the same rules
precedent has been set let the good times rollalso petition to ban puppet masters for being terrible posters
notice how the op doesnt actually display the name of his corp nor allianceoh right its a nub corp alt why didnt u post this with your main
says the pot calling the kettle black
i guess you can only change your alliance name if ccp pilots fly for you then you can make up whatever rules you want whenever you want
while were at it how about ccp stops deleting threads that expose their favoritismnot locking as per usual theyve been deleted
im not defending what ccp did here but my understanding is that there are more devs who fly for goon than for bobzoku reloaded it just happens that the sleazeballor maybe its the idiot  he did get caught after all flew for bob
posting in a looser goon alt thread
i propose that henceforth any and all threads in assembly hall that have anything to do with in game political bull should be deletedlockedand thrown out of this boardthe csm has no business nor does it care to have business with a bunch of damned 5 year olds who have to throw damn fit over every stupid little thing that happensall of which has utterly nothing to do with the posting of ideas and proposals that help improve the game mechanics and behavioralliance political power blocs shifting around or changing names has nothing to do with the aboveseriously clean this filth from our boards
supported
little hint the csm was originally founded in response to the previous examples of corruption and favouritism towards a particular alliance by a handful of people within ccp if a single person within ccp has started displaying such favouritism towards that particular alliance again then this forum is exactly where it should be raised
the first thread on the topic was fine  as nevada said the csm is as much about transparency as it is about game changes its the halfdozen followups that are ing me off
i agree to this post this should stay constructive in this forum and issues should be raisedif one issue is raised it doesnt need more threads
then file petitionsthis hardly is what i call an effective way to get ccps attention
that thread has the feel of goonswarm harassing the assembly 500 supports  most of them dont say anything and are within seconds of each other this screams bull seriously i could not care less if an alliance is renamed especially when no proof has been offered that it was ccp or anything of the kind and witch hunts always stink of stupidityand this place was starting to look so nice and clean
if you rename an alliance you lose sov bobkennybeaver was renamed with a name longer than the limit mind you without losing sov so this was done by someone at ccp
what dear ignorant fools this thread is a good poll of who knows what the hell is even going on in this game and who has spent their lifetime in empire maybe you asinine dolts havent noticed but changing the name of an space holding alliance has rather serious ingame sovreignty related ramifications when kenzoku decided they wanted their old name back they should have had to disband kenzoku resetting the sovreignty ticker on their precious few remaining bits of space but thanks to gm friends they still have within ccp managed to avoid that little bit of awkwardness this means that the original poster has no idea what even goes outside the warm cozy blanket provided by concord
this poster would have brains enough to know that posting here like an ass would be a waste of timeand that he should spend his time filing petitions directly to ccpi guess your not that smart are you
supported also ban all goonfleet characters from ever posting ever againisaac
except your proposal starts with the accusation that ccp is directly responsible and therefore why would you bother coming to the assembly hall to draw the attention of the csm who are beholden to ccp oh yeah because youre a vacant  goons  the most aptly named alliance in the gaming metaverseno one here who isnt part of goonswarm gives a flying  honestly try a petition storm stop wasting the assemblys time
i beg to differ if you cannot see the possible ramifications of people in power showing favortism towards a minor group then i really cant help you the csm was actually made for situations like those not for your boring nerf caldari petitions in case you havent noticed many empire dwellers such as myself are apalled at the idea of game mechanics being tweaked at my own expense as was explained there is a hefty price too pay for your name change and the beavers have circumvinted that nothing is perfect but that doesnt stop anyone to strive for perfection and balanced gameplay is as close as we are going to get hope that helps
the csm isnt beholden to ccp its beholden to the players who vote those people in to their positions do you even know how a democratic system worksyoure right we have absolutely no proof ccp was involved except that the name was changed without kenny losing sov the name is longer than the allowed limit and the alliance has exactly the same alliance id as kenzoku other than you are correct we have zero reason to believe ccp was involvedmaybe some of you should go study what the csm was formed for heres a hint it was formed so players could oversee ccp specifically because of situations like this go read the ny times article about t20 and band of brothers and educate yourselves
except for the fact you arrogant pricks obviously forgot that the csm can say all they want ccp can choose to ignore themso skip the middle man and make a petition stormstfu and leave the assembly hall alone and cut the political bull out
im sorry that people using the csm for its intended purpose upsetting the balance of your precious assembly hall upsets you so much you should really relax about it youre going to hurt yourself
we wouldent have to make a stink if ccp followed the goddamn rules its a dman shame that we players left to police ccp
i propose that henceforth any and all threads in assembly hall that are written by the op should be deletedlockedand thrown out of this boardthis board has no business nor does it care to have business with a terrible poster who has to throw a damn fit over every stupid little thing that happensall of which has utterly nothing to do with the posting of ideas and proposals that help improve the game mechanics and behaviorwhining about threads involving alliance political power blocs shifting around or changing names has nothing to do with the aboveseriously clean this filth from our boards
go back to your hole for now once this more serious issue is dealt with then you can get back to boost ravenn my raven missllez dont work to good in missions postsalso ps csm is not for proposing ideas actually that would be the features and ideas discussion so your attempts at pleading to ccp have all gone unheard for off topic posting in here
this is exactly the type of issue the csms should deal with
remove threads because you dont agree with them yessireesarcastic thumbs up
actually thats wrong the article in nyt is nowhere near right about what the csm is i suggest that you read the csm paper about what the csm really is
its a petition thread and goonswarm is rather known for having a lot of warm bodies most of whom are capable of following a link and clicking a checkbox doubly so when you consider that its getting a lot of support from other bobbobr kz t20 enemies the fact that the petition is growing quickly should be no surprise to anyone its not malfeasance its outrage among an easilymobilized base
the disgusting thing here is that there are pubbies dumb enough to think that since goons say something they should be against itdrake youre the reason why tafkab was able to get away with their illgotten bpos with their illegitimate motherships with directors running their capfleets and giving them inside knowledge into pos mechanics pubbies like you were too busy lining up hoping to join their ranks and cheering them on to realize that when ccp commits acts that destroy the integrity of the game it destroys any magic it hasthat ccp still hasnt learned their lesson despite all of this is truely sad with the current upheaval in 00 and the next expansion out eve should be getting a lot of good press on how exciting the game can be instead because they refuse to stop playing favorites with their pet alliance the gaming media is going to go through another cycle of how the company is corrupt and all of these prior acts are going to be rehashed and ccps name is going to be deservedly dragged through the mud againbut keep on raging against goonswarm it just shows how ignorant you are
its a good thing i didnt have to read the op to understand that youre an idiot you should stop posting this worthless crap here and go back to cnp or some other part not looked at if you refuse to stop posting that is
this has nothing to do with goonswarm you jackassread the damn post oh wait your too busy clicking a link and following the mobbut since everyone is actually responding to me i guess i struck a nervekeep it coming your responding is actually making you look worsekeep on beating that war drum and wasting your time herewhy listen to me if im such a pathetic troll why give me the attention
its a good thing i dont listen to alts
please post a link to where you supported this thread and not how you read it and instantly posted this one well wait all night if youre having problems finding your postbut seriously though go whine about t2 cruises in ship and modules or whatever it is that you do and leave this forum for what it was originally designed for a place for players to hold ccp accountable for its actions
a bloo bloo a bloo bloo bloo
i fully support that position
to the op try to imagine for a second that this is nothing to do with goons or theallianceformerlyknownaskenzokuformerlyknownasbob i should also point out that i am nothing to do with either alliance or their alliessince the dawn of the alliance mechanic the naming policy has been the same as corporations and characters afaik no name changes have ever been allowed and petitions have been ignored because those were the rules the reasons are pretty obvious constant name changing could be exploited as a result if you want to rename something you start again that means new n00b character disbandreform corporation or disbandreform alliancethe latter as has been pointed out many times on these forums now has several nasty consequences for the alliance being renamed theres the isk cost of setting up an alliance and the loss of sov in any systems the former alliance held that bobr has effectively circumvented a system that is in place for all other eve inhabitants is annoying its rather like me wanting to form a 00 alliance and being given several systems with sov 3 for freeso far arguments for the change have revolved around i dont like what goon did to bob so its justified to allow the name change or goonies annoy me so their tears are justified i find these arguments wanting for two reasons1 goons disbanding of bob was done using ingame mechanics and rules technically it was bob who disbanded themselves via a rogue director the fact that the rules allow for such a dramatic take down is not the fault of those who use them to that end2 lack of objectivity means that we cant ever be sure were on a level playing field if rules can be circumvented on a whim then whats to say it wont be your alliancecorpchar whatever thats on the receiving end when an enemy of yours gets an unwarranted boost this is the reason people should keep a very close eye on stuff like this
wrong ccp has changed names if people capitalized a name wrongly or something like that
who ive seen a lot of posts from people complaining that tweaks like that werent granted when they petitioned furthermore is bobr a recapitalisation of kenzoku i seriously doubt that i would be allowed to change my char name in such a way
from another forumstian empire was created someone noticed the typo told ccp ccp told them to disband the alliance and getting no refund from the 1b isk needed to create it recreate the alliance and once again pay 1b isk to create it and make sure to spell the name correctlyblack 0ut was created someone realized how dumb this was and so they asked ccp to change it to black out ccp told them no and that theyd have to disband the alliance and get no refund from the 1b isk needed to create it recreate the alliance and once again pay 1b isk to create it and make sure to spell the name the way they wanted toagainst all authorities had a slight mishap where someone didnt pay the maintenance build they lost all their sovereignty had to recreate the alliance and had to once again front the 1b isk fee ccp did not reimburse any of thatcorps from a defunct alliance known as band of brothers join an alliance called kenzoku they fight under the name kenzoku for over a month and a half they then ask ccp to change their name to band of brothers reloaded and ccp does so without making them disband the alliance or pay a 1b isk feeedit also stain allaince and initiative associates were told that they werent special enough to get their names changed
backing up the above post our alliance also disbanded once due a forgotten alliance bill and we had to recreate our alliance for the 1 bil fee if they now suddenly give bob special rights then i want a 1 bil reimbursement for our allianceback on the op post 1 topic should have been enough the others should have been closed or moved to coad by a mod
sigh in game in forum harassment is also banable  did you think about that
looks like the oposition is having a little trouble coming up with reasons to keep goingironic aint itlook i dont deny that something obviously went wrongbut spraying all that crap all over assembly hall like a bunch of damned kids foaming at the mouth is not only immature but practically degrading to whom they representevery bloody day i see goons are bad and bob is was badyou know what im starting to agree with them all i see day in and day out is spamming ego trips stupidity snobbery you guys cant even keep it real let alone serious your just a damn mob that changes its tune every 5 secondsyou cant even hold an argument without pulling bs out of your assesive said it once and ill say it again you want to complaint petition itim sorry you will get nothing from csm zero zilchnadaall they will do is have a discussion and if ccp says no its nowaste of bloody time and then youll make a bloody damn fool of yourself in posting in a ridiculously stupidly long thread that is obviously ignoredlike ghost training and nerfing missiles all your doing is making yourselves to be the biggest damned idiots that ever graced the forumsall for naughtso stop wasting our time and actually do something about itmake petitions or quit the frakking gametheres no other way to get ccps attention more effectively
hear hear drake agree 100
what rules
you guys truly make me laugh this is ccps game it is not your game it has never been your game it is ccps game if ccp decided that bob was allowed a name change then ok they get it but this is so ridiculous your all having a hissy fit about a damn name get over it it wont affect the change of the war between goons this is favoritism in the least possible way its a stupid name change bob didnt win its wars because ccp helped them if they had bob wouldnt be at its death door by goonswarm in fact ccp if they truly favored bob would have given their territory back free of charge but they didnt they changed a name big freaking dealget over it i wouldnt give a dang if i were in goons or bob so a gm decided to get involved in the game you all cry about gms not being more in the game and then then when they do something you all pull a hernia crying about it end of story and end of threadisaac
thisyes i admit that its a contradiction of policy but its just a fing name change peoplethere wherent given anything of value other than a damn name changeget over yourselvesit would be different if it was something more significantin all honesty i would think it would be appropriate for ccp to grant a valid name change request like a misspelling or a name that is free of anything inapropriatebut all this screaming over a name changeyou people need to get a life wrong or right i can think of worse things to scream over
people dont care about the bobr name what people care about is that they were allowed to change it without going through the usual route of disbanding their alliance losing sov3 in their remaining systems and paying 1 billion isk to create a new alliance with their preferred name there are many examples in all these whine threads where alliances were refused permission to change their name and were told to go through the process i mentioned previouslyas a result the allianceformerlyknownaskenzokuformerlyknownasbob has effectively been given 1 billion isk and sov 3 status in multiple systems im sure the other alliances who never had that priviledge are very happy at this socalled fair treatmentso far the arguments against have been of the goons hax0r3d bob so deserve what they get or its only a name thus demonstrating pointmissing of epic proportions
then make a damn petition and stop clogging up the boardsi dont have a problem with the complaint i have a problem with the jackasses that scream in spite of the fact they could have filed a petition and left it at that
its not just about a name changeits also about1 mechanics abuse usually an alliance that changes its name loses all sov and must pay 1 billion isk to reorganize thats a lot of money whether youre involved in corporations or not2 the larger issue of fairness frankly all players should want to have the assurance that theyre playing in a game that isnt crookedyou guys on both sides keep making this a carebear vs alliance  issue but its actually something all players should be worried about
snipped someimhoyou will never have certainty that the game isnt rigged human beings are in large enough numbers going to have a few who break the rules that is a certainty asking for a large corporation ccp to be 100 honest 100 of the time is naive again imho you want to really get ccps attention you will cancel your account  en mass complaining on the boards will probably imho accomplish nothinggetting 2500 people to cancel accounts even temporarily will make them sit up and take notice if you can get an entire unnamed 00 alliance to cancel for one day  that would get the accountants and administrators on the case of the gmsdevelopers to fix this nowotherwise welcome to gmdevs eveonline and dont be surprised when it goes to ppoopno i have no affiliation with any 00 entity yes this is my main no i dont work for ccp 
no this is a goons vs the assembly issue ever since this issue has been raised all of a sudden a rash of bs threads have popped up all over the board forcing several good ideas down out of sightand the ones im linking to are only a sample some have moved down through the pages and some have been lockedim all for correcting errors but overwhelming the system with aggressive overbearing whining is more than a little irritating to those of us who use this board regularly to push game changes
thisop is an idiot
it seems to be ing the goons off and that is all good in my book
am i detecting trace amounts of irony after all your remedy for this rash of threads which so aggravates you is the report link for some reason though you have decided to create a thread of your own to expound on your ideas i read it and was unable to find any of the followingits ok though despite what many people say the assembly hall is for seeking attention as much as for suggesting changes to game mechanics dont be a selfhating attention junkie
completely unsupported csm is about taking issues to ccp not just bugs or such
an issue is an issue as long as the proposed idea of the thread is suggesting changing the game in a way ccp could implement
also isnt this thread in of itself ironic because its whining about such things doing exactly what you dont want to happen in the beginning
i dont understand why people hate goons so muchthey have been highly good for the game newbie training vids accessible by everyoneetc etc goonsbobanyone should full well have access to post their issues in the game even if you disagree or something
good thing i dont listen to s who post with alts and has a serious lack of intelligence about himself
the only irony here is you proving my point with your foolish attempts at diverting attention from the problemhow many threads have i actually started in assembly hallthats what i thoughti rest my case
your an idiot for misidentifying the csm as being ccp itself or having any power over said actionas i have said time and time again ccp can choose to ignore anything the csm saysget it through your frakking thick skull it will hurt less
this has nothing to do with me hating goons other than the obvious lack of brainpower emanating form there end of the galaxymy problem is this mob mentality crap is bull and needs to stop making a mess of the boardsit is one thing to post a protest in a singular threadit is an another to start proposing stupid assed proposals in disbanding each other and compounding that fact with more stupiditytop that off with over half of the individuals participating in this are not even supporting but doing so illegitimately by playing a sarcastic attitude game which makes the whole point of giving support pointless and insulting
post with your main idiot
youre one to talk when it comes to insulting the fact is that your thread differs only by a matter of degree from this problem you so have done such an amusing job of exaggerating name me one occurrence in this thread offurthermore why didnt you just report the offending threads and move on not that i object to this thread far from it in fact im just trying to gain an insight into the reasoning that reached the end conclusion that this thread would be any different than what it rants so vehemently againstthe fact that youve never done it before is irrelevant every attention junkie has their entrance
heres the thing youre 100 right that there should have at most been one single thread the fact some people are overzealous does not negate the issue and is why there is a moderation team or mitnal who is a masochist but a team unto himself this is hardly the first time multiple threads with the same content have been made nor will it be the lastthe reason people are saying you are making it a goon issue is probably because you are being extremely rageish it would be one thing if you could link me to all your other posts where you heavily berated people for making a thread similar to ones already in existence maybe you have i dont know nor would anybody else just happening across your poststhe point is this it is a valid issue that has more ramifications than the issue itselfwhat i meanthere is the issue of the event  that the alliance name was changed without penalty and against the rules set forth and enforced in the past regardless of your belief that a company can break its own eula but hold their audience culpable to it this event is of course the event in question and is the main focal point it has assuredly been petitioned many times already this events consequences need to be directed at those that abused the system  that would be the alliancebut there is the other event which may sound very similar  that an alliance name was changed without penalty and against the rules set forth and enforced in the past etc this event is directed at ccp itself not the alliance it just so happens that the two events are identical in nature and so when posting about it they are going to by default be intertwined the consequences of this event need to be directed at ccpboth events are the same but uniquely different
finally someone who uses there head before they speaka i dont believe its ok for a company to violate its own eula thats just flat wrong now whether that this particular area is covered or not depends entirely on the eula and ccps judgement callhowever a name change is not exactly earth shattering if the compromised in favor of one then they should give favor to othersb the whole point of my yellingrantingraving at not just goons but every damn idiot who has to stand on there little soap boxes is they think petitioning the csm for answers is the answer is flat stupidi support the csm in there efforts of representation but somehow i strongly disagree that they are going to amount to a hill of beans on this particular issueyour trying to get ccps attention then why the hell mess with the middle mansurely you people are capable of speaking for your bloody selvesc i am a troll one with brains and many years of experience in the world of gaming eve being one of many i have issues in being nice as every time i turn around some idiot shows up and posts without using his damn brain and expects results only to get blasted by myself or any one of a few legitimate trolls around that actually give a damn about this gameim am neither piratecarebear or 00 basedim none of the above because this game cant be one of any kind it must be all kindsi undersatnd the underlying balance necessities of the game and i will be first to admit i am no expert on any particular area but alot of it is just plain common senseyes someone at ccp likely frakked upbut turning the assembly hall into a damn circus is not what i call a smart moveno one will ever treat a goon seriously let alone with any credability becuase you keep pushing these things1 your bigger than everyone else2 you dont give a  about what everyone else thinks because your bigger than everyone else3 you never treat anything with seriousness because you can afford to take a hit without flinching4 you can call in 100s of people to do the same ting without recourse
5 and to top it off you people refuse to listen let alone give any quater because your bigger than everyone elsegoonswarm has the power of intimidation you can afford to have stupid people flying all over the placeand it wont take a many to achieve thatbob is guilty of the same thingyou guys scream the most you trash the place the most you spam the most you scam the mosteveryone has it out for you guysand yet you expect to be heardand treated just like everyone elsejust stop and think about that for a momentoh sure you can pull up my posts and point out all the stuff ive saidbut i pale in comparsion to the toltality of what your alliance has saidstateddone in the history of this gamei try my damndest to remember that not all goonsbobs are alikeand there are a few who are actually decent people like youbut its getting just a bit hard to wipe the crap off my boot every time i step into these forsaken dump of a forum board thats getting overran with this insanityso forgive me for being a little terse if not blunti appreciate the fact you respect my position i respect yours as wellso do something about it and try the direct approach and leave the assembly hall out of this mess

i have an alt id really like to sell but ill be ed if its this that makes me get a credit card 0theres no reason we shouldnt be able to pay for character transfers the same way we can pay for the rest of eve
yes i realize people have needs for escapes however to be frank i still dont see the need of this feature prioritiesisaac
i think the reason a credit card is needed is to prove the seller is the owner of the account its also the reason why the seller always has to pay the fee using plexs removes that safeguard
supported please if u cant use a plex make a similar npc trade good thingy to a plex that deals with transfer
i too would like yaay and the other bobr whiners to get over it and thank us

if supporting this thread means that yaay brings his wonderful fcing to the beaver table more often then im all for it

dont disband the alliance just keep the old name this will be fair for all players
theyve renamed their alliance theyve made their bed time to sleep in it sov reset and 1 billion isk deduction
omg 1 billion111eleven111  where can one get this amount of iskiesincoming in 3  2  1
if its such a pathetic amount why feel the need to circumvent the games rules to avoid it
your moons in delveowai
let me go get you some aloe vera for that sick burn 
hehe
removing the 1 billion isk from them is just us expecting ccp to treat them exactly like they would treat any other alliance wanting a rename in the long run it wont make much differencehowever as they now hold some sov 3 systems the sov reset will hurt them a lot more as they will lose their cyno jammers again
cause lord only knows you barely have any sov left

i like it
please continue to discuss this issue in the threads in caod or in the assembly hall
i happen to like the new look for the minmatar ships myself the orange lighting details and intricate nonsprite frameworks and scafolds stunned me so much that i spent five minutes switching between my ships seeing how cool they looked now if anything they look better and even a bit sturdier i can now believe my tempest will not pull an enterprised on me every time the armor takes a cruise missle with that second support and all
for the most part i like the premium client especially with how they fixed the scythescimitar which imo previously challenged the moa for the ugliest ship in the game on classic i like the classic mastodonmammoth a little more than the new but only marginally in general id prefer to keep the new look minnies have in premium
considering i play with a friend whos been playing this for years hes the one teaching me and he saw me buy the ship and have it not appear in my inventory its not something im making up this is something im sure others are experiencing as well even if they dont post about it and part of my problem is that my ingame petitions arent getting answered even a week later so it occurs to me that it is a pretty big issue am i just supposed to not bring it up not supposed to talk about an issue im having like it doesnt exist when it stops me from playing the game if your not posting something helpful to somebodies problems your part of said problem cause your just causing aggrivation whats the point of saying anything at all just cause you can in which case why shouldnt i
petition times are slow after a big patch but i understand your frustration that said youd do better to ask in market discussions new citizens qa or issues workarounds and localization or even eve general than in assembly hall  find out if theres a known problem and if theres a simple solution rather than asking the csm to bring your bug report to iceland and meet with half the dev team about it in august im not saying your problem is illegitimate im saying that youre trying to use a body that really isnt suited to fixing it

i am a 31 year old humanities student living in the uk ive been active in eve for nearly four years now and have some experience in many areas of eve whilst not professing to be an expert in any one area i believe my wide experience will help to serve the general population of eve and bring what they want to the attention of ccp at all times i try and maintain a neutral stance and believe the subject areas i study help me to achieve this whilst still being passionate about the game i have applied for candidacy on the csm as i feel if elected i have the time and enthusiasm to make a difference alongside whomsoever else gets voted into the csm i would like to give others the chance to be as enthralled by this game as i have been and still am whilst trying to maintain an open mind i do have some areas in which i have a strong opinion in these are small gangsolo pvp which i think has mostly been overlooked for some time now by the developers i would like to see some effort being directed to nonsovereign infrastructure solutions such as mobile refineries mobile research and mobile production facilities beyond what is available now with the advent of wormhole space i think the need for this is greater than ever before lastly as you can expect from my corp ticker i am interested in the backstory of eve and player interaction with it i would like to see more development done that tie in the standard day to day actives of your average eve player with the vast scope of prime fiction that ccp has at its disposal this includes ideas such as widening the scope of the newly introduced epic mission arcs to include pirate and sub factions as well as simply providing more information ingame available to anyone who is interested in where they live what they do and how these things came about i am interested in the availability of background information as an in game asset rather than pushing this on people as i know full well many people enjoy this game without immersing themselves in the storylines and instead writing their own story for themselves if you have any question please feel free to contact me ingame or on here and i will do my best to answer you as promptly as possible
a great candidate for csm very knowledgeable about the game of eve online with a flair for discussion and constructive debate heartstone has been a regular at fanfest and playerarranged meets and will bring a lot of grassroots player representation to the role if he is electedenthusiastically supported
hi everyoneas an elected member of the first csm i feel the time has come for me to run a second time my character is an achura female who started in eve online over two and half years ago as a student at eve university  new edens largest new player training corporation over time i became an instructor recruiter and eventually a director at eve universitythe person behind dierdra vaal is valentijn geirnaert a 24 year old dutch computer science student from the netherlands with a focus on game design i was an elected member of the first council of stellar management in 2008 i am running for a second term now because i believe i have the right ideas about the direction the game needs to take on top of that i strongly feel that if you want something done right you have to do it yourselfinstead of writing a really long post on what i stand for i will simply refer you to my website
i would like to be the first to say good luck in your campaign dierdra you did a smashing job last time round my own time in eve university was a happy and worthwhile one and its people like you that help to make eve that little bit easier on the new players who come through your doors
dierdra vaal has my stamp of approval
yup its right here on my forehead
good luck dierdraapproved as well

no this party would be focused on protecting their desired experience that goes without saying just as every faction and special interest would be driving their own agendas the reason i started this thread was to determine the degree of interest and support the segment i sought to represent had in the idea of a formal party to be their voice given what so far looks like a record amount of apathy towards the csm iii elections in general and the idea of a party i may have gotten my answerissler
to summarise briefly you whined about being wardecced by goonswarm after being elected pathetic to follow on from that you seem to have no idea what youre talking about in short youre a poor csm who probably only got in by block vote from your alliance
i suggested that the war dec appeared to be an attempt to interfere with the csm process in the end it was just random gooness we never tried to dodge the war and i never suggested any change in eve as a result of the waryour you dont know what you are talking about without citation is about as valid as me saying i think you are basement dwelling loser virgin who has a mother that dresses you funny and has unnatural relations with genetically enhanced livestock it is nothing but a pointless personal insult and honestly like the comment i just made about you not a very good personal insult your insult adds no value to the conversationtry adding some actual facts to your attack next time please or better yet run for csm and show us just how 1337 genius like and uber you are please i cant see how eve can survive without you in the csmissler
nexus the entire csm waz worthlezz thiz time from my point of view again issler you failed to conzider even raizing the war dec limitz for small corporationz by one continuing to support your big coalition friendz on the council plz dont run for csm again issler
why on earth would i have supported that since that certainly isnt something the folks i try to represent would want do you have any idea what a constituency is err maybe if i said i had a constiuanzmy big coalition of friends on the council yeah got me there most of my friends are people i dont know and have never met until months after my election do you really think we are some sort of unified group do you read the meeting minutessorry i wont have your endorsement stuff you truly are the master of the z keyissler

its true the old capital jump effects were way betterthe new one just sucks to be honest i think they didnt put any effort into it and just rushed for expansion
signed
almost all effects has waves type  jumps sensor booster etc old style jumps was more interesting and a bit more epic or so
im agree
i agree current jump effects are just to plaina stargate simply uses an allready existing wormhole to jump a ship through jumpdrives wreck a hole on the fabric of space as in create a new wormhole this demands a more epic fx
i also agree that the new graphic for a capital jumping in and out from point a to point b is very dull and doesnt impress even new players that want a capital i love the graphic myself and especially with a titan jumping to destination system can give a chilling effect to a doomsday imminent on a hostile force on the other end with the cyno or the jump bridging of bs and support ships to the destination
do something about it it is ugly now
even as i write this it feels absurd to say so but the old effect when a ton of caps or fleet jumpedbridged in was whoooohoooo here we godont get that feeling now and thats a bit of a shamegive back the irrationality of real life adrenaline on seeing a special effectzos
signed
1 return it
i agree return it plz
signed hell with the new capital jump effects i didnt even notice a titan jumping in
for the love of god signed
support this thread
i too am supporting this topic
agree with op go out with a flash
signed gimme my bright lights back
supporting threadhuh
this season i will mostly be supporting this thread
agreed but the faction stuff should req the same skills as t2 and the officer modules should require the max skills of t2 for a launcher officer it should req the specialized skill at lvl 5the better the modsships the higher the skill req should bebut the t2 ammo shouldnt have the nerfs reduced just their dmg boosted big penalty and big bonus too use
im not a minnie pilot and i dont know any minnie pilots who use barrage but i acknowledge that it likely has some utility sometimes thing is look at what ship would generally use it when i think of a ship that wants long falloff on its acs i think of a vagabond or something similar that likes fighting in the 1520 km range to put a point on the enemy and stay out of webscram range those ships are naturally speedfit to be able to hold the range against slower enemies how well does a fastorbiting ship do when you nerf its tracking people who fight in falloff tend to need their tracking quite a lot actually it was strill who said the line you quoted and me who made about the same points you just did thing is i acknowledge that a handful of slight advantages do not offset the stonking big disadvantages void has except in some incredibly niche situations its not good as a whole even if some aspects of it are and since you cant fire half a shot that means that void is bad sure if you know exactly how the combat is going to play out maybe its better but the thing about combat is that you dont  battle plans go out the window at first contact with the enemy and all that also who trains weapon spec skills to 5 thats just crazy
supported dispite the arguing
remove all t2 bpos from game
support
ive seen no finer proposal in here p
mmm hisec veldatar should be epic i hope they dont mine too much or the hulk pilots will cry
well in some way i am strongly against caps in highsec since it is not allowed by concord and thereby not the mechanicsbut well it is chribba so what the heck i support it
somehow i think chirbba is being sarcastic u know about the bobr thingythumbs up anyway

yes of course
i agree that it would be nice to be able to see a titan up close
supportedbut think of the veldspar have you no mercy
qft let the glory that is the valdatar be displayed for all to see
absolutelyand while theyre at it modify the veldtars ddd so it instastrips a whole belt
quoted for the truth of it
yorda is forum banned for another few weeks  after flying the nidhoggur for over a year now and discovering just how awesome triage is it is really sexy im pretty happy with the nidhoggur the nag on the other hand has no redeeming features and is a worthless pile of  im fully speced for it and refuse to buy one as its a complete waste of money it needs something other than its insanely long training time if i could change one thing about training on yorda i would of trained for the rev instead of the nag been done training sooner have a good dread and probably be able to fly amazing amarr battleships by nowmotherships are a whole separate issue i never leave my carrier and have plenty of alts so that i rarely need to dock but yet id still never buy a mothership its just not worth putting a giant bullseye over your head and not be able to hotdrop or triage id rather lose a few handfuls of carriers
edit stupid eveo
any news if ccp are gonna pull their thumbs out their arse and fix the damn nag
i never understood why they made missile batteries that way in the first place if keeping them online while they have a cpu use isnt technically doable it most likely is sounds more like a question of effort the simple fix is to make them take no cpu and decrease caldari tower total cpu that would make them less useful as high sec lab platforms and useable in lowno sec the first solution is preferable but either way something has to change
even though the emoragers are flooding the assembly hall with bullcrap posts about alliance renaming go back to caod whiners and pushing legitimate issues to the bottom i think this still merits attentiononce again what exactly does it take to get a csm to even acknowledge this exists
i would like this really would eliminate some confusion
well it has been a while since the last time i got killed because of 00 gate blockades ive made an effort to never warp in a straight line in occupied sytems out of high sec since theni was in a 00 corp once but not for long i joined alongside a friend didnt learn much about them took a break from the game for a few months got kicked out for inactivity and to this day i still have 2 cruisers in their hangars which i dont feel like getting backi mean really noone even gave a damn about my questions when i logged in that fine day and procedded to fly a shuttle around until i was finally caught and blown up just before reentering 01 spaceall i have left to say about that is its fortunate clones get shipped back to somewhere friendlier when in a station one isnt allow to be in
so when
ok good
1 god idea
agree stealth bomber need boost 1
sure after all you wouldnt catch some grizzled veteran pilot sitting at a bar drinking some fruity drink like a pina colada that man is going to have a scotch in a pretty damn dirty glass with a cig definite support
everyone not supporting this should keep in mind cigarettes are already in game
are we talking the virtual burning of tobacco to create a smoke that can be inhaled by a person to get their nicotine hit in public which in many countries is illegal or a virtual ecig  aka electronic cigarette which is legal in rljust a thought  and dont have many of them al thorr
yea remind ccp so they dont forget to remove it next patch just like they did quafe girl
boosters are higher on the offensive scale and theres no way theyll take them out when they already got their t rating for the boxed set which was the whole point of removing the quafe girl cigs are safe for the foreseeable future
with all the wanton murder  and pillaging in the game anything to help chill the virtual mind and soul is only appropriate and welcome how do you define need anyway
yea i would like to be leaning against a wall in jita 44 smoking 1 with a black coat and a hat on looking all cool and stuff when i get run over by a noob in an ibis who didnt dock properly and realise i was in the docking bay and that was my ibis
i want to play an accordian while smoking a huge cigarim not kidding
lets make accordian hero game plastic cigar included
a fine puff of whatever it is people want to smoke is a good thing imo i myself would live a fine cigar and a snifter of cognac between missions
i was actually referring to the amount of time it took ccp to actually give them a purpose granted they do need a slight nerf at the moment but it took ages for ccp to get around to boosting themagreedminor how can you say minor if weapon balance issues are currently half of why amarr are far too powerful youre contradicting yourselfthe current low sec changes have done nothing to fix low sec ccp themselves have admitted that low sec needs help the majority of the problem is the completely worthless ore there when compared to high sec rats have essentially nothing to do with the problemim referring to huge influx of minerals from drone space that unbalance the current economics of minerals look at the valuedeamnd of trit versus supplyperhaps you should actually read the nighthawk thread and try to understand the numbers and math involved the nighthawks tankbuffer is hardly superior to what other command ships can fit as well gank what the hell are you talking about the dps of the nighthawk is awful expect to have tank and gank perhaps you should actually read the nighthawk thread and learn some math before you start running your mouth i provide very solid evidence and numbers that the nighthawk indeed has a serious pg issue its all in that thread respond there if youd like all the arguments are there for you to read if youd take the time before respondinghowever this thread isnt about any of the above particular issues the only topic of this thread is the amount of time it takes for ccp to respond to any given issue even issues that theyve admitted are problematic why is it ccp moves so slowly on balance issues were not talking weeks or months here were talking years in some cases
as it says to be honest never seen the need for them back in 2003 and do not see any need for them now other than for epeen as far as im concerned they have no place in eve and any of the arguements i have heard to support them have lacked any real substance and all lead back to what i said earlier more epeenif people want kill stats then they should go play unreal tournament or somethingjust my opinion of course but id like to think anyone that is a true eveer will support this ideathank you
if you dont like them you can ignore them me i like them
force new players to leave starter npc corps after a certain reasonably short character age and either formjoin a player corp or be moved to a new npc corp against which its possible to wage a concord sanctioned war players leaving player run corps are automatically moved to the same new npc corps
in before the flames
supported
op should learn to read before making the same damn proposal for the 1000th time
the game needs something like thistoo many people hide in npc corps
yes of course players should be forced to play the game in the fashion you prefer after all whats the point of a sandbox if people are allowed to play in it differently no this idea isnt any better the 500th time than it was the first
so we now have people who are what 3 months old and working on mining suddenly able to be mass wardecked into oblivion come on ccp isnt that stupidif you dont like people in npc corps give them a reason to leave it and join your alliancecorporation dont whine to the devs about forcing people down a path they wouldnt like to take im in npc corp so i can help the newer players and youre asking me to leave it because you cant wardec to your hearts contentepic fail
not supported for the 1000th time
i obviously support my own proposalnpc corps have a distinct advantage compared to player run corps  being in one entitles a character to practically unlimited riskfree income balanced with practically zero possibility for isk or ship loss this is unfair to players who choose to join a player run corpanother consequence of the loss free gameplay style is that npc corp players gain unfair advantage in the industry sector  they can afford to produce and sell goods under the cost with the excuse mineralsdatacores that i obtain myself are free potential loses would let them make more reasonable business decisionsnpc corps prevent a multitude of useful gameplay options  disrupting enemy1 industry  disrupting enemy1 supply lines  retaliation against ninja salvagers more commonly known incorrectly as salvagethieves  retaliation against scammers market gougers or just plain competitorsim sure there are more inventive people out there who can think of other possibilitiesdoes this proposal create imbalance or unfairnessnonew players have a choice  either join a player run corp and be equal in all respects to other players who joined a player run corp or join a wardecable npc corp and be exposed exactly to the same risks as other playersnew players should they choose so are of course allowed to enjoy the safety of highsec and starter npc corps for a reasonable amount of time  until they are deemed to not be in distinct disadvantage compared to older players due to not knowing the gamedoes this proposal forces a particular gameplay stylenobeing in an wardecable npc corp does not prevent any carrier that was possible in a starter npc corp a miner can continue to pursue his mining carrier an explorer can continue to explore a pirate can continue to kill a mission runner can continue to run missions an industrialist a trader a scammer all can continue to play exactly as beforeonly while being exposed to the same risks1 enemy means either or both of enemy corpalliance or individual enemy player
some repliesdrake draconis i assure you i can read and write reasonably wellherschel yamamoto npc or wardecable npc corp does not prevent any particular style of gameplay preferred by me or notbunyip im not sure what point are you trying to make that certain professions and players ought to be privileged
correct me if im wrong but if a pilot is out in space doing his thing anyone that wants too can come along and shoot that pilot if a pilot is sitting in a sation doing his thing no matter what corp he is in no one can do anything to him even if he is in a decd corpbeing in an npc corp does not prevent other players whacking that player what you want is the ability to go after high security pilots without consequences you want to dec the larger corps in the game so you can go after pilots that have no desire for pvp and will barely be able to defend themselvesand lets be honest here all 00lowsec pilots have some sort of alt to do their market work for them if you vote for forcing highsec players into decable corps then you should also vote for allowing one single account and one single pilot for everyone playing the game to truely level the playing field
you can read and write good for youso i guess its a severe lack of intelligence and foresightdid you actually check the forums to see the other exact same proposals and there answersdid you actually bother to research this instead of emoraging on npcsdid you actually think this through to the point of evaluating balance or are you just interested in padding your killsyup figured thatthinkbefore you post
a player in an npc corp cant be wardeced but they also have disadvantages  they cant issue a wardec they cant anchor a pos they cant rent a station office for extra tabs they cant use a corp wallet for extra tabsmore relevant than the last because there are no station containers for isk they cant issue corp contracts to up the contract cap from 21 to 81 and so on also your proposal fails another critical test  how many wardecs do you expect there to be on caldari provisions as soon as it becomes a decable corp having npc corps that can be wardeced means that it is utter suicide to be forced out of the base corp because you can expect dozens or hundreds of highsec pirates to keep permanent decs on those corps for the free kills of players who dont know that theyve just been dropped from safety into what might as well be 00 space so i want to have items scattered about without the ability for a ceo to pay a few million and spy on my hangars or maybe i like helping new players out and prefer to spend my time in corp chat giving them pointers or im paranoid of people i dont know and assume that player corps are just traps for the unwary and the ceos will scam you mercilesslyyes ive known people who thought that or god forbid i just want to pay ccp 15month to mission in peace and not have to worry about corp mails corp ops corp drama and yes wardecs eve is not the safest of games of course but it isnt defined by the gank alone either yes the bear is an unfashionable creature but we shouldnt just throw them all out and even if we should ccp never would for financial reasons its just not going to happen
i think its fine the way it is if npc corps offer such huge advantages why are a higher percentage of veteran players not in them
also keep in mind that about 75 of those npcers are not npcers but alts of mains who are in corps and or 00duh
force every player to mine the first hour they are logged why i love the pvpers tears go searching your easy kills another way
ravenesa i cant see how you comments are relevant to the discussion you point similarities between npc corp players and nonnpc corp players theres nothing wrong with that what is wrong is the privilege of npc corp playersdrake draconis your comments is nothing but flaming please grow up andor go to flame elsewhereherschel yamamoto what you describe is easily solvable by creating your own corp which is one of my points  join a player corp possibly your own or a wardecable npc corpboknamar i dont know whether what you say is true or not so i cant comment on it if its true it may be due to the fact that veteran players are ones who came to the game before it went half the way to world of evecraftdrake yes i keep that in mind in fact i have pointed out that its not possible to attack such alts thus harming their 00 mainsvenkul mul what you propose is forcing a particular profession to players unlike me also please refrain from personal attacks especially when a simple check on my killboard and the killboards of all the corps and alliances i have been will show you a negligible percent of empire kills it just makes you look like a stupid child
you try to force a kind of play stile you like to other players and then get offended when some retort your proposal against youi think the one that need to grow is you your idea has been suggested and soothed down hundred of times nothing has changed from the last time it was refused but you feel the need to repeat it again and pretend to be taken seriously the only reason to propose it is to get easy empire targets without loss of standing as it has been showed in all the others thread it is easy for macrosweatshop farmerstransport alt and c avoid the consequences of being wardecced so this suggestion only result would be to get easy targets in high sec if you dont know that it mean you havent searched what was already written on this topic
not supported for the same reasons i didnt support this the last time it was proposed and the time before that and the time before that and
not sure if this has been thought of butbecause a point is mandatory in any pvp encounter and due to alot of ships are limited to 2 mids sacrificing a rig slot to add a pointonly would allow for more variety on the fieldrestrictions only one point rig allowed per shipcalibration 300
getting the ball rolling
how about we limit it to t2 ships to bridge the gap to the t3 shipswe could also up their calibration to allow for iti dont think its a horrible idea id like to see some other opinions though
other thoughts if the penalties are not enoughoption 1if you fit a point rig you cannot add another disruptorscram to your standard midslots nullifies 2x scrams fitting and dual 24km disruptionsoption 2disruptorscram fitted using the rig receives a 50 reduction in warp disruption strength 5 strength will still prevent a ship without stabs from warping and dual scramblers will equal only 3 points instead of 4
this feature would definitely add a lot of versatility to ships but of course it raises difficult questions on balance since it can impact so much of the gamewhy would anyone want to fit a weapon damage rig if its much better to add a low slot and fit a damage modwhy add a rig to increase scanner strength or sig resolution when its more efficient to add a mid slot and fit sensor booster or eccm things of that naturehowever the general idea is definitely good you know how minmatar ships supposed to be the most versatile ships in gamewhat if we gave this rig only to minmatar it would certainly promote the main advantage of their shipsand so the other faction ships dont feel left out why not have special rig for each faction sort of like the national rig designed specifically to emphasize their faction strengths
a half decent ideai dig it
so youre asking for a scrambler that fits in a rig slot um wow its an interesting enough idea i suppose but at present theres no way to activate a rig  all of them provide passive effects maybe if the entire rig system was getting overhauled dramatically but at present i dont think this idea is at all possible to implement
it would act more like the tech 3 subsystems add midslots only you can not fit anything but scramdisrupters
i like the concept but its a large buff to shield tankers and bleh to armor tankers i think a better idea would be give all combat ships a built in warp disruptorscrambler and swap the disruptor and scrambler modules for attribute enhancers that affect the built in version rather than being items themselves
i like the idea but i would rather see a separate rig for each level of slot and cap each ship at a max of 1 eachadditionally each rig should still have a penalty i would propose if you add a slot to one area you lose a slot somewhere elseso for examplelow slot rig bonus 1 low slot penalty 1 mid slot calibration 200mid slot rig bonus 1 mid slot penalty 1 high slot calibration 200high slot rig bonus 1 high slot penalty 1 low slot calibration 200also afaik no ship has enough calibration to mount all three i could be wrong im still realtively new but two of them are definately possible

okey first offi really support the csm i think it is an extremely good thing to have a few people that can voice the oppinion of the community to ccp so it is not about who can scream the highest in the forums wuuhuuu which can only bring something bad with it so i am all for the csm and yes i do agree that they need some more power and yes i do agree that ccp ed up majorly on  well every turn of the way actually even with the reaction thing this cannot have been an oversight unless the employess at ccp have hat on their feets and pants on their heads while talking funny about grissley but well nvm all fine and dandy or whatever you saybut giving the csm credits for stuff which is not their gain is stupid the queu have been asked for forever the reason we have always been getting from ccp is ghost training as main problem ghost training was gone and every one screaming as crazy for the queu soo this is the reason for that not the csm
the reaction problem is understandable in a programmers point of view this game has roughly 40k people on at some of the peaks maybe higher some days each cycle one per hour would require four calls to the module to prevent the step from occuring two calls is what they implemented and it took quite some time to realize the mistake they made if you call this a mistake you should also consider the lack of foresight for the y2k bug to be a disaster even though it made perfect sense at the time of implementationwhile i do feel that this csm was both more in the news due to the pos exploit described above and the dissolution of bob and now this new problem with bobr we were also less in the news as many of the major changes in the game have already been presented by csm1 were working with ccp to get a good mechanic for 00 read the meeting minutes and mining could definitely use an overhaulall in all the csm isnt the bright ray of sunlight shining on ccps dark deeds but we do our job of being a liaison between the players and ccp if you doubt the level of sincerity required to be a csm member youre welcome to try it as its not an easy task
it is not irrelevant to the point he makes when he bases most of his argument on the idea that he was a gmit does however not justify the fact that he cheated you too are ignoring the evidence then go and read the damn csm minutesare you in internal affairs you too make assumptions based on things you dont know how do you know that nobody has been punished because otherwise is certainly the caseif you think a flight from australia and back is free then can i have free stuffsthe fact is that you havent been on the csm that means you have no real idea what the csm actually does because you havent been at any of our meetings if you had any idea then you would have another view on it it is more than a pr stunt and if you accept facts and dont just go by your circular reasoning then you would understand
wth a constructive thread in the eve forums the sky runin short i agree
ghost training never had anything to do with it just have the queues skill switch check account status  if account is unpaid queue is inactive alternately have the account expiry clear the queue i dont believe ccp ever said ghost training was the issue it was players saying that
the fact that he was a dev and not a gm just make the fact even worse and his argument even stronger a dev doing what he did is far worse than a gm doing the same what exactly are you drinkingive read them all there is nothign ther ebut praises to ccp transparence which is inexistent by the way and brownnosing from you the truth is as long as ccp is in charge of auditing itself any evidence they present is null and void if the csm was assembled to be an external auditing source as originally suggested things could be different as it is you are useless and all internal affairs investigation or evidence talk from ccp is a ridiculous farce i make any assumptions i wish in the absence of proof and i bet i am right here the absence of evidence not ccp ridiculous pr but real evidence of the opposite is quite enough for methe fact that you payed for this and had the availability to do it even considering how futile and useless the position is for everything but to gather some prestige in an online game only shows how little value your time has for youif i need to be in the csm to know what it does it is already useless by definition
lavista vista  dont waste your time debating etho ive seen his input on forum threads before hes already made up his mind and will put forth statement after statement that can be neither proven nor disproven when you cant disprove what he says hell think its victory and insult you its a classic conspiracytheory mindset silence is the best antiblowhard technique
i prefer telling him his mother smells of elderberries
you on the other hand is a nice little alt maybe lavistas alt who knows
i fart in your general french accent direction
i rest my case
i dont know if disbanding the csm is the answer but i agree something needs to change i would suggest ccp implement a new company policy that its employees no longer are permitted to join alliances over a certain size maybe even not allow them to join in at allthe fact is it is human nature to abuse any power that is given teachers are not allowed to date students and radio employees are not allowed to participate in contests there are reasons why this is done because it gets abused over and over again just like we are seeing in evecome on ccp grow up and get the devs out of bob and gs and stop this madness once and for all
please ccp return the headlights to my revelationi simply cannot see where i am going this is horrible
obviously i support my brilliant idea
i can never say no to headlights
nor can deer stand dumbstruck in the revelations path anymore
ccp hinted at this a while back but i feel it should be done if possible sooner than later it will drastically reduce isk farming and macros it would allow mining to be somewhat entertaining kinda itll open up lowsec to miners and also make hunting them easier and more fun they can become complacent some other stuff i cant think of right nowperhaps to balance this out with mining noobs have small belts enough for a frigate to mine 5001m isk around some hisec areas and increase mining missionsedit this means basically increase sites that require probing and completely remove the standard belts
do you mean the scannable belts as in the ones that already exist in normal space or do you mean something else op lacks clarity
you can already find scannable grav sites in highsec and lowsec space in wspace you can find some higher quality belts that have various different and more profitable roids in them but wspace is 00 with all the risks that come along with mining in 00 space
op updated
what will stop the isk farmers writing a macro to hunt down belts 
no it wont they will simple have the one person controlling the mining fleets spend all of 10 minutes to scan out the belts and mark them while the macro fleet moves aroundmining will never be entertainingahh i see now this is another one of those get rid of highsec because i dont have enough guppies to easily kill in lowsec threadsperhaps you should try thinking up an original idea to begin with instead of rehashing the force people to lowsec whinethis already exsists accept a mission complete the mission dont turn it in mine the missionfixed that last one for you
im an industrialist but thanks for assuming
personally i think all asteroid belts should be randomly seeded throughout the entire game and you have to scan them out to find themthis would effectively put an end to macro mining as we know it
exactlypeople think that macros can probe with the new system writing something like that would be extremely complex and not very accurateas to an isk farmer probing everything and from there on out farming the system if it happens it happens but the time that farmer took to scan down would add uptheres probably no way to remove them altogether however this would alleviate a large number of them
it takes all of 5 minutes to setup a macro to do basic mining a simple mouse recording program and 5 minutes is all you needstep 1 set bookmarkstep 2 adjust overview to only show roids and sorted by distancestep 3 record the followingundockright click mouse over to new bookmark warp to bookmarkactivate minersclick on the roid at the top of the overview that has been made to only show asteroids and sorted by distancerigh click mouse over to station warpdockmove cargo from hold to hangarset the delays between steps set the macro to repeat x amount of timesand you are donethe higher end macros work the same way once you have a warp point and the bookmark set they work off that the only work you have to do is finding where to go
that works with static belts yes however you have to rerecord a macro or bookmark every day its not a cure for macros just a treatment
there are several problems it will require several changes to the probe system again  as the mining sites should be accessible to people that havent trained the probe use so they should be scannable using the directional scanner making the probing skills mandatory is not a good idea it will not open low sec to miners easy to scan mining spots are as much death traps as belts respawning of exploration sites is borked as they respawn in a random system with the same security level in the same general area if that area is constellation region or even larger it is not clear the net effect is that they tend to pile in less used or less accessible systems so systems without stations hi sec systems in a pocket after a low sec system and so on while it can be interesting for gatecampers that want to kill miners at low sec gates it will not enhance mining in any way unless the mining pockets are small and so deplete fast it will make little difference for a macrosweatshop farmer it is easy to scan with 1 account while the others are mining at best you would remove the hauler for some minute while it scan all the gravimetric sites in system and bookmark them if the gravimetric sites are so small that they will hinder macrsweatshops farmers they will hinder regular miners too
i know it is possible to drop modules on spots where you want them by flying there but i dont find this system accurate enoughthe problem i have mostly is that i align my defensive mods from the center out this way i know the range of my guns and i can optimize the pos guns by rangein short i place my mods on a virtual axisthis isnt possible easily atm due to camera restrictions and placementi believe by making my suggested idea possible you can build your pos more strategically and precisely and a well aligned pos looks way better than a few modules flying here and there

as i was out of the game for some time did this happen after ccp stated it is an exploitif they did mark it as exploit of course if yes then you should get banned if not then its game mechanics and the rule apply here as well so depends on what really happenedi am an individual with my own opinion my logic state the fair thing not what suits my wallet or what my mates say to flamewhinepointtohaxbobedit hell people still pray to god yet we are in the same alliance that doesnt mean that i share their beliefes spelling too bored to google sorryyyy
exgonad posting in support of goons
this topic might make a fairly amusing eve radio live debate with an invited panel of guests ps not supported obviously since i believe the identity theft should have been reversed almost immediately and band of brothers invited to reform their alliance name and identitythe compromise solution we have now might be pretty messy and not fully satisfy anyone but its far better than allowing the goons to whine their way to reversal of whats obviously been a lengthy gm discussion and response to the identity theft petition
hahahaha
stick to your own goddamned rules and qualify why you didnt do it now a lot better than that meek excuse you have offered until nowwhat is this fifth or sixth time hellbent on betraying the trust of your subscribers goddamn
you call someone a tool then ask them to grow up real mature of youthe name kenzoku was hated by most of their members and it was a mistake mollee made and you have to live with the consequences of that terrible alliance name in your corporations alliance history profile mollee made a lot of mistakes he allowed haag to disband the alliance by removing the voting safety measure he lost a titan and destroyed your morale he decided to do nothing and stay docked in a npc station and finally he renames the alliance a fail name reloaded like darwin reloaded mollees titan that died this new alliance will die pathetically as wellhaving the name kenzoku demorazlies your members and was a vicotry for your ennemies and you can change it using valid game mechanics but you decided that you didnt want to pay 1000000000 isk and didnt want to have that stain in your emloyment profileno one forced you to choose the name kenzoku except your leader mollee now live with the shameyour alliance is a joke and will die as such none of your ennemies will pay you any respect
my ingame morals guys guys
same rules for everyone
id like band of brothers reloaded to follow the same rules as everyone else
same rules for everyone
you do realize that never before in the history of this mmorpg has anyone got away with such an outright identity theft as goonswarm stealing band of brothers by creatiing an alt corp to block alliance recreation rightin the past this has always led to gms nuking the stolen name and allowing the original owners to recreate their identitygoons are the ones who appear to be operating on a different ruleset to everyone else here if anything
actually haargoths identity is still his idiot
your post is full of lies
please dont tell us something like rules are meant to be brokeni want answers
maybe they where the first to ask for the name change and this is a new service now
i recommend reading before posting
seriously identity theft get out the corporation didnt exist its not like band of brothers was disbanding to rename their alliance to band of brothers reloadedoh wait i just figured out haargoth wasnt behind all of this
lotka volterranever before in the history of this mmorpg youre terrible at history fyi
funny where do the eve rules say that is illegal a name was no longer in use a player created a corporation using that name how is this breaking the game rules forget concepts of honor and morals rules how did this break them
one of the main reasons the playerbase was demanding something like the csm was because of scandles involving favoratism towards bobagain ccp has shown favoratism towards bob we want this to stop
you cant steal something that isnt taken the name was available and someone registered it no rules were broken here
same rules for everyone
everyone else who has asked for a name change ever has been told to fck off this is bs
im honestly confused here jade can you please explain in as much text as you possibly can how you can steal a name nobody is currently using again please make sure you use a giant wall of text because it seems to make you look important
ah so instead of this rather minor abuse of their authority you would prefer ccp have committed a much more significant abuse of their authority
bright colors and flashing images help too hth
yeah us goonies have a terrible attention span
the former eve alliance everlasting vendetta went to play wow their guild was disbanded and the name grabbed by another group of players before they could reform i know its absolutely astonishing that something like this has happened elsewhere in the mmo universekeep using scary words like steal and theft to suggest goons did anything but capitalize on bob stupidity and used anything but workingasintended ingame mechanics to disband bob and get their namekeep failing to see the difference between using ingame methods to achieve alliance goals and getting a gm to flip a switch to make changes to an alliance that are impossible for players to make on their own
disband them or allow the rest of us to do the same
even better maybe jade could put it into the form of a song with some guitar we could called it jade trolls unplugged
i support this edrama
actually youre wrong it happened in age of conan two guilds who hated and despised each other had a long running conflict brought about from sharing a resource instance with each other captain morgan society eventually destroyed the enemy guild the fallen guard when the guild leader decided in a moment of drunken madness to rename the guild rolving re tards no idea what rolving means i assume it was meant to be loving or maybe revolving when this happened one of the captain morgan society guys dropped guild and immediately made a new guild stealing the guild name before they could change back in the ensuing thread the action was actually compared to one you may find in eveonline and was deemed legal it occured on one of the strict roleplaying servers where guild name identity and reputation is probably more important than on a plain pve or pvp serverin essence its little different as sirmolle removed the safety checks ingame himself shares for votes thus was vulnerable to such an action by his own makingyou can read about it here although tbh its a pretty boring threadcaptain thunk
speaking of reading before posting jade are you going to read every post of unprecedented support for this ideaplease take the time to do so  that way we dont have to read your terrible posts for awhileoh yeah and heres something to think about while youre readingkenzoku was formed several months before bob was disbandedformer bob corps could have created an alliance with the revised namegoonswarm has had several directorlevel spies and hasnt been disbandedbob was only disbanded because their executor corp was structured for quick  easy accessget out
goonswarm before agtard gate  goonswarm after agtard gate  goonswarm after molle gate  thank youdr shot
so bob had 2 choices after they were disbandeda join kenzoku instant alliance and sovb make new alliance  with a better name and pay one bil dont know about a sov mechanics concerning a newly created alliance hope someone can explainthey decided for a and they get their instant alliance but now they decide want to do b instead and gm allowed that seems like cheating to me
same rules for everyone
i just see a standard gooncoalition threadnaught with no real substance demanding that ccp bend over for 5000 players in a dark corner of 00 nothing new really ultimately i think you need understand that a thread full of alts and mindless 1s doesnt really achieve anything this thread will go the way of the make goons in charge of caod thread and disappear in a couple of days in a puff of smoke and hyperbole and nobody will lament its absencemeanwhile the rest of the server gets on with playing the game id advise you to do the same
the most supported thread in the assembly hall should be dismissed in a puff of smokeyou obviously have no faith in the csm can you remember why it was created
there is no reason why the gms should change kenzokus name simply because its not the right name
my case after a few months of playing s9 ticker became available didnt had it at that time kindly asked 2 times the gms to give it to my corp since noone was using it no cant do so i had to close the corp  move all assets to corp members get outkick all corp members and finally leave the corp only to redo it 10min later with the ticker we wantedother examplesstian empire was created someone noticed the typo told ccp ccp told them to disband the alliance and getting no refund from the 1bn isk needed to create it recreate the alliance and once again pay 1bn isk to create it and make sure to spell the name correctlyblack 0ut was created someone realized how dumb this was and so they asked ccp to change it to black out ccp told them no and that theyd have to disband the alliance and get no refund from the 1bn isk needed to create it recreate the alliance and once again pay 1bn isk to create it and make sure to spell the name the way they wanted toagainst all authorities had a slight mishap where someone didnt pay the maintenance build they lost all their sovereignty had to recreate the alliance and had to once again front the 1bn isk fee ccp did not reimburse any of thatbobrs case the eula clearly doesnt give you any rights to have your alliance name changed as for bad game mecanics when bob was first dismantled it was noones fault ingame the same faulty game mecanics apply to everyone ingame other alliances can suffer the same fate sooner or later  until ccp changes something you went down thru legitimate ingame mecanis  have the spine to recognize itthe name itself has little importance you can have yer old name back for all i care but bending the eula rules still going strong for sov3 in some systems and not paying the 1bn bill  these facts clearly put ccp in a delicate position again because it clearly shows bobr plays this game by one set of rules and us the rest by another setfirst among equalsand lets make one thing clear this is not bobrs fault this is a ccp failure because they still want to interfere in eve politics why is this happening idk the only logical conclusion is that some people with a lot of decisional power in ccp still have strong ties with bobr after the t20 problems i sincerely doubt even lead gms do something big like this without asking permision from the headhonchoseve is not ccps lovechild anymore its a cash cow and it shows milk it while you can however some people will never understand that money even big money can be made in a number of ways it doesnt have to be like thisif csm has any voice whatsoever this issues will be on their agenda and yes internal affairs should be notified about this they should get mails from as many peeps as possible be decent civil but have a voice mail thembtw bobr i hope you understand why a lot of eve hates you now its not yer socalled elitism its the cheating you need to resort to in order to win something its the lenghts you go to bend the rulesas for sending us out for a walk in rl so we dont moan about internet spaceshipz business how about you follow yer own advice and when you come back at the keyboard you try to play the game fairplay and have some phun while youre at itthe irony is that its not gonna matter in the end enough entities ingame have the means now to take you down completely and keep you down youre not the elitist alliance you once were youre just average now as a lot of other peeps got into a lot of caps nowfame lasts 15min infamy lasts a bit longer
i have no faith in goons thats an entirely different matter csm was created amongst other things to provide oversight on correct goings on inside ccp in their relations to the community in this case a gm has provided a response to the community and a decision has been made this thread represents a standard goon threadnaught trying to bully out advantage in eve by threatening to damage ccps pr on the internetsnobody should cave in to bullying
excellently put at the very least ccp needs to go into more detail about how kenzoku is different from any of the cases mentioned
lol as if the intention of the hurry up and create a corp wasnt to steal bobs identity solely to rub salt into some virtual pixel wound one only needs to look at the silly toon names that post from said corp to see through that charade this whine fest has nothing to do with ccp this or gm that its everything to do with the fact that bob now has some of their identity restored i agree 100 with jade contantine and others that the original corp name theft should not have been allowed to stand rename the childish goon corp to bobr and bobr to bob at that point all will be well in the world of evestill its hilarious to see the goons and their northern nut cuppers stamp their feet like little children and spam the forums they someone think that making a billion threads and filling them with a billion posts from goons goon alts and goon nut cuppers its the same as having a thought worth listening to last year it was spamming the forums trying to get jade contantine removed as csm president and your own  put in last week it was wahhh isd didnt report us sitting outside a station for a month picking our noses now its wahhhh bob has their identity back no fair we stole their name proper like itll be something different next week the whineswarm will always continue
you make that quite clear in your many rambling posts maybe you should have a glance at some of the pages in this thread do you really think all those posts for support are by goonsyou have made your point several times that you dont like goons we understand maybe you are envious of their success i dont know please stop trolling this thread like it was caod
another bobr shows the mentality of a 5 year old stop posting sfsfailme you are only making yourself look an idiot
sad truth  btw i do not support this
my 2 cents01  bob chose to rename to ken for a reason it gave them control over some portions of space or something it didnt work out and eventually goons took even that away from them if bob had created a new name and got no benefit from it then i would agree the new name change is irrelevent but thats not the case bob benefited from using the ken name so they should be stuck with it 01  it didnt take ccp two months to figure out that bob was disbanded using legal game mechanics and that goons took the bob name if this was an abuse of the game mechanics then it should have been dealt with in the first two weeks it ticks me off that ccp waited for the ken thing to go bad ie get their butts handed to them by gs and then decided to let them change their name disclaimer  the opinions expressed here reflect my own personal opinion and not the views of my corp or the cva alliance
well i think the massive majority are from goons goon alts goon allies and good fanbois  a smaller proportion might be from younger players carried along with the hue and cry and mistakenly believing some of the complete nonsense that is being posted by the goons ultimately this is partizan political thread and the goon coalition has been instructed to follow the party line by its leadership
i really dont know what to make of thisone one hand a disgraced cheating alliance seems to yet again have been rewarded by gms in what appears to be a clearly inappropriate use of gm discretionon the other i am so sick of the pathetic puerile destruction of coad and the ingame spamming of goonswarmi am amazed to find myself ambivalent i really dont care the more i think about it the more i think that it is no big deal whether it is kenzoku or bob reloadedas for goonies whining i find myself thinking that perhaps if they showed more respect to others i would care that there was a bias against them by the gmsi suppose i will get spammmed with abusive evemails and 1 line abusive comments but as far as i am concerned is the only difference between goonswarm and bob is that bob got caught cheating red handedapart from that there is not much between them at all
right instead lets have them bendover for 3000 in public besides jade thoes 5000 players dont matter right they are all goons every single one of them in this whole thread are goons and goon alts whats a a few thousand 1s here and there oh thats right the whole point of the csm i really instensely dislike people like you at least with goons you know where you stand they wear their identity on their sleeve you you will support principles one day anything goes the next and have a public identity crisis on the third you have no principles and frankly it gets annoying trying to have a forum debate with you i dont know what to say because i know you arent reading or listening your just posting and reading your own postsare you saying there is no history of gm misconduct and are you saying that nothing here is wrong at all really come on jade please throw us all a bone and take a stand one way or the other goonswarm aside is it right or is it wrong
dont worry  goons have been caught redhanded a fair bit in the past too its pretty standard for bigalliance corruption
i see you are still out of touch with those you want to feel as if you represent
there was a history of developer misconduct it has been dealt with nowadays the dev misconduct thing is just a rallying call for goons to attempt to blugeon their way to victory in a political game that seeks to achieve results with whining and threadnaughts rather than playing the gamewhats wrong here is that goons were allowed to keep the band of brothers alt corp without having it renamed evecorp4234023049 in response to the bob leadership petition against identity theft why this happened is even more troubling because i very much suspect it was delayed and delayed through fear of negative press before the retail release of the latest expansion if this is indeed the case then it suggests the goon alliance has successfully bullied ccp into allowing full on identity theft to the detriment of an entire community of eve players and this is a very bad precedenti cant believe you couldnt read all that from my earlier posts to be quite honest
dont forget friends of goon helped tooand if anyone cares to look i believe it was on page 37 that 2 members of the bobr alliance posted support for this thread joke or not it still counts
no because ccp has already set up enough bad precedents pos bowling alliance renaming banning the guy who finds out about the cheating dev
jade i am still waiting for your explanation on how you can steal a name nobody is using however rather then explaining this please feel free to continue crying foul and crying identity theft that works just as well i suppose
well teeshirts mugs killboard graphics logos hell  custom keyrings and engraved nippleclamps  who knows point as you very well know is that when 3000 players build a community around an ingame identity that identity belongs to them in some greater sense than a mere collection of letters but we both know your question was a troll since your own alliance leader has admitted rushing to register the alt corp identity purely to block the rightful owners of the name recreating their alliance name after the directorlevel emocide
ah thank you that makes sense since they somehow own the rights to this name even though they are no longer using it nobody else can so what ccp should do is modify the rules of the game to disallow anyone from using any previously used corp or alliance nameticker see when you put it that way it makes perfect sense thank you againfollow up question since you were on csm do you think when they add the ability to walk around in stations they should also add brothels
yes and opium dens illicit bareknuckle fistfighting rings black market genetic emporiums slums and every kind of seedy local you can think of
actually the bareknuckle fistfighting rings would probably make for a pretty interesting side game if that was the case im not sure if i would rather see the mittani vs dianabolic or jade constantine vs darius johnson
stop crying goons
you havent read this thread have you its not a simple name change its about the rules and the favoritism they showed to kenzoku the only time a name can be changed is if its offensive in some way kenzoku clearly isnt it isnt a japanese swear word or anything so too bad that being said if one alliance gets to have their name changed due to petition of members within their own alliance everybodys name can be changed then
so everybody who disagrees with you is a goon or a noob and therefore their opinion doesnt count how convenient
technically no doesnt matter what their community built up you could use the argument that the usa television channel hbo and time warner has more rights to the band of brothers due to their 2001 tv drama series based on the life and actions of 101st airborne easy company in world war 2 than a group of 3000 internet spaceship game players who have no real world legal claim to the nameat the time after the bob alliance was disbanded through legitimate in game mechanics the was no alliance corporation or any other entity called band of brothers no one individual or group had any preferential right to the name regardless of how many key rings or teeshirts they had goons got their first and bob wasnt fast enough to do anything about it
approved if ccp wants to start enabling namechanges then let them notify the player base in an orderly manner and post their policy for such other games charge real money as well for such a privilage like portrait changesregardless unilateral action favoring a single faction or alliance again bob is intolerable and exactly why the csm exists youd think someone would have learned their lesson after t20 but whatever back to the woodshed we take themkrum
no compromise not even in the face of armageddoni see it is busy spewing nonsense like its going out of style here too has it found a cross to nail itself to yet
one would have hoped that ccp would have learned its lesson about giving an alliance preferential treatment out of a desire not to play a game run by people out of touch with reality one also would have hoped that after years of rampant corruption from isd an exposed cheating dev and numerous documented devs involved in bob that ccp would have noticed that it wasnt ok to blatantly play favorite with the same group of people againrename bobr to rkz and let them disband pay 1bil and reset all of their sov counters if they want to get the name that they were inexplicably given without having to following in game mechanics    just like everyone else i am actually having a hard time believing that this wasnt a unilateral action but some junior gm who didnt understand the storm he was walking into  cant conceive that there would be obvious preferential treatment like this and that they would actually break game mechanics by allowing them to go over the character limit
supported but disband goonswarm too once the drama dies down and the forums get boring again
shameful
something so insignificant get a grips of yourselfs people in the context of what has happened and the due process that went about to the renaming personally i see nothing wrong with itit appears that a lot of people are just caught up with the ehate and lack any common sensemy 2c but dont let me stop your winning
sup welcome to eve i guess you havent been playing for very long and dont quite rememnber t20 aura delve buffs and all of the other crap bobr has gotten handed to them from corrupt devs and gms over the yearschange the name back disband bobr or drop their sov this  has gone on for too long now

shame on you ccp
same rules for everyone
ccp appears to be making up the rules here as they go along if this is more collusion between ccp and the former members of band of brothers what are we the fee paying players to take from this towards ccp as a company poor ethics unprofessional dishonest lacks integrityif that is the case certainly i would have to take a review of paying for multiple accounts and continuing to play the game on an uneven  biased playing field ccp dropped the ball with t20 lets not go back there to those dark days this is a job for the csm to investigate and report back to us the fee paying member base
naughty naughty very naughty
a sad day ccp you suck
ccp im really disappointed in you
poor show really poor
not happy jan
why should we be forced into complying with the rules if you feel that bob should be entitled to a neverending series of exceptions from the ruleswhy do you out of all people be allowed to do whatever the hell you wantit does affect everybody because whenever something remotely bad happens and someone gives you a tough beating you just emorage to your csr mates and it gets fixed we do not approve of a precedent we do not want you to receive favors of any kind and for that matter no one but especially youif you ask me you should be playing the game from a handicapped position just to make up for all the cheating youve done in the pastyour arrogance the constant disobedience and lack of respect for the rules to which we all abide regardless if indeed they are internet spaceship rules depict your antisocial mentality i and many others feel like it is time for you to be wiped from eve deadline yesterdayps start playing freelancer or something multiplayer isnt for you cavemen

so many whining goons  nc pets made my dayhahaha lol
not supported its a name get over it
just a quick noteif you support the issue check the little checkbox that says check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going onmight make you look less like an idiotandkeep posting
oh mai gawd does it really freakin matternot supported i mean does the name really matter stop your crying and start actually pew pewing you whiny goons
neither of those two options should be an option they are not an option to the rest of the eve world and should not be an option to you the problem people have obviously is that ccp shows favoritism to band of brothers this is yet one more case of this sort of favoritism rearing its ugly headyou were owned fair and sqaure i see you went qq to ccp to get some sort of dignity back but in the end you just look patheticgv
no expetions for single entitiesif this option is available to everyone then there is no problem but it is notmain point is one exception leads to another exception and so on and in the end you got ppl exploiting the system and ruining the game
what exactly is the issue would you  and moan if mr smith down the street changes his name to mr johnson as wellbob was crippled by borderline abuseexploit of game mechanics or lack thereof and they went through proper channels when they realised that the old name had been reserved by another partythis whole propaganda campaign smells like a masspsychotic break due to personal issues with the name band of brothers nothing good ever came from masshysteriaa name was changed no other action was taken if you feel mistreated or that an unfair advantage was gained by it put in a petition with internal affairsinternet spaceships are serious i get that but we are talking letters here for goddess sake  their spaceships still blow up and they will probably still partake in the localsmack we all know and love in nullsec
supporteddisband of cheaters
its a role playing game names matterif kenzoku can just change their name without losing anything then i should be granted this option too
id be annoyed if mr johnson got his name change and mr jones was told no and mr robberts was told yes but you will need to reaply for a new passport driving licence and remorgage your house as your current agrement will be invalid lol sovsafeguards were deliberatly removed from the bob executor corp a risk was taken it did not pay offsent a mail to ia they sent it to the gm team now if that isnt a waste of space department i dont know what is
im new and i cant say i know much about this but if ccp is cheating then ill find myself another mmo
100 totally thisif you do not get what this means then you will always wonder why bocbod will be witchhunted out of this sandbox for as long as the servers are live
i agree with most of the people here ccp stop favoring your own alliance and even if it wasnt your own then you still did something wrong but favoring 1 alliance over the others i know a name change isnt a big thing but a rule is a rule if thats not the case then i got a long list over rules i would love to be allowed to break on a daily basecpp fail
okies again ccp where is the response to this 66 pages on this many more locked many more peeps who again find this unacceptablethe gms response was hurf bluf everyone knows it from a noob to a vet how long are we going to wait 2 months for a proper and accurate response with facts 1who else has this been done too alliance wise2where is the change to the rule stated3who else was consulted before this was done 4and who had the final say
thread needs more support from alts tbhgo biomass alts who already supported this and make a new one and support again make ccp think that everyone supports this not just you spoonswarmnorthern cryalitionpathetic legion etc etc
another fun day in eve eh
i am a neutral party and i do not in fact think developer misconduct and favoritism is a good idea oh gee that must mean im a gs alt dont derail thread you barely disguised flamebait
ah bending the rules one more time in favor of exbobkenny shame on you gm in charge you should be fired imho
im no alt and have zero affiliation to goons pl or any other involved corpsyou are kidding yourself if you think only those fighting bob are fed up with ccp being constantly being in their pocket
but yes i have an alt and i think this situation is typical of ccp and raises questions about the integrity of the whole game
i support this
even if it is not really bobrs failure i support this such buddy deals have to stop finally
oh wait band of developers that should be goonswarm because they do have the most members that are gmdevsits quite hypocritical to call someone to be favoured by the devs when those people whining about it have the biggest number of people working for ccpand why exactly is this petition about disband bobr it was only a namechange if at all youre requesting something it should be rename bobr back to kenzoku because everything else just shows what the real purpose of this isto finally and utterly destroy bob and every member in it it didnt work with all naping each other it didnt work with using a clearly quite broken game mechanic using a defect member but yes it was intentional that you can disband a whole alliance yet you have to wait 24h to unlock a bpo wait 24h to kick an unwanted member out of a corp and still bob is there and fightswhat comes nextps thanks for killing aurora because they so clearly favoured bob and did all those favours for them its really nice that theres not a single bloody event left it brings the backstory soooo close to us makes us feel we can influence itpps having a spy in an alliance is ok but hacking into forums and ts servers or sniffing packets from the internet isnt truly inside the game rules
funny how people pick up on the slightest peice of misinformation and run with it like it is proofi assume you are talking about sharesi also assume you have never been in a position where you could actually try kicking a corp out of an alliancei honeslty dont know how goonswarm got away with identity theft which other corps have been punished for previously but i dont really care eitherthe fact is that they were shown favouritism that other corps have not been shown and i think that is a gross injustice the current situation is nothing more than an uncomfortable compromiseim serious
hi avon remember saying thishow times change
this is a tough decision for me because while i think what happened to bob in the first place was fairly trashy and unfortunate certainly not the way i would want to bring down a foe and i think meta gaming is lame true but this is all part of what makes eve great and it does seem like their may be some favoritism here if ccp could provide some proof that they have taken similar actions before which i do not believe they have then perhaps i would be more amicable to the whole name change situation furthermore now that a precedent has been set they better be ready and willing to change any alliance name in addition if bobr did get to keep their sov despite the change that is fairly unconventional too i think because usually an alliance to change their name would have to reform and lose sov so bob most likely should have had to undergo the same process at least instead of just having a quick painless transferso at the moment with the given information i support this cause bobr should have to disband then they should reform with their new name and sacrifice standing etc it just seems more fair that way i do have sympathy for bob because of the whole way they went down very dishonorable way to win goons imo but still it shouldnt get them sympathy from devs who should be unbiased and not show any form of favoritism lets see how it shakes out
goonswarm may have the most devsgms but theyre not the ones getting rules bent to help them win at internet spaceships like bob they dont have a history of devsgms flat out cheating to help their alliance
first id just like to say that sure the disbanding by one button is kinda fscktup butif molle hadnt removed the shares so alliance changes could go through without a vote then thats his mistakeand how come a absent director still had executor roles intactits like removing your firewall because your bandwidth suffers lag whos fault is it your secrits gets stolen you or the hacker capitalising on the security lapsenot anybodys fault but your own you did a stupid thing like thisand your letter of the law pointits not that the name changed most couldnt care lessits that you guys got the rules bent in your favour by ccp yet againcountless alliances have had to disbandlose sovpay 1bill and reform to get what you got by pressing 1 button ironic i know p so i guess
66 pages of spam by the 12 people who care and their 6 altsthis is quite a threadnaughtsee if you can get it 80 pages of wasted disk space by tonight
thanx for helping out
you are on page 67 thanks for helping the causeand there are allot more then the swarm raising their legitimate voice
lol double post thatUFFFDs been awhile
you know what  it following 3 accounts each char on a seperate account cancelled until this  is reversedthoradhtcupnavaj0might be back if this gets reversed
violation of the rules needs to be changed back until all other alliances can do this
i am a new player just plugged in my 60 day code a few days ago i mainly became interested in looking at eve due to all the news that was generated because of the goons taking down bob i guess that is a testament to the saying there is no such thing as bad press i think however questionable the goons taking out of bob was it does not merit any special treatment by the developers if they used ingame metrics to complete what amounts to a hostile takeover then so be it if that ingame metric needs to be changed then the systems put in place to make ingame rule changes should be utilized if there is an in game metric for changing your alliance name then it should be used anything else would be some form of favoritism regardless good luck to all involved
can i change my name please
hey look
ccp doesnt realize that with such a small game like this word of mouth is the best advertisement they cant get really now they have over 1300 players calling shenanigans most of these players are willing to stop playing if ccp doesnt listen to overwehlming opinion of the playerswith this massive amount of disappointment ccp will lose allot of businessi for one will not pay my subscription until this is fixed and i urge all of you to do the same

hey d ickheadof 2000 posts in the thread 1400 are unique votes in agreement with the proposal we only get to vote onceit amazes me that you big alliances think you are the only ones in this game i have no knowledge of or connection to any major player but i pay for the game and i expect there to be no cheating from the developers or ccpas has been said if ccp have repeatedly done such high profile cheats for bob how many other times have they given them things and not been found out
yes and ban all goon s aswell
10
67 pages countless posts and still no reply from ccpa shame really
10
they killed kennysave the kenny
hate aligning with goonies but this  has to stop ccp
this isnt factual shares have nothing to do with the mechanic in play
who cares what you think jadeone game one rule if ccp hasnt dealt with this issue by next week i am thinking some other online games are looking better i can vote with my 6 accountshere is the root of the problem ccp in case you were not aware what everyone is so upset about we spend our money our time and our effort to sink into this vast game that you create we are not all massochists alright time and time again we get into conflicts with this bob entity this entity gets favors and has been caught for a lot of things who knows what it has not been caught for it is my suspicion that max damage actually stood for max gtcs cause if you think about it damage  gtcs perhaps the brass at ccp keep someone up high on the food chain so that they can increase the sales of gtcs maybe this is all about money manipulating the game to make more cash whatever the reason this whole thing is complete bull having one alliance that just seems to keep getting the favors yeah i have 6 characters to vote with your move ccp
this is becoming ridiculous
i want to change my alliance nameno exception for rules
no one should be above the rules
yesbending rules has to end at some point and this seem as good time as any to stop the insanityat the very least make return the name into its orginal state and give them the same option everyone else has had create a new alliance if you want a new name
im a pirate
down with band of developers and bob onlineps  jade no one cares really im serious
i will use one of your memeUFFFDs herei believe it isif you point me in the right direction of said rule stating that it is not then ill concede this point ofchowever taking your words for anything but spin is harder and harder for every line of text you writeccp nor you and the animals more equal then others can not ignore all these people cryingsomething is rotten in the state of denmark icelandooh orwell and shakespeare i knew that library card would pay of p
every alliance is born every alliance can diethats the game
i dont know who were kiddingeven if the csm has the brass to broach this subject ccp wont act on it despite having more support by almost an order of magnitude than any other issue ive seennot even if every player not in kenzoku supports itsigh what can you possibly do when the entity holding all the keys is against you
supporting this
its just a frickin name 
what you dont understand is sov mechanics if they wanted a new name they should have left or disbanded kenzoku and formed a new alliance just like every single other group in this game would have had toi guess i misunderstood what had happened originally i guess all the former bob corps joined another already formed alliance instead of creating a new one so they had no say over their name when they joined kenzokuthey had a choice join kenzoku or make a new alliance with a new name they chose kenzoku this never should have even been considered by ccp
yes change the name backno special rules for spezial friends
they could have made a new alliance called bob reloaded if they cared so much about their identity they did not they chose an already existing alt alliance to join called kenzoku to give them sov advantage in delve they made their decision they should have to live with it and not break the rules everyone else has to follow
found at least the right symbol for agreeing with the proposal
lets see if the csm has any real power not holding my breath tho
i dont like beavers
so false considering 90 of the supports in this thread are by alts which in turn are probably goonnc altsif you could only support this with 1 char per account then we would see the real number
says the bob pet
i dont agree with you ergo youre a bob altpet
grimmi already explained the action taken yesterday so theres no point in continuing the bitter rage regardless of what either csm says there really is no voice for the player base that will ever be heard and actions addressed in the right timeband of brothers and kenzoku are nothing more than a name much like any other corp or alliance love them or hate them it makes no difference log into eve and kill them if you hate bob that much the only voice that will ever be heard is the guns blazing and missile spamming of internet spaceships tbh
like an apologist asking why resist a military junta
bob made their choice when they decided to become kenny they should be made to live with their choice like everyone else has to soverignty or name not bothccp should be made to acknowledge their mistake other peoplecorpsalliances have been denied a name change and to bend the rules for kenny and change it is rediclous especially given that by now kenny was estabished as an alliance name and identitygms still need to learn some pr skills in the threads about this ive seen them not reply despite people asking them to while still managing to delete peoples posts and when they have replied they seem to make excuses to fob people offnot happy with ccp
why they did this they mustve know that it would create a storm its very disrespectful to me as a paying customer
i see alot of goonswarmsomething awful alts i hardly expect to see this thread taken seriously
you cant refute any point made so you whine about alts instead
bob and friends might dont take it serious but i think breaking general rules for a small group of players is an issue for the whole playerbase it in this case has nothing to do with bob itself it could have been every other alliance which has developers friends and got other dev favors in the past if there would be any
i support this no alliance should be able to use gms to circumvent sov mechanics i dont care about the name this about actualingame cheatingthey should be disbanded and allowed to to recreate the alliance with that same name well close to it apparently its too long for a player to actually create theyll be band of brothers reloade which is close enough id think im sure theyd be happy with thati actually have some sympathy for them but as far as i know the disbanding and subsequent registration of the bob name was completely legitimate and caused by a metagame betrayal which ccp has expressly allowed if not actively encouraged it is in fact one of eves strongest selling points so while i know it must suck to be bob this recent change must not be allowed to stand sympathy is not justification for cheating
the number of other goons that got trolled by the character limit on corporation and alliance names amuse me its not 2425whatever guys everything else still stands though one rule for all
the whole point is bias since the only people replying are the ones who would benefit from the proposal if one that demanded the disbanding of razor or goonswarm on some technical ground that was minor which this is effectivly poped up and got 2000 votes from mostly corpless alts would you expect it to be taken seriouslyanother thing this is is a pr attempt to drag bob throught the dirt again to gain credability something which the goonswarm has been lossing at a dramitic rate if any of my fellow empire freinds have to saywhat ever you say its obbious what is going on here anyone with half a brain can see so dont try and lecture to be about right and wrong your wasting the energy in your fingers
answer ccp were waitingmaybe a false advertising complaint wouldnt hurt you cant say its a player run world with this many complaints
1 rule 1 game no nepotistic bull
keep drinkin the koolaid man erase the names bobr and goons from this issue and the point is obvious the problem is being clouded by the entities involvedthis is wrong period
i support this
no the issue is minor and pointless its over a string of characters its fueled by childish vendetas and in game aspirations to gain a upper hand
sorry mate but i do belive that all this csm assembly wall n stuff was created only to keep us entertained with somethingand some hope but only thati belive ccp will do the same thing as others hideyou will not readhear a word from thembut as a wise man once said hope is the last to die seifer
some good ratting systems are cynojammed now due to this 
i do believe youre wrong shows a basic misunderstanding of the csm system which by its design takes some time to have an effect even if the skill que was the only thing they had ever done it would validate their existence but they also provided some serious balancing ui tweaks and the orcathats not the point here anyhow this thread is just another pr attempt by the goons bob did the same thing to them when they had any real power the two just go back and forth annoying everyone else in the universesince the goons will bump this for another year or so no harm in condemning the waste of a slot on the assemblys main pageyou frothing lapdogs
what do you think would be better  that ccp openly declares its support for bob or that it just stays silent and denies everythingwhat are you gonna do if they get balls enough to declare a favorite alliance fight them or ragequitid think itd be pretty amusing if they came out in the open
i strongly fullheartedly support this ive never worked with goonies nor with bob but the very stickiness between bob and ccp goes beyond ones capacity of describing it in proper words its like im unknowingly getting a lemon from a car dealer w exactly the same amount of cash his cousin pays for to get a mercede from backdoor if i am mad enough to go for being headlined id smash his store w the lemon he sold and shot him in his face w the so much public announcement of your love to your bob you are sharply indicating me that the portion of my life ive waisted is just digitalized as few binary glitches of the your database file and you are saying you can play it however you want it fine i get itlike ghost training issue and t2 bpo scandal however this one will go down a long way for the years to come you will never be free from people armed with these issues ganking you when and where most unexpected and i promise you that i will be one of themfly safe
need a tinfoil this thread makes me laugh everytime i read it stop the whining fight them all you want and stop annoying people with the same crap for the rest of the yearbig boohoo that they changed theyre name are you scared to fight them now or somethingand what do i think would be better for more raging goon muppets so i lol some more
you exploited game mechs no flame suit on
you exploited game mechs no flame suit on
how hard is it for your people to see the point its about the fact that theyve been given special treatment that allowed them to keep sov when other alliances would have been told to disband if they wanted a new name bob jumped into kenzoku to gainkeep a little sov easily and quickly then later asked to get the name changed to something they wanted instead of going about it the normal legit way and making a new alliance with the name they wanted from the start then gaining sov
nice ad for eve ccp before when people ask me about eve i use to answer it was a good game thank to the gameplay etc now f up the gameplay i will say to dont try it cause devs arent fair with all player gg ccp your game sucks by now
the op is mistaken that this has never been done before there are numerous examples that everyone seems to be ignoring in general and caod threads so based on that i disagree keep the tears flowing though since caod is much cleaner now that the goons and goon allies are around a circle discussing the issue
lol
nice sig ill take it
no more tears  i am very unhappy it has been hilarious watching the threadnaughts stay tuned i am sure something else will happen to cause fud 
no ccp cookies to friedns
enjoy it as much as we did this way you can reflect on your tears with a smile on your face 
considering 975454  of this thread consisted of gooons i demand a revote wo goons  or trial accounts of goons
amusing really since they really dont care about the game step on their ability to grief and they waffle like little girls 
name change was rescinded seems like a fair enough solution to me
we do not have to quit let us all suspend our subscription for 1 month i am certain we can find other games to play for just 1 month loss of a months revenue might not bankrupt ccp or even dent their wallet but its effect will be felt for alliances holding sovereignty they can cycle the numbers 33 of the alliance will suspend subscription for a month and for those with numerous accounts suspend subscription on one account this has to get ccps attentionwhat really gets to me is that no explanation has been offered
oh the irony of that sig its delicious
boosh
what was the social impact of bob being changed to kenzokukenny always dies at the end 
yeah but he comes back every episode like jason vorhees
i corrected your typo nbd no thanks needed

thread is now redundantlocked
is this real or a troll guessing by the amount of exclamation marks id say the latter  but we are on the eve forumi thought the whole point of that mission is that you have to visit all empires to complete itdoes anyone know if the agents will talk to you even if your standings are too lowthat would be nice imo  you could do the mission if youre fast enough to escape the local navy 
this might be me but since when do gate guns attack you if you have low standing with a empireafaik but thats been over a year ago all you got was some navy ships trying to destroy you which where at best a threat to lvl 1 frigatesguessing its gotten upgraded with faction warfare but by that much
if you dont know where you are going and what your standing means you deserve to get blown up take the lesson and dont repeat the mistakeeven the note that tells you about the epic mission mentions that you need to be able to access all of empire space if you found a note that said everyone who warps to the following coordinates needs to be able to tank 5000dps em damage would you hop into your merlin and jump right over there only to complain that you had no chance
yes the agents will talk to you but you always have them saying something like get out of my face before they give you the mission its almost comical but it worksalso if you cant travel to all the empires learn the diplomacy skill if you have it and still cant travel to all the empires it sucks to be you weve been trying to implement a way to gain standing for a faction without doing missions but were still at a loggerheadhopefully well see it soon until then dont do the epic arc

frankly im with drake it was bad enough when it was just coad  i dont read that forum so i didnt really care but when the forum mods cant even keep the asembly hall from degenerating into the equivalent of a kindergarten playground i have to seriously begin to question their ability towell moderatehand me the banstick for a day or two ill clean things up and then the useless lumps whose job this is supposed to be wont have to stretch their artificial intelligence
a goonzoku forum would be good
you can say that again my thread was locked and they left a damn sign pointing to a topic that actually made it worsemy whole premise was to stop that crapand honestly im not even going to bother complaining to them
call it eve shrinklooks like the goons have quite some psychological issuesmaybe itll help
whining post please lockps they are fixing the pos shields maybe if you bothered to read the newsisaac
i suggest you stop playing eve for an hour for each child in the world that is having a hard time the world will be a better place if 30 mins of you not playing eve helps children why not quit eve and help all children
which children you gotta be mor precise then that personally i dont really support those kind of things i believe certain people have it in a certain way because of how their believecommunityreligionsociatyraceetc have made them evolve and they have had the same chances as every body else if they are a dying species well then you should let them die and let a new and stronger element come in their place this is nature and evolution dont degenerate the human species because of a soft spot in your heart
let them eat cake
congrats kids you all assume and fail again i run a amd athlon 64 x2 5000 with 4 gb ram a msi ati radeon 4500 series 1 gb ddr3 ram card with windows vista home and creative sb xfi gamer sound card with a 600w modulated psu yes i do agree with some that maybe i have over looked something but to think i wouldnt use my brain drake hmmm no reason why your first thread was erasedi prefer the old graphics over the new graphics i hate the shine the glow the polish they added last time i checked space stations had no polish to them and i very much doubt they ever would in my opinion shot the guy that thought of adding polish no real life spaceship was polished they are all dull burned out from all the space debris and burns from the atmosphere bring a more rugged look a more real life feeling to a game that is bordering it anyways granted some scifi moves show polish but this isnt those movies
im soooo sorry for your sufferingthat is one lousy fit for a towereven that would give me headaches
lockedplease discuss this issue in the original thread
hooray heartstoneweve had great progress in many areas of the game but i think nonsovereign infrastructure and player impact on the storyline of eve are two that need some lovegood luck sir
whats your view of the blatant favoritism within ccp regarding the alliance formally known as band of brothersand the blatant disregard to their own eula regarding the name change from kenzuko to band of brother reloaded and all that it entails
from a personal perspective i believe that the examples in the past of favoritism shown towards the alliance formally known as band of brothers has been much hyped up the t20 scandal for instance was a case of favoritism shown towards a particular playercorp within the band of brothers alliance and not the alliance as a whole i also think that when this happens it is up to ccp to investigate and deal with like any other business rather than the eve community in general as an example if you somehow got a meeting with a representative of a major oil company and demanded to know the results of a disciplinary against one of their plant workers you would be quickly told where to go in this particular case i cannot see how it happened whilst maintaining the precedent ccp have stuck to before having said that i also dont know what happened internally at ccp additionally i personally cannot see any significant way it effects the game apart from being an irritation to those who wanted to change their alliance corp or player names in the past and have been refused the chance and for those who would use such an event as propaganda for their own cause i would prefer to stick to issues that actually effect peoples ability to play the game andor find the most enjoyment from the game although if enough people wanted to know if this had been investigated by ccp i would certain be more than happy to ask that question of them as stated in the previous example though i wouldnt consider it appropriate for me to demand of ccp to release any details beyond the fact that an investigation had or had not happened if they wished to release more details that is entirely their prerogative i hope that helps you make up your mind one way or another
alright let me ask one of the more volitile questions i take it due to your associations with star fraction and your wanting to be in the csm that youve monitored the past two candidacies what mistakes have they made that you wouldve done differently if you had the chancesecond your corpmates reputation in the csm is well known and many dont look favorably upon the exchange that occured in csm 1 what would you say to make us believe that this isnt a repeat of the past and that you will behave differentlylast there are currently two hotbutton issues on the csms plate and youll most likely take up the mantle of representing these when you become part of the csm how would you resolvehandle the following issuesa 00 mechanics sovereignty incentive etcb mining adding interest balancing ores etcthank you for your time and i just want to see how youd handle the pressures inherent with being a csm delegate should the public decide you worthy of said position
i am not altogether sure this as straight forward a question as you think as most of what the csm does from my understanding happens behind closed doors and in part is covered by the nda i wasnt privy to that sort of information with the 1st csm as some might think as jade kept star fraction and the csm role separate and took his nda seriously the 2nd csm has also been as opaque in many ways as the first one if we are to take what we see of the csm at face value though i personally think that in some cases on some issues there has been a little bit too much self interest governing the votes and not enough critical analysis of the subject concerned the words critical and analysis you will see time and time again from me as its what i do and more to the point what i do well i hope that i could bring both of these to the csm from my training as an academic in the humanities simple answer to this one jade and myself are separate people with separate and distinct personalities many people attribute a certain pattern behavior too many groups in eve and beyond but this falls apart on close analysis if you were to ask me what personal qualities i have that i think would be useful as a csm however i would say that i am easy going and able to think critically about issues both abstract and mundane both of these i feel are important in a csm rep it is also worth noting that whilst this my main character i chose to announce my candidacy on for the csm is a member and director of star fraction my intention is not to represent any one particular group but to weigh popular opinion on a subject with close analysis to help my fellow csm members reach a conclusion to present or not to ccpas with most subjects i have a personal opinion on them ie sov needs a change to increase the dynamics of 00 warfare beyond that of the current mechanics and adding the ability for any sized groups of people to create an infrastructure to support their miningindustry endeavors which isnt limited to location andor sovereignty but as previously stated the aim for me is to interact with the playerbase and analyse the solutions that have popular support that isnt to say i shall except what the most people say but rather pass on ideas that bear up to critical analysis that warrant ccps attention that the playerbase agree would help to increase their personal and group enjoyment of the gameand thank you for your questions i am no politician and have no carefully designed platform to wave my banner over as such what i am trying to sell so to speak is myself and the more questions i get the better so as to allow me to represent who i am to the voters and allow them to make up their own mind about me and whether i would represent them best or whether someone else would instead
good luck dierdraben

was one of the best teachers back at eve uni used to teach alot of ecm classes what do you think of the proposed ecm changes dv
when i met the ccp devs in iceland last year it was interesting to see how worried they were about showing favouritism something ive recently seen enforced by ccp in an unrelated case if they actually made an exception for bob that would be extremely worrying however im witholding judgement until their internal affairs department finishes their investigation which im sure is going on atm it could be a gm error and that would result in the name being changed back it could be a change in policy unfortunately ccp has shown repeatedly that synchronising its public documentation and internal policiesmechanics isnt one of their strong pointsregardless until ccp makes a statement nobody really knows what is going on im confident someone on the current csm will bring this up my guess would be darius johnsonedit i just read ccps reply here ccp stated that they have done this before and if this is true i have no reason to think otherwise then there has been a precendent and ccp did not show favouritism that said this seems to be another example of ccp failing to communicate properly youd think theyd learn eventually i hope one of the current csms will force ccp to come with a better explanation of the processdecision thoughfirst lets keep in mind these are firstdraft proposed changes nothing final yet and any of those changes wont make it into the game in a hurryi think theyre ridiculous same for the sb changes admittedly the 230km optimal range on my falcon rigged for range naturally is maybe a bit too far although imo thats what rokhs and other falcons are here to deal with but removing the optimal bonus completely to turn an expensive but paperthin ship into a close range fighter is ridiculous a better solution would be to reduce the falcons range bonus to 1015 so its optimal would be in range of most sniper setups while it still has some combat viability the rook with its existing damage and tank bonuses might be better suited for ccps visions for short range brawler the scorpion is fine and im not sure why they want to change it and the kitsune could use some love but oddly enough ccp seems to forget about that onesignal distortion amps are fine as they are i think  they do force ecm pilots to truly commit almost all of their ships slots to their ewar gimping their damage and tank but i feel that weakness justifies the strength of ecm modulesi may be a bit biased because i do fly ecm but i think people forget too easily that for every time you curse because a falcon pilot jams you theres another time when a jam fails and the falcon pilot can say bye bye to his ship ecm is an all or nothing effect and people focus too much on the all and forget about the nothing
i would like to thank you for your document on bounty hunting and you were one of the brightest stars in csm1 unless i see another candidate which i think better captures my desires for this game you have my vote good luck and kudos
does someone have a link to these proposed changes i havent seen them yet

extreme for csm  eve player since the beginning motivated good manand thats all that needs to be said fyi
my name is poopsock alarmclock and i approve of this message
reminds me of the beavers mom no not that beaver and not that one eitheroh stewardess i speak jive  cut me som slack jack chump don wan no help chumpdon git no help jive ass dude don got no brainsanyhow
not a bad name actually as it gives you a psychological monopoly on reason and allows you to effortlessly paint your opponents as unreasonable by default
considering how the csm has zero political power creating a political party makes equally zero senseits an advisory council its not that you can influence the game design in such a way that would give those you claim for yourself to represent any advantage or greater considerationthis thread here proves once again how much egomania the csm is made up of and how little actual reason is behind it
what eve needs is an antimetagaming party
i dont think thats a fair statement these folks get to meet ccp face to face and voice their opinions some of it is bound to sink in even if the devs are actively trying to ignore themtheres no way to sit down and have a beer with someone and have absolutely zero impact
except that a party makes for a stronger route to communicate important issues the reps and being able to ascertain actual interest in the issue and ultimately be able to quantify that interest in terms of numbers of individuals who are aligned with that party imo might actually foster better ideas coming out of here you let whatever party ya knowwhichever interest privately debatediscussrefine their ideasissues before they bring it to the attention of the whole of the community aside a party might have the creativity and incentive to actually foster involvement which i think everybody can agree is a good thingi get that an idea like this might not work but it certainly wouldnt cause any damage if it didnt
i should qualify thatas long as there is some selfcontrol exercised on the part of a leadership structure in this theoretical party no harm comes of this if it becomes some sort of lame vehicle for court packing it would be the suck

apologies for the delay in replying i was on a business tripi couldnt resist making the subject sound so outragous it sometimes is the only way to illicit a replymy point is communication csms yes you may well be working hard spending long meetings late into the small hours with ccp and feeling under appreciated by the inhabitants of eve but many threads seemed to be opened over and over again and the same questions answered because pilots did not know that you guys had already been on the case another thing if there are petitions threads and you know it is being looked into post a link to the thread if it is an issue that is not currently being looked at dont be afraid to post a reply even if you just sit on the fence look at the missile petition for instance  i cant see any csm response from thathoweveri see a new issues thread that has been stickied in assembly hall this is certainly a start in improving lines of communication i have just posted a link to the bombs issue to the stealth bomber petition in assembly hall finally the search engine that eveonline uses is absolutley rubbish it does not allow pilots to research issues that have been previously raised and probably doesnt help csms in their causegrz
give us proper player owned structures something that resembles and functions like a basic station in space and not disparate lagfest of the bits and pieces we currently have thank you
hell yeah i wanna see this
much 3 for chribba

for the love of god put this into the game ccpnaow
i seem to recall a ccp dev mentioning that the pos code is huge clearly a redesign would be a very large undertakingthat said they did write all that code in the first place so while a huge task it is a task they can manage else we would not even have pospos are clearly an integral part of eve now they are not some fringe thing a few players dabble in but rather a fundamental basis in the game for thousands of players and numerous corpsalliancesand that despite pos and by extension sov mechanics being horrendous i am sure ccp has a lot on their plate even so this is well worth an effort whatever changes may come this is absolutely money well spenteta as for csm it is their responsibility to bring this to the devs if the community demands it in sufficient strength i think the devs will understand that the csm is merely carrying out their mandate and not hold it against individual csm members that they are bringing something the devs already said no to the devs can of course say no again and be done with it but at least it sends the message to them that the playerbase keeps this particular issue high on their want list as any business it behooves them to pay attention to what their customers want whether they can deliver on it or not
signed
definitly not worth going for minmatar caps as it is
not supported its great entertainment as is and still a decent source of info is you care to do some shifting through the threads
ban goons
dont screw with the towers cpujust fix the launchers so they can work while a pos is reinforcedgive a bonus to cal towers that allows missile arrays to still work while the pos is reinforcedeither way supported
i guess that sounds pretty resonable
would fix the issue without screwing over genuine disconnects may want to change that to still disappearing after 15 minutes though theres nothing really wrong with the current 15min timer its avoiding that timer which is the issue
every turret is visible even if you cannot see the difference between t1 and t2 but even now with two types of launchers for every caldari combat ship we still cannot look at them to see what they are fittingis that a torpcruise ravenis that a hamheavy drakeis that a rocketstandard crowwho knowsi know thats a 1400mm fit tempesti also know that megathron has neutronsoh look at that beam zealotanybody else wish ccp would put a few guys onto designing some launcher models
why not supported
yeah ive always wanted to see missile launchers visually on shipsim all for it
you raise a good point with the bit about looking to see what the enemy is fitting also i want to see just how ridiculous cruise launchers would look on stealth bombers supported
the devs say the ships who have missile launcher hardpoints have the launcher thing on their modelsbut i want to see mah launchers turn around and spin and launch stuff
this is something thats bugged me too
supportedmissiles come out of the center of our ships or on a random spot it would be nice to see a launcher rise up on a ships hard points fire a rocket into an empty area of space then track down the target
supported i do know that the devs are aware of this however there are several technical things that need to be worked out before it can be implemented hopefully well see it done thoughisaac
surprisingly good suggestion gasp
yes good idea people will finally start laughing at me when i fit assault missile launchers on the drakein all seriousness it would only make sense if it was implemented
yes it is time to move the damn missile away from the broken spawning in the center i want visible missile launchers which launch missiles just like turrets have nowcaldari need love
id like to see this idea taken the whole way and have every module even the mid and lowslots and rig on a ship visually represented in some way
sorry lavista i knew you supported iti just saw it as we are all human and can sometimes forget so i was bumping it
supported right click repair would make the process much smoother
this needs more attention
im not an awox alt and i support this topic
forgot somethingi on the other hand am neither a topic or an awox alt but i do support this topic
im not an awox alt and i support this topicaditionally carriers should be capable of carrying
i am not a support and i topic this alt althurr durr
i am declining to support this topic on the general principle that it sounds like a one person 20 alts whine festnow if you can convince drake to support it ill reconsider my position but thats only because once mentioned that he was kind of sorta maybe starting to like my posts and i want to encourage that sort of thing
de  i already owe you a few drinks postambulation for some fantastic posts sides drake and i troll so much weve decided to form an alliance
yesan alliance of trolls cough not really a troll just bitter geeks who know too much for there own good but would rather scream instead of be polite for the assembly hallto arms
yea not an alt blah blah blah supported
when ccp nerfed carriers they did say they were going to make improvements at a later date
this is true for the whole skill queuenow we have the thing so id like to have it better also just having exactly the problem prerequ skill finishes in the night but i cannot inject the followup skill and append it to the queue so im carrying it around in the cargo bay its a cheap skill not worth to hunt me nowsupported
no support it does add to the lazy man effect this really shouldnt be too big an issue if your logging on semioften otherwise youll need to figure out a new skill to train isaac
a simple timer would be nice
simple change i support this
supported
supported this may also help with lag as people would not spam the dockjump button as much
simple useful addition for everyone

i support this its a good idea and i think it would make things easieredit for not clicking support
good stuff support
that would make things so much easier when knowing if you can gtfo or just die lol
previously one just had to anchor a can at the warpin point of a moon and it prevented someone from putting a pos there until the can was destroyed this mechanic was changed so that poss ignored anchored cans now it is common practice in highsec to anchor a tower at a moon and just keep it offline to reserve or sell the moon whereas previously with a can you could just destroy it with enough firepower without declaring war with pos towers offline you have to declare war on the owner before you can attack it to clear the moon to use i feel this mechanic is worse then with cans destroying a large faction tower in highsec from a corp in a huge empire alliance setup to make wars expensive is unfair for anyone who wants to use that mooni would like to see some kind of mechanic be introduced to prevent this kind of moon reserving to make it fair for others to come and use the moon if its not in use either make a tower unanchor after a period of time from being offline few weeks or allow people to shoot offline towers without being in war in highsec or some other method
sounds like more support for the idea of being able to hacksalvageunanchor offline towers  all good ideas
use a different moon if you dont want to blow up an offline tower
imho if your going to play stupid little jerk games like that anchoring offlined towers to lock moons you should be under penaltythe towers should be online and fueled to do thatif its offline you have 2436 hours or the tower self destructs along with all the other equipment if not become stealablesimpleefficient and forces people to be more active and not a bunch of lazy morons
if you look at 07 06 and 05 systems anywhere near jita youll find maaany with just offline towers most of which is just a tower no other modules finding a free moon anywhere near jita is nearly impossible thats where the issue lies there is no incentive to unanchor a tower if your not going to be running your pos because its so hard to get a moon just leave the tower offline the chances are someone will declare war and be able to blow it up isnt that great im just proposing some sorta incentive to not leave it offline like it will get blown up easieranother option would be to just make offline poss subject to the system trash cleanup so after a month they vanish that would also solve it if you dont online your pos for a whole month you deserve it to vanish imho
how about hiring mercs and let them blow up the offline poswouldnt that be possible
well sure but it seems to me that this is just defeating some of the purpose that allowing towers to ignore anchored cans did the idea then was to prevent moons from being reserved or tied up anchored cans have immense hp but so does a tower you just dont need to declare war to shoot a can
fun fact if a tower is offline you can use closerange gank bs and the only thing you have to worry about is if the corp shows up to defend itfurthermore there shouldnt be a stront timer because the tower is offline so you can do it in one go
true but you have to declare war to do so fairly expensive if the corp is in one of those 500 corp empire alliances that exist only to make wars expensive if you didnt have to declare war in highsec then i agree that would be a good solution but having to declare war to clear a moon seems excessive but maybe thats just me
ive even seen reserved moons in low sec so i can imagine how bad it is in high sec fix it
thumbs up from meperhaps changing the mechanic so anyone canunanchour a tower after it has been offline for something like 7 daysthis may also have a benefit to 00 sov war by enabling some kind of ability to siege locking the enemy logistics would become a strategic tool againzos
well this isnt really an issue for 00 since a single dread would tear up any offline pos but in highsec youre limited to battleships at most and you have to declare war for small corps and such declaring war on a big alliance just to get a moon in highsec that someone has forgot about isnt using or is just reserving seems a bit excessive when viewed against the game mechanics that was changed to prevent cans from holding a moon this just seems to be the same issue although the can now is more expensive but it makes it less likely someone would shoot it due to having to declare war
too bad your premise is completely wrong anchorable containers are protected as assets of the individualcorp and shooting them is the same as shooting anything else in possession of the player and that is will drop concord on you like a ton of bricks if the 250 mil it costs for you to dec the corp that dropped 200 mil to get the tower out there isnt worth your time to take it out then that is too bad
war dec hire mercs ask the corp in question to take their tower down find a free moon in a quiet area go to lowsec there are plenty of methods available unfortunately as most of them involve interaction with other people they are not suitable for some of the more extreme mouth breathing carebear elements of highsec
bumpulus
go pod some boggeril they drop banjos oh wait
two trains of thought come to mind when i see this ideai like it the concept of smokey bars in a station where the pilots gather to drink and play games of chance or hammer out deals in illlit back corners makes sense that and there are drugs in the game already which are pretty nasty so they do have the precedent for this already established the thing is that its all textbased at the moment not actually being seen done and i think that will be the difference people react badly to the concept of smoking and drug use and in ambulation it would be visible useage so i could see thier point if they dont include it because it might be seen as them saying smoking  drug use is cool still  i am an adult and i dont let videogames tell me what to do so i vote yes its a nasty nitty gritty space world and the ciggy hanging from the mouth as u play a game of cards in the seedy space station bar works for me
supported if only for the hilarity of smokefilled bars in jitarensdodoursoh hey zed o
should also add a nice selection of luxury food and drinks
epeen sure but theyre also the single best source of longrun intelligence about an enemy in the game if you want to know combat info about a pilot look up his killboard stats plus people like things like that  having a record ofm what they killed knowing what valuable faction mods could have dropped but didnt and this is still a game also watching pirates whine is just pathetic  nobody wants to see that
supported for exactly this reason
hey guys we just sank a battleship and the divers say it had 16 guns not 12 like we thought the americans caught a couple more a while back posted the info on kriegsmarineclinic told us they were kitted out the same you think maybe the germans upgunned their navy while we werent lookingnah lets just ignore it and assume things with no basis in fact instead gathering intel is like cheating righttheres a reason ive never uploaded a kill to a killboard and its because i dont want to advertise what i fly and what i fit if other people want to pass around their valuable information like beer at a frathouse kegger though im going to take advantage of it
id rather people just said yes or no to be honest people are using intel as a reason which is a bit funny tbh the poster above me used a real life example of how some divers could find more guns on an enemy ship surely it would be better to find out that info before the fight even happened which you are capable of in eve to think you could find out a ships fit from an explosion in space is also ridiculous lastly the above poster pointed out that you should not post your losses for all to see i have just looked on battleclinic and im showing 384 kills and 98 losses do you want to know how many of those i have actually posted the answer to that is 0 i have never posted one kill or loss on that site and yet my setups are there for not only my enemies to see but for anyone who cares to know they have not had to work hard at all to find this info out as i said earlier this info is for epeen and nothing else
no killmails are fine just ignore em if you hate themthere simple enoughisaac
hate double posts
i say just yes and no when the debate is selfexplanatory this one isnt and so i explain dude scifi game you dont watch the pretty explosion you send a probe out to pick through the wreckage and figure out what blew up thing is thats so automatic that they dont even ask you thats the sort of crap your bridge crew does they just sent you the mail through concord as a joke  given how often we kill our crews they need a laugh every now and then more seriously there are two parties in every kill both will reasonably speaking know what happened in the fight if one publicizes it and the other keeps it secret well its still public again ill pull out the ww2 analogiesbeen playing too much hearts of iron lately  there were a whole lot of real historical battles where one side publicized the results and the other didnt of course those featured a lot more lying and forcible repression of data than eve does but the point still stands  if the japanese dont want to talk about midway because they screwed up but the americans trumpet their monumental victory then the germans read the battle report and still get a pretty good idea of what happened theyll certainly know if the americans start talking about how one particular spot of armour is thin that they should probably aim for that spot if they ever start fighting japan the japanese dont like it much but they dont have a whole lot of control over it your opponents are posting their combat experiences for the world to see and for better or worse youre in it like i said above if they want to pass out valuable information for free they can do that you dont i dont but others do and theres no sensible way we can stop them from doing so either in the context of the universe or the context of the game um i just gave a concrete example of something else its used for and you agreed with my claim
leave my kill mails alone some of us like stats go f off
its a pvp game killmails are how combat pilots keep score scores are kept in every game if anything eve doesnt have enough combat statistics stats are fun i love the stats in games such as battlefield and i am not that great at that game
thw killmails are not only matter of epeen but also tells you who in your corp is not so good in pvp and how you can help him to get better and the information getting form enemy killmail is very valuble information in terms of setup location and playing time
worst idea since greedo shooting first
now now lets not say things we cant take back
tldr not just no but hell nolonger versionwhile i can certainly understand the frustration of some players myself included at the protections that npc corps provide to those who arent deserving of those protections salvage thieves macro miners etc the fact of the matter is theres no real reason to force players out of themsome players again myself included really just want to be left the hell alone i chose to leave an npc corp because frankly i got tired of being bothered by all the stupid people in the corporate chat channel i joined a small corporation so i could in fact be left more alone than i was before sure i can be wardecd now but im willing to risk that to have more control over whos on the party line they call corp chatother players genuinely enjoy the huge player base in the npc corp they like helping out newer players teaching them the ropes of the game helping them choose a path what have you and thats a lot easier to do in terms of communication if you happen to be in the same corpfinally some players are just plain lazy its not that they like being in an npc corp  they just dont want to go through the effort of finding a new onethe point is none of these people should be forced out of an npc corp just because you dont think they should be allowed to stay there
some of it is some of it isnt for example you cant help out new players in corp chat if youre in a oneman and more to the point youre forced into being wardecable  sort of the point of this whole endeavour  which is one thing a lot of players will find very distasteful ive known several people who have complained that they cant stay in a player corp for a month without getting decced and that will drive people away pretty severely also ive never set up a corp myself but doesnt it require some amount of skill andor isk i know its not the month and a billion alliancemaking takes but its more effort than a lot of people will want to put inyou also still havent addressed the problem of having a corp with thousands of incoherent undefended members that can be wardecced im sure the privateers will love you but seriously it is a gaping flaw in your proposal because at present youre not advocating vulnerability youre advocating mass suicide
i kind a like this ideai support
would you like a box of tissues with thatall i see is a pathetic whelp of a pilot who will not read who will not think and who will not do researchall he does is answer arguments made by very intelligent pilots with stupid lame assed excuses and in total denial of realitydo i troll that oh hell yes
drake i love you but you troll everything
what can i say im your evil twin brother
normally i would vote yes on such a thing but ever since the 94 skill nerf to new characters i now have to say no
for the 100th time in the 100th thread that is merely resaying the same thing for the 100th timeno
no thanks you shouldent have to force players to experience the game its a little bit rude and will not win any long term subscribersthe noob corps should be there to filter out those who dont want to play cooperativally they will either discover that coop play is more rewarding or they will abandon the game eventually to set a time limit on this is as mentioned rude
in short exactly the same thing thats been proposed 1000 times before and rejected by everyone force players out of npc corps into a decable own corp if they want to or notso we can shoot the crap out of the newbees but just dont want to say that out loudand again the answer everybody gives is the same as the previous 1000 times no thankseditthe only way i could see something like this happening is with some kind of conscious decision from the player in question for instance and this is just an example you can not train t2 skills while in a nondecale corporation or return to one if you have them join a decable npc or player corpyou want to fly andor use t2 you take the decision and face the music or guns something like that but it has to be left up to the player and be a decent level skill or skillgroup
not supportedif they cant stay in these corps most will just quit which would be bad for ccp and worse for you they are your ingame customers who else buys all the faction crapedit when it comes to highsec alts you may have a point
tldr  thread
what possible reason could mission farmers  macro miners  all the other people who would be the main target of war decs have for leaving the complete safety of npc corps
ah gee lets think about that hmmme scratches beardwell uh how about the ability to use posscorp hangerteamwork larger gangsfleetswow i guess that was so hard for you to figure out musta hurt like hellglad i could be of help
95 tax
yes because that will clearly force all the miners into player corps
each races ewar compliments their tactics except for caldari here i draw out new caldari ewar that more closely follows the pattern of the other racesrace tacticprimary longrange ewar generally used by only one racesecondary shortrange ewar often used by all racesamarr big slow laser shipsprimary tracking disruptor  decrease tracking on gallente and minmatar gunboatssecondary nosneuts  bomb capacitor for speed ships and active tanksminmatar fast ships and gunboatsprimary target painter  increase signature on targetssecondary webs  tackling from speed shipsgallente close range blasters drone boatsprimary rsd  restricts engagement rangesecondary warp disruption  forces engagementso the goal here is to model caldari ewar off of the other races pattern but tool them to benefit caldari engagement tacticscaldari long range rails and missilesproposed primary range dependent ecm  higher strength close up forces long range engagements where caldari ships have an advantage redesign the mechanic to look more like periodic focused bursts where the frequency of instantaneously breaking locks depends on the strength of the jam rather than the current chancebased timersproposed secondary inertia field  a new ewar module that decreases ship agility could be used to catch ships out of alignment and force tight orbits out to longer distances and subsequently a lower transversalboth effects give an advantage to rangeindependent missile systems and longerranged slowertracking railgunsedit bumping mechanic needs to be changed if inertia field is to be implemented too powerful side by side
supported if only for the hilarity of inertia fielding autopiloting freighters
only if bumping is nerfed completelyotherwise not supported
how so its a little vague and i dont see the connection to ewar
bumping is the current tactic for preventing a ship from aligningif your going to make a module that nerfs your agility which slows your ships ability to align then bumping is nothing more than pure greifing compounded by this moduleyou cant have it both wayspeople wont use the module by default because bumping does the same jobbut those who have the module will bump and jam the agility of a shipbalance mechanics would make it an utter nightmareso in short bumping goes or your ewar idea goesnot both
ok i see where youre coming from the inertia field is more of a tactic for slow long range ships  mostly as an antiinterceptor module that counters fast tight orbits by reducing agility possibly forcing closerange ships outside their optimal rangesusing the module to slow aligntimes is a secondary tactic  but i see how it can be a huge bumping buff if bumping were changed so ships didnt spin around in different directions that would fix the issue good catch though thanksedit also the inertia field isnt nearly as important as the change in ecm mechanicsedit2 yes i think bumping ought to be removed completely the inertia field is a more consistent mechanic for slowing align times
im stunned a goon who dosent act like a goonnicely stated chapill keep an eye out for yah
drake raises a good point but its ultimately minor the overall proposal here of making caldari ew fit into racial tactics instead of just being a win button is a good one i think that the issue of range can be solved by dropping optimal increasing falloff and maybe upping strength a little which would make it a weapon for shortrange engagement denialso that they have to fight at long range to get around the jams instead of long range pwnage thats dangerous  at least the strengthincreasing part  but something along those lines might be justifiable and that seems to be what the devs are thinking broadly right now in a similar vein rsd ranges need to go way up  you cant deny a longrange fight if your ew cant hit at long range yes this means that the ew range is exactly inverted from the range on the rest of the racial stuff but thats actually kind of appropriate on the whole as for the inertia field suggestion its interesting but i wonder whether itd actually see use or just feel like a waste of a module i suppose if it was like 90 or something crazy itd see use but its not a very powerful effect in most contexts and i dont think it really does what you want it to do in terms of caldari racial tactics pushing ranges out from 5 km to 10 and even then only if the enemy is trying to orbit is not the sort of thing that a rokh is desperately looking for when a blaster mega jumps him if you want to give caldari a secondary consider smartbombs its a bit weird and im not sure itd work but theyre shortrange weapons that make quick work of drones which makes them a nearperfect weapon against the racial enemy or perhaps in a similar vein make ecm burst a whole lot better especially against drones again not sure if itd work but as theorymongering goes it seems like a decent enough starting point
id have to disagree with this as being fundamentally wrong tactics wise most ships that can lock you in time to use the inertia field on you can easily drop a point on you negating the necessity of bumping your ship around while i do agree that bumping is a craptacular tactic i dont think in correlation someone is going to use an inertial field instead of a point to keep you pinned down via bumping instead of just actually pointing you most close range ships wouldnt need the module and most long range ships wont want to be close enough to bump you anyways i truly think this idea has merit
interesting and well thought idea however i agree with drake remove bumping before we let this in isaac
yes unless theyre a supercapital sitting on a station sitting on a gate or sitting on a pos shield escape is not always accomplished via warp
most supercapitals use cyno jumping as their means of escape for which bumping would have no effect
even if it is little bit older thread i think it would be very useful as some people blocklist contains hundreds of blocked people due ot the recruitment channel jita scams etc it would be very nice feature to be able to export and import the blocklist
where do i sign for my wtfpwnships
i do see what you are suggesting however all ships are not intended to pointthere are obviously some ships designed to tackle those get the primary secondry tertiary points then whatever others in fleet should simply spread them aound the larger the fleet engagment the longer it will last and the more targets your tacklers will rotate through to keep the victim ships held downanother issue here is that essentially you are giving every ship an extra mid the balance of ships ability to tank etc could be seriously upsetthumbs down from me sorryzos
lol that was only a suggestion  i dare say the penalties should be significantly stiffer my point was the op didnt mention penalties at all that i noticed
maybe shield tankers should get the residual boost this would give as it stands now fcs rofl at the thought of someone bringing a shield tanker to battles i myself have heard on numerous occasions shield tanker lol let him die as it stands pvp is almost solely the realm of armor tankersone of the main reasons behind this suggestion is to help bring back 1v1 small gang engagements and add some flavor to them one on ones are hard to find and when you do its usually the same ships this would add more variety to your engagements  bigger box o chocolates if you willyes i did 300 calibration severly limits your further rigging options plus i have provided possible options for further penalties a couple posts ago
my amarr af alt would love any of these ideas 1 extra midslot would be happiness
supported but only if the rig 1 gimps your cpupg 2 gimps your resists and 3 is cheap and easy to produce oh and one for the low slot would be interesting too of course the 8slot limit should still applybut as someone had said the shield tanking for fleets would finally be as viable as armor with this implemented
ok before i say this i want to say i do not have this skill trained ofc this was a critical skill for probers before the update if it was all about time but now whats the point of this skilltrained to lv 5 which would take around 1820 days would reduce your scan time of each scan bywait for it5 secondsthis skill got no love from ccp with the new update lol oh and the worse thing of it is that this skill does not even open up any other skills or mods at any level again ccp where is the lovewhat i suggest for this skill is to increase the warp speed of probes by a large amount if ccp insist on keeping this skills benefit time based then why not 5 seconds off each scan is no incentive imo then again maybe this is another one of those skill that is intended to go to the skill grave yardso i say increase the warp speed of probes by 20 per level as well and the 20 to scan speed i think this would encourage the training of itmaybe
i didnt do probing before the changes but my understanding is that it was nothing special then either and as it is given normal probe warp times training it to 5 reduces your scan time by about 25 remember its not 5 seconds its closer to a minute for an average scanningout since you have to do a dozen scansroughly to find what youre looking for probably not worth training to 5 but its hardly unique in that regard  weve already got 28 weapon specialization skills that fit that bill whats one more train it to 4 and be happy
its useful i see no problems with this skill if your truly serious about scanning youll do it to five if your not you wont no supportisaac
supported the change really made this skill pointless at least i only trained it to level 4

hey hey just a simple request really could there be a new forum specifically for wormhole and all things sleeper with the addition of epic arcs yet to be seen the missions forum is becomming very cluttered wormholescosmoscomplexesepic arcsgeneral npc etc i feel that the community would benefit from a more specific wormhole forum if you look in the mission forum its littered with wh threads and the mission ones and the epic arc ones drop rapidly off the page with the influx of the retail players and generally new players it would be beneficial to seperate the two many thanksmikal dreyshattered crystal  the best place for all your online codes
nothing against itso why the  not p
i dont read missions and complexes much but what it sounds like is that youre being flooded in fotm threads which will die down fairly soon even if wormholes remain popular mechanicdiscovery threads will go away as will a lot of the okay how does this work threads i expect itll settle down within a month or so if its still flooded with threadson one topic that bump all the otehrs down then i might support this but for now id prefer to wait and see
revert the race you mean i hear from old vets that caldari boats used to be excellent pvp ships a continuous digression from torpedos that can strike at 100km to battleships speed tanking cruise missiles i still have a raven in my hangar though it looks mean so long as it isnt shooting at anything
too bad naomis bloodline is khanidamarr not caldari
 was drunk i apologize
thanks definately needed in some form and thanks
im sure its a good starting point but the entire alliance structure needs to be made more efficientas it stands an alliance is not its own identity when it comes to contractcorporateinsurance payouts and this really needs to be addressedthe idea of alliance roles with of course the ability to decide who has these roles for how long and when would enable alliances to further their member corporations ability and reach by allowing clear lines of what is alliance assets and what is corp assets of course there would still be arguements but it should be a lot more black and white as to who personalcorpalliance owns what anything in game from a shuttle to the bpo capital set and who can interact with items stored at an alliance officethe suggestions are a good start but there needs to be more emphasis on the identity and ownership at the alliance level so you have my support for what its worth
then what exactly would constitute proof for you any evidence regarding the punishment of a ccp employee in regards to a game which is the intellectual property of ccp will amazingly enough have to come from ccp and any communication with the public from ccp is going to be pr thats public relations so therefore any evidence that comes from them will be disregarded by you according to your own arguments therefore wheres the point in arguing with you when you are going to deny proof when you see itseriously take yourself outside learn some logic then come back and argue i dont know if lavista is right or not but you are an idiot
and just how do you know they are even thereall this mumbo jumbo and conspiracy crap no evidenceno proofme dons tinfoil hatseriously you people are making me laugh so hardits hilarious
hah this is too funnya list of all my alts is publicly available on the forumi dont post with alts i believe in what i say and ill happily smack somebody on their forehead if they are being too stupid without using an alt
so because ccp actively engages in conversation with us about key issueswhich we of course cant publish or talk about we are by definition uselesssorry your logic is fundamentally flawed its nothing but circular reasoning
technicalities differs from game to game i was gm game master in a game where i only had access to commands to unstuck players invisibility teleport around etc only the developers were able to alter stats and spawn items and npcs ie a higher grade gms i wasnt aware that eve was at such low level that belowgms can spawn items thats remarkablehint thats sarcasm try see the pointim merely showing ccps behaviour a pattern that is the key to my whole proposal and not discussing the case in hand i made an effort to really point out that i tried to post it as neutral as possibleif you have to know i supported the ghost training changes its posted in those threads go read if you wantit was marketed to include a game time card the box says 60 day game time as well as advanced career guide which in the box is constantly referring to the online guide that already exist and a vip pass which is a pamphlet with info of how to use the buddy program on this site as well as a special edition shipyou could argue that the guide and vip pass is delivered as promised the game time card and ship however isnt as theyre tied to each other you have to use the gtc on a fresh account to get the ship and you cant even use a buddy program invite ie fresh account use the gtc for this thus circumventing the free trial ie effectively a loss of parts of the 60d timeso basicly you have no freedom to chose how to use the gtc technically the things are delivered but the text the communication to the customer is a workaround buy 2 and get 3rd for free but the first two had their prices upgraded so essentially you pay for 4 technically correct horribly customer communication and treatment you dont get what the box implies that it deliversagain the key here is to show ccps behaviourcommunication towards customersyou are being silly and didnt read my post the situation in itself is not the issue im arguing ccps behaviour its very simple read the rules for name changes its clearly stated noone will get a name change unless the name is offensive etc i didnt ignore the case that a single gm might be behind this its perfectly in line with what i posted  poor customer communication from ccp rogue or inexperienced gms that should be subject to proper informationintroduction the company are responsible for their employees they are responsible for their eduction and behaviourspace adding up posting the other replies in following post 
i didnt read the nyt article about the csm fyi at the time of the t20 incident i was very curious to follow how ccp would treat this case in the game where i was gm we had multiple situations where gms of higherlower levels were involved in several situations similar to thismy interest here was not only as a player regarding game balance i know thats a subjective thing the case i followed here was to see how ccp would try solve this again ill try avoid discussing the cases itself so lets get to the red line that goes through all the things i presented here ccps communication with their customersplayersin light of the t20 incident ccp promised us an internal affairs division as well as the csm to add transparency i remember very little else of what was promised back then but i know thats the exact key phrase they used regarding csm transparency csm was supposed to deliver players an insight and control mechanism to see that ccp did their best to avoid another t20the rest is an afterconstruction im pretty sure both you and me see why ccp wanted a solution came up with this cool idea and then let it get its own life and develop its the exact same approach they do to eve which is part of why its a successful game however while this is innovative when creating a game its horrible for customer relations as its a 100 certain that the promised product will never be delivered since it has its own life evolve and changecsm has run its course its about to shut it down it never got off to do what it was supposed to and it evolved into something that isnt neededperhaps if you instead of trying to find arguments on the particular cases but instead reading the whole picture that is provided  the red linetheme going through then youd see what the post was abouti admit it was a bit long but i clearly made an effort not to discuss the single cases the details in them isnt interesting whats interesting is how ccp respond to it the rest would just be arguing semantics back and forth and noone would ever be right since its a matter of opinionswhats interesting is to see how ccp however really could use some help on how to address big changes to their customers and how csm is doing little of significance being virtually useless and throwing away money that could be better spentthats what this post is about

and political parties make csm politics much more interesting lets not forget im still concerned that by having a carebear party youll end up with innately restrictive practices being forced on the csm to give to ccp  remove meta 0 loot from missionsrats would harm the isk supply of independent missionrunners at the expense of t1 manufacturers for example and therefore make private enterprise that much harder again i am all for a party that campaigns for private enterprise sandbox gameplay and other liberal values
due all respect i think that important aspects to the issue in question is being ignored in your argumenttheres many aspects which has to be considered when we discuss that very issue1 do missionrunners make enough isk2 should they make lessthe whole idea is that t1 manufacturing is not worth it because of the abundance that comes from lootif the carebear party is made up by smart people like issler then im certain that it wont end up with innately restrictive practices
this is my point i have nothing against advocacy groups but when you say things like i think the party could make its goal to maintain the freedom to enjoy eve with the widest variety of styles of play youre obviously misrepresenting the truth of the situation your goal is not to defend a variety of styles of play its to represent one style of play theres nothing wrong with that but please be honest with yourself also the reason nobody cares yet is that we still have a week before nominations even close we have more serious declared candidates in the race now than we did at this point last time my understanding of the reasoning for this party is improved voter relations not improved ccp lobbying it doesnt require the csm to have a huge amount of power for it to be effective in that role
doc all due respect but attempting to defeat a fundamentally good idea such as reliable representation for at least a moderately sized portion of the player base by putting an idea into their mouths and then playing kick the can with it is hardly a fair litmus test as to whether there would be any value in creating a partyespecially when i would think with the proper leadershipyour average so called carebear will be infinitely better armed with information and guidance thus producing infinitely more realistic and constructive issues hershi dont get it spell it out for me seeing as the basics of carebearism seems to be leave me alone im trying to build a sand castle here its highly unlikely that their interests will otherwise disrupt anybody elses gameunless of course somebody elses game is harassing people who just want to do their own thing with some friendsat which pointho hum advocacy works everybody wins
how left alone should they be though theres a lot of bearish miners out there who think that canflipping mechanics are fundamentally broken for example  leaving them alone is possible but itd negatively impact the gameplay of the flippers or a bit more to the point look at ankhs campaign to nerf suicide ganking in csm 1  a carebear csmerdont let the fw stats fool you who used her position to launch a direct attack at a pvp career choice and succeeded now im not saying that her position was wrong  on the contrary i largely agreed with it  but it was a bears argument that did negatively impact other people remember the old chestnut about this being eve online and not hello kitty online  harassment is a perfectly normal and acceptable part of eves gameplay yes it can be tweaked up or down but those harassers are playing eve too and their choice of sand castle to buildin this case one of delicious salty tears and the occasional loot drop is just as legitimate as yours the two do come into conflict sometimes and that has to be acknowledged
great hop back into those trees so hopefully we can all miss the forestlook im not here to debate what the appropriate can flipping mechanic is nor do i at this point maintain any opinion on exactly how left alone folks should be in high sec when theyre mining nor to even judge a definition of left alone its overly detailed and not pertinent to the discussion its probably an argument thats been had here a thousand times and with bringing it up as a universal straw man it will probably be had a thousand times more whats actually being talked about here is what if any value might their be to creating a streamlined point for players of similar ilk to constructively provide their interests to one or more csm members save your can flipping stuff for whenif this theoretical organization materializes and whenif they even bring this up in their internal discussions and whenif they decide to bring it to the attention of the general community
actually i want to make sure i understand whats being said here hershyoure not suggesting that jetcanners herein potential victims dont have a right to as much vocal and meaningful advocacy as the flippers do righti dont think thats what youre saying but i want to be sure
um its already hard enough to get players out into low sec you want to make that even harder

signedwhy because through all the posts i havent seen anyone in ccp put their hand up and say ill take a look and give reasons why it cantwont be done other than because it cant
you are mistaken the main reason ccp said they wont do it is because  it is too hard i am serious it is because it will be a big project they feel they can not do this so they can do stuff but not when it is hard
signed i agree the current poss dont look realistic a bunch of modules floating in space around a tower just doesnt look realistic at the very least have the modules connect together in a streamlined way how it would be if we were able to leave ship and walk around the pos even though we know this will never happen

instead of capsecond t2 long range ammo should give a bonus to caprecharge its not a lot to ask since most fleet bs lack exactly that  cap and also because there is already the lowdamage of long range ammos and gimped tracking so that kind of small bonus would make it more usableperhaps the tracking of short range lazerblastermissileexpl velocity here should be looked into as wellor some sort of other bonus or something would certainly be a nice addition to t2 ammo
cant support this topic as its unclear what is being asked fori would definitely support a buff for shortrange t2 ammo  the reason its so cheap is not because its easy to produce  its bacause there is no demand due to the fact that it has crippling drawbacks for no noticable benefit  as it stands if youre using void  hail etc youre doing something wrongi would not support nerf of faction ammo however  and since that is a concievable inference of the thread title i cant support it
another additional note is that you could potentially add an option to allow current customers through the shield this would avoid having to hand out passwords and deal with the constant rerequests for forgotten passwords
good idea but i dont think it will happen in this formi would rather see a silo system employed everything goes into and out of the silothe corporation can still anchor silos inside cause they own the pos but the old rules applybut for non corp membersthe only way to prevent abuse would be to have the silos anchored outside of the shieldsthe person who wants to rent anchors there silo and agrees to a connection charge to the research platformso the silo would be owned by a person not a corpthis way protects the researcher and is a much simpler method you simply pay for the connection charge when you insert a job and you get disconnected when it is completeand as far as all those silos you could make a research beacon of grid from the pos so you anchor the beacon and everyone who wants to rent goes to the beacon and anchors the silo there ccp can even limit the number of anchored silosand for those that want to spam have a count down say 15 days after your job ends your silo gets unanchored if you dont que a new job so you forget about your silo and someone can steal itof course you would never employ this system in lowsec or 00 but then again why would you even want too so yes you are on the right track but no to your current implementation
i dont see how the researcher having to haul and anchor a structure one that is unprotected outside the bubble is better for the researcher the same amount of effort would still be required on the billing side for your connection fee as a simple locker rent would be only this allows the pos owner to control placementoptions better what risk do you see the researcher having under my storage array idea and how would them using their own facility unprotected connected to the owners pos be any better
i support this not because its a good idea but because it is silly also the inevitable ragefest that would ensue would be great to watch
voting in support as many have said chribba has done way more for eveonline than the average player and things of this magnitude are acceptable i believe since it will really have no effect on the supply of veld or the game mechanics just like the veldnaught this will be a shiny toy for people to ooo and ahh over and thats not a bad thing

giving the naglfar an extra mid and a cpu  cap boost doesnt stop it from being a steaming pile of  i needs significantly more damage on top of not being made of paper

wormhole space was an amazing proof of concept which show that the dynamics of the absence of local is both interesting and fun lets take the next step and bring it to known space
no
ill say the same thing ive said a hundred other times if system scanning tools are developed to the point where local is unnecessary then i favour the abolitionwell delayed modeing of local local is a stopgap intel tool and it wouldnt be used like it is under a sufficiently improved system that said given that those scanning tools do not yet exist trying to extend this to known space is premature its fine for the funky space to be genuinely hard to find people in but not for the real world
i agree with yamamotosan
i support delayed local in all 00 space
no just nonull sec alliances get enough people raiding their space local makes it possible to defend against them
more risk in 00 would be great in my book
simply no what would this change exactly so you know the numbers of your enemy so what he knows your numbers too just leave 00 the way it is
one thing for certain local nerf would be a serious deterrent to chinese farmer operations in 00right now they occur on massive scale
wait wutso no more claiming 100 systems that you really dont have the resources to defendno more instablob because of a local spike thus encouraging smallscale pvp with roaming patrol gangsrequire active attentiveness to those allainces while operating in lawless spacegod yes this is horrible
the ability to know i am in a system whether i have been seen or scanned is whats kept me out of 00 for the most part sorry but this is a needed addition you shouldnt show up on a local cortex unless you choose to say somethinguse your combat scanners and kill the localspy
great idea we need more mission farmer alts and i need some free kills for my cloaking gangs
i support this ideaon the conditions that1 we get scanning tools that make local unneeded in 00 2 local stays in lowsec and npc00 but in delayed mode you only show up 30 seconds after you jumped into system or when you start moving3 hisec no change at alldoh forgot to klick the support iconerem
1 autoupdating scanner ui maybe a miniui might be nice2 no3 sure
nowhybecause in normal space entry and exit to the system is governed by jump gates which broadcast the info on a systemwide basis which is why you can gank someone somewhere fly to another gate and still be denied permission to jump until your aggro is clearthis information is available to all ships within the sphere of influence of those gates hence jumping into system leads to your appearance in localwspace is accessed through unstable fractures that are not connected to any technological equipment that will broadcast this information  this is why you only see another player when they open comms by talking you probe them out scan them down or get visual contact on the same gridthe only time i would support ships being able to jump into regular space and not appear in local is covert opsclass ships that enter via covert cynosural field ie if they enter via jump gate they appear in local
only with suitable scanning substitutes ccp has made good progress in improving scanning but its not ready to replace local yetthat said im going to support this because i want to see what ccp can come up with
yes lets buff solosmall gang roaming thanks
this
by that logic anyone that enters through a wormhole shouldnt show up either i still support 100 delayed mode in local in 00 its a lot of fun in wspace picking up a ship on scan that wasnt there before and trying to figure out if its friend or foe and wondering if theyve spotted you it also seems to benefithinder pveers and pvpers about the same
funny because when you jump from wspace to kspace you instantly appear on local
the simplest solution would be to make it so that you never show up on the communications channel unless you say something periodits a communications tool not an intel tool it only became that i suppose out of ccps negligence the most logical system for highsec lowsec 00 and wormhole space is that you never show up on a communication network unless you fraking communicate any other system is ed does this need to be implemented with boosted ship scanners yes but it still needs to be universal  adding a second support

sweet free drinks count me in
but does it come with cheese
im not an awox alt and i support this topic
first a bit of a preface according to my source dss probes were supposed to have a starting strength of 5 instead of 20 and someone goofed fine however i also learned from that same source that when you run a scan with probes it only returns the four best results for any given result i confirmed this by using 4 6 and 8 dss probes around a site that i had scanned down and bookmarked via other means the results while consistent with this information were maddening at minimum scan range with 11 strength on the probes after skills ship and rigs the sigs maximum accuracy was slightly less than 25 it remained at that for all three scenarios furthermore i took the painstaking time to arrange the probes in tetrahedral with 4 octahedral with 6 and dodecahedral with 8 configurations providing the greatest possible quadrangulation even at 32 au  enough to cover the whole system from each side in four directions  the signatures in the system bounced around like a ping pong ball so the probes inherent accuracy has been severely hampered by the 75 drop in strength i believe i referred to it as a nerfbat to the ballsmy main issue is not the strength of the probes though it was nice while it lasted but the fact that only 4 results are used no scientist in their right mind would ever think to just toss out extra data points however precise they may or may not be so long as they referred to the same general area or range when were talking about probes each probe knows approximately how far away an object is within a given error using only 4 results does indeed give you a point result but if youre able to add more scans from different directions to resolve the error hypothetically you could eliminate the error almost entirely if you simply quadrangulated from many directions the result might not be perfect but it would be fairly accurate and you could move the probes closer to the result to give a perfect hitin short all i request is that every probe that a player can control be able to be used in the determination of a given signatures position not simply the four best also a base strength of 10 wouldnt hurt since these probes are supposed to be highly advanced and do require astrometrics 5 however the first half of the proposal is the most important
argh clearly i do support my own topicyarrsticks
it sucks that additional probes beyond 4 does nothing to improve the signal
this whole probing system is designed around stepping everything down by a factor of 2 each time until you hit 100 deep space probes just let you start 3 steps higher which is useless in small systems and necessary in large ones personally i thought the prenerf deep space probes were a great reason to go for astrometrics 5 which i likely wont bother with now but it does fundamentally make more sense you shouldnt be able to achieve final scan results with deep space probes you should need to swap down to something with better resolution as for your point about the four best ill say two things one youre clearly in the hard sciences because the soft sciences seem half the time to be all about throwing out data points to make the world fit the modeli dont mean that badly  you simply cannot analyze broad trends in a field like history or economics without making subjective decisions on what counts as a legitimate data point secondly while triangulation is a hard science in the real world its a game mechanic in eve the added probes protect you from deviation and give you significantly better results on the whole but they want lowskill characters not to be too badly disadvantaged under this system and so they capped the number of probes that contribute directly it may not make physical sensealthough to be fair it may  the data coming from these probes is obviously incredibly loose at higher ranges which you can see as you watch probes jump around by multiple au between scans and throwing out data may sometimes be reasonable but it makes gameplay sense and thats 95 of what ccp cares about
i think the issue is more profound than the op has itas noted in this thread in the game development forum deep space probes dsps are no better than core probes apart from a greater probe range and they warp faster and reallythe warp faster thing is not a big deal at all the greater probe range is hardly useful at all as the 32au on the core is plenty most times simply use more to cover a bigger system if necessarya trivial task indeed the core probes are actually better since they can narrow the scan range down more than dsps at the same range they are the same strengthso you train a 14ish day skill to l5 for what more expensive probes that take up more room in your cargo holdto make matters worse apparently the sisters deep space probe is now precisely the same as the normal dsp or so others have suggestedi have not checkedas probing existed before the nerf it was a hassle to find what you were looking for in a system since the game nicely forgets all your previous results on each new scan however the dsps made it somewhat tolerable as they were now it has become a hell of probing down everything to exceptional accuracy and pinning it and then doing that again and again boring and tedious barely cover it timesink understates it nightmare is closer to the markit seemed one of the main issues with dsps as they were was they were very overpowered when finding player ships no question that needed a nerf rather than a nerf though one which would have reasonably made dsps not good at probing for ships but kept their probing of signatures useful we get this hamfisted hatchet jobtruly looking at the issues of gutting a l5 skill so it is worthless to train and making the better probes literally no better than their lesser counterparts and to toss the whole need for an expanded launcher is nothing short of astonishing csm please ask ccp for their thoughts on this one soon at least give the players a sense if this is exactly how ccp envisioned this or if they what i am hoping merely gutted the probes as a very short term fix to avoid the ship probing imbalance on those and mean to provide a more balanced version soon and not trademarked soon but actual honest to god soon
i bolded the part you missed theres no concord response in 00 space
unless empty moons are so hard to find im not sure why people are concerned about it what is the main reason for a hi sec pos a research lab if so why do you have to be close to a market hub to set your pos up at
concord really should not protect offline pos
agreed i would prefer the unanchoring method myselfi would say 15 days and your tower gets unanchoredmaybe a week but no less then thatoh i also like the idea of no concord for offline possso both your pos goes offline it is considered space junk after 24 hours and someone can take it outor they can wait for it to unanchor in the 7 to 15 day period and take it all
you seemed to miss the part where she said that she cant shoot their towers without a war so were obviously not talking anything but high sec towers
again if the tower is offline for 24 hoursno more than 36it self destructs or becomes steal ableyou people who ask for 1 week or more your just making the problem worsethe idea is to only hold moons your actively fueling for not squatting them like a bunch of jackassesif you want the moon that bad fuel the damn towerotherwise leave
well rl comes into it unfortunately and that is why i say 24 hour and it can be destroyed and then one week and it can be stolen i really dont like the idea of it just self destructing that is too easy and not evethat does not create a problem cause if you want the moon that bad then destroy itif not then wait the time and see if you can steal it and make a profit
how bout if somebody else wants the moon that badly they kill your tower as youve obviously invested more time and money into that moon at that point than they have and working for rewards is what eve is about
rl is a poor excuseposs should be employed by people who can use them that means a corpyou get a partner to help outend of discussionalso read my damn post i said stealable as an option as opposed to self destructingit is perfectly logical and feasible considering the nature of eveyou leave a can out there in space and its open to the world what do you expectits gonna get tippedposs are a a rampant problem stop making excuses that favor the problem and come up with solutions that are rational1 week is too long and that would mean anyone could fuel it for a singular day and wait a weekat least with 2436 hoursif you snooze you lose
grumbles  stupid eve forums glitch
i am not disagreeing with you i am saying both options24 hours you can destroy it you will have to work to get that moonand 1 week is becomes unanchored and can just be picked up and stolendo you consider this an unreasonable option for a free 100 million to 11 billion isk pos 
the problem with your logic as ive already said people can exploit thatmost wont know that the pos is offline until they start looking aroundby allowing it to stay there for 1 week they can refuel it and bring it back onlineand allow them to destroy it implies a number of problems does this mean they have to wardec the corpjust allowing anyone to destroy the pos is not what i call a good idea its a can of worms at bestdoes the owner get aggro to fire backtoo many holes therethere needs to be a stern mechanic here either you maintain your pos or it gets turned into space garbage or robbedyou can suggest all you want as far as solutions go but 1 week is too long imofew months ago i would agree but now so many people want in on that territory its utterly insane today
edited for correctionsagreed offline poses should after a certain period of time become legally fair game for anyone to either shoot at or appropriate no one should be reserving moons that they cant usefrom what i can see poses near hisec are primarily used for moon mining because thats where the money is valuable moons shouldnt be beaugarded if theyre not being used unused poses are not uncommon it can be hard to find unoccupied moons of enough worth to justify fueling them in some areas and naturally corps will find it preferable to erect poses as close to civilization which makes unused poses very frustratingnow i do think that a corp in this situation is currently welladvised to simply relocate to a less convenient part of space but it seems silly to me that moons can be reserved in this way and often forgotten about
i would say yes the corp can defend its posand you should be able to defend yourselfhmm a can a worms yes but i think maybe it could provide something interesting  the same timesay corp a lets there pos run out of fuelcorp b comes in and starts taking it out after the 24 hour timer comes in to playcorp a comes in to defendwhen corp a fires  corp b a instant war dec starts for 24 hoursboth sides can open up on each other to fight over the moonthe price for letting the pos run out of fuel and the price for wanting the moon right nowconcord will not get involvedand if the corp is in a alliance personally i would rather keep this on a corporation level as it is a corporation issue not an alliance issuebut i doubt the mechanics would allow it which is a shame cause it shouldand yes someone can keep fueling the pos every other day but it still shows intent and would quickly become a pain in the ass to keep it upand you could always just war dec them and be done with itin most cases though i think more poss will just get destroyed without the owner lifting a fingerneed to think on this morebut i dont agree with a 24 hour timer and the pos just goes boom or can be stolentoo easy especially cause how this would effect poss in 00cause if you let a pos run out of fuel you have to unanchor everything else before it can be reanchoredand you would be surprised how many major alliances in 00 and low0sec have issues keeping poss fueled
too bad there are no mineable moons in high sec or this might have merit there are absolutely no minerals within moons in high security space generally the only purpose of a high security pos is running labs for research invention and from what i can tell t3 construction at this point
sorry youre right  i had confused myself and misspoke near highsec is what i mean  the barelylowsec areas as close as possible to hisec there are enough moons in real hisec that crowding isnt a serious problem there and particular moons arent more desirable than others since it makes no difference what moon youre orbiting
a your making a simple solution more complicated 24 hour wardec is not a good way of resolving this issueb this is just high sec call it a concord policy much like not being able to anchor secure cans in systems higher than a certain sec levelc make it 36 hours then but not a week 2 3 days at most1 week is too longat least your thinking this throughand for that i respect you but your compromising the balance in the process
looks like some alliances are having to relearn empirebut i also agree there should be a way to hacksteal highsec towers however you could always find an offline small with a one man corp and wardec them with an alt corp running amarr gank bs it wont take long and will be cheap and easy you can even turn it into a profitable venture if you can find towers that still have modules at them
smoking cigsweedcrack and drinking should be in eve itll definitely make spinning spaceships a lot more fun especially if there are fun visuals added in with getting high
i like keeping records of me getting pawned and podded
mercenaries pretty much nuff saidin detailmercs that can prove they did their job make money killmail  proofmercs that cannot prove anything dont no killmail  no proof
first off people dont have to report kill mails to a public kill boardbut they do and that system was around long before the kill mails even existedso the current system is a convenience to those that wish to report what they kill nothing moreso removing it would serve no purpose other then aggravate those that use the mechanicand for the rest of us that dont bother with it we just dont bother to look  itso rather then hearing wining about why it was removed from those that use it and for me cause i would rather have ccp working on actual issues then this i say no leave it as is
killmails are a good idea they tell you your contribution to the fight and who contributed to your demise otherwise all combat tactics would be totally theoretical with no one actually knowing what worked and what totally failedthe problems that need to be addressed and things that need to be added are1 logistics contribution to damage taken2 hitpoints transferd by logistics 15 minutes before rr ship dying3 a solution to fake mailsneither of which justify the removing of killmails an act that would create many more problems
this is a serious issue which hasnt been addressed properly although there has been talk about it for god knows how longthe underlying problems areregular cloaking devices noncovert ops cloaks and the mechanics that dictate that a cloaked ship is impossible to scan down aggro timer when engaging anything currently we have the 15 minute aggro timer when you engage a player ship and log off but aggroing npc ships is not taken into account this being a major issue when a person spontaneously logs offspontaneous logoffs when being aggressed by npcs like mentioned abovethe issue with noncovops cloaking devices has been raised many times already and it has been acknowledged yet nothing has been made to correct it at the same time scanning mechanics have been completely revamped scanning out ships is now more time consuming than ever before while a simple module like a prototype cloaking device can effectively make you invulnerable effectively what this means is that in a supposedly harsh environment of 00 a player can simply warp off and cloak using a noncovops cloak before anything can catch it a battleship with a prototype cloak can warp off an asteroid belt and cloak and therefore become invulnerable before any ship can warp in to the belt and tackle the battleship im fine with being slow and having crappy reactions but when catching a battleship on a belt 1000000 km off the gate youre jumping in from with an interceptor is considered impossible there must be something fundamentally wrongthe biggest problem of course is the nonhuman factor in most of the forementioned cases the player is using a macrobot of some kind and therefore can react way before a human on the other side can react even this i can still accept but the fact that they do this and then use a fundamentally flawed mod like the prototype cloak to become invulnerable is just unacceptable the other variant that weve seen is that the player simply logs off as soon as another player enters the system and with no proper aggro timer present from shooting npcs the player is impossible to catch especially after making ship scanning even harder than what it used to besummarizing the post scanning has been made more time consuming than before while no aggrologoffcloaking mechanics have been altered this has been unbalanced for a long time and is even more unbalanced now the biggest problem i see here is the macros and the current mechanics that make these macros possible and profitable to use this has to change either by seriously affecting the penalties of fitting a noncovert ops cloak making the noncovert cloaks finally scannable or by changing the logoffaggro mechanics something just has to be done
i hate to sound like a  here butisnt it called a cloak for a reason the only improvement i can see to your situation is a drastic increase in either the difficulty to produce cloaks of all types  or a drastic increase in training times to use them im also not sure what you were getting at with the logoff mechanics ships that have logged off can still be scanned down for something like two hours i believemaybe im just wrong feel free to correct me or clarify this some more and ill support
yes i just hate paying the corporate tax when i sell my mineralsoh wait
fixed
lolfunny funny
do not supportbefore this issue can ever even have a chance of happening ccp would have to fix a number of other issues1 the incredibly cheap cost of a wardec they are basially free at the moment2 the corp jumping thing if people get kicked out of npc corp then they will just join corps that have enough alts with their own corps that they can basically just leave altcorp1 and jump to altcorp2 and when that is decced jump to altcorp3 and so onneither of these things will be changedfixed anytime soon and both would have to be addressed before this could ever have a chance of happeningalso i am of the opinion that if you want to be in a npc corp and just play the game highsec worry free fine the only people that want to dec highsec corps are the ones that have trouble in low00 anyway
yeah mission farmers macro miners they sure need pos teamwork and large fleetslook how stupid you are troll
mining doesnt make much isk now anyway i can assure you most nonalts in npc corps do nothing but run missions all the time
youreyoure not a miner are you have you ever even turned on a mining laser one of my corpmates makes enough from mining in his hulk largely solo to pay for his account in plexes with some left over it may not be much isk by your definition but ffs 350 million a month aint loose change either
darth vader voice  you underestimate the power of the mining laser
noexamplesi am a pirate and have no to be associated with anybody i am privateer and do missions and whatever else to make a livingi am a independent miner and dont wish to be associated with anybodyi am scammer and a pickpocket not sure how you would do that but you get the ideai am spyetc etc etci would love the ability to remove myself from any corporation thoughit would be nice to see people with a corporation identifier of nonenow that would be better then a npc corp and would show a personal choice
actually i am bearing in hisec right now mining veld with a hulkexp rigst2  crystals etc and solo a couple hours mining nets me from 610 mil if i mission i more than double thatbut to make enough to buy several plexes maybe if i didnt buy anything else that month sure
he dont know how to mine does hestick to mission running leave the minin to the pros not to mention the knowledge about them
apparently not assuming a couple of hours actually means 2 hours i can make 56 million in my retreiver for goodness sake with a fully fitted hulk i would expect to make somewhere between 15  20 in the same amount of timeme cant fly hulks yet  ive been too busy training for a typhoon
assuming you have a hauler alt going and are mining regular veldspar you make a shade under 117 million per hulk per hour thats about half as much as a missioner with a decent amount of skill makes but its far easier alternately if you fit a hulk up for cargo space and then mine semiafk you make better than 2 million every time you dock up its not enough to retire on but its a fully respectable income stream if youre making 35 mil an hour mining actively even solo youre doing it wrong
no hauler alt expander rigs ill get accurate times and numbers tonight
we expect full fitting spec sheet with charges and whatever your mining to be listed palif your going to ante up go all in or nuthin
yessir captn o7
let all npccorp players get conscripted to their empires militia 3 months after they started
we expect all pvpers to mine for 3 months straight before being allowed to fire a single shotohwait
they can join sooner if they want but not stay in npccorp longer then 3 months before getting a concord letter telling them congratulation you are now a member of your empires milita no go make us proud son
this is a pvp game whelp
pvp doesnt necessarily involve combat
if its a pvp game then why are there miners and manufacturers smartass
but only if you require all people to mine for 3 months straight
this is a pvp game whelp did you already forget i just told you
so what your saying is pvpers dont know how to read let alone answer direct questions rightwow i feel sorry for you guys
not supported because you want players forced out of npc corps offer incentives instead to encourage ppl and id sing a different tunepossibilitiesa after say 3 months npc corp start handing out missions to members that gain them nothing but standings gain with that corp if these missions are failedrefused they gain a standings hit that if not rectified will eventually have them thrown out to a different npc corp downside is that it still has elements of being forcedb start instituting a corp tax on npc corpsc let members of player corps use corp standings to access hostile agents from other factions as a means of repairing personal standingsd give bonuses to mining or some such similar to fleet bonuses but not stacking with them to members of player corps while in any system they have an office or a posi would personally rather see something like c or d as they are incentives and not penalties
youre right there is only pvp no missions no ratting no mining no refining no manufacturing no invention no trading no hauling right the only ships that exist are there to kill like the orcayoure just a jackass insulting doesnt prove a point npc corps have good pros and cons people dont need to be forced into combat when it will probably find them eventually even if its only suicide ganking
i think we should be able to have a no corporation association optionor if that cant be done how about one called none or independentsomething to say hey i do my own thing and have no need to be associated with anybodyexamplesi am a pirate and have no to be associated with anybody i am privateer and do missions and whatever else to make a livingi am a independent miner and dont wish to be associated with anybodyi am scammer and a pickpocket not sure how you would do that but you get the ideai am spyetc etc etc
nonpcs already do that let alone 1 man corps
yeh yeh yeh i hit return by mistakethe rest of it is in there now
yesespecially combined with option to have wardecvendetta against individual characters no matter npc corp player corp or no corp
i agree with this actually i think a nonaffiliation rogue capsuleers as it were would be a neat thing to have
no this is game is designed with corporations in mind no supportisaac
oh for crying out louddo i have to spell it out for you low iq peoplenon affiliated pilots are worse than npcits nigh perfect immunityit will never happen hell will freeze over before you get that far
only if you can wardec an unaffiliated person but if you can wardec an unaffiliated person for less money than a corp everyone would and no one would choose to be unaffiliated as opposed to be in an npc corpif all you want to do is not belong to someone elses corp just found your own like the duke of plazatoro ltdif you were proposing replacing the npc corps with unaffiliated status such that individuals could be wardeced thatd be something elsein its proposed incarnation though this seems impractical to me
semithis1 man corp is far better anywaynpc corps are especially nice for new pilots who join up in there first days they get a corp chat for the npc corp and can ask questions related to there race so to speak its likely to be a bit quieter than rookie chatthats just one advantage npcs are typically nonaffiliated anywayso i fail to see the reason for this proposal to begin with even if you allow wardec to singular individuals then whats the point might as well allow that across the game itselfthis is a ridiculous proposaland a can of worms at best
fair enough its rare but the other three still apply quite frequently
i thought that too at first however it has nothing to do with orbiting it works no matter whether the enemy orbits or not it just requires you to make tactical maneuvers too if you do so you can take advantage of itthere is an old naval tactic called crossing the t the basic setup looks like this         the triangles are the ships in their direction of movement it means the one who crosses can fire broadsides at his enemy wave after wave while the enemy can only use its forward batteries and has to shoot a moving target with maximum transversal in eve only the transversal speed remains of that still if you cross the t of your opponents flight vector and you have his inertia beaten down he cant adjust his vector well so eventually you end up orbiting him and you can dictate range not by speed but by vector because he either stops to align to you losing distance and speed or he takes forever doing so on the fly falling behind on your actual vectorit is complicated but it should work at least in theory of course caldari pilots would have to learn that ships can actually move during combat first
problem is eve isnt a tactical movement game  the commands are simplistic and not designed to let you do what youre trying to do here really the only commands you can enter are to dictate range  theres move to x orbit at x and really thats about it furthermore theres a deep problem with how tracking is implemented in that it doesnt account for the rotation of the firing ship  if youre in a circular orbit of a stationary point the effective tracking is zero not radial like eve uses if they implemented that then youd have a lot more tactics in how ships move but at present its solely about dictating range the inertia gun makes it a bit easier to do that but it seems like itd be far less effective than a web maybe if you made it outright add an amount of mass then itd be better for antifrigate work but then its useless against big ships i see what youre saying and i agree to some extent but offhand i dont think eve is the game youre looking for here
thing is hersch eve would be soooo much better if it was a tactical gameits just too plain and jane to show up and open fire on a shipit would be so much better if ships had there weak points and strong points depending on the shape and positionfor example a malestrom has all of its cannons along the side of the ship on the starboard and port sidesone would think that going broadside on a ship of that magnitude would be a veryrisky venture if not fatalas all guns are brought to bearif the malestrom was firing her cannons in the front or the rear quadrants it wouldnt be as effective yet it is to a degreeeve would be more interesting that way opening up on a ships rear quandrent to knock out the enginesblind spotsetcetcbutalasnot likely to happeni can dream cant i  o 
i got some positive feedback on this topic in the ideas forum and am submitting this for an official votetopic 1i understand the need to restrict tractor beams in high sec space but i think the game shouldnt restrict you from pulling other peoples wrecks in null sec or at the very least extend the tractor beam to work on alliance wrecks this arbitrary limitation about wreck ownership makes cleaning up around alliance systems a pain in the ass for all salvagers especially when the owners are offline and cant fleet younotethis proposal is specifically for low and null sec systems 4  00 systems of sec status 5 and up should and probably will remain as they are topic 2someone also suggested allowing tractor beams to pull unanchored structures and containers so i am adding it on the main proposal as topic 2
i support this topic
you support this thats funny because it doesnt look like you are support this ehp
definitely supported for 00 assuming its technically feasible probably supported for lowsec as well
i understand some limitations for this in highsec maybe even lowsec but 00 should be free for all
supported
oh man we need this
supported for obvious reasons
sure why not an exportable block log file could prove useful for some users
a good idea
actually i think that could lead to alot more problems in imblancing than is already ingamea rig that provides for a fitting slotwhy cant i have a rig for a propulsion slot or more drones or 1 for a web at what point is it no longer a rig slot but just an omnislotnice idea but not really wanted
training it to 5 should allow the directional scanner to sort things properly

as a very knowledgeable player what is your opinion of fitting interdictors without bubble launchers and the loss of said interdictors to solo frigates what actions would you take against vocal critics of such fittings
lol still feeling bitter about having your access to our forms removed vit oh well in any case i personally wouldnt use an interdictor in that way but mostly because i think there is a number of ships that can do the job just as well having said that i can see that a high speed dessie would be useful in some situations outside of 00 and certainly wouldnt post insulting and snippy commentspictures about someone who did want to try it as for actions of censorship taken against people who critise such fittings i would be taking no actions as constructive criticism is a key way of helping others continual pointless smack and insulting of other members of a forum is another matter entirely of course and after consultation with other moderators of said forums i would be only too happy to remove that persons postingreading rights if there was enough continued complaints against said person hope that helps
i personally love to fit interdictors without bubble launchers i use the extra slot to fit minibars and jacuzzi and consider that since my clones cost 30mil isk anyways its a bit pointless to fly a tech1 destroyer when tech2 versions are available
where do you stand on the whole bob reloaded kerkufflewhat do you think about mining income versus missioningwhat do you think about militia members getting faction hits for rring fellow militia members who have criminal security status
well to be honest i find the amount of forum talk about it to be far in excess of what the subject deserves as it is i think that the changing of the name from kenzuko to band of brothers reloaded was a mistake on someones part within ccp i doubt there was anything malicious in doing so simply on the basis that it really doesnt mean all that much at the end of the day as mentioned by several people on both the giant threads in regard to the topic if the exbob leadership had formed an entirely new alliance and then petitioned the band of brothers corp for name squatting i can see how that would have been a viable solution to the affair as it is rolling back the decision was the right move in my opinion not becuase of the public outcry over the issue one way or another but simply because kenzuko had been in existence for too long to say something like whoops our bad we meant to type something elseas a csm i would as stated above be more than willing to ask ccp if an investigation had been carried out into how this whole mess had happened the issues with mining income versus missioning to me seems to be three major areas firstly the isk a miner makes is entirely determined by the market since the removal of shuttles as an npc item removed the lower limit cap for trit and as such fluctuates with supply and demand whilst missioning is a relativity fixed income which only relies on the time you put in the second issue is that of macromining which connects to the supply and demand part as the market value of minerals is artificially reduced by the abundance of minerals created by these miners lastly the reprocessing of mission loot seems to me to put in an inordinate amount of minerals into the market which further devalues the mineral prices i personally would like to see more dynamism in mission running in regards to the rewards you get and the quality of the agent being heavily linked to the number of requests that agent has for missions per day i would also like to see the loot drops reduced and maybe balanced by a small increase in the bounties of the rats in the missions of course this would be a delicate balance to achieve and would need some work by ccp as well as other options looked at that the players suggest im sure this will get some backs up but i agree with it the various factions are in effect subservient to the ded in regards to standings in many ways they all respect the negative standing placed on someone by the ded and as a result helping such a person would result in a lowering of standings towards the faction now i can understand this makes things tough for those militias who have such people in their midst but at the end of the day you still have the choice not to work with them i think it would be far more sensible and fit in with the way the standings system is supposed to work if people with a criminal security status werent allowed to join however this would be ignoring the long standing traditions of privateering i suppose there could be some sort of letter of marque given to a criminal but thats a whole different kettle of fish and would have to be looked at very carefully in order to not allow factional warfare to turn into a pirate free for all i dont have anything against pirates though i work with a number of them all the time but eve is about choices you make if you chose to be a pirate then official bodies such as the four core empires wont like you and if you chose aid one then you are aiding a criminal above the status of aiding a fellow militia member based on the idea that ded standings are more important than empire standings

transparancy most importantly thanks to ankhesentapemkah you now have a wiki where you can keep track of all csm issues and ccp is looking for further means to improve communication with the players i will continue this path towards transparancy and accountability after all what good is the csm if the players cannot clearly see what is being worked on  this is no vague talk or idle promise as can be proven by take cares track record over the past year participation i encourage all players to participate at take care and get involved with the csm there may be issues that are important for you and we would love to hear from you you can send questions concerns and comments to ankhesentapemkah and me and well get back to you with an answermy agenda in a nutshellfind in the following the issues which are my personal agenda if you want changes which i will try to push forward if elected csm delegate some areas i would like to see developed while not being an expert myself i can assume that a csm colleague will know a lot more in such areas and i will constructively support him or her in the submission process finally feel free to bring your own topics to my attention or to modify priorities according to your understanding programmable npcsprogrammable npcs shall give out your missions to other players creating missions should allow you to assess the best pilot for later recruitment build a renommee for yourself in the sector create an income for mission runners and yourself the toolset would range from simple courier missions to transport a pile of stuff from a to b sourced in slices from your own stock to acquisition mining  trade  exploration eg nailing down a signature to killing where either spawns would be triggered by the type of enemy the mission creator selects or capsuleers need to be eliminated where a mission would only be given out when enemy capsuleers are present of course concord refactoringcaptain we just received a distress signal in this constellation  having a computer generated police force was a logical decision at eves stage of 40k subscribers today with 40k pilots simultaneously online we have better options be it by tradeable killrights or introducing the role of marshals who may react on aggression or distress signalsif capsuleers do the job pirates will have equal opponents  carebears with teeth and imagine an adaptive system security rating depending on the number of marshals around and how that could reshape the galaxy we could testdrive the mechanics in lowsec first to provide incentives for players to police space and take care of the justice aspect of the game while providing pirates there with more juicy targets 00 incentivizingalready mentioned during csm2 but i want to emphesize that endless pos warfare is not the endgame we want allow 00 alliances to do empirebuilding let them add npcs to their outposts and provide more reliable moneymaking activities for the grunts to make isk on site having reasons for alliances to operate under an nrds policy and making money off visiting carebears would be a bonus for example by using the player mission system see above let 00 space be used and come to life  more ships there will then trigger or allow other activities my focus is an increased interaction between players making pilots travel more regions of space of course 00 needs other aspects to be looked at like the sovereignty mechanics themselves and moon mining
 finishing factional warfarethere are mechanical flaws which need to be addressed from known exploits to stupid spawning in addition to these engineering issues i see a much greater importance of factional warfare for the whole galaxy when war broke lose between the empires i hoped that it would bring a sort of endgame to highsec imagine  conquering a system will make it harder for the inhabitants loyal to the defeated faction to live in it also i do not see a reason why amarr can ally with caldari but a capsuleer alliance cannot oh and did i say that i hate spawning  let plex appearance be playerdriven not totally random  i can imagine playerowned habitats as factors in occupancy with solid profits attached until being conquered or destroyed by the enemy some kind of sovereignty in empire space leveraging the standing systemnow this last one is quite abstract and maybe it is too farfetched but lets see  all the greater aspects of eve work sidebyside connected more or less through the item market yes it is hypercapitalism and nothing wrong with that but the ubiquitous call for more backstory involvement sandbox and incentives leads me to believe that we need more than isk to compete with before we had the alliance system corporations already forged alliances outside of the clienttoday still a quarter of a million capsuleers meet eye to eye you sell to one other your contract is picked up by one other you shoot at one other and if you shoot well he use his killright to shoot back what you are doing inflicts a change only to exactly one other pilot or none when you shoot the environment and once it is done it is over it not really multiplies stages nor has indirect effectsmy goal is to add interaction between capsuleers and to make it little predictable by introducing a new abstraction layer on which capsuleers compete throughout new eden a second market your standing should empower or hinder you standing which others set towards you  for example from all pilots loyal to the occupying faction thus your actions will have a potential backlash upon you both good and bad standing you currently gain through npc missions and you only use it for missions standing given by other pilots is irrelevant standing given by a corporation to a pilot is irrelevant but in future standing may allow the marshal role for the occupying faction or sovereign alliance it might give real bonusses to your personal profit and efficiency of your corp the standing settings of each pilot towards you will gain importance to an extent as they are themselves liked or disliked depending on the region of space you are in occupancy the resulting standing network will be hard to exploit as we deal with thousands of individuals and ten alts will not make a differencethe cushion from where the ball bounces back to you can then be occupancy where the loss of a system affects the whole loyal community there aggression and killrights which may be used by other capsuleers than the involved two parties your creativity where your missions in good standing are required for an infrastructure which you may exploit further issuesthe above list is not complete as said earlier i cannot adopt issues where i am not an expert in the area of effect a lot of ship and module effects fall under this category personally i think there is something wrong with the turret mechanics in closeup battle i will support such submissions the least i can do is checking arguments for validity and completenessmy focus is networking and increasing travel and trade and interaction that is the view i want to add to the csm discussion
i express my confidence in erik hell make a great csm and continue the work ive been doing the past year
anyone can stand on a soapbox in the street and trumpet their desire to make life better for everyone to cure what ails us to produce winwins and to otherwise make happiness fall from the sky like rain this isnt limited to the csm either  were pikers compared to rl politicians thing is even if they do mean what they say they cant generally deliver yes its possible to have everyone gain from a change but a lot more frequently someone gains and someone else loses the gains can outweigh the losses but you cant carry on blithely unaware that there are people who will suffer a loss because of the change you propose this is why its fundamentally false to claim that youre trying to let everyone play the game they want because when the platitudes end and the policies begin youre not you cant you cant even increase the isolationism offered to players without affecting other people because youre withdrawing the new isolationists from interactions they would otherwise have engaged in and that would otherwise have benefited others you say im being too specific but im just pulling out one example of many there is no issue where you can propose a change that does not harm somebody and you cannot call those changes simple isolationism with a straight face bears have simple tastes much of the time but their desires will inevitably come into conflict with the desires of others as for the overarching issue i think we agree im entirely for players organizing to have their voices heard and this seems like a decent vehicle for doing so im not trying to derail isslers attempt here im just trying to make sure that everyone understands what it will actually look like at the end you cant get what you want without stepping on the toes of others at least to some extent so be aware of that going in if this party is to succeed it needs a clear agenda and a clear understanding of how it will enact that agenda and what obstacles it will face along the way you will never get unanimous support for anything nontrivial and you will not be able to enact that agenda without serious opposition understand that prepare for it and while you may choose to use pithy slogans in your communications with the outside world never make the mistake of using them inside your own head you are not making the game better for everyone you are not meekly asking to be left alone in a way that doesnt affect anyone else and you are not making it so that everyone can play the game they want you are advancing an agenda that you believe will help the game as a wholeor if youre a jerk that you believe will help you personally but there will be casualties along the way and they will fight you thats not to say you shouldnt try  on the contrary i fully encourage you to do so  but please go into this with your eyes open too many negatives in that sentence for me to be really unambiguous so ill just state this cleanly everyone has a right to advocate for themselves their play styles and their preferred gameplay changes to the best of their ability i may dispute your points i may disagree with your goals but i will never dispute your right to fight for them as best you can to the best of my recollection the only people ive ever attacked for speaking on these boards were obvious trolls  hell i tend to give likely trolls the benefit of the doubt this isnt about whether isslers crowd can speak up its about what it would wind up looking like when they do
do mission runners make enough isk its arguable on the one hand you have the average level 4 runner who makes shedloads but on the other hand you have the l321 runners that make virtually nothing in comparison id say hitting the people who run these lower leveled missions would be unfair perhaps a good solution would be to remove t1 loot from missions but replace it with higher quality salvage this would increase the price of t1 fits at the cost of lowering the price of salvage higher t1 prices would probably equal higher mineral prices too  youd get a healthy multiplier on the other hand what about the newbie mission runner if t1 prices increase too much the risk occurs that he is priced out too easily the idea of a liberal party is a pipe dream for myself personally so let me not repeat the assertion maybe when i can go for a csm position in my experiance carebears do not stay carebears forever  theyll eventually branch out into industry mining or pvp  its just that some people do this quicker than others
isnt this the other way around a liberal party would work towards social engineering and protecting carebears a conservative party would be based on having as little intervention as possible or is it just in the us that liberal groups work to protect everyone from themselves and conservative groups want the government to get its nose out of everyones business
agree with op
completely agree with the op we need our blazing flashes of light on the battlefield it just completely takes away from the feel of a hotdrop or any capital event for that matter without a spectacular flash announcing our arrival

ummmevefiles and evesearch to name a few
hmm lets seewhy shouldnt he have his obsession fulfilled because its against the rules rolleyes yeah as if anyone in here plays by the rules all the time ofc depending on the rules i dont think everybody here uses exploits or so  he asks nicely at least
you guys realize with the current rules for highsec capitals if ccp were to make an exception for them and we all know how eve hates ccp playing favorites and move the titan to highsec he would either be forced to jump it out or never be able to log in with a single war decyou cant dock titans and amarr cant have control towers let alone capital ship arrays anchored being in space in a capital will mean you get it moved to lowsec i know chribbas not serious about the request in any way but i have a feeling some people think this could actually happen
thats why it should at least be brought in as a monument
highlighted important stuff
pretty muchyou should see my minmatar and gallente standings
the nag defiantly needs buffed not sure if i agree with your solution but something does need to be done the nid on the the other hand is a great carrier and even if cpu or base hit pointsbase cap need tweaking i again dont like your solution
worst dread ever build make it 457 change his bonus to rofdmglvl and you will have a nice dread like other races and btw do you know that a tempest have a smaller range than a domi
the numbers are in  with all skills at level 5 the naglfar spits out more damage than any other dreadnought right now as it stands with artillery and torps it packs about 345 dps presiege the next best being the revelation at about 340 dps with autocannons it packs about 435 dps vs the moros 425 dps assumes all level 5s and empmultispecantimatterthe downside is that it does indeed more skills than any dread and has the worst tank of any dread hence my recommendation that all it needs is an extra mid more cpu and better cap but that is my opinion and its a modest change as it doesnt screw over people that are already skilled for the naglfar ie myself the improved cpu and cap allows for damage mods to be fitted in the lows without losing a permatank and without having to use serious faction gear too outside of siege  permatanking in siege is nigh impossible doable but you kill resists doing it unless you have carrierlogistics energy supportif it was made to 3 turret slots with 5lvl damage at level 5 the nag would then do 480 dps with autocannons but only 310 dps with artillery just throwing that out therebut yes i still agree principally with the base argument  minmatar capitals should all be shield tanked at the very least with comparable ease i personally think that the extra training for both capital artillery and citadel torps is an adequate tradeoff for the best dread damage in the game if only it could tank as easily as the other dreads
that my friend is a good point that i had not previously considered by my own logic id have no choice but to support the notion that ships entering regular space from wspace through a wormhole would not appear in local until a wspacelike condition had been met  if someone made a specific thread about that id give it a thumbs up
the entire reason you dont show up in wspace is because it lacks communication devices that are in known space and cause you to show up instantly
supportwith a caveat that directional scanner needs a severe rework including autoupdate just like the overview and the ability to slave it to station sensors while docked for grid info
of all the players in this game the chinamacro farmers are the least likely to be bothered by endless monotonous constant directional scanner clicking for inteland for us legitimate players well we hate your poorly thought out idea
i already said there wont be the need for constant scanner clickingand even with real time scanner update its already a big step plus to being able to gank them
this would be a huge boost to small scale pvp no more of the silly hey local is 2 ok lets undock 50 people
that would help in my eyes the whole problem of isk farmers in 00 its already annoying enough to fly through your space to see macro ratters everywhere add delayed local and bring some risk to those macros i approve just for the plain fact that i want to pop more macro ratting ravensnighthawks 
why you people never search for a previous version of the same threadit was stated by the developers that a auto updating scanner is not a acceptable solution as 50k scanners updating every 23 second across all of eve with all the information gathering that they will do will add a unacceptable strain to the server with consequent lag crashes and so on from this point on it is my opinion not some dev statementlocal is the system intelligence toll that has the least impact on the game performance it was possible to remove it from wh space as most of the time a wh system will have a limited number of people in it so even if they are all using the directional scanner the impact on performance is manageable it you have 2 20 man fleets in a k space system with every one of them hitting the directional scan every 2 seconds and getting several hundreds of signals the lag will be unberable
ive spent a decent amount of time through the years in both 00 and empire and i definately support this i do believe there should be some sort of intelligence networking built into the game though seems strange that in rl now we can share intel across multiple fleets but in the future this is resolved to text or voice comms i also believe that nerfing down the localintel would lead to a more specialized intel gathering network and ultimately shrink empire sizes all of this i believe to be a good thingi detailed a bit of my idea for an intelligence network here though some of it is outdated with the newer scanning systems i guess i should write up a new proposal
i tentatively support this idea however i agree with a need buff to scanning tools so for the moment it does not get thumbs upone idea that may contribute is to tie this in with system scanners on a pos the current system scanner is essentially redundant since in home systems there will be many ships in space many of those idling in a pos perhaps changing the system scanner to show local in a system to the sov holders and their allies would help with this rational would be the scanner automatically scans and updates local with all the pilots in spacethis would retain the intel aspect for the home defence who reasonably ought to have an advantage where is concernedhowever simply changing this would introduce a significant imbalance to the setriment of a hostile roam therefore buffing scanning tools would be required as well perhaps a transponder probe could be introduced the mechanic being that when deployed it searches for active pilots transponders in the system as a whole this probe would not be a locator as combat probes currently are but while deployed by a fleet member would allow visibility of local to a hostile fleettwo seperate mechanics that need to be balanced well and ultimately allowing visibility of local to both where the benefit to pvp is concerned it removes local from systems without any sov unless the parties involved use a transponder probeactive scouting would be more essential and probers more common in fleetsjust a couple of ideas and maybe not the best but something to throw into the potzos
a simple scenario to demonstrate why this should not be proceeded withyou have a mining op going on in an ice belt with 10 people an orca and a rorqual you have scouts out and all is well you think you are safe and that you have prepared well but all of a sudden 20 covert ops force recons black ops etc  appear from nowhere and you start screaming as your well planned and executed little op gets torn to piecesmuch puiblic ridicule is heaped on your shoulders by whoeverpodded and annoyed at being bounced you scream at the scouts where was my warning and they yell back we saw nothingthen it dawns on you logonski by one character covert cyno and you were stuffed and despite all your preparations you really stood no chance what so eversmall problem perhaps anyoneuntil an instant scanning system is implemented that warns of hostiles in system and does not drive people to distraction proceed no further
i do support this for reasons allready stated in this thread if ccp improves and adds more scanning mechanics of course
refer to my post above and it is possible to see how some changes could balance this out arguably it would be foolish to carry out mining ops in a system with no towers with a tower and sov you would gain a warning from local as you currently dozos
i agree with this local needs to be changed either to have it show blank unless someone has typed or a 30 second delay at least
yeah
this is why you need ships in your op to protect your mining shipsit would mean you need to be more on your toes instead of having a scout 2 jumps down the pipe to give you warning it makes the game somewhat more exciting then sitting there watching your mining lasers mindlessly and without any worryits 00 space it only makes sence local should be removed from game completeley
supported  except we should have delayed local in all space
sounds like a plan
with the proviso of some much improved scanning interface oh god yes please do this as soon as you canat the very least to 00
you need to read that again more carefully what the devs said is that the current directional scanner on autorepeat is bad for the server this statement was in answer to a just put an autorepeat on the directional scanner suggestionobviously the number of possible resultsparameters the onboard scanner produces in auto mode would need to be reduced among other changesedit this is what was said 
more importantly  were not proposing an autorepeating scanner only a buff to combat scanning and or probesa wise man once said you want to find someoneuse your eyes
im not sure im understanding you correctly here but with a delayed local every ship needs to have the innate ability to acquire this intel in circumstances mainly limited by range without having to deploy anything fit any additional modules or spam button presses this ability should come from the onboard scannerdeployed and fitted equipment should only serve to enhance that ability
which is why i said we also need a boost to onboard scanners and combat scanning probesthe two go hand in hand boost scanners and probes  nerf localspy
the problem with that is the extreme boredom of sitting watching nothing to scout for hours its the most ed gameplay ever simply speaking in such a situation attackers have all the advantages and no drawbacks attackers dont have to wait and lets not get started on cloaks that would be extremely overpowered in such a place all you do is force the few that actually live in 00 to get a iskmaking alt in empire along with the rest of you it would be fun to run around in my recons in 00 but no way am i gonna do any ratting or mining in such a scenario then ill stick to missionsthe only way removing local would make sense is if there is some sort of replacement tool for local that would give some of the same info
heres an idea because ive been thinking on this for awhile if we were to come up with some science skills relating to communications networks and interfacing that would stand as a nice compromiseit would be some extra lvl vs to train but the idea is only the people with the right training can manipulate the commnetworks to use them for intel eh the bonuses could also extend to anyone they are commanding in a fleet this would allow small 00 corps to have one hackerscout to watch local while he plays he keeps the gate campers and sentinels informedjust throwing it out there
very intriguingid like to see someone expand on thisreading the back stories on fluid comms always begged the questionwheres the comm hackers
yeah im thinking that with two lvl vs edit two lvl vs not counting the prereqsmaybe a maximum of 50 names can be displayed on local even if they dont speakthis  a boost in strength to combat scanning even if its only nominal would be very nicei had some other ideas about actually hacking commchannels but i dont think ccp would ever implement them even if the skill requirements were insane
imo any skillbased solution will just mean an additional required timesink everyone will train the new skills and well be back to the current situationi believe the solution to cloaked ships is to add a cloak signature to scan results no range or direction just a presence in system maybe the visibility of this signature should depend on the size and type of the cloaked ship and its range from the scanning ship or probe
wellno because if you lower the bonus enough to say 10 nonspeaking people shown on local and you make the prerequisites hard enough then even if everyone trained up it would still be harder to see who was wherewhile the idea of cloaked sigs is novel it would have to be impossible to pin down any of the signals  or cloaking would be pointless i still think there is probably a skillbased and or modular solution
how about only having no local in conquerable space
yes please
how will those 10 be chosen seems a little arbitrary and how hard would you make the prerequisites do the high prerequisites stop people from having capshippilot alts this will just become another item for the alt marketin any case even just 10 showing up will completely negate the delayed local effect as a ratter will still safeandlog when someone shows up in local and a scout will show up in local to another scout or fleet etc everyone will either have trained those skills themselves or have a local alt in the same way as the current falcon alt maybe the cloak sig would show up at some relatively short range without giving up the direction and that this range would vary with the ship size and type this way makes the standoff cloaked recon possible but makes close approach risky
this is what was proposedreal time scanner updates if that is not a scanner on auto repeat it is a scanner in constant use or it will not be real time there is nothing obvious in this so you want to reduce the information you get from the scanner and remove local at the same timesome other nice idea
simple scanning sends out a ping you can passively scan say 3au and actively scan the 14 or whateverso when you scan you can also be pinpointedproblem solvedso those covops exposed themselves scanning down your position
not supported
i wrote about reducing the amount of info from ships scanner when in automode this seemed obvious to me to allow it to work in real time over ranges of several au and not overwhelmingly stress the server the manual scan may retain all its current functionalitygood idea adds some complexity to the scanning system
for those who dont know i recently lost a kronos worth roughly 5 billion isk in mods etc its my choice to fly it and i really enjoyed flying itafter the patch before everyone knew about the hp bug and the server seemed suprisingly stable i decided to take it for a spin as i had done many a time prepatch i jumped into a reasonably sized gate camp but nothing i wouldnt be able to tank as i decloaked none of my modules appeared to activate i was then instantly put down to 10 armor at this point i didnt know what was going on so i hit fraps to rewatch afterwards i managed to fraps for about half a second before my ship popped and although the graphics showed my mods inactive a armor repair cycle went through boosting me to about 70 armor a second volley popped me instantly the fraps shows clearly that just 2 zealots were actually firing the larger ships didnt even have time enough to lock methis kronos has 8084 resistances on everything and i thought i had been doomsdayed at first i quickly posted the mail and apparently 2 zealots were the only thing doing damage to me my kronos with 7k shield 9k armor with 80 resistances and my structure 10k with damage control had been melted by 29k damage from 2 zealots only 2 volleys for themluckily for the guys who popped me the best stuff lived including 2x centum atype lars and vizans eanm i petitioned and quickly received my ship back but of course minus the mods that livedthis policy has been in place a long time and ive never challenged it because quite frankly its never been worth the effort but ill be damned if i wanst gonna try and challenge it hereanyway to cut a very long story short after 2 weeks of escalating petitions i was given the finger this policy is ridiculous isk is something that takes time to make in eve and somehow ccp think its reasonable that a victim of a bug they admitted was their fault should lose 3bil isk because what they dont want to take mods off people who should never have gained them in the first place if ccp make a mistake ccp should fix the mistake i know if i make a mistake in eve i have to pay for iti have to live with the fact i suffered a massive loss to ccp but in the future i want to see people getting anything they lost back because were all paying customers and why should we take a hit because ccp fcked upi understand that perhaps it would be very difficult and time consuming to retrace those modules steps but at the very least the person who lost the ship due to a blatant bug should get the market price for that modules placed back into their wallets i dont think there are enough legitimate losses to seriously affect the economics of eve by doing this but regardless i think something should change

i sport this
im sorry but to be blunt i really dont pity your situation first off you went into a gate camp and got roasted alive im going to guess it was 5 v 1 and your complaining that two zealots blew you to bits claiming it was module lagright i can see why ccp wont even if you didnt have the claimed module lag im pretty sure you would have been destroyed you tried to solo pvp and got destroyed over it yeah you totally deserve reimbursementin my opinion the policy doesnt need a change no support isaac
thisto be honest ive sat here staring at this post several times trying to figure out whether this is a justifiable proposal or notand honestly i keep coming to one conclusionwhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaseriouslyi get the fact you flew your fancy ship into a gate camp and lagged outbut there is absolutely no way for them to detect a disconnect its just not how tcpip infrastructure worksfor all we know it could be the jerk down the street downloading a ton of torrents on your isps bandwidth some nut case plowing into a power line or a moron tripping over a cat 5 connection and quickly plugging it back inall of this over a shipyeah sorryim sure if i flew my freighter into a gate camp id be screaming toowait i wouldnt fly my freighter into a gatecamptankable or notbecause its a bloody gate camp
are you stupid  do you think two zealots can break a officer fitted kronos tank with 2vollys and roll your eyes again to darkness the lord ill slap you in the face
lol you are for real or you were born that stupidlearn to read my halfbrained friend ship was reimbursed because ccp admitted it was a bug and the issue is something totally different what ill leave that to you or ask your parents  maybe they can read and translate it for youanyho signed for actually getting some rules for reimbursement atm its totally random stuff sometimes people get ships even including caps reimbursed after the battles ccp never reimburses fleetbattle losses amrite where in clear documented cases including fraps there is no reimbursementso not only ya need to make clear when reimbursement is possible but what can be reimburseddrake draconisminmatarshadow cadreworlds end consortiumyou sir are also stupid and your reading comprehension is that of 5 year old
hey for all we know this could be just a cleverly crafted argument all because someone was asleep at the wheel
trolling weatherman
no ccp gave ship back because damage recieved server side was 2700 wheras actual hitpoints of his ship were over 25000 and thats not including resistsi guess ya never lost battleship to claw in 2 seconds by being onesalvoed next time stfu and dont make fool of yourself
moderated weathermanin anycase i happen to fly heavy assaults and id like to see the killmails to see what those zeolots were packing i severely doubt that it was all due to lag as hacs are well known for chewing through anything larger than a cruiserif the case of the bug is true good for you in getting your ship back but nothing else here makes me think the reimbursement system is bugged or in need of worknot supported
i pity your loss but im not really sure what ccp can do here either they remove those modules from the hangars of the people who picked them up  hardly fair to them  or they open a loophole you could drive a truck through whenever a bug opens fly officerfit ship into combat lose officerfit ship to bug drop officer gear get officer gear reimbursed suddenly you and your enemy have made 3 billion for a few minutes work if you can come up with a solution that works better than the status quo im all ears but i dont see what it would be
probably not paying attention eating chillilasagne full of leeks least you got the ship back  pity about the mods
wow i must have touched a nerve by the way because you reported drake i feel its my responsibility to tell you i reported you sucks doesnt it now that we are over that little humpi see what the op is saying and agreeably ccp should have rules on reimbursement although im of the opinion that reimbursement shouldnt happen at all because it could be just as easily your fault as it could have been ccps fault but i dont suppose you would mind maybe having a suggestion of what those rules could beisaac
he probably doesnt and i still havent heard him explain how he takes on two hacs alone all bugs and lag aside marauders arent exactly made for solopvp
i agree with this statement if you do allow both sides to get a copy of the modules youl have people exploiting it eg you get your ship popped by the glitch and than have your offline corpmates log on and recover your items giving you 2 sets i do not support this unless ccp devises some system to track module ownership and fraud once this is in place i will support changing this policy
right now ccp is not aware of hp bug and frankly i am also skeptical since i didnt encounter it myself and have not seen other people showing impossible killsif your kronos died to a single frigate maybe 2 frigates then wed have serious evidence of something wronganyway if you hope to get your ship back you first have to help ccp identify the bug  if it exists without that theres no ground for reimbursement
supported but dont get your hopes upi asked about this at last years fanfest and it doesnt look to be on the horizon
would be nice
supportedim a caldari ship only pilot and this is something sorely missing
i can see the rails on my vulture just fine i dont see the problemseriously though this has been requested more times than moist things in game and still even after all the graphics upgrades updated effects theyve not devoted any time to it sad really
yes id like to see this in ccps next major patch
o might support box dont let this issue die make ccp hear us
sad situation yeah but i doubt anyone at ccp will give a flying f about it
we could really use this one
if youre transporting a skillbook youre doing it for someone else this wouldnt change thatalso jumpclonesyeah somehow i doubt thatkind of like how you were too lazy to come up with a real argument probably the only valid argument in this thread though i have a little bit of faith left in ccp that they havent gone that softsupported for why the hell notedited for potentially huge isk sink
says the pot calling the kettle blackit is a lazy mans featureand today i came that close to agreeing with youbut your smugassed remark turned me offme thumbs downhowever ignoring said persons argument im open to injection only under strictest of conditionslike the fact you can inject based on the fact your going to meet said prereqs within the 24 hour skill queue timethatis rational and sensible
umm nodont see the point of injecting a skill you cant train for months maybe if you can only inject a skill that you will be able to train after your current skill ends
based on the skill queue being created to allow someone to effectivly train their characters when they can only log on perhaps once a day at a restricted time and whereas the inability to inject skills without prereqs prevents this goal from being completely met i support this idea there really isnt a bad side to it other than the confusion that might come from someone injecting a book and not knowing that that doesnt give them the ability to use it until its trained this can be prevented with a simple notification window when injecting a nonprereqd skill informing the player of such
actually jorah cores have and always have had a sensor strength of 40 dss probes got theirs hacked from 20 to 5 the reason a result at 2 au on dss and 2 au on core is the same now is because 2 au is the minimum for a dss but 8 times the minimum of a core despite having 8 times the strength how an advanced variant of the probes with an expanded sensor suite is beyond me  by the numbers someone just took the regular core sensors and adjusted them to look farther resulting in an increase of range for a proportional decrease in strength thats not advanced at all thats bogus a strength of at least 10 would make sense for an advanced probe with that rangebasically dss probes are longrange cores and theyre not very desirable at all because of this huge hit in fact theyre even worse than cores since refining a scan is impossible with them not hard impossible dss are supposed to be the specialized exploration probes while cores were supposed to be the crappy doitall probesand yes i am in the hard sciences thats why i said no scientist in their right mind with that said i think it is fairly agreeable that astrometrics would fall under the socalled hard sciences an experimenter will only throw out a data point if it is very clearly not the same result and its value and error range does not overlap or coincide with any of the other values and their respective error ranges by a certain marginnyah the flip side of your argument is also applicable what is the reward for players that train hard to use the explorationspecialized probes right now jack and s and jack is stuck in wspace
longrange cores is about the reason yeah try scanning stuff out in a 200 au wide system and tell me cores are up to the task if youre in big systems and want to get a result without some exhaustive and irritating searching use deep space probes do they need more use theyre narrow but exceptionally good at their niche i say i wont bother with astro 5 because im not a serious scanner people who are will likely get enough use out of itand the 8th probe to justify training it
thats just it though scanning a 200au system is easy with cores easier than with dsss systems that large have widelyspaced middle and outer planets and its not hard to set a few cores to 816 au around each planet or the inner cluster of planets and scan each area one at a time since no cosmic sig is more than 4 au from a warpable object  unless such things have changed the main advantage of dss probes was that they could easily scan the more dense systems with relative ease  systems with 812 or more planets packed in a 3060 au radius dss probes allowed you to get a fix on the approximate location of each result  about 105 au so you wouldnt be scanning different results with higherresolution probes as you were trying to get fixes on eachstill you leave my questions unanswered why is an advanced variant probe specialized for exploration particularly en masse effectively no better than the standard basic probe aside from increased range  and worse due to the inability to finetune furthermore how is the game mechanic justified in only using 4 probes to calculate the final accuracy granted more than 4 produces diminishing returns but each one still increases the accuracy of the result up to a certain point given proper and effective trilateration more appropriate term new players will usually at least train astrometrics 3 and be using 6 probes when scanning
heyas u all know ccp personel is allowed to play on the live servers as they please obviously without using any commands to spawn themselfs stuff etcbut theres other ways to get very very richthis thread is about one of those ways inside trading trading itemsgoods using nonpublic information gained trough means of working at ccp even short glances at global economy figures during database access can be enough to get very rich in the right hands and hey everyone wanna have a lotta isk in eve rightdoes this stuff get investigated it does in the real world and are there limits to how rich someone working at ccp is allowed to become in eve online tq serverid
for years now this has been of big concern to me as you can do basicly anything given enough isk u can even fund wars getts lotts of people following your cause basicly you can completely unbalance the game depending what you do with the iskand isk makes isk if you know what to buy and sell because you have real figures to work with that other people dont talking manny trillians of isk here complete market controlinternal affairs do you investigate this and are there limits
1 your obviously not using spell checker and type like 5 year old2 you have zero evidence3 you forgot your tinfoil hat4 you epically failed to troll ccpinsider trading is a term used to define the act of someone taking company information they work for and using that information on the stock market to turn a profit and making it look like they got damn luckyfor you to use such a grownup term in the context of eve is laughableeverything is obviously pubilc knowledge as far as prices go duhall you people who whine about ccp playing amongst you wheres your proof all i see is you claiming they do this and yet there is no proofseriously get a grip on reality well yaheven if they did your still not producing proof put up or shut the hell up
if you keep this up i will report you for harassmenton topicproof ccp ceo made public statement when the whole t2 incident went down that they will allways play on the live serversthats enough to know that they are on the live servers and they are making isk for themselfs in eve the question is how much isk and do they use information they gained from working at ccp in their free time on their player characterswe do not all have access to the same amount of information for one markets are regional resources required to construct something thats in development ccp is allways first to know way before it even getts on the test servers the most information is inside the eve database all trading is recorded its easy to keep track of market tendancys so no we really dont have the same level of information as ccpand the question is aimed at ccp internal affairs not someone like you obviously baised to believe nobody  ccp ever does anything wrong history has proven different allready hence why the internal affairs was created
yet again you rabble on without prooflet alone a spell checkergo ahead and report me your just a whiny child with no hope of achieving anything other than encouraging paranoia and conspiracy theoriesgo on now put on your tin foil hat and repeat after meccp is out to get usccp is out to get usccp is out to get ussay it enough times it might actually come trueyou never knowyep laugh of the day here classy stuff
ccp have an internal affairs department which monitors all their accounts for anything strange this is done fairly regularly and from what we saw in iceland all the staff take ia very very seriously if you think they are doing what you described please let the ia guys know and they will investigate
i have no doubt that they take the ia very very seriously but is it within the confines of what they are allowed to do affect eve on a global scale and become insanely rich are there rules that say they are not allowed to have more than 1 trillian isk random figurebecause i believe they have no rules about this at all all we know is that they are not allowed to spawn themselfs stuff
for all we know they are spying on your computer watching your keystrokes tracking your movements every single little website you visit all of your bank accountswhy the thought alone is staggeringsomeone should contact the authorities
obviously ia doesnt allow that thats pretty much a givenas oz said we have talked to ia on several occasions trust me they wouldnt let that happen ia audits all employees on a regular basis
lock threadthreadisaacps your an idiot and paranoid also this is ccps game
recent events the renaming of bob have substantionaly lowered my will to simply take their word for it that all is well move on etcwhat i woud like to see is specific rules ccp personel have to follow when playing on tq can internal affairs possibly tell us just what rules there areit still wont garentee stuff but atleast we know there are specific rules about this for them to follow so ia what rules are there
a game with a global economy where developers play on the live servers and are abble to affect the game is insane so yes we need rules for them to be allowed to play on itthis is our game that they made for uswhat are the rules their personel have to follow
then why the hell didnt you ask for that in the first placewhy come up with some stupid harebrained idiotic accusation with no proof or basis which would lead us down this stinky rabbit trail of an thread which obviously is nothing more than someones stupid little soap box demanding answers which could have easily been accomplished by petitioning or contacting internal affairs directlyor are you just doing this because you wish to draw attention to yourself and shout the sky is falling

assembly halla platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar managementthe csm this forum section is the playerbase conduit with ccp what your suggesting is that its possible to contact ia directly and get a answer about this
learn to read kidyou got your answer move alongmove along
if the csm wont get them to tell us the rules ccp personel have to follow on the tq servershow do i go around contacting the ia is there a specific procedure for this to actualy get a answeri been trying to find out what rules they have to follow for ages now if any specific rules even exist ever since the ia was created years ago we havent been allowed to see what they really do
i suggest you petition your question to ccp directly or check the information pages on the eve online website
troll troll is trolling trolls uh in here
nobody outside ccp knows the exact rules what we do know is under strong nda they wont tell you but you can contact ia at internalaffairsccpgamescom if you think a ccp employee is using insider information for very good reasons the rules havent been published but trust mere there is a set of rules which every employee has to follow im sorry i cant be more specific all i can offer you is my word and my confidence on this subject i can obviously not give you any proof
i knew there was a reason i liked the fact your in csmo7  vista
yeah read lavistas post also who the heck are you to demand that ccp have rules for their game when they obviously do ccp made this game they can just as easily unmake it live with itisaac
this with a longer timer all ppl would have to do is fuel up the pos with just enough to online it for an hour or a day what ever it takes to reset the timer
this also is a problem of towers being reserved from the standings game as well the standings check is ony there for anchoring a tower so you go around in the 7 days you have good standings for and anchor a bunch of towers then once you really want to use them you can online and anchor the goodies its gaming the system because teh system allows and even encourages it thats not to say that this is right the entire highsec pos mechanics should be changed offline towers anchoring shoudl decay fueling costs should be related to standings certainly a much higher charter expense with insufficient standings the 7 day window thing for anchoring needs to change so that corps must maintain standings to keep their pos affordable howerver changing this by itself would cause other problems so many highsec poss would become unusable thereby greatening the slot shortage issue this should be covered by public availibility of pos slots with the appropriate changes that this would require this would allow intrepid individuals who did maintain their standings to offer the slots up for rent this would remove the necessity for a lot of those placeholder towers out there
wont someone just fuel the tower and charge more for the pos selling to counter any offline pos removal idea
totally depends on the costs involved
yes but it makes it go from a no effort type of situation to an bloody annoyance
within certain limits for example you can currently evade concord with black ops ships by jumping to low sec i think that being able to gank someone in high sec and then being able to cyno to low sec should be fair game black ops are not all that common and if somehow you get tackled its game overwith wormholes i think raids into empire space should be possible and allow you to jump back through now this might mean that players would have to start policing themselves they would deduce that if a black ops ship didnt attack them then it is possible that a wormhole in the system is responsible so they scan it out and destroy the pirateswhateveryouliketocallthemconcord evasion should not be an offence in certain situations other ways of evasion should not be possible apart from black ops and wormhole evasion
i dont know whether to cry at the insanity or to laugh uncontrollably
i fully support this this is what is needed to make missions more fun
justjustnono wayin hellisaac
using black ops to evade concord is a bannable offense using any method to evade concord is a bannable offense
awesome idea eve needs it imho
runescape and lotro both have alcohol consumption and you can whip out a pipe and have a smoke on lotro neither are even teen games fully supported
oh yeah seen this same complaint in america all the timestop keeping score it makes the losers feel badkm fine toughen up and grow a pair worry about your own lack of epeenishness
havent got any kills latly dont get any kills from npcs or damn sick of ur loss mailseither way to much of the eve community like kill mails u get to see what ships u killed wat was fitted and much more
this is not correct ships with no aggression timer will disappear after 30 sec if they have aggression ie have engaged a gate station can other player with an offensive module and such they have a 15 min timer before they disappearand with the new probing mechanics it is impossible to catch them before they are gone as they will not be under the 15 min aggression timer if i read the op correct we are talking ratters farming safe isk in 00 yes i agree with the op the covops cloak and ships that can fit those have got a role but when every ship can fit a cloak and become invulnerable that is just wrong imo some sort of penalty should be applied to using a cloak that brings the risk aspect into it not just the reward an agility penalty perhaps a delayed warp out mechanicat least something that makes ship using a prototype cloaking device have to take some risk we are talking about 00 space after all and it is not supposed to be safei would also like it if cloaking ships using a regular cloaking devices noncovert ops cloakscan be probed out and caught with a well skilled character it shouldnt be easy but it should be possible imoand dont get me started about the macrobot players
cloaks are already balanced and fitting one comes with penalties  no change is needed
and what penalty would that be the scan res penalty and activation delaydoesnt address the problem and they can hardly be called balanced when they make ppl invulnerable
as i told the last million threads on this subjectno unless ccp changes how cloaking and all related mechanics to cloaking there is no change needed isaacps no reason needed because i stated it a million times you have no real solution your demanding ccp change the problem but you have no suggestions this isnt the qq this mechanic sucks forum its the bring your suggestions here forum
i agree that cloaked ships invulnerability really is a paintrying to catch a ratter with a cloak is pretty much pointless any more and searching for a red in local with a cloak is simply a waste of timethe principal of extended cloaking should be limited to specific ships and while others may use them it should be heaily limited in useperhaps introduce a cap usage on activation this would be a drain of a fixed percent rather than an actual amount the rational being that a larger ship requires more energy to remain cloaked so perhaps an activation cost of something like 10 percent if for the sake of argument the duration is 1 minute then any ship using a prototype can remain cloaked for 10 minutes max long enough to take a bio however not long enough to simply wait out a searching fleeti see this as a dynamic that would nerf titans in some way too requiring them to be more often visible on grid and therefore open to attack or at least their position and alignment knownusers of covops cloaks would have zero activation cost and therefore operate as beforezos
a noncovert ship with a cloak can barely move cant warpand cant attack during the times the ship is invulnerable every other ship in the system is also invulerable to the cloaked ship balance achieved if the cloaker decloaks there is a delay before they can lock and they have weakened the combat ability of the ship by attaching the cloak that takes significant cpu and a high slot simple test take any two identical combat ships and two identical pilots put a cloak on one of the ships fit them with the best possible pvp fit with the exception of the cloak have the cloaker decloak next to the other ship and attack due to the delay in firing and the sacrifice of the cpu and highslot the ship with the cloak will most likely explode
eveonline would be a better game without local and without noncovert op cloaking devicesit would end the isk farming problem
listen to this man or forever be labeled dumbspot on
the way rights are organized period needs to be taken into consideration and better documented the sheer bureaucracy thats being forced upon alliances just to function is absurd
supported  just because itll make drake draconis and efrim black cry more
the purpose of all these is to fund pvp what the point of the game watching your wallet grow and paint dryforcing people out if npc corps does nor necessarily force them into combat  it just makes them equally vulnerable as all the other players it may cause them to pay for protection or grow a spine and protect themselves or cooperate with others  there are many options
mining in my system i did one runtook roughly 15 minutes hulk wcargo ii  cargo rigs for 17991m3 cargot2 strip miners with t1 crystals only available atmi mined in one load  added it to my small unpreocessed ie below min amt to refine from last reprocess to get170000k dense veld4509k veld2115 condensedwith my efficiency im not in a high standing station but close so it yields to 685877 units of tritat the running price of 420isk thats 28milin that one load i could have done half a mission 500k and downed 4 bs rats at lets say 500k thats 25m not counting loot and salvageso no missioning is a lot faster in terms of making iskin fact i ran lvl 4s in tandem today and did 3 easy ones in about 2 hours and made 88mil on bounties and mission time rewards this oes not count loot  salvage nor does it count the faction drop i got this was shared so count double that as my counterpart didnt do much in the missionsbut this is getting off topic so ill stop here
what about people in major alliances creating freighterhauler alts to do all their important logistics work with 000001 risk factor instead of 01 that they would get with war dec00 logistics is already safer than empire since alliance people in 00 never use stargates only jumping between deathstar pos and then they hide in noob corp for the empire side of the businessnew players also benefit from getting early exposure to pvp if they grow old in eve without ever leaving safety of noob corp they become weak and too content with the carebear lifestyle without realizing what they are missing outthis game shouldnt be too easy and we should accept that this game isnt for everyone the weak must adapt or be greifed into quitting keep eve community healthy
you people are utterly stupid beyond all reasonits truely sad you cant see any further than the end your damn cannonget a freaking brain and try to figure out why this proposal gets shot downeveryfrakkingsingletimeoverandoveragainsorry trying to drill it in for emphasis
oh im fairly certain this will be a no go as usualon a side note drake i see you here so much when do you find time to actually play
grinsi have multitasking vand yes i am on just ask develdrinbroke in my new orca today as to your comment on the threadthis is the same song next verse number 100000000youd thinkpeople would figure it out its a nowin situation you favor one side its unbalancednpcor pvp you will never reach a conclusion without compromising the other
true enough while there are ppl who abuse npc corps there are also ppl who have legit reasons for being in them i spent a while in them myself when i didnt have net access at home cause i didnt feel it was fair to a player corp to sign up when i didnt know for sure when i could play had nothing to do with the fact that i dislike pvp for the most part the only reason i offer ideas to some of the things i reply to is that i have a habit of trying to see things from bothall sides of an issue not always possible but i try hell some of the ideas ive posted have been along the lines of a random what if moment i know they wont necessarily be good ideas but i float them out there for a response and feedback hoping that it leads to an actual good idea
so basically your way is the only way to play the game nice do you even realize what an unmitigated ahat you sound like sadly probably not this is essentially a whining rant against people who have already left npc corps  they just keep alts in themon a side notesince griefing is clearly against the established rules of the game if not the eula and is a bannable offense well be expecting your resignationbanning imminently for advocating its usecan i haz ur stuffs
i do not support this i fail to see how you can properly learn from veterans in the game if you do not chat with them the easiest way to accomplish this is to talk to the vets hanging out in noob corp chat
okfirst off i sincerely apologize if i trolled you a little to muchi would be hypocritical if i didnt respect the effort your putting into making new ideasat least you have the sense to reason it outsecondly as ive said before most of these pvp idiots fail to remember that 75 to 80 of the npc corpies are in fact alts of major alliancecorporation pilots trying to sneak around and do business they normally cannot accomplishand until you get that through your frakking thick skulls yells at the rest of the pvpersyour going to look like a bunch of idiotsjust forcing someone to do something to your so called demands is considered criminal in this gamei did not buy a subscription to this game to be forced to play by someone elses ruleseve is a game of chaos and sandbox you make your own damn rules and you for the most part do as your bloody well pleasethe moment that changes is the moment i quit spending my hard earned money on it and go somewhere elsei choose to be an industrialist so i can make lots of isk and stash it away for the day i can afford to blow gobs of ships up just by pvpin like the rest of you because the funny thing is you guys dont even get paid peanuts to do itstop assuming the world orbits around you you ignorance on the matter is obviousalso keep in mind that i do not favor the carebears in this matter eitherwe need equal portions of both pvping and carebears as you would put itit keeps the game intersting having it go full pvp or full carebears would suck
nope though it would help fight off the macros it makes it too easy to grief ppl
this is easy to fix just one toon account1  new players shouldnt be forced to do anything the moment you force someone like me anywhere  i kick back in this case stop paying2  realize what they are missing cmon you cannot be that selfcentered pvp just is not for everyone most of you are too young to remember elite but eve does the best job of bringing that game into the 21st century please not everyone wants toneeds to play your way the game isnt easy the learning cliff takes out quite enough people now as for greifing people into quitting hmmmm i believe ccp has an answer for that no
so what your saying is you want to cut down on the funding of pvpyoure not very bright some people dont like playing the game the way you do just like in reallife not everyone likes to do the same thingso get off your little pedestal and grow a spine and learn to deal with reality
of course yes losses have to hurtthanks i dont need appreciation from an isk farmersure so go back to wow or hello kitty online or go dress barbie dolls whatever makes you feel good just dont ruin the only decent pvp game
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
quote of a moderated post weathermanalso i think you may need to take your tinfoil hat off im not in an npc corp to address the rest of your rhetorical spin nothing about npc corps makes this wow there is still plenty of pvp to go around im sorry youre not getting enough industrials on your killmails  taking that out here will get you a pat on the head and ridiculei for one dont really care that you dont like npc corps ccp isnt going to just penalize people for not wanting to spam up the game with even more 1 mancorpsgo wardec some macromining corp and stop wasting your time trying to sound intelligent
plays an online game to grow his wallet avoids interaction with other players and never pvps  yep thats your typical npc corp farmer
except im broke in game from losing a ship in wormhole space in pvp i also founded my own corp i was in an npc corp for quite a long time not to make money you sniveling rat but to learn how to play the gamesome people are slow starters bumping this moronic slagfest wont change that nor your paltry amount of support
this game is built on greifing people some to the point of quitting ccp are themselves the biggest greifers in eve because 9 out of 10 new people who try play this game get so bored or frustrated at what ccp forced them to work with that they quit the game without ever getting into it then there are thousands of players who quit routinely over the game changes ccp introduces with patches or because of the negative answers they get in petitionsand if ccp wants to keep their game from turning into wow clone they will continue to encourage greifing separate the weak from the strong no single player or corp has caused more greif to players than ccp
7 out of 10 people agree your full of oh you dont like it when i make statistics up on the spotsez you  o p
the ability to import and export fittings is a great idea but i think there should be an option that would allow you to specify an export format that eft or evemon can understand because right now it only exports as raw xml which is pretty much useless because none of the fitting utilities use it
signed
why is the onus here on ccp to fix it let the eft people learn how to read xml
agreed this is something they need to fix in eft not in eve eve has the ability to export and import its own fittings so they can be shared with whomever you choose that is enough ccp should not be responsible for tailoring the game to 3rd party tools
two specific issues directly related to current scoop mechanics1 when you command some light drones specifically warrior iis to return to drone bay often 12 will try to return but for what ever reason they dont stop mwding when they get into scoop range and as such they will orbit in and out of scoop range while continuously running their mwds its a minor issue but it adds a lot of extra time and attention to achieve what should otherwise be a relatively mundane task getting your drones back into the drone bayto solve the issue which seems to be a relative recent bug would be to simply fixchange back what ever changes caused this or to simply make drones turn off their mwds once they are in scoop range most times at least some of the warrior iis do this just make them all do it2 the second issue that in my opinion is tantamount to a flawed drone scoop mechanics and which seems to cause more headaches then anything else in this regard are the current sentry drone scoop mechanics the issue is prevalent in carriers but it defiantly affects several other shipsclasses of ships as well the issue is especially noticeable in pos sieges when your sentry drones for what ever reason wanderdrift several kilometers away in various directions and can take several minutes to fly after to scoop them all the other option being the continuous scooping and redeploying of sentries to keep them close often this extra time flying after them if some all get out of range cannot be taken and one is forced to either abandon or leave 1020 mil worth of t2 sentries in space less obviously in the case of t1 sentries the issue could be fixed easily enough with a 50100 ms return velocity for sentry dronesa third issue less directly related to drone scoop mechanics then the first two issues but in some respects related none the less is the issue of sentry guns aggroing drones in low sec its fair enough that drones are freely targeted and killed by other npc entities specifically rats but rats also tracking disrupt sensor damp apply ecm fire defenders and neutnos cap all these issue affect various other forms of weapons systemssentries on the other hand apply none of these tactics against players and their weapons systems they do none the less target and destroy drones often in 12 volleys all this seems to do is limit if not remove dedicated drone boats from gate and station camping in low sec dont get me wrong people still find ways to very successfully camp gates and stations they just for the most part rely on nondrone boats to do thisdrone boats are by their very natures balanced around the use of their drones just as other types of pvp ships are balanced around the use of their weapons systems why specifically limit if not remove the use of dedicated drone boats near gates and stations and none of the other weapon typesi could see issues with gate camps supported by posed carriers with assigned fighters but maybe in the case of fighters continue to have sentry drones shoot them but it seems i hate to use this term unfair to limit the use of dedicated drone boats and only dedicated drone boats at gates and stations where the majority of low sec small gang engagements take place
what purpose would this serve how is this possibly worth considering in any way npc corporations are the default none anyways that you end up with a chat channel you can completely ignore is just a side effect
no for many of the reasons already stated on the other hand this gives me an idea
issler dainze  voice of reason candidatewebsite soon tmeve online forum thread soontm
firstly i would like to wish you luck in your campaign i voted for anhk in the last election as i think she did an excellent job in the first term and seems to have done so this time round as well in regards to this section of your manifesto i am very interested to hear your thoughts in this area as i too would love to see that come into play in eve please feel free to contact me in any way you see fit about this or simply post your thoughts and ideas here
confirming i will be voting for this candidate d
hello eriki created the csm chat channel for this very purpose and the third csm is welcome to use it to keep in touch with the playerbase i agree with your viewpoints on informing the players of csm activity but i am currently drawn between you and dierdra for the csm vote i only have one votethat being said i am against the concept of a party in any political system let alone eve if take care is an ethic rather than a party id be all for it as i tried to implement that very concept in csm2keep up the good work and i wish you the best in the upcoming election
i have to concede that despite corporate differences i would certainly vote for lark as he at least has an idea of what he is talking about and appears to have some kind of vision insofar as to the role unlike some catoninetailsi have read your blog very kind of someone to make that for you and think your ideas are well thought out well presented and balanced good luck with it lark i for one hope you make itkrasedited for spellingbeer does that
i would be happy to see someone representing mercs on the csm but alas i dont have the time to do so mahselflarkonis what you gonna do for mercs
helloafter taking some time to reflect on comments both in forums and conveyed directly about my proposal for a political party to represent the players often described as carebears i have decided to run for the third council for stellar managementi will be doing this to guaranty that the proposed voice of reason party will have a candidate in the elections i will be driving party focused dialogs to establish the core tenants of this political organizationat this time i have not formally submitted my application for the election but will complete that in time to comply with the deadlinefirst steps now will be to establish the party and develop the political process to create our visions these early steps will include1 creation of party forums and website2 establishment of the process to join3 establishment of the party planks4 a virtual party convention5 preelection activities to raise visibility and participationother early activities will be creation of logo and selection of a slogan for the party for this electioni want to make it clear that other candidates can join this party and process if they commit to the part values if prior to the election we determine that the party needs to field a reduced set of candidates or even a single candidate i support the idea of an election as part of the virtual convention to select the candidates the party will vote for i will gladly submit to another candidate if the party determines that this will best represent their interests in the csm processso i hope many of you will join me in this new experiment in eve politicsissler dainzeceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accordcsm ii memberfounder of the eve voice of reason party
issleri agree with you in the call for a party and as my colleague ankhesentapemkah has already pointed out above  the call has been heard and take care was formed did you have a look take care is a promise to the voter  give us your vote  we will use it well and we will even tell you whycontinuity  not conservatism but using the methods which were found during a term also in the next term take care delegates need not reinvent the wheel in the councils next term we have a network to communicate to pilots to the council and eventually to ccpefficiency  we are offered a supreme opportunity of participation by ccp in building the best game universe ever take care will make sure that council discussions are aimed at one supreme goal  put the voters voice through to ccp discussions and conflicts must be fought out with that one thought in mind that an issue entry needs to be shaped for ccp to understandcommunication  i know from my own experience how hard it was during the first term to reach information about the topics which were discussed in the council thanks to take care i had a competent partner who would not throw incomprehensible minutes at me but explained what essentially was going ondialog  take care does not make an end to the eternal fight between industry and piracy we keep the fire burning in fact we turn up the heat i enjoy mining outside highsec a lot more because risk is involved more than taking a position towards industry take care takes the position of the moderator who makes sure every voice is heard who understands the need to shape an idea which is in the end put onto the table of the council and has a chance for a majority for a better game i agree very much with herschel yamamoto in that point  take care is a platform to let this conflict be discussed to let it be discussed by many many pilots and to build a strong position from that discussion which can be put onto the table of the counciltake care party for eve csmedited for layout
im with you issler at least insofar as it will not effect the freedom that makes playing eve so great i would be excited to support a canditate who would for example help push the already discussed sov changes that might encourage alliances to be more inclusive to peaceful players that would be a change that would benefit the game in the long run by forcing more interaction between players that is really what makes mmos so great in the first place if thats you im on board
why are you posting a campaign advertisement in a thread about the formation of a separate party

and this is the man running our alliance cripes3 vuk
any progress on this
very soontm instead of just soontm im affraid
well thats something i supposethanks ankh
i love 90 of the updated effects but i have to agree you fumbled the ball on this one ccp give us the womf the omg the brown pants time that these vessals deserveplease
the old one was alot more dramatic
even if i cant watch it devour the amarr system
i would understand them saying flat out no if we asked for it next week but we can wait we just want them to start work in it how long it takes is no issue as long as the current poss get the job done but at this point its like they are ignoring poss and how bad they are in favor of new stuff i do understand the importance of new content but ccp do need to think of all the players that end up running all these poss they said that they would like sov mech and poss to be addressed post trinity and we have seen nothing changedif anything all i and a lot of others want is a simple answer if not today then when will our stick poss be replaced with something that looks like a player owned station and when will you quit disappointing new players who get excited about seeing there first pos only to be let down with the junk in space that it is today
yes i bashed into their heads that there should really be an interbus station to at least fix empire standings on the pirate ones they were very vague but said they would like to see some mechanics that allow it dont expect anything soon for them though faction standings really need to be dynamic based on game events imo it makes no sense to have them fixed like this
supported i would to fly minmatar caps but with the current broken state of them i abandoned the idea in favour of another racezos
what the nag does the lowest damage of all 4 dreads by a large margin maybe its because its 6am here but out of siege damage what on earth are you talking about im completely lost
awesome idea and much needed traing to switch from nid to hel is painful
minmatar ships are made from trash and should also have trash weapons
nope this is in eft with all level 5 skills the main reason that the nag does so much better than other dreads is that it uses four weapons instead of three 2 proj 2 torps and an extra slot for the siege mod its the only dread with 5 highs i did not in that instance throw damage mods into the mix that is only the ships themselves plus weapons  max skills across the board as well as topdamage nonfaction ammo i did not include the siege mode damage because it is moot  all dreads get the same damage boost from siege modehowever as i was writing that i redid it with siege modeand the dps results are the same using longrange turrets the nag takes the cake at 2497 the rev is a close second at 2470 although lack of need to reload may make that better the moros is kinda sad at 1998 and the phoenix is  poor at 1955with shortrange turrets the nag again wins at 3163 moros in second with 3088 revelation with 2823 and the phoenix again loses with 2127 one torp swapped for an ion siegeso yeah the nags damage is not bad per se you just need to do 23 times the training to get it better than everyone elses and even then your tanking ability in a nag is awful in relation to other dreads thats all im saying  weeps at the sorry state of minnie caps
the main reason the nag is terrible is because you have to fit damage mods for both guns while a phoenix or rev can throw 3 damage mods on and it applies for all their weapons the nag throws 4 on and only 2 apply for each weapon the 4 weapons are completely negated by this fact and the fact that only one of the nags bonuses applies to each group of weapons where as the phoenix and rev have two for each gun the moros has one and the crazy drone bonus throw in the fact that faction crystals are easy to come by and last a long time and its easy to see why the rev is the bestthis is of course assuming best case scenario setups as most alliances realize how bad the nag is and just brick tank them
yes please
systemnetwork scannerspersonally i would prefer something linked to sovreignty as a system scanner if sov level then you can anchor a module at a tower make it a big powercpu module so it cannot be on a deathstar and make it fragile then you can have a small gang attack the module offline it and then go on there merry waysov 1 makes people in constellation appear 10 seconds after jump cloak finishessov 2 makes people in constellation appear instantlysov 3 makes people in system appear 10 seconds after jump cloak finishessov 4 makes people in system appear instantlythat way if you hold sov space you get some protection
what protection is local an arbitrary list of names how do you know if player x is in a recon or just sitting in a shuttle somewhereyou use the scannerenhance the scanner scanner sends out a 10second cycle ping when its opened and the window can be made smaller in fact if you remove the local window that people have up separately you instantly have room to place it from there on you can have 2 options active and passive scanactive scan sends out a ping which signals itself to other players running both and active and passive scanpassive scans are useful when cloaked in a covops you have a more limited scan range say 50 and you cannot activate any weapon groupsmodules while in passive modean option to steal from freespace is to have a scanner able to detect a hostile configuration which can determine if the ship on scan is set positive or negative based on standings i dont see why this isnt the best solutiona players that have these vast empty systems and rely on localalts to be afk monitors on hostile fleets now will have to defend the space they claimb covops can still do recon missions in which they were designed forc mining ops still have that level of protection you just cant afk mine solo in yor hulk without at least watching the scanner occasionally for a blipd there is still a mystery especially if the other person is beyond scan range having a full system scan range negates the purpose if hostile configuration is implementedthis option keeps your intel tool that requires some level of intelligence to use it removes local allowing some mystery and not the instablob of some alliances when you want to come down and have some lovebest of all it makes black ops useful
no
so after removing local you give less informations if someone dont use the scanner actively see that as balanced and think that people will not use it actively dont work that way you will get some new player doing that error but the largest part of the people will be pinging the scanner constantly and you will be still giving less information on a passive scan less than the current scanning system and less than active scanremoving the information gathering system can be some pvpers wet dream as they think to get tons of kills that way but the results will be more blobbing and less kills as people will become even more paranoid and stay in high sec not the reverse
i am strongly against itthis will not help pvp it will get some poor random sobs jumped while mining or ratting yes but actually finding a fight with your enemies will be made harder since you cant tell reasonably quickly where hostiles are unless theyre literally on the same grid as you arei only support specialist cloaked ships not showing on local while cloaked thats fair if you want to sneak up on someone get a sneaky ship
are you intentionally trying to be obtusethe autoupdating directional scanner does not need to see anything but manned ships there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to have realtime updates on unoccupied ships asteroids wrecks pos structures and all the other crap that the current directional scanner can scan for all of that can be left for the manual scan that will presumably be left as a subfunction of the new ships scanner
there is no pvp in wspace cause there is no local there see
hes already gotten his ship back along with the destroyed modules hes asking for people to get the droppedie not destroyed modules back in future as well
dang that lucky eri lost dozens of multibillion battleships in pvp and i never petitioned themso ccp officially acknowledges hp bug they have to if they agreed to reimburse can we got some official bug hunter or ccp to confirm
i would really appreciate it if people actually read my post this wasnt about getting reimbursement and it certainly wasnt lag i didnt mention lag in my post at all i said that 2 zealots killed me in 2 volleys under 8 seconds and ive taken on far bigger camps and lived maurauders for anyone who actually has an iq are perfect ships for pvp they have an awesome bonus to both damage and tanks and the only weakness is ecm atleast in the kronoss case as i have already said i do not expect reimbursement my case has already been declined but i think that things need to change for the future
pyramid quoting is not allowedapplebabeare you joking this post is ridiculous and you are actually stupid let me put it this way the maurauder has 9k armor 80 resistances and with t2 aux nano pumps exile booster and the reppers it repairs 2719 armor per repper or 5438 armor every 11 seconds wow at taking on 2 hacs what was i thinking and just for the record i have fraps of me taking on 15 or so hacs and tanking with ease i can upload if you want me too
this isnt the forum for showing off your internet  that would be crime and punishment that said tanking 15 hacs with a 3000ish dps tank sounds like one hell of a feat their drones alone should down you also dont post gm discussions publicly  its not allowed
dangit herschel ya beat me to it that just goes to prove go to work for 8 hours and the whole universe changes while youre gone basically see herschels post above  for the reasons why this will never work unsupported
say is this something i should reportyeah i think i will
has anyone from ccp confirmed existence of hp bugbecause if its real its a game breaker
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
killmails are bugged especially damage dealt in fact i dare you to find one correct killmail since the last patch i see you are claiming hp bug but since ccp denied your request and you cannot show any evidence logs can be modified and one second of fraps is useless there is no reason to believe you i know you are super leader of triumvirate but i have killed some very efamous people and they ed and moaned about lag and dropping when that clearly wasnt the case would like to hear from the people who killed you since they have little reason to lieas for getting your modules back lets think about this shall we by using the petition system you know that petitions especially reimbursement petitions are not answered immediately in fact they usually take a few weeks if you escalate them what happens to dropped modules in a couple of weeks people sell them of course so do you yank the module from someone who legally bought the module no you have to reverse the entire transaction now consider the module changes hands multiple times now you have to reverse a chain of orders and screw up a lot of peoples walletsassets i think you can see the problems that this will cause another what if lets say your corpum lar dropped when you died due to a bug in the game and i loot it i put it on my kronos i get killed in a legit manner a few days later and it drops again ccp grants your petition and all modules now they either have to yank the lar from someone who fairly got the module in a fight or duplicate the module you also run into the situation where if you recovered your own loot with an unaffiliated alt and got your ship back youd have another corpum lar out of thin air from ccpyou might think it is worth it for your super expensive marauder to go through all of that but with a standard t2 loss it is too much work and we cant have different treatment for different people just because they lost a few more expensive imaginary pixelsnice little tri threadnaught you got going on here its cute 
no they havent i have been in plenty of armor based combat with session changes and have not noticed any problems i have noticed that modules refuse to online when i first fit them but anything can happen and strange things have happened on tranquility plenty of timesif there is evidence of an hp bug we really need to get that narrowed down asap as that would be a show stopping bug
well the bug has been fixed now but as an extreme example we noticed that just after the patch our titan which was at the time cloaked in a safe had one hundred 100 armor hpanyway this thread really isnt about the bug or reimbursement for me but as deva said a call out for a clear and fair reimbursement policy for the future i dont really see why people dont want this how many people have had petitions that have been succesful then petitioned again with the exact same problem and it gets rejected there is quite simply no consistency on ccps part
i have reported your post as it is once again off topic this isnt about tri or me so please take your bitterness towards us and throw it out the window read my entire post again and actually try and understand what im saying this is no mail bug and i got the ship back
while i can see how this works in a 1v2 battle how does it work in a larger battle where the process of obtaining your loot may cause several other people to lose their ships doing so only to then be denied the loot because the original destruction was a bugyes its a bug yes it sucks but unless its an exploit i cant see how you can justify the amount of time it would take to come to a decision about what to do in x situationyou certainly cant give isk as well as the modules what if an ally scooped the modules free isk what if you then knew how to reproduce the bug more free iskalso you petitioned and quickly received your ship back  after a patch even  wowkeep in mind that with every loser there is a winner and when you lose something to a bug you can thinkknow its a bug but the minute someone loses their loot from someone they killed it will be for certain a gm acting inappropriately
i agree it would be difficult if not impossible to take back said items from the players who have them but if the servers show clearly there was a bug i see no reason why ccp cannot simply give isk as a means of compensation to that player think about the isk lost even in a fleet battle in loot it would probably come to no more than 12 bil even in a battle of 100s of people unless someone fitted pimped gear that ammount of isk being given back to players for their loot wouldnt make a dent in the economics of eve but it would be fair which is really what i would like to see if their logs dont show anything then fine but for the blatant bugs such as mine where yeah within 24 hours i did get the ship back i should also get everything else back again i am not asking for reimbursement now but merely using my loss as an example because its the best one i have
signedsucks losing a ship to a ccp feature good luck recovering
if a bug is identified as a bug and reimbursement takes place it has to be complete that would be bad for those who benefited from the bug as theyd lose the modules but when did ccp ever allow those who took advantage from a bug allow to keep it especially not since it even fits the exploit rules when i shoot something that goes pop so easily that i should know something is amiss i would have to petition it myself even if it is to my disadvantage at least that is what the rules say when i last checked
this is a toughie on one hand i agree in prinviple that its a tough loss which should have been advoidable howeveri assume you have been playing a while and know the reimbursement policy if that is true you should be aware of the tough stance ccp take on these reimbursement issues and also you should know that as soon as you undock anywhere your ship and mods are at risk either due to game mechanics desynclag ecti remember a while a go i undocked in a pod during a war dec black screened long enough for my pod to go pop losing implants this was petitioned falling on deaf ears  but i accepted it grudgingly for me travelling in 00 and low sec in a faction fitted ship adds to the adrelenien so with those thoughts and the difficulty ccp have for tracing and returning lost mods i cannot support this although i do feel for your loss and for that im sorry to read what happened
thats exactly what i mean though i knew the second i saw those mods lived i wouldnt get them back but ive been far too lazy to fight the cause of full and fair reimbursement because ive never really lost anything of high enough value to botherbut i think its something that should be changed
i would support a fair and standardised method of reimbursement by the gms and on those accassions where a esculation happens a more human approach is adopted by the gms rather than them applying rules1differantly to differant people2in cases where a exception can be made based on sound judgement and if the situation warrants it my main gripe with ccp is applying rulings unfairly and differantly to differant players if your op included a reform of the reimbursement policy and procedure to include my points above  you will have my support 
signzored
since so many morons fail at reading even when the op repeats ithere the storyship goes into gate campship dies and drops modsccp reimburse ship and destroy mods but not the drop modshere what the op is requestingthat drop mods also be return to the owner of ths ship in a case that ccp does reimburse a shipi dont see any logical reason not to support they dont have to take the items from the people who loot the wreck just give the person all their stuff backthis game is already eats up a lot of time losing a few billion to a glitch that ccp is willing to reimburse for got to suck
if the proposal read likei recently had a ship reimbursed after i lost it in a glitch they did not reimburse the billions of isk worth of modules that dropped from the ship however this policy should be changedi would have supported instead of that he wrote a two page pityparty about losing is fraking kronos if he wants my support he can clean up his main post or maybe the halfdozen posts in response to dissention that sound like this are you stupid  do you think two zealots can break a officer fitted kronos tank with 2vollys shocked and roll your eyes again to darkness the lord ill slap you in the faceim not stupid for thinking a marauder cant tank two hacs solo anyway neither is isaac main poster is a rude jackass and i havent seen any evidence to support the claim that ccp wouldnt reimburse the modules from a bugkilled shippersonally i think its generous they gave him anything
i support this and ive been wondering why its been this way for some time my friend used to fly a typhoon in lvl 4 missions and it looked like he was giving birth to missiles at a rate that would make rabbits jealousi dont see how this could add too much effort to the cpu as we can already turn off a lot of effects the only thing that would complicate this issue and not by much mind you is finding where to put the things on the already small ships such as a rifter the line of effect should be easy for the clients to calculatesigned
agreed
its one of those things we all just got used to and to a point accepted but that doesnt make the request any less valid
i have been wanting something like this since 2003 i guess pi mean the icons of the launchers even show how they could look just put it in allready
needs looking at explosion velocity is ridiculous
definatly supported the numbers say it all and cit torps are just pathetic currently
so i trained a phoenix a few months ago the moment it was ready i hopped on sisi and started pew pewing and realized that the missiles go about 1kms and cant hit anything that moves for any damage at all the ship is so laughably bad that i sold the charactercitadel torps need a big boost for both the phoenix and naglfars sake its really pretty sad how awful those dreads are compared to the others
i quote this and remember the thumbs up 
the concept of a physical skillbook that must be transported makes no sense and adds nothing to the game
theres your problem  the within 4 au mechanic has changed stuff can be anywhere now meaning that a rack of cores isnt enough also its not worse in any meaningful way because its not a choice between the two you can scan with cores or you can scan with ds and cores nobody scans with just dsat least not after this nerf you find it to 2 au range reel your ds probes launch cores and finish the job adds about thirty seconds to your scan time as for the fourprobe complaint i think we all agree its unrealistic i just dont expect to see it change because then theyd have to rebalance everything from scratch
deep space probes are still useful for quickly canvasing very large systems for exploration sites if you want to visit any of those sites you can easily switch to exploration probes and get to work just because the deep space probes are no longer the be all end all of scanning doesnt mean they are uselessit was a good nerf
a only using four probes ensures that scanning is about placement not ting out as many probes as you can and throwing them around a hit i like the lack of clutter thank you its hard enough to see whats going on with four overlapping probes nevermind 8b what youre proposing is basically making scanning easier its already easy to scan down stuff if you were to double the scan strength of dsps allowing you to scan down sites even faster then youd need to make all signals harder to find youd either just raise the skill cap to explore with any decent measure of success or make exploration once you hit astrometrics v incredibly easy
i can support what the other delegates in the csm with me have said i would also like to point out that it makes no sense that the developers would sacrifice the game they know and love for the epeen of saying i have 3 trillion dollars ccp is a business and as such it runs by rules to ensure the game continues to move smoothly
it is a good thing that ccp employees play the game because it is the best and only way to ensure that they know what the game is all aboutit is a good thing that they do so on the live server because the test server is not a true representation of the actual game environment since it follows a lot of different rulesit is logical that they make isk for their characters somehowit is also logical that they do so based on what they know as long as that does not include using exploits they cant avoid knowing things after all you dont expect them to drug themselves thick and dozy every time they play rightyou have to trust in ccp ccps internal watchdogs and the csm to keep a watchful eye on this if you dont it makes no difference anyway because if ccp actively tried to smash the game theyd succeed with or without your trust with or without controls even if it just meant to go bozo on the server blades with a fire axe that would be pretty dumb though after all eve is their biz not just their hobby
im gonna believe they have rules for playing on tq  its a damn shame they arent public thoim sure they woud never ruin the game they worked on so hard however they might think its fun to get rich and wage wars on tq if even the ia team thinks its fun for them to wage wars we got a problem as it can get pretty unbalanced to fight someone with near unlimited iskim into pvp a lott but i dont like putting a lott of efforttime into beating a enemy that has unlimited resources it is why when the t20 thing got out i started to put very little serious effort into evechanged from a 10 hours a day pvper believing everyone can be defeated to a pvper that plays a few hours a day casualy as the person ur fighting might be one these ccp guysquestion is  is it funallowed for them to wageorganise wars or notand from what you have seen are they into that stuff on tq or is that nda aswell
you do realise that this forum is for the bringing of ideas to the attention of the csm and not ccp internal affairs rightdamn you fail
well done
are you a shareholder or something ccp is a privately owned company so no they didnt make the game for you they made the game for themselves and released it to the public in order to create profit that they even listen to people in order to improve the game and thus their profits you should be thankfull for
cripes another mm loser that believes all the propaganda his leaders spew outget it through your tinfoil covered head ccp is not out to get everyone and there is not a great ccp conspiracy on tq most ccp employees have no idea how the market is going to react to changes just like the rest of us any sort of blatant market manipulation based on insider info would be easily caught by ia

youre under the impression here that concord is new edens police force its not its the carebear defence league  if you shoot a bearone that isnt stupid enough to reflip a can or similar at least concord comes to smack you around its not supposed to be balanced its not supposed to be fair its supposed to be a deterrent backed up by the banhammer such that the bulk of eves user base can play the game in relative peace and that will never ever change get used to it
good god no
i value pew pew as much as anybody in this game and maybe more but i still groan every time i see i get rid of concord thread i realize this is not precisely what youre proposing but the bottom line is concord exists for a very important purpose just because you need to get your pew pew fix doesnt mean we should be able to evade concord if you part nonconsenting under prepared riff raff from their ships just go to wspace
ccp makes industry a fulltime training job someone who really wants to explore the industry side cannot train the skills to keep up with a pirate you want to remove their protection just so you can have easier access to easy targetsyou wouldnt happen to own a van that likes to sit outside elementary schools do you
i remember a long time a go it was possible to outrun concorde specially when ur mine exploded in 00 whilst you were out and abouthowever it was decided that breaking concorde rules was punishable by a ship loss and it has become a exploit if this was somehow advoidedi fully agree with the current mechanics and do not support the op
hell no
itt op doesnt grasp the concept of concords wtfpwn setuphow about concord pods and can nullify your clone contract in empire corp stations
not supporting thishigh security space it is high security for a reason namely the protection of law abiding citizens those who break high sec laws get punished if caught just like in real lifeif you want pew pew then stay in low secnull sec or declare an empire war
i want to be ablr to collect exotic dancers and open a strip club when we get corp storefronts
how old are you try being constructiveedit just checked your avatar ingame and you are an obvious troll you have barely been playing five minutes and i doubt you have got any killmails from shooting mining lasers at roids
as i said at the start the people that are against do not really offer any good reason as to why we haveneed kms if people really need to keep a record of what they do then why not just fraps itas most people seem to do anyway if you want the enemy setup then scan the ship if you want stats then keep a diary do any of you remember when ascn lost their titan the first titan ever made did you need to see a km to know it had been popped the answer to that is no
actually several good reasons have been given 1 it makes sense ingame that people would look at the wreckage to see what exactly they killed2 its a game people like keeping score3 the game should do that kind of monotonous recordkeeping for you not demand that you do it yourself 4 tracking corpmate performance to help you improve their play 5 tracking corporate performance for the purposes of creating a clear and unambiguous combat record which can then be used toeg advertise mercenary services 6 theres no good reason to remove them its fine l2p also i know i dont use fraps  doesnt it utterly ream your system performance my computer isnt exactly the fastest machine on the market it cant handle another highneed program while eves running besides expecting players to be forced to use thirdparty tools when the firstparty tool already exists is silly
signed for the counterargumentcloaking is a balanced mechanic as it exists in the game you cant find them but they cant harm you and if they try to harm you theyre doomed the exception of course being stealthrole ships since that is their purpose to hide and lie in wait and ambush but compared to similar ships theyre still weaker combatwiseyes cloaked ships are impossible to scan down the cloaking device bends all electromagnetic radiation around it seamlessly rendering it invisible to any form of detection while it is cloaked its sensors are offline as well so it is not emitting anything that a probe would pick up on since it is far too small to register passively on magnetometric and gravimetric sensors
i was watching the video of revelations and in the background of space you can see thousands of stars in a narrow band seperate from the basic background stars all around you these are the stars that we can travel to in game and that we see when we open map it depicts the stars all around us and its so neathowever after revelations ccp no longer has the map stars visible in the background just the basic background stars are visible i am wondering if they can put them back into the game because seeing the stars in the background as you play helps with immersion i think i wonder if they removed them from view because they created lag or why dont they have them visible in the background anymorecan we get them back visible again maybe even add in the thousands of stars we can go to via wormholes too that would be neat to see as you look around your ship in space
to me it sounds way more logical if all the ceos had to vote for some important decisions such asdisbanding allianceinvitingkicking a corporationhell what about simple introducing shares of a sort this way the guy who started the alliance can decide if he likes a vote system or not
im for the pvp community i hope to represent them at best of my efforts 
sounds wonderful but what specifically are you in favor of
frankly i would not feel comfortable with small gang pvp in your hands
thanks for asking gothar there are a number of ideas that i personally like include looking at group dispersal weapons both modifying the existing ones ie smartbombs and launched bombs to make them more use able and the creation of new types such as chaining weapons one of the key areas though that i feel could benefit the small gang pvp group would be an in game record of intelligence gathering allowing the fc to better track what is going on outside of his own vision i would like this to be integrated into the map so a commander could at a glance see the disposition of potential enemy forces assuming he has scouts in the area obviously this would benefit large scale pvp as well but i think the effect it would have on small gang pvp would be extremely beneficial obviously this wouldnt replace the old tested methods of voicecomms and a pen and paper but it would supplement it the long outstanding issue of transferable kill rights if implemented would also help to increase the opportunities for solo pvp and am very much in favour of this issue and would hope to be able to raise it again with ccp i feel the concept of bounty hunter subcareer would not only fit right in with the feel of eve but would open up exciting opportunities to those who like to spend time gather intel and finally strike at the moment they think is right the issue surrounding it that would be problematic in my eyes would be the old clunking bounty system which at the same time would need an overhaul beyond these areas i think that factional warfare could do with a change to decrease the benefit of large numbers of people in a single plex capturing it although that ideas isnt fully formed in my mind how it would work and therefore i cant go into much detail right now these are just the ideas that have captured my imagination so far that have been bought up by various people of course and if a proposal is put up in the assembly hall that would benefit the area of solo and small gang pvp it would get careful consideration from me if i were to be on the csm well thanks for the input anyway sak please feel free to give your reasons so the other people reading this can be aware of your concerns and better come to their own decision
i like your ideas and may vote on you good luck in the electionerem
heartstone bunyipthank you for closely reading my op and let me give you a few thoughts regarding the two topics you were touchingsandbox and factional epic warfareour positions are very much related heartstone and i can see where you are coming from jades plea for more pilotstoryline interaction is among the most captivating ive ever read and using fw as one possible vehicle to flatten individual and erratic influence onto possible storyline branches is quite clever still as we stand today the sandbox is too imaginative factually decoupled from the games foundation ie the plot anyone still remember why we have fw its war stupid and isk is the least original incentive for player activityon the other hand sandbox and storyline impact present two economic challenges to ccp  how to balance gooning which threatens effectivity of investments and how to offer content with as little man power as possible  one part of the solution and very much web 20 in that regard is to let the players create content and the second is to give them choices  not too many choices for man power reasons  and make sure the choices depend on many pilots rather than one that is why i advocate two ideas as my very own agenda  tradable kill rights programmable npcsthe former might one day replace concord and the latter i see as a major milestone to boost the sandbox into a new dimension  it will bear a sister to the playerdriven economy which is the playerdriven mission system it will link wis to space and it comes for almost free for ccpwe should cooperate heartstone and make sure that ccp shift their focus accordinglya party is a party is a partyand then again bunyip  it is not look at it as a mechanism to make the communication pilots  ccp more efficient ill give you three examplesissues are not always risen by posting on the forum let alone the right forum which is the assembly hall the mass of pilots is using their network of friends to communicate and exchange that is where the idea of our party network kicks in  having a csms ear everywhere thus many good ideas will not only be discussed on an alliances forum but also picked up from the perspective of a councils member who knows how to work with the issue until is gets presented to ccpsecondly the csm has rules which are written and then there is the unwritten governance regarding communication within and to ccp having the party as mechanism to assure forwarding of experiences from ankhesentapemkah to me will bring continuity into the discussion between csm and ccp not so much in terms of evas personal favourite issues to be continued but knowing how to deal with people that will allow me to start at full speed and give both csm and ccp a predictable read reliable team player in the end this is to the benefit of pilots who will turn to me to have their ideas representedthirdly and just mentioned as a pilot you will want to find someone to get your ideas through to ccp nothing more teadious than now having to convince the csm first before ccp reads your idea take care has a clear identity in addition to the above said professional yet less tangible aspects  small industry  gangs roleplay balanceif you as a pilot have an idea in this area take care will be your addressee and your voice to ccp
introductionmy name is weazy and im running for the csm i thought about doing this the last two times and basically assumed that the people who would run would be representing the majority of eve online players however through following the progress made by the last two councils i would be neglecting my responsibilities as a player if i did not run the bickering pointless arguing and general neglect of the playerbase has led me to believe that the people who have been in csm have done a poor job making any noticeable progressbioplatformfirst and foremost i am a pvper i dont mine i dont rat i dont plex and i dont build my only occupation is 00 combat both small gang and pos seizing i am under the impression that eve was designed to be a combat environment with a secondary emphasis on everything else i currently fc for the dara cothrom alliance in cloud ring where i run ops daily in all combat situations defense roams pos seizing and gatecamping i am not a pirate i do not grief new players but i spend my time in eve as a human wrecking ball over the last few months i have observed the shifts in pvp tactics from an fc and combat perspective and think i can provide ccp with valuable insight as to how combat in 00 works and can be improved im not signing up to run because i hate falcons or think amarr is overpowered im running to represent the so far neglected voice of combat pilots who have always adapted to flavor of the month combat and will continue to kill because thats why we play the game i have been playing eve since 0707 and run three accounts with my two mains at around 30m sp each i have been a member of many 00 and high sec corps and alliances including bruce daco pure and others i have experience as well with high sec mission runningt1 and t2 productioninventionresearch and am well versed in the carebear arts but i have enough isk so i dont need to manufacture any more my toons encompass all four races so i am not partial to any in particular i have led fleets to all ends of the universe and my favorite type of op is of course the small gang roamreal life infoim a 23 year old student living in the southern united states i attend university with studies in a broad range of topics ranging from history to computer science summaryif you vote for me you will be voting for someone who really enjoys combat and will work with ccp to make it as fun as possible i have many ideas to bring to the table and know i can make a contribution to the combat side of evea vote for weazy is a vote for pew

hello allmy effort in the campaign as a csm will be focused on pvp let me introduce myself my friends call me leo or ruri i am 24 and study business management at university currently in my final year i hope to set up my own wine importexport business soon when im not out or studying youll probably find me online on evemany players love this game because it offers the most fun pvp out there in the mmorpg selection out there my focus will be directed to interfacing with the pvp focused community and to make that voice heardarguments that will be discussed with the community will be matters such asthe current sovereignty system how can we make more fun and less boredom warlow sec loss of sec status rebalanced make low sec engagements less demanding but keep empire safeish without limiting access to someone just because he popped a couple of shipsrevise the bounty system to make a bounty hunter profession viable where assassination contracts are handed out between players playercorp a hires playercorp b to kill player c no point in assigning me a bounty so that i can pod myself in my clone with no implants to collect the bounty maybe the contract could specify variables such as if ship kill or pod kill required maybe if ship what classfrigbcbs capital etcwreck ownership if you kill something and a third party steals it flags the thief to both wreck ex owner and aggressoravoid corp hopping schemes make it so that if someone joins a corp he cannot un join for a period of time 35 dayswork and talk with community and devs to find a way to let players that in the sandbox choose a purist pvp a way to survive purist missioners make loads of money purist miners also a pure pvp char will have many more costs but substantially less rewards this needs to be rebalanced also links in the next point of t2 efficiency over price vs insurable t1 what point is there in having many solutions and many ships when they are not viablework with ccp to find a way to give small hacrecon gangs a game play more enjoyable maybe not bring nanos back but find a way that gives small groups more choice of mobility in engagementdisengagement what i would like to express in this point is the difficulty of groups of skilled players to be effective a 50 mil sp char on a hacrecon vs a 12 mil sp char on an insurable bs should take in account not only the sp count but also the cost of utilizing a 250 mil un insurable hacrecon or a insurable bsalso a discussion on the surrender war option to make it so an official contract is accepted by the ceos of the two corps where an item exchange section is displayed and a safe time in days is displayed so that the cessation of the war is mutually agreed by both parties the winners take the agreed cashassets and concord can sanction the contract by saying that for x amount of agreed days the winning party cannot declare war again before the end of the agreed contracti hope i can do my best for my brother and enemy pvpers so that we can all stay in this fun place and keep enjoying itplease send me feedback and talk with me my voice is yours to useleonardo dalessandro  ruri dant
question in what way do you see the establishment of a political party as having any effect in a nonbinding advisory body such as the csmyouve indicated that you put some thought into doing this and im wondering how this will actually matter what are you thoughts madamedit apologies didnt see the party post before putting question here if you like you can direct your response there
i looked and i dont think that the party referenced was anywhere close to succeeding in gaining support the fact i had to have someone point me at a thread outside the forums that were used for promoting candidates indicated to me that the party was not viable in the form it exists nowas to the stated vision of the take care party i believe that the party should decide if they need to reinvent the wheel the voice of reason party has no interest in keeping a fire burning we seek to assure the freedoms we believe are essential to our members within the basic tenants of eve that risk and reward are directly related and that the pilots of eve have the right to choose the degree of risk they will most enjoy that when the risks of eve are all compared that there remain a logical relationship to the rewardswe are conservative in that we believe that the fundamental principles of the riskreward framework must be maintained we are however a party that embraces changes that maintain the balance but add new and interesting elements to our lives in spacei have announced my commitment to the voice of reason party in a separate threadbest of luck to all candidates and any political affiliations they happen to represent in the upcoming election of the csm iiiissler dainzefounder of the voice of reason party
thisi vote on individuals not partys a csmcandidate can be a bear and have good ideas that improve eve for everyone without tilting the game the game to much in a certain direction that will alienate other players with their preferable game style however im 100 certain that you issler are not that person that i can trust with such thingsandas for the name im sure you thought you were clever when you come up with that for your party but for me that is just a big warning sign it reminds me of small often extreme local parties who desperately tries to get their ideas heard but no sane individual takes seriously and gets hardly any votes on election day no doubt you will get all your friends in honda accord to vote you in a second time but i hope more reasonable people look elsewherebut at least the name tickled my funnybone for a seconderemedit fixed some typosedit fixed more typos
we can pretend all we like but theres not a whole lot of leeway between carebearism and wanting to lick carebear tearsits a 01 togglerepresenting being left alone as a blow to pirates rights is a bit of a sham isnt it either one person gets to be the sad panda or the other
for reference my position on this issue is as follows there is no place in the csm for political parties the csm is meant to represent the eve community as a whole and not just a select group of people whilst personal focus of individual candidates may influence where they put their vote and what subjects they cover due consideration must be given to all topics by all csm members with as little bias as possible the idea of voting blocs parties and vote trading seems to me to smack of corruption to quote james madison the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties  james madison the federalist 10 thursday november 22 1787edit for spelling
of course there is a place for parties  how can the pilots those who vote be sure that an individual candidate will represent their vision as he might claim to do  except the faint incentive to be reelected one time for a voluntary job there is only his bio and his network which define himin addition to that most of us show their alliance  corporation in the posts would you display them if you were not in favour of their position and deem showing your affiliation to be helpful to your cause  that is whya i show my face to the voterb i think players will appreciate a csmthemed affiliation on top of any ingame referenceas for the 1787 reference of madison i tend to answer pragmatically  would we have parties if they did not do a good job  cause on one hand parties are apparently well condensing peoples opinion to an executable position and on the other hand they balance individual eccentricity to make sure the public good is not forgotten my rough estimation  more harm was done by selfcalled peoples representatives who did not have a stabilizing surrounding
not at all read the op this isnt so much to make lowsec space harder to get into than to make it a more enticing and worthy challenge as a mission runner i can certainly see this idea having legs and taking offi also see this controlling the 10 population

not a very big change but i would be good if on the orbit option in the overview we can have perhaps 3 defaults set so can change range fast while in combat rather than having too bring up the box and manually swap the orbit range ie one can be set for close orbit one outside of scram range and another at the gtfo range as it is now if want to hold a gate in close before the jump got to swap to say 1k then keep remembering to change it to outside of scram range and tbh when in a drunken gang it does make for comedy deaths and missed tackles etc but even those wear thin after a while so please give us a chance to preset a few more defult orbit ranges
and support
sure
great idea
supported and id also like to be able to map the orbit range options to hotkeys
this
great idia plus the hot keys 
frankly id like to be able to have default keep at range and orbit configurable to my overview tab view since i constantly use different ones defending on whether i am mining or mission running
i like most of these suggestions yes

missile nerf imho was aimed squarely at reducing the number of caldari players dont expect it to change until the numbers among the races are more balanced

yes fix the damn minmatar caps please i hate being laughed at for being a naglfar pilot and in fact most corps i am apart of expect me to either train to a phoenix or a rev 
well now my almost exclusivly minmatar specced pilot has started training up the amarr gun and ship skill trees toward a rev im sure not gonna fly a nag like it is id rather be on the field in a typhoon than a nag pfix it before i get too far in my amarr online ship training plz
the numbers are in but they are wrong you are ignoring the moros drone bonus and the fact the nags damage mods only applies to two turrets eachnews flash this just in you cant transfer energy to a seiged dreadnought
caldari dreads  smartbombs  0 dps since the torps will get destroyid 
they fixed this

1 you havent definite your less information before this post 2 most of the posters suggest a range reduction in passive mode and that is the best way to make the scanner useless3i would very much want to see other things beside manned ships for example probes drones maybe wrecks it will give me an idea what the other guy is doing cans same reason as wrecks unmanned ships if identified as such the function of a scanner is to get an idea of what is happening not simply to know there are 3 pings
oh yes wouldnt make 00 as boring
if you dont understand what weve said then just say so1 what are you asking2 read again you misunderstand3 okas to your last part its the same interface only actively scanning makes you more visable thus the ping reference
till the post 65 i cited no one has defined in any way what less information when auto scanning was i dont agree that reducing them to only manned ship is a good idea but at least it define a starting pointsaying you havent understood what what we are saying when you hadnt defined that vital point has no meaning maybe you should read the posts again suggestion so far1 replace local with a pos addon linked to sovereignty2 passive scan with reduced range3 no we dont want a auto repeating scan good having a starting point helpedthe last part mean that getting only the ships and pods hopefully is getting there are x pings targets or however you want to call thempeople need to know more informations to try to guess what they are doing so if i lose local with his friendnot friend display i need to have more informations by the scanner to compensate for example if i am in high sec and seeorcapod apod bpod cunmanned combat ship 1unmanned combat ship 2unmanned combat ship 3and then it change toorcamanned combat ship 1manned combat ship 2manned combat ship 3as a miner i can suspect i am in trouble even if i dont see that there are 3 red flashing guys in system a useful feature to add to an active scanner if local is removed is the detection of friendly transpondersie i actively scan and send out a signal all friendly blue pilots transponders reply and the relative ships are identified as allied the others simply as not identified
seeing how the 2 post about reduce range when in passive mode are yours 50 range and 3 au can you care to explain how that will make the passive mode useful
this only works in wh space atm because there are a limited number of poss up without a bazillion ships foating in space plus most wh system i have encountered have been fairly small in reality in proper 00 it just wont work
no
if youre not using the scanner and its just sitting there exactly what would it matter other than a quick glancesee you want to have everything simple and easy and handed to you you want to get a full picture of the situation without any work as you posted above you want to know for sure based on scan results if some ships are manned or not or what changes have taken place hell lets just make a huge systemwide map that shows everyones position and what theyre doingno a scanner should essentially say x ship is roughly y aukm away and in z direction with n accuracyive posted the interface will not change but if this would be a local replacement with the scanner constantly being on the main ui then unless hunting for someone actively then reduce the range and add some mystery stop wanting to play the game on easy mode
because there is people like you that want to get a easy ganker mode3 au passive range is laughable it will not detect any probe but then probably you dont want probes detected it will detect a ship that is already warping to your position and only a pair of seconds before it drop on you coupled with a refresh cycle of some seconds it mean it will miss a ship warping to you at least 75 of the timethat mean that passive scanning is totally useless at that point we return to step one mash the scan button every 2 seconds and kill the server and find the scanner made useless by lag you dont want a replacement to the local system you want what you dream is a get plenty of kills systembut the effect of a change like that would be exactly the same of the change of the probing system with kalia pair of week of easy ganking of mission runners then years of cries in forum where are all the low sec missionrunenrs force them to run in low sec we dont have targetyou will not get more easy pickings you will simply increase the number of empty systems and cloaked shipsmaybe you think that cloak on line will be a beautiful game i think it will be a total waste of bandwidth
yep i really rack up those kills oh wait you see heres where people like you have a huge problemyou say nope that wont work so instead of finding a way to fix it here and there you throw everything outheres a thought passive scan range 14 au active is 25 ausuddenly nothing changes except we get an auto scanner that broadcasts the locationlocal does nothing to prevent anyone from getting ganked oh wait thats unless you use it as a batsignal when to run hide and log outbecause when you run to station you cant do anything you cant scan where heshe is for all you know theyre cloaked and afklocal does absolutely nothing right now but give a false sense of security enhance scanning by benefiting those that want to be found and those that dontmake it so stealth has a purposemake it so hunting down people takes workmake it so theres no instabroadcast of whos in spacemake it so alliances cant take 100 systems with 30 peoplemake it so 00 industrialists have to actually be cautious instead of parking a scout 2 jumps upits a joke and im an industrialist
signedlocal shouldnt show you in any systems if your not talking
learn to read i clearly show how item duplication and ownership of dropped loot cannot always be distinguished due to alts and trading and marketcontracts report me all you want throw a tantrum whine and holler no one caresunder your idea which you have changed from getting all items back to getting isk value back and who determines the amount of isk to be given back hmmmill go very slowly and hopefully youll actually engage brain this time1 you get popped to a bug faction module drops2 your unaffiliated alt picks up faction module3 you get back your ship  all modules via petition4 your alt also gets isk since ccp refunded the items it took away from your alt that looted all the modulesget it
signet sooooooooo much signetthis policy is more then just rediculesssince you only get your ship back if it was killed due to a bug i dont see how they can let people be rewarded by using the bug which is actually exploiting this is so rediculess and should be fixed immidiatelysigned signed signed aaaaand signet p
you have records of everything in eve it is just to ran everything back module wisemeaning if you got a module due to a bug it will be removed and you will rescieve a eve mail where it states that it was a bug and therefore was removed and if it was done on purpose it would have been a exploit and therefore banneble so people complaining clearly know it is a bug and therefore wish to exploit well shouldnt need to say more
im torn on this issue as wellunless ccp can find that the items have not changed hands fitting to a ship refined or jetision i would say yes give the mods backbut the problem goes back to the logs show nothing and trying to track those items let alone the chance that someone doesnt try to quick sell the mod for isk or fit it to their shiney shipi think it could leave room open for abuse and cause more problems then it solvesthe hp bug is something i hadnt heard of before but its just that a bug and its good you got some reimbuirsedi support you in ideal but in the current devplayer relationship through petitions the time it takes usually to resolve reimbuirsment its not fesible to implement imo anyways
im with ignit on this one as well its sort of like the legal principle that the will not disgorge an unknowning purchaser of stolen merchandise i do believe certain exceptions should apply such as the wreck being popped before being looted but id be curious as to how youd redress this problem creating items or removing them from people who through no fault of their own came into possession of them before id give my full support
the problem with this is that it starts to throw the rarity of a lot of mods into question wait dark werent you the raison detre for the speed nerf in you 18 kms vaga oh screw you not supported
yet again i ask you to read my post and if you have a look at the bottom i havent changed my mind on anything i said market average value in isk is a possible option as to your exploit what so ok if it is a genuine bug then it would most likely be at random like all bugs are so in your situation you would run the risk of blowing up your own expensive items and run the risk that a you get it back and b the expensive modules are the ones that live if ccp put a banning rule on this sort of behaviour i highly doubt anyone would try it because it would be incredibly difficult to do so plus bugs are very different to exploits exploits are consistent bugs are randomall your posts are saying to me is that you have some kind of personal dislike for me or tri and you still have not fully read my opening post
i think there are two possible fixes for this either give the player isk back based on the average market price or perhaps impliment a new petition section giving it priority much like petitions filed under stuck say we call this new petition option bugged loss the player who has lost his ship or items petitions saying i beleive my loss was due to a bug etc etc the gm then freezes the items or removes them from game temporarily and passes the petition on to the reimbursement department who can then do a full and normal investigation taking as much time as required for it this minimizes the work load on ccp and doesnt  a load of people off who have shifted sold or used the modules themselves by having the items taken back the petition response generally on a stuck enquiry for me has never been longer than an hour or so no item can move very far in that time
dark i know youre smarter than this to not see how many horrifically myopic problems the bolded bits would bring in
its just a possible solution but i would be interested to see possible arguments imagine also that ccp said abuse of this system would have punishment i doubt many people who arent drunk would do it
we just need ccp to stop responding like robots and actually consider what happened and as far as i know this bug still hasnt been fixed i keep seeing it
gather the evidence and report it i consider this to be a very serious issue  yet theres not enough evidence to show that it really does exist in a way suggested in this thread a bug like that would be of critical importance to fixotherwise its just rumors and excuses by people who lose stuff where is the evidence
were playing the same game here right
drunk people will petition anyway regardless of situation or drop down options also ephemeron the only evidence i can provide could also be falsified the only way for you to really know is through a gm reply but i dunno how you get that

ive no idea if its the exact same bug but you can see basically the hp bug happening in one of farjungs old vids edit wave of mutilation 1110 in from several years back where he two volleys a freighters hull with a blasterthron theres been quite a few reports of it just recently so i dont think theres any doubt its a real bug thats not the point of the thread thoughthe reimbursement policy is horribly inconsistent theres no debating that you can submit the same request in identical circumstances and depending on the gm you get you either receive your ship back immediately or have to wade through lots of firm nos an escalation or two and then quite possibly a yesi have heard of a couple of cases of looted mods being reimbursed or duped rather unfortunately i cant cite concrete cases i guess even with a nodupe policy recreating the odd t2 mod seems insignificant to the gms i dont know what the solution is we used to have a set of implicit precedents like no looted mods reimbursed no supercaps reimbursed no ships from fleet battles reimbursed all these policies were grossly unfair but at least they hit everyone in the same waynow theyve all been broken gms take every case on its own merits that should be the ideal policy but unfortunately theyve proven several times now that theyre just too prone to ballsing it up theyre obviously overworked and with eve being as complex as it is its hard for them to hire enough knowledgeable people but something is very wrong if they cant even consistently call the headline cases correctlythe specifics suggested here on what to do about dropped loot i cant support there are too many corner cases it may not be a big deal to try to reimburse several bil in lowend officer gear fortunately isk isnt instawin in eve but there are a lot of items in eve that are so rare you just cant put a market value on them if the gms cant even notice how long an alliance has existed before changing its name how can we trust them to accurately determine the value of a t2 hac bpo looted in a bug ideas to try to freeze loot associated with suspect losses is just unworkable in generaluntil we reach a situation where genuinely unbiased commonsense usually prevails in petitions i tend to think hard limits with noexceptions on various reimbursement scenarios is the unfortunate way to go nevertheless ill support reimbursement policy being raised by the csm not because it will lead to a silverbullet solution but because it will remind the gms they have a lot of room for improvement however hard that improvement will bei know vuk campaigned on customer support in general and probably will again and has been very tough on the gms whenever hes gotten the chance but im not sure its ever come up as an official csm issue so heres a tick and lets hope it doesid also personally like to see more qa effort and attention paid to the kind of bugs that lead to these situations there are some signs thats happening but theres a ways to go yet
nice post and i have to be honest i have no quick fire genius way to fix it ive just given some small suggestions as to the kind of direction it could go but this is about raising awareness to ccp that their reimbursement policy could as you say use some improvement thanks for post
yeah so everyone can see just what our damage potiential is wait what damage potential since the nerf not like it matters right now missiles are a minor at best threat in most pvp

i figured that this was already implied if a skill is injected already i can queue it up until it hits the 24 hour limit of course the same would be true with injecting skills based on prereqs that are in the process of being trainedfull support here i was actually a little surprised that they missed this when they implemented the queue
fully support this only if the required prerequisites are already in the training queue
wellbecause ccp saw fit to erase all your previous scan results on each new scan the problem becomes sorting through the clutter now with core probes you have to narrow each one down one at a time to 100 so you can bookmark it even if it is a site you do not want you need to go through this rigmarole so you can bookmark it to avoid probing the same site out on your next go to find whatever it is you are looking forpreviously you still had to get some accuracy on it but did not need to pin everything to 100 to focus on something you wantedand againit is more about them being essentially the same as a core probe for usefulness yes you can scan a bigger area with one probe but so what you can get better hits with a few cores running a shorter range plopped to cover inner planets and remote planets i think the guy above is wrong that sites can be anywhere all scans i have run have all the sites within 4au of some stellar object even if you use dsp you simply must revert to core anyway so while not a big deal to call them back in and redeploy core why bother not to mention this makes it worthless to train up to l5 on the skill
this get over it

they might not be alone in thinking its fun to get rich and wage wars on tq after all a lot players try to do either or both and i dont think ccp employees are any differenti assume because wagingorganizing wars is part of the game and they are allowed to play the game they can wageorganize warsthe rest of your post seems to say you have more of a problem with big alliances playing eve than with ccp employees about 05  of all players maybe playing eve if your worried about getting into unbalanced fights in eve you have bigger fish to fry so to speakps even someone with unlimited resources can be defeated so there go back to playing 10 hours pvp a day
there should be a easy way for filtering local from unwanted players based on their corp or alliance currently you can only block a single characters which is avery ineffective way of making your life easier if you want to avoid entire groups of players for example noob corp playersisk spamming bots or some alliances you just dont want to read many messages in same time can increase lag but long block list can give you simmilar effect
im supporting this
im sure theres probably a good reason for this but ill wait for the parade of people to emorage on me to explain why the modules in question are sensor backup arrays and signal amplifiers taking a look at signal amplifiers between their midslot counterparts it comes out to thissignal amplifier iitargetting range 30signature resolution 15max targets 2no faction variantssensor booster iirange 30resolution 30activation cost 5 capscriptable to 600faction variantsin this case shield tankers are already juggling their mids for other utility slots such as tackle and propulsion not to mention the cpu advantage is generally lost on shield tanks given their high cpu amount the lowslot variant is less than half as effective in resolution important due to agility changes and the only benefit you have is a passive module that is vastly outperformed and a bonus that doesnt work because of broken mechanicsnow onto sensor backup arrays and eccm radar backup array ii48 sensor strengthpassive18 cpuradar eccm ii96 sensor strength12 cap usage10 secondsoverloadable to 1248in this case the module in question is once again half as effective for about 33 cpu savings and minor cap usage with overloading it becomes about 13 as effective and is detracting from propulsioncapdamage modifiersfitting utilities in sum these items as well as tracking computerstracking enhancers need to be reviewed from a balance perspective as its already one more disincentive for shield tanking in pvp
the most reasonable thing to do without any radical changes is to seed faction variants for mods that have none
now compare tracking enhancers to tracking computers low slots are allot more valuable then high slots yes those 2 mods are weirdfor the rest if you have atleast 34 mids then low  midslot

ok first of all im not trying to say that scamming should somehow be removed or bannable if ppl are not wise enough to read contracts before excepting the terms they deserve to be scammedwith that said my issue here is the blantant abuse of spamming of scam contracts in jita local im sure i speak for many others in stating that the scammer spam in jita local chat impacts the legitamit players significantlythe solution i constantly here when ppl complain about this is simply block them well thats a fine idea however you can only block so many ppl and that really does not impact the potential buyers of the legit contracts unless the potential buyers also block them not to mention that there are only so many ppl you can blocka few ideas i have that are probobly not perfect but may help i hope others chime in with ideas and the devs take a serious look at this discussionidea1 drastically increase the amount of players that can be blocked like to say unlimited at least if only in jitaidea2 there needs to be a time limit when posting with contracts linked possibly 12 minute delays before posting another contract link this wont affect chat maybe not the best idea due to the fact that it will limit legit traders contract posting as well however it will most certainly hurt the scammers more than legit traders i believe it will also give ppl a chance to read the contracts and determine the fake ones vs the real ones and the block the fake traders idea3 im out of ideas for now you chime in on what you think may be a good solution
i agree on idea 1 the others not so much
just to clarify the 2 idea about dealying posting with contracts is intended to be towards the same person posting multiple contracts one after another although admitedly its not the greatest idea just a thought
and what is the problem with closing local when you enter jita and then reopening it when you leave unlimited block list would be nice but if it is because of server performance limitations then i would rather have better performanceeven if all the scammers and spammers were gone from jita local jita local would still be completely stupid
maybe a report spam system would be a good thing simply right click the name of the player add to spammer list and once every 5 minutes the system checks for people with more then 10 25 or 50 reports and then mutes them for an hour as punishment this could also be used in other places of course like yesterday in 49 the goons took it on themselfes to spam the hell out of local for no appearant reason i might add and it would be nice to be able to stop that without having to call for a gmthis doesnt prevent anyone from scamming but it would curb the pantsonhead ation that is currently jita local its like reading the viagraspam mails all day its not like anyone falls for them expect people that deserve it its just plain stupid and a waste of bandwidthgmtime etc
asura starfield would be displeased
how about not allowing a contract to be posted more than say 50 times in a day or maybe a total limit regardless of how long like 100 max contract links
dr eyjog mentioned it at fanfest 2007 people have been asking for it before others tried to make one themselvesan eve isk saving account  bank that people can put their isk to and receive intereststhe interest rate is supposed to be small eg 05 per month or lower so that player driven eve banks and other forms of investments can competethe isk can be locked for a certain period of timealso the interest payment can be done on a daily basis where people have to login and push a collect interest button so that they receive the daily interest otherwise the interest for that day expires this way there wont be an uncontrolled growth of isk on inactive accounts it would also motivate people to log in the idea that money generates more money without that the owner of the money has to do something is not new interests are common in any economy system receiving interest for money occurred even thousands years ago on earth even mentioned in the bible a realistic financial system that eve is supposed to be shouldnt lack it
and why dont you just put your money in the player driven eve banks
eves financial system doesnt lack it put your money in a player bank or a bpo or a better mission ship or its not that im opposed to this i just dont see the point
this
because i dont like to lose all my isk in the next big eve online scambanking requires trust and security this naturally doesnt exist in eve the bank owners can simply not pay back your isk thats legitimate gameplay no scam and you couldnt do anything against itin real life bank deposits are secured in many ways the prohibition of scam for example and finally through government guarantees in eve there is nothing alike its a big invitation to pull a scam player made content doesnt work properly in that trustsecurity based system id love to see a secured banking system
then this sounds like the issue you should be proposing be fixed not creating a system separate from the one that already exists
evading concord is actually very easyyou just dont go into systems where they patrolproblem solved
absotively posilutely not and this is exactly why carebears rely on the rule of law to run the supply side of eves economy because by and large they cant rely on themselves especially when theyre working in space in ships fitted for industrial tasks
yes while in it i keep a sniper rifle handy and practise satanic rituals i also think concord should be more easily defeated but changed so they are more like sleepers this info is the worst of them allshudder
you are still operating under the mistaken delusion that concord can be defeatedi believe its actually been said somewhere else by one of the ccp folks that if you can figure out how to beat concord its an exploit and bannablebesides i already told you how to avoid them what more do you want

so you were on auto pilot in a little hauler carrying over half a billion of cargowrong forum and the loss is your fault 10 are punished for being in hi sec but they are not prevented
a wrong forumb do not post communications with gmsc being 10 just means the faction navypolice will chase him not concord it is possible to fight them off or tank them given he was using smartbombs he likely was expecting to be target jammed by the faction navypolice being in an abaddon he probably had a hellacious tank sucked up the damage and decided to instapop whatever he could at a crowded gate where everyone is locked outd seriously bad move toting around 600 mil in a mere hauler at the least a tanked to hellandback platesextenders transport preferably a freighter you are asking for trouble with that much loot in a haulere no idea why km was odd maybe lagdunno

with my corp we made some testa covert jumpfleet of black ops consume isotopeok we measure the consumption of diffrerent ship for a jump of 4ly manticore  258 isotopepilgrim  3218 isotoperapier  2725 isotoperedemeer  845 isotopethe cargohold of the black ops being 600m3 of 4000 and may contain isotope consumption of covert jumpfleet was modeled on the fleet of jumpfleet of the titan  but the hold or consumption is a big problem i am not in favor of increasing the hold of the black ops to prevent abuse of all kinds  but reduce the consumption of ship is a good solution
they already implemented a supplement to this and that is with the blockade runner ship it was designed to be able to use the jump portal as well so it could carry fuel and supplies for the fleet

cloak is called cloak for a reason works as intended no issue here macro miners are a problem which every mmo has changing a game mechanic to aim at macro miners will aim at legit players in general aswell we just have to live with macro miners or better hunt them down yes it is possiblesorry no easy free carebear kills for you
ah i see now its an arguement so strong and so pursuasive that facts have nothing to do with it only our imaginations can unlock the wisdom of this idea ill try hard to imagine a world where this is a good idea i really will
oops sorry i forgot to put proposal
candidacy postno website yet will update when i throw one together
i think ccp has done a very good job making 00 interesting by allowing the player base to make it what it currently is however i think that there needs to be more adjustment to make it more tempting for players to come out and enjoy it one of the major problems i think eve has is the divide between the players in high sec and the players in unsecured space one could go his entire eve career become exceptionally rich and never enter 00 if he did not want to there needs to be more incentive for people to leave the comfort of high sec for better riches and more rewardalso i think pos sov mechanics need to be reworked to make it a bit more interesting shooting down posses that are unmanned is about the most boring and tedious parts of the game i would like the regular pos ai to be reworked so an unmanned pos is harder to kill and also would like to see poses take a more backseat role in regards to sovereignty one of the things that makes the game unfun for 00 inhabitants is the fact that we have to deal with posses all the time filling anchoring transporting emptying and have people in our alliances who do only that if we could remove some dependence on poses for sov everyone would be happy i assume
rurii represent a different group of folks in eve and am running myself so i wouldnt be voting for you and i would be encouraging folks to vote for members of the voice of reson party that said i hope you will run you definitely have been committed to an important part of the eve experience the eve csm is only better the more diverse we can become i hope you give it a shotgood luckissler
i am hoping that the formation of a party will increase the visibility of the csm i also believe that while i have some ideas about what makes sense for the folks i will or whoever the party ultimately supports represent adding additional channels of communications and opportunities for participation will improve the input for this constituency into the csmthis is very much an experiment i was partly inspired to take this course after some conversations with folks in ccp about this interesting venture into virtual world politicsi am excited to see how this unfolds so id love to continue hear what folks thinkissler
ive gotten commitments from 8 of the csm canidates for interviews and hope to see commitments from more in the near future i plan to post the interviews on my blogthat said heres a link to my lead post on the subject it also contains an index of all my interviewsif youve specific questions youd like to see asked just go there and leave a comment ill update here as this progresses expect the completed interviews by the 20th of april
i appreciate the time you took to respond to my post erik and i respect your position in fact in many ways i agree with a lot that you are saying but dont personally see the need to bring in another layer of titles and names to be able to achieve it let me briefly address some of your points from my personal perspective so you  and others may see where i am coming from whether you agree with me or not i believe one of the essential things for a csm to be able to do is look an issue brought before the csm with as little bias as possible to say you ascribe to one vision or another limits your options in certain circumstances if you hold to it in every case yes there are areas in which i have opinions and thoughts for myself but i think it would be remiss of me not to consider counter arguments against those ideas for the good of the whole community i can think of a number of ideas that would be of great benefit to sologroup pvp that would negatively impact the industrial sector for example but wouldnt vote for them precisely because of this negative impact to a large portion of the player group in this instance i am not talking for my alliance i am not here to represent the views of the star fraction on certain issues i am not even here to represent the views of the roleplay community or the pvp community i was actually considering creating a blank character to run on who had no affiliations but thought in the end that such a character would be ignored so simply went with my main character personally i think this is a tautological argument we have parties in my opinion because they are to an extent political easy mode i see a certain value in them in real world politics but cant really see the need for them here i agree that parties can be a stabilising influence certainly but the stabilisation they are shifted to more often than not seems to be towards the benefit of the party than the public that voted for them in the first instance in the case of the csm i certainly dont doubt that the public good would be forgotten by anyone who wished to run as a party member my concern is with the implication rather than the current reality at the end of the day though i certainly wont be railing against those that are members of parties or those that wish to represent one cause over another i respect your position and wish you luck with it its just not for me
lowsec is already underpopulated due to the risks far outweighing the reward before making lowsec even more dangerous adaquate incentive needs to be created to make lowsec worthwhile
the tunnel was a great sight which i loved seeing jumping now is a big disappointment bring back the old cyno effect
quotin dis
im running for third csmand ill support this even if just for the lulz
nice idea especially with hot keys
i posted a thread months back about orbits and hotkeys and especially how baffling it is to see hotkeys for certain functions like lock target but nothing else like the various movement commands it hardly received any notice but no matter this one fits the bill nicely give us something that shouldve been present in the game ages ago ccp
supported
very much a good idea
this was on the wrong page saying that the 3rd csm should bring this to ccp we will see if they fair better the our current csm
what this guy saidso no
the were the one suggesting 3 au or in alternative to cut range by 50passive at 14 au is functional 3 not scanner dont broadcast the location it give number of presences in range and there are those like you that offer one sided solutions and then get all offended when people shot them down you want it changed your job is to offer functional solution i dont see much reasons to change my job is to shot down unworkable solutionsi have suggested some idea you fell they are overpowered and shot them down good you are doing your part of the job but dont pretend that your suggestion have no flaws all your argument have a value if you offer a a workable solution but most of your suggestion so far have been about removing a strong intelligence tool and giving in exchange a tool suffering from myopia
space is too small with local blaring your presencei support this as it would make small roaming gangs more validand extend it to fw space too for extra fundirectionalscanners need work though
its a change proposal if you actively scan it shows even on the passive scanner within the maximum range so if youre looking for someone you can be seen also of course this doesnt work for cloaked so instead i had a thought last night with ghost images random blips or such this would need more thought as to houw its implemented but i do agree removing local without making it possible to detect that someone might be cloaked nearby is too overpowering for covopsreconsblack ops believe me when i say im not offended and also when i say my ideas have flaws i even state several posts above that any ideas of mine have issues and need to be fleshed out a bitive spent a lot of time in wh space recently ive been a nice guy there and one thats not so nice ive harvested and hunted with no local and constandly looking at the scanner ive had a blastif you delay local in lowsec and 00 it wont change much lowsec is about as populated as a wh system these days anywaypart of removing local though would be to also remove static belts this would give your lookout if you were on an op to notify the fc if hostiles were nearbyand if youre really that worried with a few recons coming and disrupting the party have a couple bss intys and hacs around those recons will melt like butter
im so disturbed right now by how many people have 00 alliances in their name and support thisthe reality is that 00 space would be forced into becoming capship stationgames far more then it already is the system wouldnt be defendable the only people left ratting or mining in 00 would be farmers
lolwhy becase you cant park an alt 2 jumps up the pipe to see if local popsor because those superalliances might find its fairly difficult to defend that much unused space without an instant intel toolno there would be no farmers as they wouldnt be able to run and log as soon as someone enters local
you know rp reasoning for this can be used either waythis information is available to all ships within the sphere of influence of those gates hence jumping into system leads to your appearance in localcan you explain why this has to be
oh can you imagine how awful that would be oh the horror the horrordisclaimer would not really be horrible
speak for yourselfprotip ratting can be done with other ships than lolfit ravens warping to beltmarkers at 0km and staying stationary until the last rat is dead
you must tell me this secret of awesomeness
really i doubt itjust a thought but a possible set up that will work for rattlers raven with extended probe launcher instead of cloak sure it will have cpu problems they it will not be so hard for ratting drop a combat probe max range filter ship only and smash the scan button forever war to a safespot when the probe detect someoneboring as hell but probably anyone working for a sweatshop would get a macro doing it for him and automatically recalling the drones and warping him when someone was detected it would work even for normal players too the only drawback is that they will hate smashing the scan button every few seconds
macros input commands how they respond to dynamic data is not known and cloak means noshowup thank you for finally agreeing with me actively scanning to replace local
how about thisthe people who want to keep local will have an option to always appear in local but those of us who dont want to show up in local we wont show up unless we speakeverybody gets what they wantand you have no right to make me show up in local against my will
stupid idea 00 is already too empty who the hell will do ratting or miningif they can get nearly as much iskhour in supersafe empire doing missions if this no local will be implemented noonethen who do you want to attack with your small roaming gangs possibly noone will be there to be your target or maybe another pvp gangbut because you wont be able to know their numbers for sure you can be eaily out numbered lots of them can be cloaked one side will surely bring in more numbers to achieve victory  blobbing so there wont be small fleets only some larger fleets without targets and the usuall high end moon blob wars in 12 systems thats all if you want to increase the riskwhat this proposal will do in 00 okay but then increase the gain too especially for the average 00 players and not for some rich alli leaders with moons what ccp should do is greatly increase asteroid mining income in 00 and reduce the stupid jump transfer possibilities like jump bridges also there should be possible stacionary target for small gangs like pos shootingstation service shooting for huge gangs where they can hurt the enemy even if the enemy doesnt want to fight back
 omg  so who the hell would use the show local type if he wouldnt get 100 accurate info he only gets the negative from it but no benefit
i would rat in 00 with no local chatand i would enjoy having less competetion from the chinese isk farmer  because i will kill them if they dont leaveand maybe with less farming and macro mining the prices of 00 goods will go up slightly making my efforts more profitablethe big alliance mining ops can easily post alt scouts on all gates  essentially alerting everyone of any new arrivals so yea basically we get less isk farmers more reward for real player more excitement and theres nothing wrong with losing your ship now and then when you can cover the losses in just 1 hour of farming
i will also rat in 00 with the proposed change to local chat
not supportedimo the reimbursement policy is as great as it gets dont want to loose isk  dont be an idiot and fit the ship with mods 3x its price and take it to pvp
sorry to hear you lost your shiptotally signedand for your reference just over a year ago i petitioned a carrier loss due to a bug and when the ship was reimbursed i got it back exactly as it was fitted before loosing it including all modules entire contents of corphanger and every ship in the ship maintenance array even though a lot of this doesnt appear on the killmaili dont know if the policy has change since then or if is inconsistant or down to the gm dealing with it i know i had to petition twice before getting it back and iirc in the end it was dealt with by a senior gm 
ok so darknesss is jumping into our camp i was dealing with internet spaceship drama so basically i was the sentry i was there to say hey 80man bs gang is about to jump in better vamoose darknesss comes back into local he had been jumping into our camp mwding to the gate getting away i say on vent darknesss is back in local i see nothing maybe 1min then on vent omg hes back im thinking maybe someone came from the other way then on vent wow what was he in he instapopped was he just a shuttle no the wreck says gallente elite bs what the hell happeneddarknesss warped to the gate right next to me jumped i never saw a damn thingas for the whole idea of the threadsurely he doesnt suggest getting the modules back that were dropped so he suggests getting a gm to spawn items or isk value which certainly cant be good for the economyalso think of the exploits then someone figures out how to replicate said bug with 100 success fit the most expensive ship possible have a friend kill you lewt and get gm to spawn new modules for youalso where is the cutoff can i get my t2 fit insured drake completely respawned and everything or is it just for these highprofile eve player 5bil isk kronos bugstoo many holes
this would unleash a flurry of accusations of favoritism ccp got that kenboku members officer mods back to him from a goon an didnt explain what the bug was or they explained the bug but baaahh not true ccp cheatsthe ship only reimbursement policy exists because that will be enough for new players but screw old players they should know better the universe is cold unpredictable and unforgiving
the universe should be cold but im not talking about the eve universe im talking about ccp being at fault and fixing their mistakes as for players doing it over and over again and exploiting it i dont see how its too random to and if they got caught it would be a perma ban even so im not saying my suggestion is the best way to go but merely the situation needs addressing because atm all eve is is favouritism some people lose things get everything back some get nothing back the ammount of times ive heard people who have petitioned in a fight got their ship back someone else in gang petitioned the same thing and got turned awayccp couldnt possibly be any worse with reimbursement than they are now
who needs to do it more than once 3b off an exploit is more than enough for a few minutes work
try it it would take you hours to find a worthy target in high sec then you can repeat your ganking attemps with concord killing you until you no longer can enter high secyou think youll make money
support
supportedexploiting aggro and logoff mechanics is making pvp too easy to avoid not simply because of the ctrl q at a gate but also seeing gangs log off everyone but their cloaked scout until you go awayi like the idea of a packet sent to differentiate between a ctrl q and a genuine disconnect dont know if it is possible but that would seem to be a solid idea in principlezos
should be changes yesand no it is impossible to differentiate between real disconnect and a ctrlq well that would be possible but then they would just pull out their network cable or disable their wireless or do something more fancy by letting their firewall block all eve packets
love the idea because itd look awesomenot that i think itll be implemented in the near future but oh well
yes please id like to see the citadel launchers open up from the hull on my phoenix or cruisetorp launchers on my ravens
agreed i want phoenixes with some nice launchers opening up
have you tried flying a torp raven it will even put up a fight to the most feared gallente mega pilots anyways supported definitely more shinyness always welcome
signedwould be very useful with no drawbacks that i can think of
plenty of people are signing without reading the counterarguments the skill que knocked off most plausible complaints from the skill system to go this far is just pushing it the point of not being able to inject the skills before prereqs is to facilitate a number of things 1 the skill stays a physical item until you inject it this allows you to change your mind and sell it or lose it  which to me is a fine risk for something you cant use yet anyway2 you cant do physics without arithmetic it finetunes your skillque to mainly leveling skills you already have and want to get better in which means3 you actually have to fraking sign into eve and change your character sometimesnot supported we have our skill quelets not get ridiculousedit  yeah because textbooks add nothing to reallife
i actually bumped againt this the other day let me give you the examplei was training drones v and knew that immediately following that i was going to train drone interfacing 1so i wait until my drone v gets down to under 24 hours left  ie i actually have room in my skill queue for a new skill i try and add drone interfacing 1nope sorry no can do admittedly its a minor annoyance  i just stuck a three hour skill in there and then waited until drones 5 completed before i added drone interfacing but it doesnt make much sense to me to have it implemented that way
except that the reason ccp stated for the skill queue at all is to allow you to more easily determine what time of day you fraking  sign into eve
and the skill queuq accomplishes that objective so what exactly is the purpose for this other than to further distance and abstract the skill systemi havent seen a single logical argument for this implementation only people who want to manage their characters a little lessif you cant manage your time with a 24 hours queue plus the ability to tag long skills onto the end of it then perhaps this isnt the game for you
its more about completing a feature yes the queue does let you keep your training time utilized but it in some instances does not allow you to fully maximize your training time this would get rid of the only hurdle in the way and with virtually no work required by ccp i guess i still dont understand the reasons against this unless the general population is so used to almost complete features in the game that the prospect of something being finished is foreign and frighteningit doesnt really matter either way to me as i dont think i even have any skills to inject that i dont meet the prereq for but i still wish to see the game constantly improved
if the block list works like i think it does this should be fairly lowlag i wouldnt use it myself but it would have use to some people its not a priority but sure
tracking enchancers are likely that way because its meant as a compromise to gank for snipers and more or less useless to most short range weapons pulse lasers are still quite well effected by them
hi i am in the wormhole with some player since 4 days with a posand some players have began to mine some gravitometricthe situation is too stupid i have only one covetor and the medium intensive refining array is completely out to follow the covetorthe first proposal is to increase the capacity of refining arrayexample  medium 25k  100kintensive 200k  500kor to add a new array for make the compression before refining same process than the rorqual
stopped reading right there tbh refining arrays are fine get a dang rorqual or live with the array isaacps want more support for your idea quit saying its stupid its how it currently operates and thats what ccp wanted now why dont you be more constructive also they will never make the refining array act like a rorqual otherwise that nerfs the ship
sorry but in some wormhole its not possible to pass with rorqualand how do you make in this case and not every body is in low sec
maybe dont live in the wormhole
im likinnot likinsome pretty damn stupid playersya its a funneh thing the reactor basically anyone who might want to use it will easily overrun the stupid thing add on top of that the thing basically hogs the whole tower takes forever and uses tons of fuelbig waste of time isk and energyyep our mining op got to about 150km3 and i was like ya um time to stop miningthusly making the actual rorqual uselesssorry but proposal isnt supported as it isnt very practicalthe refiners blow chunks thats for sure 25 loss just becauseboosting these refiners hurt who rorquals more or less but even then theres value in using rorqual still who is left to take advantage of the boost 00 and low sec people they dont have stations to put stuff into im pretty sure a 00 mining boost sure wont hurt thingssome might come and say but jason what about the drone regions pff those guys are so heavy in sov 3 and minnie outposts and easily defendable choke systems rolling into like 910 systems those guys wont even bother using refiners
i dont think any of that post had any sentence structure in it but from what i have read you want a array that can compress orethat sounds like a good idea but it would make the rorqual almost useles apart from the bonuses and the jump ability
yep the rorqual have not the same utility than the compressing arraywith the rorqual have an nice bonus the clone jump hangar array compressing oreand its not possible to use the rorqual on all wormholesorry for me this request is interesting
understanding that english is not your first language there is a problem this statement in english doesnt mean anythingthe situation is too stupid i have only one covetor and the medium intensive refining array is completely out to follow the covetorplease restate
i think hes saying that the array cant keep up
yeah that was my guess as well i guess it comes down to how long you are mining in a day i believe an intensive refining array can refine 1111mUFFFDmin so really a single covetor would only really exceed its capacity if mining more than 18 hours a day need more capacity get more refineries
completely agreed
imho there are a few ships that need theyre bonuses tweakedguristas shipsall guristas ships have split bonuses caldari skill boosts missiles gallente boosts hybrids every other pirate ship has either twin bonuses focused on one weapon type or a bonus to a weapon plus a bonus to some other element of the shiprattlesnakeive never seen a rattler fitted with hybrids and this is probably true for a number of reasons1 it only has 4 hardpoints2 even if it had 678 it doesnt have the pg to fit them and anything else3 if you try to fit hybridsmwdpointwebcap booster you either have two slots for a tank or have to armour tank and either way you run out of pg by a huge factorfix scrap the hybrid bonus add a different gallentestyle bonus 510 drone hp  damage bonus would be ideal also would be very nice to add a 7th launcher hardpoint and bigger drone bay even without bandwidth to match gilanot as bad as the rattle but overshadowed as a hybrid platform by deimos  brutix  vigilant  eagle and even probably the thorax once again changing the gallente bonus to a drone based one and giving it a reasonable drone bay would keep its different flavour but make it more useful 1 launcher hardpoint toowormtbh i have never flown one so i wont comment on downsides  upsides of bonusespilgrimim sure this has been mentioned before but the only use i can find for this ship is ninjaratting against sanshas its too slow to catch intys  dictors and without fitting faction neuts it cant attack anything larger without being in overloaded web range the rapier  arazu get a bonus to their primary ewar range the falcon already has range and gets a strength bonus yet the pilgrim is left with shortrange  strength bonusfix swap the 20 per level neut amount bonus for 20 range bonus or give it 10 range bonus and 10 amount bonus
youre putting together two very separate issues and you might have more luck splitting them that saidpilgrim agree fully the pilgrim has always seemed a joke to me  without a range bonus it doesnt really do very much its in need of a bonus of some sort and dropping neut effect for neut range seems the natural way to go guristas again agree fully who slaps a blaster bonus on a raven the vindicator is the right sort of model for putting a third bonus on an existing ship  find something novel that combos well with the existing twoa mwd bonus on a blaster ship and youve got a ship that is actually sensible and functional put a mediocre bonus on that doesnt fix very much and you have a mediocre ship once the nano fit stops being brokenmachariel and put a bonus on that most people actively ignore and youve got a ship that just feels like a raven you bought because you didnt notice that extra 0 in the price faction ships should be different in ways that make them useful a shieldtanking paladin is a novel concept and the nightmare runs with it admirably a battleship tackler is a fairly bad role and the bhaalgorn isnt very good at it but it at least feels like a faction ship  it does weird cool things the idea of a missiledrone ship that is actually worthwhile seems like itd be in the nightmare category  usable interesting and effective if you really boost the crap out of it it might even be worth the isk but yeah i agree with both and if you can arrange a review of the blood and maybe angel ships while youre at it thatd be cool too
then why have a curse thats always been my question the pilgrim has in your face neuting while the curse is farther out why change it isaac
the whole full speed warp cloaked lets you get a pretty good setup off on people in most situations id think neut amount would be better then range however in the more bloby situation that which pvp is pilgrim really is left out pretty badhonestly giving em 20 range and 20 amount wouldnt be terrible then again falcon is being nerfed bigtime so might as well let one of the recons fail with the falconyep horrible needs to be fixed we were promised this during empyrean age we didnt get itps i could swear the nightmare used to have torp bonuses with 4 launcher slotsproof of nightmare with launchers  old 2007 nanobs vid
in large fleet battles 100km warp ins big complexes whatever sometimes you just want to look at something far away i mean you can physically zoom out and spin the view around so you can get close to an object but this is very annoying to do with objects far away since eve is a very pretty game with beautiful spaceships and whatnot why should you be limited in what you can see i propose that one should be able to look atset as parent on anything on the grid as long as you can zoom out and see it why cant you zoom in for a closeup this would make it a little easier on film makers and also further facilitate the detailed graphics of evetldr if you can zoom out and see something you should be able to get a closeup you can get a closeup already its just difficult
agreed
agreed this has always seemed weird to me look range should be grid range
your client already knows where the object is so why cant it look its only a clientside change we are asking for herenow if it was at the edge of the grid and on the other side there was a ship that you couldnt see but the ship you chose to look at could see you still wouldnt be able to see it because seeing it would require more work from the server
simplest optionrclick player select spam option until you leave system they will be blocked for you if enough individuals select spam in a given period of time the person is gagged for a certain period of time i would be satisfied with an hour lets me get my shopping done without their annoying yammering if enough people flag the spammer in a 24 hour period or in multiple systems in a short time the character is gagged or their account locked pending investigation of the spammed materialthatll stop the spammers dead in their tracks but leave a little breathing room for legitimate sellers
thing is he has no chance whatsoever of getting that problem fixed  its fundamental to eve he at least has a chance at getting a npc deposit bank implemented
so what youre saying is his overall chances range from slim to none
that and that i wont fault him for giving slim a shot even if it isnt terribly good policy
id like to just be able to split my isk up into different piles  it would make keeping to a budget much easier if you had all your spare isk in another wallet
if you want to keep you isk then dont give it to random people you meet on the internetworking as intended imo
oh multiple wallets is definitely something i could support  one of the beautiful things about being in a small corp is that you can ask the ceo for a spare wallet for when you want to track a couple things separately id be all for that option being open to others as well thing is this proposal isnt that
i recommend eve bank thats evebanknetlavista vista helped write the code for that one i believe as for an npc bank thats probably never going to happen
i have been playing with this idea of adding a ship which is capable of scanning like the covert ops but has the ability to participate in pvp as the covert ops class have no added value other than scanning which doesnt drive a lot of people to choose this ship as theyre ship of choosingso i present my idea of adding the patrol attack shipbased on the destroyer class hull it is a ship designed for probing down opponents and holding them down for a limited amount of timei wont bore you with endless statistics which will bore you to tears and will never see the living daylight so ill outline the main points of my idea heregeneral bonusesit would include something in the likes of a bonus to the range orand strength of combat scanner probes and a small bonus to the range of warp scrambling devices also standard a cpu bonus for the expanded probe launcher should be added so it can be fitted easilyoffensive capabilitiesmake it able to wield a small amount of small guns and possibly even drones but make sure that it will not become a solo shipdefensive capabilitiesgive it a medium sized tank so that it can last and will not have a paper tank on top of that give it a heavy mass so it is not the next best nano tank due to heavy armor platingshielding equipmentcloaki dont think a ship such as this would need the ability of a cloak the ships scan strength orand range should be enough to make it able to scan quicklyrace bonusesonly dependant on the gun types so it has a little firepowerprerequisite skillsracial frigate 5covert ops 4destroyers 5astrometrics 5it should be in line with the skill time of the interdictorsin conclusioni personally think this could be a viable ship in pvp for finding people in safespots without sacrificing good tackling ability and a capable damage shipnow support it flame it discuss it
i think this is a cool idea as it would possibly call another use of the destroyer classmy only problem is your name i think they should be called hunter killers
a couple changes i thinkfirst off skill requirementracial frigate 5covert ops 5destroyers 5astrometrics 5my opinion it should be five for all four skills offensive abilitiesno drones unless its gallente about five guns sounds right to me cloakt2 cloaking device sure but no covops cloak otherwise ship sounds pretty good but i dont see the need of it atm yes the covert frigate is not the greatest thing to fly in the world but it gets the job done really well some people i know also use it to tackle people at risk sure so in short i dont see the need but more ships isnt a bad idea isaac
i agree with the basic idea a probing ship that can do something other than sit there uselesslywith caveats of coursebase it off the tier2 bc hull give it an insane tank give it the marauder weapon bonuses and limited weapon mounts so they can fit utility modules such as tractorssalvagersmake it slow as sin do not give it any weapon bonuses of any sort other than the marauder damage bonuses on limited hardpoints do not allow it to fit covert cloaks allow it to use noncovert cloaks as bombers do to prevent them becoming cloaking guerilla fighters but no velocity bonusessentially give it the ability to do two thingsscan swiftlywork plexes findsbut worthless in any sort of pvp or theyll become fotm gank fleetsend of story
lol so you figured out a couple ways to evade them mehso basically you want to make a system where you can kill someone in highsec they cant even see you coming while taking no losses at allyou know theres an exploit where you essentially have a person accepted into a corp while they are basically in warp and about to drop in on a group of people or have the gang log out where you know the camp will be accept their apps log in at the same time etc etc all these are considered exploits gms have made posts saying they are exploitswhy do you think your exploit is better then any other exploit
i wouldnt mind seeing the black ops exploit get legitimizedi mean dropping over a billion isk on a gank ship that has a very good chance of not surviving long enough to jump out is both 1 awesome and 2 very riskyi dont see the problem frankly if you lose your hulk to a black ops get another one and mine in the same system with a cloaked friend in fleet with tackle nearby next time he tries it pow concordokkened and you get a bunch of shiny loot to replace your lossi feel like that would be fun as hell for both the black ops and the targets and considering the immense cost of the ship i dont feel like it would start happening all over the place remember the black ops really only has the time to strike and jump out in 05 maybe 06 space and it has a window of only a few seconds to pull it off
there have been a hp bug which reduce your effective hp to extremely low properly what happenedthe 10 sec pilot well thats just extremely bad and lame mechanic from ccp which they should stick where the sun dont shine so ertarded
atards all of you ffs read or is it over your intellectual levelhe said he had auto pilot on at the gate which means at 0 from gate so he garentee to jump as soon as possible then to manually jump to next gateffs people are such a holes these days
indeed
its rtardanyway by his typing let me paint this picturehes on the gate either into likely perimeter or jita to perimeter traffic control closes the gate he has 600mil in an apparent t1 hauler worth roughly 200k isk my math sucks whats that like 003 of the value of the goods transportedok so hes got ap on so when the gate opens he jumps through are you sure never tried itso ill put myself in this situation for a secondim stupid enough to haul that much worth with that little yugo shipthe instant i realize the gate is closed i will buger off and warp away i will not sit there hoping some miracle opens the gate for methe 10 player did nothing wrong this shouldnt be in this forum it should be in cp where he can be mocked repeatedlyi have done runs into lowsec 00 and through all the hubs with hundreds of millions hell even billions in cargo not once have i ever been gankedive been targetted ive been attackedplay it smart and you minimize your losses ill die eventually but ill be sure its not because of doing something this idiotic
1 dont go to jita if you can avoid it 2 if you cant avoid jita transport your stuff via courier contract let someone else take the risk3 if you cant wait for a contract use a solid vessel that has a good tank that means battleship or orca in highsec4 always split your risk if you can do it in multiple runs dont do it in one unless you can risk losing it5 if you carry immense value never stop if a gate is locked use another if all gates are locked warp around in the system till they open up again never play sitting duck6 if red flashing people are anywhere near watch like a hawk7 dont go to jita if you can avoid it ps be glad it was only 600 million your corpmates will understand after all they were bright enough to let you haul that much unescorted and all by yourself from jita they could have jumped into some ships too would have split your risk
concord doesnt pod  he flew in in a pod grabbed a bs and shot you in said bs if thats what the gm claims its likely what happened as for the 300 damage thing youre the second person ive heard complaining about that  look at the reimbursement policy thread some guy was saying the same about his kronos and mentioned a titan having 100 hp as well petition it on the basis of this hp bugsince it sounds like you just petitioned the 10 guy shooting you and you might have a bit more luck
get off our board troll this isnt an issue or a proposal you are simply full of fail
im not sure posting on a public forum that you carry billions of cargo in a hauler might come close 
if i were smart i wouldnt be hauling it in this char
supported on the provision that smokeless tobacco products such as chew dip and snus be added to the list
as long as we dont have to train the new smoking skill to level i before being allowed to i like the idea of having tobacco in ambulation
my name is melgaladh and i approve this messageand if you go over and look at what ccp said about ambulation they brought up three movies aliens blade runner and star wars the empire strikes backblade runner was covered in cigarettes i think the idea of having a cigarette during a corp meeting sounds like a nice touch

hello my fellow internet spaceship captains i am pleased to announce my candidacy for the csm my history in this game is very different from most of yours joining goonfleet on day 1 of playing this game i flew my ibis directly out into 00 nobody told me about podjumping  and right from the start i have immersed myself in all that is good and bad about life in nullsec i am a firm believer that the best parts of eve are found in the high space drama that occurs out in 00 yet so much of the playerbase is unwilling or unable to venture out away from the protection of concord i want to make 00 more fun and rewarding for everyone and my goal as a csm is to push for 00 changesheres my campaign website
its not concord that draws ppl to highsec m8 its independence freedomi got tired of being taxed ordered to show up at xxxxx at a certain time also i was a meatshield for other peoples moon mining operation and they dont give nothing back basically i was playin the game for someone elses benefitnot sayin all alliances are like this but it just left a bad taste in my mouthright now i have every part of the game at my disposal at the time of my choosingi got rd production goingi got nice sized rats spawned for my killing pleasurea minihub 6 jumps away for tradinga lowsec system 8 jumps away when i wanna get froggya mining system 13 jumps away when i wanna mine and watch a movieif i want 00 providence is closei log in when i want do what i want and best of all no taxyes i miss having gangs to fly with but i cant imagine trading away my freedomfreedom is why i play eve when the freedom is gone so am i
everything you said is true life in 00 is a hassle and the real rewards of life in 00 moons plexes supercap construction are only feasible for big alliances i see this as a problem and i want to improve it without nerfing anything about life in empire
your ideas have merit however i think larkonis managed to get in a bit before youhe seems to be the unofficial cp delegate and given how many carebear candidates there are i think it would be important for at least 1 pvp based candidate to get throughim unsure if by running you would be increasing or decreasing the chance that a delegate who regularly pvps and more then just shoots stuff actually understands wtf is happening is voted in
issler thanks for your words although we have been on opposing sides of the battlefield and the smack talk i can appreciate your words i believe we can work together focusing on the different facets of eve so to make it a better game keeping in mind all game play stylesmickey simoni have read now the pod of larkonis whereas his manifesto looks more like a dark side of the pvp i hoped to work for the benefit of all pvp i for example dont think that resources have to be diminished in empire just make it so that empire stays as it is low sec should be richer by a multiplier of 15 than empire and 00 richer by a multiplier of 2 than empire but this is my opinion what i would like is to hear as many different people as possible so to understand what the specific view on different points is my view is that there must not be a compartimentalization of the game the blobbers  the crazy piratesmercs  the carebearsmy candidacy will have the goal of better defining pvp as a profession noir im sure wouldnt mind yulai convention approved contracts for mercs and assassinsthank you for your input guys
simple  i want to promote freedom to play the game in as many ways as possible the large sandbox for all i also wish to help ccp improve the game particularly with balancing of game mechanics and follow up on various initiatives that ccp has already started upon i will also try to offer a newer player perspective to the game with me personally having less than 20 million skill points and less than 2 years playing the free trip to iceland is also cool although i will have to bring my wife so it wont really be free cause if i dont bring her she will kill me
why arent you running as friedrich philwhatever your mainissler
because he is not one of frieds alts perhaps
the idea of doing away with local has been floating around for some time the recent glitch to local on sisi whether intentional or not has sparked a few discussionsrages about its potential fate i am completely local neutral so if it stays or goes i could care less i do however see a potential repurposing for the recently defunct pos module the system scanning arrayempire for all intensive purposes is civilized space per concord mandate system occupants are reported via the local system for all to see nothing changeslowsec and npc 00 space are a gray area since technically they are faction not concord occupied space for these areas local would be paired with positive standings with the occupying faction take molden heath for example if you have positive standings with the minmatar republic local appears as it currently does if you have neutral or negative standings local is reported on a broadcast only basis similar to alliance chat access to local would be based on true standings not as modified by the various social skills so players seeking to gain access to local must earn the tactical advantage00 space being lawless and unoccupied does not report local by default it acts solely on a broadcast basis where you only appear upon posting now bring back the system scanning array sov1 anchor sov2 online and make it so the controlling alliance has the option to provide local through associated standings this provides a home turf advantage to the occupying alliance that they can see system occupants in local but hostiles can not this also means that just as jammers and jump bridges are taken out as a part of 00 sov wars it allows local communications to be taken down as wellthe data elements to do this should already be inherent to local as standings are reported to make the little blue and red boxes next to names all that would be needed is a conditional prefilter to determine player access to local on a systembysystem basisthe end result would leave local in place where it is most wanted while adding a whole new positive element to lowsec npc 00 and alliance controlled space
i understand what it means to repackage a ship its basically taking it apart and packing it into a smaller space what i dont get is why they wont let us repackage ships that have rigs on them technically the rigs are a part of the ship when you install them when you remove them they are destroyed so they are nonetheless part of the ship and can be taking apart with the ship and put back together since its not being removed from the shipi dont see any particular reason to have it to where you repackage a ship you lose your rigs wouldnt it increase the risk of transporting ships if they still had the rigs installedsorry just kinda angry since i couldnt fit a ship thats 55000 volume and 5500 packaged into an obelisk that has over 800k room even with the ship unpackaged theres plenty of room for it to fitwhat yall say repackage ships with rigs ok
i think t2 bpos are fine as they are for the older corps to last this long in a world like eve is proof that they should hold onto that bpo eve isnt about fairness and older characters are always rewarded for being with the game because they sat through a bunch of  does it hurt the market a little and make an unexhuastible source of income for the holder yes but it doesnt matter since they were here first and got it before it was goneif es me off just as much as anyone that i wont be able to get a bpo of a t2 item and if i buy any bpcs then its just pure profit for the guy who made itbut how about instead of taking it away give it a decay factor just like ships and mods if the t2 bpo isnt used for what3 months it goes back on the lottery instead of destroying them how about recirculating them if their on inactive accounts or if they are just sitting in hangers not being usedeven though i like happy mediumsi still stand by that they lucked out on it and everyone else will just have to deal with it and suck it up
get some billion and buy it no on the first count the only field where the t2 bpo influence the market are the items where no sane inventor want to invent anything remove the bpo and the t2 items will disappear as the few t2 items build today will be replaced by namedfaction itemsone example are the t2 armor plates they are worse than rolled tungsten and cost the same remove the bpo and i doubt anyone will care to invent them for the unexhuastible source of income they work exactly as any other bpo after you have brought it it give you an income if you build from it so any bpo is a unexhuastible source of income
thats pretty much how it worksif you want a t2 bpo buy one but be prepared to wait for a year or so before you start making your money back they are not isk printing licenses these days not like they were before invention as an inventor i may not be able to make the margins but i can vastly outdo the t2 bpo holder in output
1 defense of the lowend computer users let us turn off effects entirely pos shields bubbles textures let me turn them off2 support of usergenerated content let us create stuffexamples change poses to modular structures like t3 instead of this annoying clickand drag interface let us configure how they look similar to the amazing structures found in some missions let corporations create missions for the general public to accept3 make missions  interaction more inyourface for example seize camera control but let us break out and zoom the camera in advanced mode towards an enemy spawn that us usually announced in local give us more dialog more realism and more interaction4 let me fiddle with things outside of the intended game mechanics let me be creative and try things from a roleplaying standpoint and make unexpected things happen for example let me steal the maiden from the mission which results in the mission agent hiring faction npcs to chase me down let me shoot at things im not supposed to shoot at poke and play with things and make something interesting happenfeedback welcome and my right to append to this list is reserved
there is no doubt in my mind that user generated content when done correctly is the future so i like the idea we could have some discussions among the csm candidates about your suggestionsissler
