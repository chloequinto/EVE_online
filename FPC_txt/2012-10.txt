bump for exposure
yeah i forgot about the whole buying and selling kill rights and new bounty system thing this will be very helpful once this stuff goes live
so thats why i see like 80 people in a mutual war with the new dec shield i was wondering about this lol
however the defenders should then have to pay for the dec unless both sides choose to be mutual
no no noyou wont see the pod since your link to the camera drones is now severed what you would should see is the pretty much the similar stuff from the matrix especially since the pod probably starts shutdown sequence a few seconds before the actual hull breach to prevent data loss for example as such you would actually lose all the intercomsoverviewschannels similar to the toggle we have right now for screenshots and then blackout and awaken in the pod which is collapsing around you spilling the contents and your now doomed husk to be you would subconsciously struggle note we arent in gasfilled environment as such we wont automatically eject due to pressure difference it would be more akin of breaking an egg and contents slowly oozing out  the temperature difference should not matter since there is no decent medium to absorb our heat fast enough as such the actual cause of death would be pressure difference bloodstained vision and general blackout no air in the lungs afaik we are filled with oxygenated goo so chest wont explode  to summarize you are neo spilling into huge vacuum around you remember how bs look like while you are near pod now imagine the pod debris with similar size beside you mesmerizing sight of space maybe wo nebulas we dont have enhanced vision which turns red and then black very fastand then you wake upabout the hair i personally think it is too much because we can always say that facilities can be preprogrammed to try making the exact replica of yours truly otherwise capsuleers not only will loose hair  they would lose the tanmusculature and tattoos redoing that as soon as you wake up would add only a little bit to the immersion but otherwise will be a major hassle especially for these pilots that need to return to the battlefield asap
and how would you recognize someone who bought a toonactually that might be good i could buy a toon from someone with a good reputation chribba for example and proceed to  and pilliage on his good name
the margin trade scam can also be seen and avoided if you pay enough attention and are wary this is not an exception
the thing with thing i see wrong is being able to put down orders for things without affording to pay for the minimum amount you want to buy the game should run a balance check every x times and cancel all orders that would fail if someone tried to sell stuff to them

why sub folders you have folders allready 
playerbase  1ccp  0the playerbase thoroughly and adequately warned ccp that the wardec changes would do little or nothing to combat what was already broken about the system sure enough the wardec mechanics were left to one employee who didnt listen to external criticism in the typical preincarna styleweve gone from an inexpensive broken wardec system to an expensive yet still broken wardec system thats all nothing was ever truly fixed and here we sit with the exact same problems as we had before the wardec revampsummary of eves last four expansions
the easiest fix would be to remove the ability to make wars mutual let all wars play out while being paid for by the aggressor so you get 7 days of open warfare the defender can call in assistance just like now this is one i totally agree with but after the 7 days war the aggressor either pays again or the war ends if the defending side then wants to take revenge they can wardecc the aggressor back possibly paying wartime allies to assist and wardecc the original aggressor tooan answer to the transfering of wars may be to make so it just doesnt happen the corp who is decced continues to be at war but teh alliance they join are unafected corps leaving alliances however should carry the war with them until the original 7 day term is overi also think that for every entity the defending side brings into a war the aggressor can also bring in that many allies but make it so that any allies the aggressor may call in can not bring the total number of pilots to above the number of total defending pilots including alliesin short defenders being able to call in aid in a war is right wars should however not be able to be made mutual thereby locking peple into wars that may well end up with people not bothering to log in revenge can be taken in many ways without silly mechanicsthese simple changes would i think stop the exploitation of war mechanics but still leave war as a viable and extremely fun part of eve
continued from abovegreat so the next major problem is wardec copyingtransferringright now any entity can transfer a defensive war to any other entity this is not how wars were intended i merge this unintended mechanic with the infinite mutual wardec to trap people indefinitely sadly ccp will read this sentence and think awesome all we have to do is stop one of those activities and wardecs will be fixed which is absolutely not the case to transfer a war from a corp to an alliance have that corp join the alliance to transfer a war from an alliance to a corp have that corp join the alliance and then leave to transfer a war from an alliance to an alliance have a corp drop the wardecd alliance and join the other i know this is not how ccp intended the game mechanics to be because otherwise they wouldnt have spent so long creating a mercenary marketplace with this ability to transfer copies of wars there is no longer a reason to ever be a mercenary when you can literally just join the war with an infinite number of defenders again for free this completely renders the mercenary defender system obsolete congratulationswardec copying was implemented to create that concept of commitment for entities at war you can no longer escape a war just by leaving the alliance obviously this isnt working as intended this allows for wardec copyingtransferring as described and also an octopus defense where an alliance breaks into individual corps thus increasing the effective cost of wardeccing the members of that alliance by many fold this is rare but its an obvious defensewe dont want corps to escape wars by dropping out of alliances hereby known as droppers for brevity but we dont want them to be able to join other alliances with these wars either so these are our options in order of my preference we forbid droppers from joining another alliance for a week consider it analogous to corp hopping restrictions we continue as is allowing perfect copyingtransfer instead preventing mutual infinite wardecs we retract the war against the dropper after x time 72hrs perhaps we allow the war to continue against the dropper but dont transfer it to a new alliance they join this is unlikely because it lets a corp in an alliance be in a war independent of the alliance we retract the war against the dropper old system  bad we prevent dropping from a wardecced alliance very bad there are more variations on these themes but the goal here is to prevent infinite wardec copyingas for wardecd corporations joining alliances this is probably fine with a few notes first it should inform the aggressor that the target has joined an alliance the moment theyre application is accepted into that alliance this gives the aggressor a 24hr forewarning also as mentioned above we should also be removing the restriction preventing corps from joining alliances while in a mutual wardec  as it no longer makes sensesurprising your enemies while in spacethese are considered exploits so dont do them but lets code the rules into the game to make it impossible and save the gms lots of time youre sitting in space next to a target whos at war with a corporation you have an application in to the ceo accepts your application and you instantly begin shooting the target  he had no possible warning or defense exploit youre in a corporation thats had their application accepted to join an alliance whos at war youre in open space next to one of their war targets the application goes live you instantly begin shooting the target exploit youre at war with an enemy you drop from your corp so youre not at war undock next to them their ui isnt updated yet they shoot you and get concorded without warning exploit any variation of these are considered exploits due to the lack of possible warning to the opponent the barely legal workaround is to dock get accepted undock start shooting it basically only adds seconds to your case and your opponents local list wont have updated but the gms consider it legalthe solutions to these are pretty simple if a corp applies to join the alliance youre at war with it should send a notification out to the aggressors the moment the application was accepted warning that in 24hrs theyll be facing a whole new set of targets thanks to them absorbing your targets war dont allow a corporation at war to accept an application for a member while theyre in space or at least have it queue up the acceptance for the next time theyre docked or offline force an update on the local list whenever a local member joins or leaves the war against you this would prevent much confusion and grey areas with the abuse
wars with dead corpswars with dead entities are theoretically impossible but still totally possible dec shield is currently at war with a closed corp whenever the last member of a corp leaves that corp all wars against that corp end removed textits also kind of foolish that a corp can disband and then reform 10 seconds later corp hopping is limited to not being able to rejoin for 7 days so why can we reform new corps instantly this has led to a large number of aggressive wars being fought with only alt corps  especially now that any real corp would be trapped infinitelymore dead corpsit seems its still possible to leave dead corps floating all over the place including inside an alliancethis could potentially be very useful for us as we could keep a bunch of dead corps in alliance to maintain majority vote for executorship without actually dedicating any characters to it well have to test whether or not their votes actually still contribute to ownership of an alliancethe procedure for recreating this bug is to have a corp apply to join the alliance then have them close out the corp and it will join the alliance as a dead corp downtime does not wipe the corp from existence you can also boot these dead corps from alliance theyll have copies of the alliances wars and if those wars were mutual then youve suddenly locked everyone into a mutual outgoing war with a dead corporation which no player can ever correct this problem  so be prepared for mass gm petitionssurrender mechanicsany surrenders offered to an alliance are easily flouted have a corporation drop from the alliance accept the surrender from the alliance reapply with dropped corp to alliance resume war this is easily fixed with my top suggestion to the fix to wardec transferring unknown what surrenders to corps that join an alliance do  i will investigatewith the toggling mutual option the right click mutual menu doesnt function at all this has led to much confusion for people that leave dec shield the only option that does work is to use the drop down menu at the far right side and to uncheck the mutual box
wardecs preinferno were very annoying because of the pos exploitbutthe system was betterbetter
it really wasnt better fix the transfer of wars and the system we have no will be pretty much perfect as far as im concerned at the moment the only people generally who think the old system was better was highsec wardec bullyboys who dont know how to pvp against people who actually want to fightin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
those are some very confident assertions very confident indeed for someone who is wrong the lore says that the pod actually injects and euthanises the pilot miliseconds before the pods shell is breached so you really would just see your sight quickly black out but you wouldnt wake up standing up straight in your cloths in your captains quartersin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
eidric thank you for your contributions everyone else pay no attention to the very faulty science eidric is espousing in fact liquids have pressure too and space is cold but can be hot depending on proximity to a star and wether or not you find yourself in a shadow but i wouldnt ask the devs to get into that as i recall arduemont is right pod pilots are euthanized in the split second after the pod detects a hull breach but before the pod is totally destroyed also they are also depicted as wearing masks that cover their eyes so i dont see how the perspective would switch to their own eyes still on the field seeing as how they are blinded poisoned and had their synapses melted by the cognitive state xerox machine eidric i dont mean to pick on you bud but your assertions though interesting are wrong on a lore level as well as a basic 9th grade physical science levelbut we can all agree that theres room here for improvement d and the way it is now is just lamehighsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom
the idea isnt bad but is it really necessarily to add rp fluff to ideas in the assembly hallit seems a bit counter productive to the whole explaining your idea clearly thing
then perhaps ccp should stop alowing us to train while we are afkoffline since we are playing but not playingever hear of snipers do you really think they stay awake 247 or never leave their position to  or  or sleep or eat or anythng yes snipers go afk but the enemy doesnt know if or when they do it hell the sniper could move on and they often do since it is dangerous for them to stay in one position very long yet the enemy doesnt know this until they actually go out and verify combat forces also use decoys and various forms of deceptive practices to deceive distract and or delay their enemiesafk cloaking is a valid gammng tactic so go get some cheese for your whine one last point i played wow for years since its begining for years the useless noobs would come into the forums and moan and groan about this change or that change that needed to be made because oh the current system is soooo hard or unfair especially for the noobs so what has happened now wow has become watered down and stupified to appease all the useless morons with iqs south of 30 i left wow and came to eve because i got tired of playing in kindercare and wanted to actually think for myselfso my point is that i hope ccp doesnt listen to all the whining of the noobs and keeps doing what they are doing  and all the ignorant low iq noobs can go back to wowoh and for the one moaning about you posting in the wrong place ignore him when a game has been around as long as eve there is very little that hasnt been discussed already except maybe new content and even that gets old fast in reality very few people actually research old past post first most just want a fast current reply often times from new players who probably were not around when it was last discussed and i see no problem with it if you dont want to read it then move on honestlyediots that whine about trivial crap like this are about as usefull as the forum grammar police

helloi play eve since years now and one of the first questions i did to my self during the first months playing this game washow can a ship like a titan carrier battleship or even a batlecruiser can have just a pilotafter years i keep asking my self why after so many expansions crew hasnt been addedi have full respect of ccp and the game they did is just awesome  i came from different mmorpg experience and this is the most intresting one so there must be more than one reason but i came to the point that after reading so many post in the council ofstellar management about small improvements was time to post mine about crewhere i will put the concept point by point hoping to find more players who will support the idea from the fitting panel a link to the crew panel similar to the fitting window it might show a 2d interior ship with free spots in key roles propulsion gunnery shield hull electronics ecc in every spot you could put just one officer who might give you one special bouns gunnery tracking speed damage reload efficency ecc propulsion agility speed ecc armor hp repair amout ecc basically the same bonuses you receive with rigsquestion would be why add something which adds almost same bonuses of rigsi think it will enhance the characteristics of the ships and the style of play of each player in addition you might decide to balancethe bonuses of each ship the crew would have a dailyweekly or monthly cost you hire you paythe crew cant be killed or dismissed can only be sold but while on the market you keep paying for it the crew gets experience for every battle is envolvedmore experience more bonuses more costs more values on the market the first officers you buy from the market start with 0 experience it is up to you to let them grow the crew can be killed or wonded during fights after receiving a perfect hit you might loose one of themi would have more ideas to share but i want to keep the post simple basically here you have my crew concept which i hopeswill at least put some ideas in the mind of some ccp programmersthank yourvnsm
i like your idea of giving a particular ship experience credit so if you had some particularly lucky or effective ship that had many kills without dying it would have some small bonuses over a factoryfresh hull of the same type but only in your hands or something so you couldnt go kill fifty noobships and then sell the improved hull in jita for a markup would be nice to give specific ships a history eve is nothing if not a vehicle for playercreated history after all
that doesnt make it a bad idea
so lets discuss it repeatedly again  i agree it would be nice to do a name change blizzard had all the normal objections to allowing it as well but at the end of the day it all boiled down to their bank account and they now allow it for a fee oh and guess what their game world didnt endif the real world allows for a name change with even more possible negative out comes how bad could it really be for a gameccp just think of your bank account and i know you will do the right thing 
not until my fourteenth or fifteenth year did i begin to come across the word gallente with any frequency partly in connection with political discussions for the gallente was still characterized for me by nothing but his nationality and therefore on grounds of human tolerance i maintained my rejection of nationalist attacks in this case as in others consequently the tone particularly that of the caldari antigallente press seemed to me unworthy of the cultural tradition of a great nation i was not in agreement with the sharp antigallente tone but from time to time i read arguments which gave me some food for thought at all events these occasions slowly made me acquainted with the man and the movement which in those days guided our corporationUFFFDs destiny tibus heth and the caldari providence directorate the man and the movement seemed reactionary in my eyes my common sense of justice however forced me to change this judgment in proportion as i had occasion to become acquainted with the man and his work and slowly my fair judgment turned to unconcealed admiration today more than ever i regard this man as the greatest caldari ceo of all times how many of my basic principles were upset by this change in my attitude toward the provist movement my views with regard to antigallente sentiment thus succumbed to the passage of time and this was my greatest transformation of all the gallente have always been a people with definite racial characteristics and never a social institution with any integrity due to their own original special nature the gallente cannot possess a sound social institution if for no other reason than because they lack idealism in any form and hence belief in a altruism is absolutely foreign to them and a social institution in the caldari sense cannot be imagined which lacks the conviction of survival through unity in some form indeed the gallente do not prepare their children to look after each other but only for a practical and profitable life in this world the best characterization is provided by the product of this education the gallente himself first therefore the gallente goes about making up to the people for his previous sins against them he begins his career as the benefactor of mankind since his new benevolence has a practical foundation that the left hand should not know what the right hand giveth no whether he likes it or not he must reconcile himself to letting as many people as possible know how deeply he feels the sufferings of the masses and all the sacrifices that he himself is making to combat them but even more all at once the gallente also becomes liberal and begins to rave about the necessary progress of mankind if we consider how greatly he has sinned against the masses in the course of the centuries how he has squeezed and sucked the blood again and again if furthermore we consider how the people gradually learned to hate him for this and ended up by regarding his existence as nothing but punishment of heaven for the other peoples we can understand how hard this shift must be for the gallente the purplehaired gallente youth lies in wait for hours on end nefariously glaring at and spying on the unsuspicious girl whom he plans to seduce adulterating her blood and removing her from the bosom of her own people the gallente uses every possible means to undermine the racial foundations of a subjugated people the personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the gallente and so the gallente advances on his fatal road until another force comes forth to oppose him and in a mighty struggle hurls the heavenstormer back to hell the caldari state is today the next great war aim of their underhanded subjugation it requires all the force of a young missionary idea to raise our people up again to free them from the snares of this international serpent hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the caldari people by defending myself against the gallente i am fighting for the work of us all thank you galaxy pighighsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom

explain how this is exploitable ifship cost  insurance payout  drop value    bounty pay out for killing their shipclone cost  implant cost    bounty for killing clone is a random amount that ccp will choose but its going to be  100 call it 75 to be niceso if a pirate was flying a 100mil ship with 50mil of mods with a 20mil drop and the insurance pays out 50mil but he had a 6bil bounty on him thats150mil  50mil  20mil drop  75  60mil payout  the 20mil drop for killing a 150mil ship
i really dont think hes looked into it much its not exploitable people have been literally debating new systems for years and by years im talking 68 probably some of the new proposed systems are practically bullet proofhaving said that i really really want to see a dev blog about how they plan to change it dont fail us now ccp people have made some brilliant and borderline perfect suggestions i really hope they dont make a completely new system they thought up themselves thats full of holesin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
its odd to me that a game with such focus on corporations and business etc has such poor to nonexistant reporting ability in or out of a corp i would like to see the ability to generat financial for both members of a corp the corp as a whole and even solo players who are nto in a coprthese could be viewed in game or even exported to a spreadsheet to the clients computer the would be stored on server or even on client side if ccp wanted to savfe server storage spacethe financial logs would track everything to do do with ingame financials including total ore mined processed sold and for how much where mined and where processed and sold what and how many assets owned and where and cost of aqusition and value if sold etc should track all income and expendditures including taxes for both solo and corp players this also includes all loses like through combat etcwould even be nice to be able to generate graphs based on al lthe dataif ccp wants us to run a corp then how about giving us some tools to do it withalso on the corp member page how about adding the ability tio flag a member as an alt and or inactive this flag would then move those members to seperate tags respectively or would give us the option to hide them from view like we already do for members who are either onlion vs offline

sigh here we go again then i guess you havent read the 2nd link space itself isnt cold or hot it cant be  the temperature can only apply to matter vacuum is absence of matter or very very tiny amount as such space itself if very very good insulator there is a reason your coffee stays so hot in thermos for such long time  due to vacuum in the hollow wallsyes eventually the body will radiate enough heat to freeze but it wont be fast enough at all i am not sure you know the meaning of words you say google sublimation  it cannot apply neither to water nor mercury inside barometer and liquids dont expand in same way as gasses do they might experience depressed boiling point  increased evaporation causing the said goo to actually boil outside and this could lower the temperature of it btw but that would depend on the goo itself and its surface tension which would probably be higher than that of wateryou know how canon works it is main intent is to describe the current game effects if you follow it to the letter you will wind up with exact mechanic we have now  maybe your memory is still weak and you simply forgot you waking up in the lag and only started properly remembering things when you are up dressed and back in your cqfunny thing again but your initial design was also contradictory to the cannon but you kinda ignored that in fact your version is even more far fetched as you imagine the now corpse not only injected with toxins but nerve fried while still maintaining stable connection to the camera drones outside of the pod seems very unlikely to mewhile the idea of a neo awakening could actually hold ground even with neurotoxins because think about it  who actually tested the results and how can they be tested we are talking about seconds even milliseconds here maybe toxins are not fast enough to effectively shut the consciousness down before the pod cracks open but it cant be proven because capsuleers do not retain that memory  memory has been transferred before application of neurotoxinabout nerve damage  dont forget that one of the things our body knows how to do best even without consciousness is to collect information from sensory organs unless you specifically kill these maybe the dying body will not be able to process it but while sensory system is active it will see it besides capsuleers might start to develop some sort of resistance to the memory transfer as technologies get better and our brain is better adapted for such transfer if you remember correctly your jump clones arent really damaged that much by it this could also help note i didnt try to kill your suggestion at all  i tried to elaborate it enhance it even in turn you are calling stuff lame because it apparently a bit different from your suggestion if you are that stubborn  i am afraid you idea would never work at all learn to adapt
why should we do that when the old post will probably be locked which makes no sense people create new post because they want their views seen and or have further questions so if having multiple post annoys you dont come crying to us about it talk to the geniuss at ccp who lock post for no good reason
the link u put is useless i am speaking about crew you can manage and chose i know crew has been a past topic but reading the postproposal in the assebly hall makes me laugh a lot of small improvements are requested ship crew would allow to customize you play stylein addition i am not speaking about managing hundreds people but just officers imagine to have only two spots available on a cruiser and a choice between a dozen officers it would make your ships much more customizablebtw it is just a point of view but i dont understand why u dont want nothing about xp eve players build their experience while playing eve so why dont do the same with npc crew officers
paragraphs are overratedalso intergalactic summit that way 
can someone explain why threads are locked i mean i underestand if there is some sort of serious drama going on or something but other than that it makes no sense to me why you would ever lock a thread i have seen a number of post where people are saying that subject has already been discussed here before go look it up etc but i say why bother looking it up when its just going to be locked where you cant respond to it so we are forced to create multiple new threads on subjects that already exist so that we can present our views or further questions
agreedi think they recently implemented something where threads autolock after a certain amount of time has passed where nobody has responded to the thread maybe to prevent necro threadswho knows either wayi agree with you here
i was glazing over someones whine thread about pve in general discussion when a thought occured to me while probably not a new ideai think it would be not only awesome but fun to see npc rats warp in and get involved in large fleet engagements i am sure it would cause additional lag and such but it would still be cool the npcs wouldnt want to take sides but instead randomly target and fire on ships in active combat perhaps even give chase within the solar system anybody else think this might be pretty cool to see
noneeeexxxxt
good argument congrats on your fail
no 1 npcs are generally dumb and in the case they have an ai they can be exploited2 npcs dont add anything to the fleet fight either you bring in soooo many that it is an annoying clusterfuck or they dont change a thing3 fleet fights are about pvp which is what they those players want they are not about shooting npcs which is what those players are choosing to not do why would you force that crap on them 4 why would anyone want this if you want to shoot a fleet of npcs go warp into a plex if you want to shoot them with your fleet warp your fleet into a plex
1 ai is being implemented for all rats as per a recent dev blog that ai can be updated and configured further in the future as needed2 npcs would add a random element of danger more interaction with the game world itself during fleet fights regardless of whether you are a strict pvper or not npcs and the factions they represent are a part of the game world3 see 24 see 2
npcs spawn at belts and gates commonly and other celestials less commonly there are tons of ways to interact with them already and in order for them to be a disturbance capable of adding even a modicum of danger to a standard fleet they would need to spawn en mass with a much better ewar ai im certain this would be abused in some farm scheme if you want more random elements of danger then ask for random events that are manageable and meaningful in size for example have you ever seen an incursion gate camp they slowly build in size and become extremely potent with fast locking tackling frigates thatll catch coldwarping fleet inties and heavy hitting bss that can nuke a fully tanked drake before it can power back to the gate this is more along the lines of what you should request not npcs joining fleet battles
well if you want to request that then be my guest what i am requesting and what i want to request is npcs getting involved with the sovereignty warfare in nullsec fleet battles those npcs are part of factions in each region and should be interested in the conflict occurring there
yes i want to be able to summon 100 sleeper battleships that will web scram and neut a gang while i laugh
i and my indie alt approve and support this proposal
this is best idea ive seen on this forum  ever definitely 1this will allow extend gameplay to planets  from harmless pi structures and outposts to extremely expensive and builded trough many monthsyears planetsize cities overgrowing poses and stations in size and capabilities with defenses breaking titans like matches  armies of dust mercenaries fighting for corporations interests  this will be game changer for eve no doubt
also one thing for me it will be probably long and bumpy road to build meaningful cities courscantsized city could take years to build so it could be nice to being able to merchandise cityplanetary structures ownership so you could simply sellbuy existed structures shares on marketcontract instead making military escalation only viable option to take them
ownership transfers have been included so players can sell and transfer cities to other playerscorpsalliances if they were so inclinedand i believe its coruscantyes i hope it would take quite a few monthsyears to grind a city into a planet sized city spanning all pi grids on the surface then again such a city would make techmoons look like small change
owned when i said you were wrong i just meant theyd be dead before the capsule even breachedi wasnt questioning the science of it i tend to do a fair bit of research before anything like thatanyway though being podded really does need to get upgraded it could start as simply as the screen quickly fading out as you reach very low structure they can work on changing the captains quarters bit later if it comes to it i would love to have a room attached to the captains quarters that the fresh clone wakes up inlets face it coming to standing up dressed in your captains quarters is ridiculous if your nervous functions are that poor that your short term memory is that bad after waking up how exactly would you get dressed and walk over to your ship balcony to look stoically over at the hangarin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
actually that is entirely plausible to find yourself standing fully dressed without memory how you did that if just the memory is affected but not reasoning sort of like early onset of alzheimersand still living body emerging from the pod is likely too although there is also a similar possibility of the body being destroyed by the actual ammunition exactly on the moment of hull breach problem with the suggestion of additional stuff in cq lies very close to the problem of incarna itself there are numerous people that never leave the pod in stations  and many never will even with incarna getting a second breath for them it is the space game only as such there will be a quite large chunk of people who will not even notice the difference in fact even detest it if it would be a requirement since they would not see it as immersion but additional hurdle after death that is handled by the stuff they never really liked in the first placeand afaik the most deadly battles usually happen in places where rp is not as common bubbles help greatly so our primary target audience should actually be the 00 population  and speaking from my previous experience of nullsec life  they will treat it as waste of time the cinematic before death however would be actually treated differently due to psychological reasons as well they are still on battlefield perhaps seeing the final moments of the battle and the change in perspective due to size difference would not only add immersion but also contribute to the cinematic effect of ones life in battle while the cinematic after battle would be usually psychologically treated as dead cutscene you are already at the station  how come i have to watch it and not just jump into next ship  my people need mejust think about it from coolness factor  what is more awesome to add to the game  image of the epic battle above you or the image of you getting dressed and wobbly walking from the axlotl tanks

hello wake up we are speaking about a game now i understand spaceship are a concept too far away a game in the future let you dream but in terms of realistic way to play and fly a spaceship has more sense to see a ship with a crew and not a brain connected to something i could reply withif you are hit by a torpedo and one of your million links got disconnected you may be disconnected from the main server of your flying ship supercomputer cmon have you ever seen star wars or star trekeven if we are speaking about something in the future a crew makes more sense and add definitely mor fun than your fantasy about a supercomputer linked to your virtual capsule
arguing about whats realistic and whats not in regards to a science fiction video game is a mute pointcheck and mate
the problem if a player is spammed with a large number of conversations their client may lock up and become nonresponsive organized groups of players occasionally abuse this tactic to prevent players from responding to an attack according to xolve the solution 1 ccp should declare this tactic an exploit and temporarily ban 3ish days all players that participate in any verifiable convo bombs any player participating in these convo bombs know they are abusing and exploiting the conversation feature to create lag and obstruct the client of an opponent this is a clear violation of the terms of service 2 ccp should work on fixing the conv feature to prevent this from lagging out a players computer relevant threads in fi when is an exploit an exploita mittani article discussing gm correspondence that moreless declare this an exploit
first you need proof of if this mythical convo bomb according to your sources no cap pilot recieved a convo during that operation there for there is no proof that this actually took place lag in eve is a mystery sometimes appears for no reason
i propose that you reformulate this thread to a neutral tone right now it comes out as a public cry about your coalitions loss firstly your booboo makes this proposal look like it was motivated by vengeance not a flaw in game mechanics secondly your tears make it look like what youre really after is ccp reimbursing your carrier losses and banning those who kicked your sorry bottom thirdly your hurting bottom tries to hide the fact that your fleet was lost due to them being 20km away from pos shield and capping out  not convo spam fourthly your crying shows incredible double morals as convoing has always belonged to cfc repertoireif you want to make a serious proposal take your personal vendetta out of it
i agree hearsay is not evidence of wrong doing ccp has logs and assuming they can verify it they should punish it people that feel they are wronged should file a petition for ccp to investigate it there is no reason for 100 people to suddenly pm an opponent in the middle of a battle other than to disrupt their client if that ever happens to you you clearly have the grounds to file a petition and all those involved should be appropriately punished like with a temp ban in truth ccp really shouldnt need to tell people this is wrong as it is clearly a violation of the tos but some people need to have there hand held
ironically this hasnt happened to me or my coalition i just get annoyed when people cheat to win agonys not involved in any sov crap and frankly blues suck balls i dont think ccp should reimburse any ship losses as anyone that takes their ship into a fleet battle should accept its going to die perhaps ill tone down the post some im really just peeved that people would attempt such tactics
i agree that the convo bomb tactic isnt making the game any better but worse but giving retroactive bans  especially when both sides are known to use the same exploit  doesnt sound to me like a solution that you claim it to be
1 in acknowledgement of the problem1 to the proposed solutionthe solution is not to ban players for abusing this mechanic that would take great efforts by the gms to enforce and police it no the real solution is a game change that neutralizes the n
i think ccp should just hardcode it so that if a play is set to autoreject convos that the data shouldnt reach them at all policing this as a matter of policy would be difficult time consuming and unnecessary in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
adding convobomb to my bag full of dirty nasty pirate tricks thanks
ccp will not be able to implement this in a quick manner so until then how do you suggest ccp deals with players that abuse the convo mechanic i figured a quick swat on the ass like with a 3dayish ban is appropriate way to treat kids that misbehave
a swat on my what sir oo hmmmm how did you know
this module is missing in action last i heard it was getting art assets is it coming out in retribution could the csm look into itenquiring minds especially the blaster orientated ones need to know
several years ago i heavily advocated for an ingame display of account time remaining when time was less than 10 days it was welcomed with open arms ccp even took interest with one of their dev blogs for a winter release however we still do not have any visibility of when our game time will end when paying by cc or any service other than plex the plex status does nothing but give you words of encouragement that your account is in good standing even though its going to end in 10 minutes because you paid with a credit card and there are no funds on the card when i pay with plex i know 2 weeks in advance when my account will endi hereby propose an ingame modification to show exactly when your game time will end and the last method used some of you will say wahh use the account management site noob and i will kindly direct you to the door this proposal is for the transparency of when your account will end no matter where you decide to check on it
im still locked in my captains quartersupported
1good call on this possibly best to indicate it on the login screen so as not to disturb the immersion ccp is going for
either there or the plex status section of the character sheet they introduced yet does absolutely nothing
let me start with the standard disclosure i love eve ive been playing for 6 years without any unsub type break ive spent most of the last 4 years running 4 separate accounts im not crying about anything im not whinging about anythingthere are many aspects of the game that i feel need improvement some of which weve seen dev love applied and some of which we will be seeing dev love applied at the end of this yearthere are others that im aware ccp are looking at such as corp management panel  posshowever one of my gripes ive not seen any movement on well ever reallythat is the political relationships between the 4 empiresccp loves to remind us and for good reason that new eden is the biggest sandbox environment in the worldwhy is it then that the factions are still tied at the hipweve all read the same chronicles the same novellas and the same novels havent wewere all aware of the same political social and economic rivalries between the 4 empires arent weso why is it that amarrcaldari and minmatargalente are still tied at the hipi would dearly like to see some separation applied between the empiresan incharacter point of viewi graduated as a capsuleer a little over 6 years ago having been selected after getting excellent marks in the apititude and physiology tests implemented by the state war academy after id completed my training i became a private contractor in support of the state taking to heart the lessons the state imparts about working for the good of the state applying my best talents and skill in furtherance of the goals of state and accumulating the rewards that i risked life and limb and hull forwhen the shock of the matari thukker fleets happened the assaults on the concord station the retrieval and exodus of the long thought dead starkmanir tribe i felt so strongly for them i had a great desire to support their initiative for freedom oppressive religious slavery being against the ideals of statesadly though when i endeavoured to provide support to the minmatar republic corporations whether providing security or minerals or logistical support  those acts were frowned upon by the amarr and for reasons that escape me my own state slapped me on the wrists alsohad i been shooting state forces then surely i would understand but yet when my firepower is applied to amarrian loyalists vessels or worse their associated blood raider pirates which is an act i have undertaken repeatedly for my own state i still get slapped for it this is a situation that strikes me as both irrational and in the long term untenablenoone i work with within the state holds any love for the amarr noone like a slaver or a bully so why is it our politicians feel a need to kowtow to them tibus heth certainly doesnt feel that needits time for a changeoocplease csm dig in to this talk with ccp lets remove that link between the empires give us capsuleers that extra freedom to support who we want without being punished for it irrationally
if you want to run a corporation like a business then the prerogative to do so is on you not ccp besides most ceos dont want that sort of information made public not even to their own members there are trust issues along with outside influences to deal with if said information leaked outif youre looking for advice on how to run a corp i wrote a guide which is stickied in eve new citizens qa resources

i didnt say summon the faction rats would just be there harrassing anybody they target at random they would not be there to pick a side but have their own goal of eliminating both of the other opposing forces maybe even do what the sansha incursions do and drop in their on capitals and supers to prevent farming of these rats or abuse they would need to not drop any loot or salvage and offer no reward for their destruction they would also need to dissapear after the fleet engagement is over to prevent them from staying in a system
oh look a bump in the roadin all seriousness this idea is still needed as it will revolutionize warfare and transporti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

sigh you greatly insult my intelligence sir but i suppose i started it your bs understanding of science speaks for itself though apparently by the ignorant court of popular opinion i am defeated i do like some of the cunstructive thoughts you seem to be stirring up though and you are trying highsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom
it is your words that greatly insult your intelligence i have shown proof of my ideas with 2 links one if directly from nasagov while second one was written by nasaemployed mit physics graduate you on the other hand never went beyond personal attacks without any scientific backing or constructive thought if you want to continue discussion that could actually benefit this idea of yours come back with at least scientificallybacked results any further attempts to ruin your own idea will be ignoredyes ive decided to step down to this level simply because i actually liked the idea but not the execution of it
i am not arguing it is not a matter of realistic or non realistic it is a matter of funwhat would be more fun for you having a fantasy about capsule connected to a super computer i have never seen a capsule connected to anything honestly during my playing time in eve or a crew to customize your ship having a bit more feeling to fly something alive and to have more choices about game stylei really dont understand the utility of certains posts we should discuss ideas for game improvement not immaginations about something doesnt exist at all i can immagine whatever i want about this game but it is not the point nor the right forum for that
i dont really see a problem or have ever seen a problem i allowing for the following modulecrew complimentcomes in 5 sizes small medium large capital super capital costs from 10k to 100mill ships cant fly without one includes scotty the engineer and a bunch of donuts but if we didnt made it mandatoryships without a crew have no inherent bonuses runs off
never convo bombed someone nor has it been done to me but i am well aware of this non exploit exploit i agree it needs to officially be deemed an exploit obviously a code change is needed as well to make it impossible to do in the future i disagree with retroactive bans although i agree that you should know such a thing is a violation of the eula
now youve gone and done it ccp was trying so hard to dazzle you with a new expac and hope that you would forget the man behind the curtain but no you had to find out the truth about the wizard of oz
simply adding your account expiration date to the already existing built in calender as an event with a reminder say 5 days ahead of your expiration would be simple and effectivei already do this so i dont forget to buy a plex or two
it would not plex are pilot licenses
heres how i see it the game shows you when your account expires if you are a trial account or paid with plex but if you pay with a credit card you have no notification of when the cycle ends other than the account management screen or your credit card billing statementare you not given a bill every month for your cell phone electric cable insurance even if you choose to have those bills automatically paid for you still receive a statement of when it is due

afk cloacking is use for a lot of reason and theres no middle or half way arround ityou might even need to use it to go to the wc when rl your body tell you topsy warfare spying urgent need no place to park your ship waiting for a scout etc people have a lot of reason to use itthat is part of the game and its not an exploit you need to get use to it
whats the point though if its just a must have thing with a set cost and no new gameplay mechanics there is no point adding it you might as well say that crew costs are already included in the hull cost and leave it at that no wasted dev time no wasted gameplay potential same end result i think whatever the chosen mechanic is any sort of xp grinds are bad and should be avoided like a plague the problem with xp gains for crews is that it just leads to xp grinding by any means necessary instead of playing the game normally and doing what they enjoy people will endure almost anything to grind for xp even when they dont like it they will do it and dislike the game for making them do it getting around this problem is easy though dont allow crews to gain xp instead have different types of crews with different advantages for example standard crew comes with the hull and provides the normal stats but alternate crews can be used to alter existing stats in some way bonuses to some areas with negatives to others so even the standard crew sees a lot of use just an example for something different without trying to crowbar in an xp grind mechanic to the game
marging trading is a typical market tool in real economyi never scam anyone and i am very active on the marketyou could easily see a scam coming in the marketbut marging trading isnt a scam in rl marging trading is use within a lot of productits not a scam at all when you sale something and the other dont have the cash he simply cannot buy itnobody is scammed you dont loose anything someone else will buy your product later thats alland by the way even with marging trading your isk are stuck in escrow you cannot do anything with it and you have no interest on it either that is not fair i would say
its a good idea and could create a market with corpses or memorial1  implant recovery with skills pos module in low sec and 002  by product the reprocessing of the mass body another skill in the same pos that give some water and gaz for exemple link to planetary product not a lot but nothing is lost everything is transformed3  the possibility to give a chance to a body to have a place in order to rip the npc soe could have the task to collect bodies for their final place could give a small fees its more the act of giving a place that count we could have in each region a memerial station unique design and huge dedicated for it4  an alliance in 00 could erect a memorial near a sun its espensive as a stationyou could reprocess your enemy and honor your deadit could be destroyed if the soverignty change or the other could let it orbiting arround the sunone sun could have 8 orbiting memorial at max and any alliance could have only 2 memorial at the same timedeal could be made between opponant to tranfert the memorial in respect of the deadit will honor an alliance and the one who destroy a memerial should have a note of dishonori probably forgot some other use but those 4 are already a good deal with copses and what we do with it
recovering implants seems a pretty lowimagination way to use the idea of corpse salvaging much more interesting would be to use the burnedout implants and other biological material from player corpses to manufacture new highly illegal types of advanced implants or biocontrol interfaces for new types of ships or modulesa resource gathering profession driven by purely pvp activities would certainly be something interesting
its not pretty low imagination ideas come and evolve with brainstorming ityour idea could be added as some sort of invention with the body recovered implant as if they have been used they are not ready to be sale again either they have a refurbishment in order to sale it or invention that give advance implantrecovering poucentage in that case could be important and the cost of refurbishement doesnt flood the marketwith that you could place another market in the hand of capsuleerbut and theres a big but there some people will go on headhunting in order to kill to recover implantso on the other hand you need to put in place some safe guard about ityou dont want some people to exploit itthe emplementation could be done in two stages first recovery and refurbishment and then later when the market is more mature the possibilities of invention throught bodiesbut as i said in a post earlier we shall have the possibilities to offer a resting place for the corpse
due to a dozen of recent hotdropoclocks and cries about counters to cynoships i thought id bump this a bit
i dont think ccp should get rid of the system but it has to evolve thats for surebecause you could exploit the bounty or farm iti know people talked already about it but here some idea the bounty should be link to kill right the killing righth should have an extended timeits not because we have clone that life should be easilly disposedeither you use the killing right to have your moment of glory or you make a deal with concord an exchangethat doesnt apply in 00its then that new rule should applyin the killing right the one who give the last blow got the maximum the other half eachyou pay 10 of the bounty and concord the rest that should give incentive bountywhen a kill right is trade those guys start to flash red to everybody its not only a bounty it become a huntwith a safety guard when you killed the guy with his bounty you are not flashing red to hes corp mate or allianceand then the bounty is done or the guy has to wait in station for his bounty to end but when the deambulation will come if he goes out of his quater he could be targeted as well at with any gun or knife that will be availabletool for the bounty concord should have a board accessible inside ship fighting class ship only no industrial or mining ship it allow you to know that less than 3 jump from your position in a system or a station if docked a bounty is waiting to be takenand we coud have the same board accessible from captain quater but with a range of 10 jump the change of region dont count only the number of jumpa bounty link to a killright is right to my point of view its probably fair in the game
the wizard of oz should have invested in better security

i laughed a little at the extra 2 cup sizesthey arent big enough already either way the plex for breast cancer is a great idea in fact i really wish ccp would start doing plex drives for multiple benifits all at the same time keep them open indefinately that kind of thing would really get attention towards eve in a good way
i hope you realize that any frig destroyer or cruiser would be instapopped by sleeper bs in a c4c6 warping fhrough gatesis a mad idea anyway anomalies in a c5 or c6 are way different from the ones in c1c4 whs the scram neut if you do them in a wrong way or shoot one of the triggers by accident you may have a hard time or loose the fleet in the worse casesomeone on page 3 compared anomalies to incursions imho i think incursions are a lot easier no risk to be ganked eitherwormhole stabilizers is a bad word its more an invasiontool than anyting else but even then there is no other reason i would know how to use it than for invading and making sure i can get a few caps in when my enemy is sleeping it saves the time needed to collase and scanning time though
eidric pigs ideas are better than any of yours instead of debating science how about you debate the effects in which he refers its obvious this game isnt pinned down completely to science otherwise stations would actually orbit planets and moons and my spaceship wouldnt slow down when the engines stopped or i would at least see some retro rocket fire i mean come on so stop trying to show off how smart you think you are because you half read some science articles and admit that the effect could use some change
i agree with the possibility to hack an off line pos and module as wellwhen a pos goes offline theres a 7 days timer before the hacking process could be done a hacking pos skill higher the level less time to do it but it should take twice or three time the normal time you need to install it this skill has to be link to several other skill at lv4 or 5 it has to be a real job and the training time is 5but i think the chance of recovering what is inside should be offer you have to have the hacking pos skill at lv4 and the training time is 7 each lv give you a  of recovery the lv5 give 50 for exemple
there is a fault in your reasoning afk cloaking is the only activity where someone does not benefit from being afk how do you actually know if the player is afk or not
easy its the fact that ppl dont know if the person cloaked for up to 23 hrs in system is active or not and they cant scan him down but its not the cloaked ship that stops them mining its the black ops fleet that he could jump in so all that really needs to be done is put a black ops jammer into system sov and then no one will care if the cloaky is active or not because he is basicly usless against even a half decent sheild tanked barge
i have to admit that doesnt hurt the active cloaker
there doesnt need to be a point for something like this its just a matter of realism especially if ccp does say your ships have crews god it also could create potential markets and trade routes if these items were only produced read educated and prepared for space travelling at certain planetsconstelations else nobody really thinks a ship has crew because1 you mine asteroids2 you build it possibly slowly from asteroids3 you enter it and exit station all in under a weektheres never mention of anyone in there really but either way its one of those things the sole bonus i suggeted would be somethign that simply enable a ships bonuses and doesnt really complicate things or more hilariouslymaybe you could have 4 crew races which when applied to a ship gave it bonuses to each of their races weapons ever wanted to fly a stabber with blasters ugh get a gallentean crew im sue they know how to fit the things
for industry pilots out in the cold dark zero zero getting access to trit pye mex in null sec is overly difficult because the lack of it in grav sites and the fact that corps are rarely given access to large patches of 00 systems where they can freely roam systems and mine asteroid belts unlike empire space on the flip side grav sites yield an over abundance of nocxium zydrine and megacyte ores even at the lowest index levels this is partly intended so that their is a flow of null sec mined minerals to empire but with industry indexes a change in loot tables and the growth of 00 thousands of systems with poor belts now have access to an unlimited supply of high end minerals and no realistic way to make use of them all these 00 minerals go to the only system that can support their sale jitaalong with flooding the jita market with high ends most null sec industry corps  alliances buy low ends from the same market in bulk and do what is called mineral compression this pulls billions of low end minerals off the jita market and converts them to meta 0 mods to then be shipped to null sec when this is done on a large scale this puts stress on the market hub and leads to large movements in mineral pricesmy proposal isa rebalance of the contents of these complexes in order to make 00 production less difficult make oreminerals that were once considered rare more difficult to access and profitable at the same time bring mining up to par with recent changes to anomalies where pilots making the most isk are at the greatest risk thus increasing pvp in evefirst rebalancing to to make production easierfirst of all let me explain that i am going to be using the drakes as a analog of the common t1 buildable item so gravimetric complexes and my changes to them can be compared to each other now to the complexes themselvessmall gravimetric sites are the easiest to attain and maintain yet they cant support production at all and are overstocked with way more high ends then can be used you can not build 2 drakes off of the 8 million m3 in this sitemy proposal to change the small site in a way that makes it a key site for all pilots wanting to do production in null sec in order to do that it needs a change in its current contents this also helps to conquer my second goal of making abc ores and their minerals more difficult to attain and more profitable a modified small would drop from 8 million m3 to a total of 55 million and minerals in the right ratio that 20 drakes can be made it takes 15000 arkonor 25000 bistot and 15000 crokite out of circulation for all index level 1 systems just for starters when comparing the current small at 870m isk for 8 million m3 and the modified small at 55 million m3 and worth 1006m isk one would hardly miss the high end minerals at all future outlook  if the minerals drop to nov 2010 levels this site would be worth approximately 600m below is a list of the asteroids that would be found in the small gravimetric complex in unitsveldspar  9000000scordite  7000000pyroxeres  2500000plagioclase  3500000omber  125000kernite  175000jaspet  100000hemorphite  65000hedbergite  65000gneiss  30000dark ochre  35000crokite  10000bistot  5000arkonor  5000second make rare minerals rare againwe have already taken a huge chunks of high end ores out of the system by modifying the most basic gravimetric complex and reducing its yield of high end minerals it offers here is where we slowly put it back in but do it at a ratio that means less of an extreme over abundance as before and allowing each site to yield reasonable amounts of low end minerals to support its use in t1 production locally what we should end up with is an overall reduction in high end minerals that can be achieved but a larger potential for profit with corps that can maintain high index levels and build off the minerals they minethird put pvp back in 00 and increase the risk for minerscorps and alliances willing to upgrade the index to 4  5 do large scale production and produce large amounts of high end minerals will literally be placing themselves on the map maps used by pvp corps and alliances that roam 00 looking for index levels and systems showing large activityin the endwhat does this do for the industrialistplayers wanting to build in 00 will have better access to low end minerals an ability to seed 00 markets with items mined refined and built locallywhat it does for the isk minersminers will be driven like never before to increase index levels to access ores that are once again considered rare and valuable but currently over mined and worthless being accessible to anyone with a hulk and ore prospecting array iwhat it does for pvp in 00as the changes made in the past in sov levels used to limit anomalies availability shifted pilots in to smaller spaces isk miners wanting to earn the highest amount of isk possible will be interested in upgrading indexes beyond level 123 and turning themselves into targets for roaming fleets the pure industrialists only interested in actual production will be less effected
if you are new player or old player that looks for a corp and you flavour of the game is incursion and you want to join a corp that is specific for this part of the game itUFFFDs not availble in the recruitment searchthere is corps just for this part of the game but since there is no option to search for them its not easy to find them either
try the alliance and corporation recruitment center you have the wrong subforum friend
no itUFFFDs not in the wrong forumthis is simply an option in the search window where you find corps recruiting that is missingyou can search for specific corps that do faction warfare and so on but you cant search for specific corps that specialize in incursion runningso this is very much the correct forum to bring up the subject and see what ccp thinks
i much prefer the salvaging approach to the looting approach  to be honest id like to see the same for shipwrecks where instead of plucking intact modules out of a wreck you only got smashed up components which you would need to process much like salvage is processed currently plucking an old implant out of a body wiping it down and selling it on is a bit linear for my likingeither way there needs to be a modification so that player names frozen corpse becomes player names mutilated corpse after it has had the useful materials scraped out of it
i think scatims idea of using corpses to make new contraband is more interesting because it adds a new dimension to criminal activity in eve right now if we want to be unethical dealers of illegal goods all we have are boostersmake it so that clone gradesp and implants at time of death affect corpse quality somehow too so theres a reason to seek out olderricher players corpses and discourage farming alpha clones off your alt
agreed with both of you some sort of grade in corpses could give a better marketto have a mature market you need more corpses available some could be recover from wreck or from some missionand you could add some flavor if i could say that like scentist body give implant for science and research tourist give accuracy like targeting an exotic dancer could give implant for inertia etcthe contreband could be part of the trade but i think it could be link to some skills to hide contreband in general in ships and special containeri always found annoying getting caught at a gate for moving forbidden stuff without havintg the possibility to hide ita skill for contreband ability  give access to the second skill at lv3a skill for the ability to hide contreband in ship  give access to the third skill at lv2a skill for enhanced containerthis three skill at lv 5 give you 100 chance of not being caught
blockade runner were use for itbut they lost the 2 warp strenght the had beforei prefer to use a blockade runner instead of a deep space transport to go deep in 00deep space transport need a full rebalancing and the blocade runner stay as it is nowi agree the deep space transport need to integrate advance electronic countermesure like bubble proof faster  2 warp strengh got it already cover op cloackless cargo in exchanged and more expensive to built
it would be better to have capitals and subcaps doing black ops to have a jump time rather than teh cyno timer the further you are jumping from the longer it takes to arricve on the field the larger teh ship the slower the travel timeive never been a fan of instant travel stargates could stay more or less instant with teh reason being the absolutely massive power available to them as stationary objects that have only one purpose as oppose to a starship that has so many other things it has to cram into its hull
thank you sable moran for your support

i personally think if a pos owner lets the fuel run out they dont deserve a 7day safety timer there already exist plenty of pos applications that allow eve players to track exactly how much fuel is in your pos eve generates notifications when a pos is running low on resources there is no excuse for letting a pos run out of fuel and if you do you should be risking its loss as such i recommend the following a offline towers should have no shields if you dont fuel your pos you should be very worried about someone stealing or destroying it b im not a fan of hacking poss but im not completely opposed to it i prefer just reducing a poss ehp enough to make it easily destroyed but i also realize that most people wont want to waste their time and ammo shooting a pos without some type of motivation since there are waaayyy to many abandoned poses in space hacking a tower is reasonable compromise that encourages people to scoop them note hacking needs to be a criminal concordable activity this means you need to wardec a corp to hack its tower in highsec which gives more than reasonable notification for a highsec corp to fuel their offline poss c what is the point of sleep mode rf exists to give people a chance to protect your inspace assets and you can fuel a pos to do the same not fueling the pos is akin to not stronting the tower sleep mode should not be a backup pos state that the pos enters when it runs out of fuel but should be a specific minimal operation mode used to maintain the pos inexpensively sleep mode should have major penalties to the pos 50 shields all pos modules offline no pos force field in exchange for much cheaper fuel and maybe even an rf timer the fuel capacity of a pos in sleep mod should not be more than a month with the idea that players put a pos in sleep mode on purpose to essentially reserve a poss realestate while not leaving the pos vulnerable to hacking
easy fix a pos with no fuel will degrade orbit after 2 weeks of orbital decay the pos will fall into the gravity well of the moon it orbits and drag all the modules with it
i personally dont have a cloakable ship on my combat alt that i enjoy using so i can only speculate on what i have learnt so far the only way in which i can see there being a method to possibly appease both sides is to have a emission rating or heat rating on the cloak this could then build up over extended use of say a hour or what ever length of time is suitable you could then have a scanner to scan for these emissions or heat build up the template is in place if they used a similar model to the planet scanning for resources where by white spots indicate heatemissions this would also mean if these emission are produced by all ships then the best place for a cloaker is on main routes alternatively if its heat based the sun or volcanic planets also produce heat as do big facilitiesand not to ruin continuity in lownull sec have interference on the scanner that makes it a lot less accurate so that you could only scan down to withing say 1au of the target that way the high sec care bares get their counter measure that is partially effective and cloaking ops are not totally compromisedi mean if they use the heat side of thing for the build up afk cloaking could still happen if they leave it near say a star but then one scan would give that away in the sense no heat spots else where on the mapanyway what you think viable to both sides
someone actively cloaking behind ememy lines doing some recon work may very well be cloaked up for more than an hour you have now nerfed an active cloakersame thing for someone cloaked in a wh he could be stalking the local residents setting up the correct time to pounce your scannable heat signature now alerts the residents that someone is cloaked in the wh you just broke wormholesum how is this anything but a nerf to cloakingjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
the way i would suggest doing it would be it is only a dominant showing of a heat signature if the ship has been on one spot for more than a hour kind of a if you stay still the heat radius gets bigger making it hard to hide
this thread is terrible in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
its not my fantasty its ccps and theyre not going to change the game lore because one bloke on the forums is having a hissy fit according to ccp and their officially published fiction non capsuleer crews are massively inefficienttaking this issue away from a lore perspective adding crews means more things for ccp to balance balance is already a bloody nightmare that ccp are now putting a very large amount of time into so its unlikely they will find this idea even vaguely appealing if you think dragging the icon of a person into a new fitting slot will be fun and then spending extra time in eft trying to work out what the new optimum fit for all your ships will be then your too easily please not to mention the fact you will be adding another level of complexity to a game that ccp is already putting effort into making more accessible to newer players i could rant forever about why this is a bad idea but ill stop therein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
the thing is that people doing scams arent actually hurting anyone with the trade that fails in that transaction you have the items you try to sell it to them and the sale fails youre still left with all your items and you didnt lose any money in the failed transaction so everything stays the same for you you have been exploited but the exploitation happened before the failed trade and no game mechanics were circumventedwhy is that relevant its relevant because it determines what actions are acceptable in treating such a minute problem minute because it in no way interferes with the well being of the market system doesnt steal anything from the person being tricked and is very easy to spot beforehand any solution must therefore be equally good for the health of the system and be balanced with the severity of the problem it tries to solvethat is partly why freezing their wallets or putting the in to negative balance seem like bad solutions freezing a wallet is a problem because everything in eve demands the wallet to fuction all kinds of small costs and taxes are involved so you cant play the game without a positive working wallet it doesnt seem appropriate to stop the other player from playing the game just because he put up a market order with no losers negative wallet is much worse since it presumably pays the seller from money that doesnt actually exist in the game this is an issue since its concievable that you can make orders that allow you to print increasing amounts of money from nothing and you wouldnt need other people to do it it doesnt matter if your wallets are red at that point since you can buy plexs and make new accounts and continue exploiting in case you didnt know training a trading alt is very fast let alone a character who simply needs  the trading branch is so fast to fully train that it doesnt even warrant an attribute respec im sure ccp could crack down on people exploiting such a system but again its potentially a gamebreaking solution for an insignificant problemim not saying there cant be ways to have consequenses for people doing it but what you suggest as solutions are more damaging to the market and the game than could even theoretically be its not a problem that must be fixed at all cost or the game cant function its an easy to spot scam that doesnt do any damage to the system or the player falling for it its just a bait to get a greedy player to buy some overpriced items that he can resell to recoup his investment all im saying is that any potential solution to the issue must be appropriate to the nature and severity of the problem
i start to wonder if only a csm member or if a developer is aware of this idea
maxi totally agree with you your petition would really improve the gameplay and it is what ccp have to do to the next expansion i would really appreciate if the eve community move in this directioni have spent some time trying to find a way to gather some ideas about what is expected of the pos revamp that the last csm claimed as a goal i would really appreciate your opinion there also if the csm read this i would really appreciate if they take this effort to cpp and some dev use it to speed up their job link discussion  new pos system  block built  starbasecraftthx o7 new pos system new sov system
that would work but what is the fun in that
cant support this if you cant fully fuel a pos why should you be alowed to claim the moonjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
guys ccp plans on reworl the whole pos system if you read the last csm meeting minutes you will see thatplease take a look at this tread discussion  new pos system  block built  starbasecraft new pos system new sov system
or we could just not implement stupid mechanics that do nothing but nerf legitimate playstyles because crybaby bears need even more safety than they already havei know its a shocking idea
like i said i think cloaking is fine as is but that to one side every development in war has a counter measure at present the cloak rules supreme with no counter measure by adding a way to counter it you can still use it and do things fine but just means those that use it with less shall we say strategy get a kick in the buttpersonally though drone swarms work well against cloaks well enough that its a viable counter provided you take certain other stepseither way i was merely adding a option of compromise that could work
so all an afk cloaker has to do is point at a random spot in space and switch on engines no longer stationary no heat buildupyou could counter that by saying well that dosnt count they have to warp at least once an hournow its a massive nerf to active non covert ops ships that have managed to get in place undetected and are waiting cloaked to spring on someone or performing intelgatheringjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
ok i understand ccp needs to make things more simple as they need to add players to eve and make more money as i understand crew is a concept which would need to be balanced properly but i dont work for ccp so i am not asking myself how can i balance it properly and i dont play eve because is simple actually i would play it more if it was more complexi addition i didnt discovered crews by my self it has been hugely discussed already i decided to make a new post as i didt find any post about that in the new forumsby the way try to follow this point eve is a complex game in the beginning once you understand how it works isnt that hard to play and this is the reason why old players not new ask for big improvements i understand that ccp need to make the game accessible to everyone but look at that under a marketing eye who do you care the most players who paid for years the subscription or players who try the game for a month or few and than they quiti think both need to be listened and for example as someone suggested already you may have crew in biggers ships from bc for example so you will avoid the crew management to anyone who is new to the gamei mean we are discussing just the concept of crew i put an idea but i am sure it can be improved hoping to have something extra to deal during my game play

we keep looking for an easy updatehrolt ceo live free die proud
copypaste from my post in this threada very painful realizationbeing at war with dec shield makes us no longer able to declare new warsyou might say sure you can still declare wars technically youre right but each corporation that leaves dec shield creates its own war and each new war that is created raises the price of declaring a new war by 50 million isk today about seven corporations left dec shield when i went to declare war on a separate target i noticed that the cost to do so would be 400 millionthis is already in the realm of impossibility to be able to afford but the worst part is that if this continues we will no longer be able to take mercenary jobs since clients will not pay such high war fees even if we do the actual work for freeso zerg what this essentially means is that if you cycle about 20 alt corporations in and out of your alliance on a weekly basis all of dec shields currentlytrapped targets will have war bills so expensive that they wont be able to declare new wars
zerg its obvious you and your fellows have put a lot of time and efforts into finding and using the brokeass mechanics ccp has foisted on us yet again concerning wardecs what i want to know is how long it is going to take them to fix this cf so that wars can actually be useful againhas there been any conversation between the csm and ccp about this
i talked to veritas and soundwave in vegas this last weekend and went over many of the major loopholes and the such soundwave gave me his business card and asked me to email him more information im currently working on a more concise write up so i can mail it off to him was planning to do so todayas far as urgency they were all of the mindset that it wasnt a pressing enough issue yet and there werent enough complaints or public outcry to warrant shifting gears to address the issues quicker so at least in the short term i wouldnt expect anything to change but well continue to push for fixes anyways
not what i wanted to hear but thanks for the answer and for continuing to push the issue keep fighting the good fight
seriously is this thread still going do us a favour and look up the old ones everything you anticloakers are saying has been covered literally hundreds of times in previous threads do some god damn reading i am done baby sitting you lot and slowly and patiently explaining why the hundreds of terrible ideas you people come up with are crapi just dont get it what is so wrong with you people that your so damn scared of 1 person in a system if someone is there and you want to run anomalies move next door is that really that scaryin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
your forumfu is weak i found these 2 threads right away
oh really i didnt know that now that i have this what to follow list i am sure i will win the gamerevamp and rebalance it is something will always happen especiallly in a game like eve where you have two major expansion every year ccp is iproving and adding new stuff to the game i am wondering if one day the will add crew to and personally i think they will do thatso even without crew you still need to revamp and rebalance old contentsmaybe they try but adding more skills will always put new pilots in the backread all the posts and you will find out that this issue has been already discussed there are several ways to not bothernewbies with crew andor other stuff crew would be not mandatory like rigsthis advice is totally useless but thank you for it i really appreciate itthe reason of the post is not i want a crew cause i would like it the post is about something which could be added in the future in one of following expansion crew would add surely something nice to the game think about having a fight with the chance to loose one of your officers and his bonuses it is something which cant happen with rigs or modules unless u overload them ofc crew would add the lucky variable factor which is actually misseda game is a game ofc but adding any realism isnt bad and ships have crew in a fight crew has a big role would be nice to add something like that in any big eve fight the concept isnt really usefull for pve fights but mostly for pvp fleet combatsif you cant understand that ok but please keep your intresting post somewhere else in any proposal forum would be nice to see suggestions to improve the idea and not useless post i
thank you for your kind words durcon we can all do our part by traveling to the gallente starter systems in a proud naga finding a gallente noob in their first frig and blast them in the name of the state explain to them that you did it because they are gallente and that everyone in the game will continue to hate them until they choose another race also tell them that it is socially unacceptable to mine in highsec after youve been playing longer than 6 monthshighsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom

i tried to skim it but was overwhelmed by rp stuff is there anything relevant to the assembly hall forum in that thread
good afternoon csmis it possible to deliberate or consider changing incursion mechanics so that if a fleet enters a site they either have a timer or are exclusively tied to the site until they down it or leaveim not sure how to actually make it work but itd be pretty fantastic to implement something along those linescheers
im sorry can you please explain what the problem is
eve is dying lowsec is drying up 00 is dead unless youre part of the cfc or hbc blobbing each other and in 2 months you can make 50bil flying in circles doing nothing productiveand we are pissedhere are several propositions with ways to execute them1 faction farmingcurrently everyone and their motherbrotherdaughtersistercousinaunt is leaving whatever it is they are doing to get in on the isk farming train that is faction warfare you take a frigate fit a warp core stab and orbit some plexs until they are capped then one day you take control of the system and cash out there is no incentive for the opposing faction to defend their space because they are doing the exact same thing in their own spacewhat needs to be donereduce lp gain from capping the plexs by 80 while increasing lp gain from killing attackers by 250 scaling with rank vs rank if a rank 10 kills a rank 1 please excuse me i dont know the level ratings or crap youd gain say 25 lp but if a rank 1 kills a rank 10 250 this is solely on defense against other players this will reduce the lp  isk farming that is currently happening while bringing life back in to the spirit of factional warfare2 npc nullsec vs sov secthere is absolutely no reason to go to npc nullsec other than to engage in some random fights and dock up when you get outnumbered should sov space have the best systems sure but to an extent there needs to be an incentive to move to npc nullsec for example if you are in syndicate there should be more serpentis related events weather it be more serpentis plexs better rats i mean it is the serpentis area of operations you know they have fleets there as well as exclusive gallente related moon goo same goes for the other npc nullsec regions you could also decrease the true sec of systems the further from npc space they are reducing the number of botters out in the assend of nowhere3 promote piracywhat if there were some npc factions that encouraged piracy similar to faction wafare but more on a non role play level for example once you have pirated 100 targets you could gain access to smuggler gates creating shortcuts to other areas of lownull sec suddenly you could be pirating in decon and gain access to jump from decon to reblier i know that is a bit of an exaggeration but you get the idea
i know there are plans for fw changes in the winter expansion but this is something that really needs to be addressed right now as it is an exploit
i still cant believe fw lp farming hasnt been nerfed it was known early on that it was broken and it hasnt been touched even reducing the tier bonus to 20 instead of 50 wouldve at least helped i actually ignored it for 2 months expecting it to get hotfixed as soon as i started trying to take advantage its 1 month after i started lp farming and i have sold 10bil worth of items from fw and still have another 70bil worth to goccp letting this go to winter is just massively incompetent
what really irritates me is that they have deemed the lp method an explot told how its an exploit then proceeded to announce that nothing would be done until the winter expansion
thank you roannon
if they did something like this im guessing itd be more along the lines of a pink shirt or something like that but it certainly wouldnt be as memorable
hell i would be all for a pink shirt with the breast cancer ribbon on it its one more way to show support no pun intended and why not i am sure there are plenty of eve players that would appreciate that in fact it would be awesome if ccp made a shirt or something when they do donation plex drives for charities nontradeable nondestructible shirts or something signifying that you donated hell i get a sticker from the fire department every time i give them 5 bucks
is that afk guy in local bother youthe solution is simple make the afk guy disappear from local when he cloaksthere now he wont be bother you now wont youseriously afk cloaking is only as bad is the mind allows it to bethe only people i see whining are ratters and botters who want to mine in complete safety in 00htfu
qft
so here it is i was sat up thinking about this game and i realised after reading the time line that its far far into the future yet there are no aliens in the game at allso i was thinking maybe it is time to add some in i was thinking about perhaps some species that is hostile and mounts incursions or possibly a region discovered through a wormhole of ancient gate of some kindnow for ships and weapons i was thinking about what is not currently covered in the game i mean you got guns and lasers even missiles so perhaps a organic race as for if they are playable or not i do not mind if they are or are not would just be a cool event to see first contact with a alien speciesanyway thats all i got for nowps sorry if this come up before i run a search for alien and nothing showed
whywe have 5 major factions 4 of which are playable each their own distinct dramas and political issues and a multitude of subfactions that havent been completely fleshed outalso i feel that adding aliens would distract from the distinctly human story in eve
yeah i can see what your saying about there being a lot of factions and such already i am just thinking it would give the devs something to aim for in a long run as a cool event i mean they could do something like for the introduction of the species play them themselves and launch a invasion into a area for examplealso a new species in the game could also open up a load more option for wh exploration and in general would add things to the game as for the distracting from humanity side of the game if they were non playable it would just be a fun bunch of rats and a tool for devs to use for events
the eve universe has a rich and well plannedthought through lore precipitated by ccp three books if only two good ones and plenty of extra ccp arent suddenly going to add allies into it besides when you say aliens i presume you mean beings of equal power and intelligence to humans if not then there are already alien creatures the slaver hounds are certainly not just dogs and they even have if subtle and unassuming in game representation in the fiction there is also plenty of mention of other such alien creaturesthe devs already have plenty to aim for they dont need any extra fluff they have a massive backlog of things they want to get done and i doubt adding a whole new alien race is part of it as for wh exploration the sleepers are there and we may well be getting a method of exploring sleeper stations sleepers may not strictly speaking be aliens but theyre really not that close to human either for those of you who dont know im not referring to the sleeper drones most wh occupants have to deal with on a daily basisin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i assume that you believe that aliens should look greenpalegray with big bulgy eyes aliens are all over new eden if you were born on caldari prime then amarrians minmatar gallente sansha nation blood raiders sleepers and drones would all be considered aliensmany may share origin but how do we know that the aliens in real life dont look like us too wooooooh tinfoilhat
hypothetical situationincursion fleet 1 incursion fleet 21 enters a site begins cleaning out the site2 enters the same site begins clearing it out as well there are 3 other empty sites same type even waiting to be cleared2 knows they have more firepower2 wins the contest 1 spent 20 minutes of complete waste while 2 trolls and follows 1 down to every site they go to disallow them from earning isk
ive been on the receiving end of that particular tactic and i still dont understand how it isnt a valid form of pvpit happens in exploration sites too
i understand how contesting a site worksand here are some solutions expand your gang so you have more firepower and can win the contest move to a different system i dont see why its a problem
he didnt word it very well but what i think he meant is that the ingame corp search tool does not allow searches for incursion corpshe may be proposing a change that allows corp search to filter incursion corps
bump for more discussion
while i agree that changes need to be made and this is coming from a wormhole ceo and fw director my alt is sam sabre i do believe that eve is far from dead there are multiple wars going on in nullsec but i do agree that it will be nice when a goontest civil war occurs to break up the blocs a bit and rest assured like every bloc in the past it is bound to happen eventuallyi would suggest a bit of patience with ccp on the changes this winter as i sincerely believe it is going to spice up gameplay the state of fw is still alive as far as pvp but the isk faucet that exists is overboard people will abuse it for another month or so and then it will be adjusted and the gameplay will changei can assure you that eve is dying threads have existed as far back as i can remember and eve is still here so i wouldnt stress it
this is a thread on making smuggling a viable profession who doesnt want to be han soloto begin  we first need to understand what smuggling is and why its simply impossible to accomplish in eve onlinesmuggling is the art of moving contraband or conveying persons illegally into or out of an area secretly and illicitly why does it not work in eve onlinenpc customs officials are faction npcs who sit at gates who scan a random player passerby this is completely unavoidable and while there is no guarantee that you will be scanned theres also no way to prevent it or lessen the chances further more there is no way to actively avoid it either when you are scanned by a customs official and found to have contraband you will be targeted scrambled and webbed at which point you be given a choice to either release the contraband in their custody be fined and take a standings hit which can be pretty hefty depending on the item if you refuse to give up the item or jettison it from your cargo you are attacked and will almost inevitably lose your ship in more extreme cases they may just attack you outright if the contraband is deemed severe enoughso what needs to be fixed how can we fix it1 we need the ability to be able to do one or more of three options a avoid the customs scans entirely this could be done by revamping the customs system to apply to the same system we operate on with ecmsensor strength b reduce the likeliness of customs scans this could be done by operating on a standings system with higher standings in that particular faction reducing the chances of being scanned think of it as being part of the neighborhood watch and actively taking part in your community you couldnt possibly be doing some illegal right c reduce the chances of success from customs scans this could be done with the same system we operate on with ecmsensor strength  using it in a manner to trick the customs officials sensors into a false scan2 revamp the consequences for smuggling a few things can make this more appealing a reduce the capabilities of the npc customs officials to a more forgiving manner for not making it past the revamped scan system remove scramblingwebbing but keep the option to be fired upon if confiscation is refused b security standings hits should operate not just on the contraband itself but on a x strikes basis if its your first time getting caught the standings hit shouldnt be so severe if its your tenth  the nations probably not going to be happy seeing your face over and over again c operate on the new crimewatch system with the revamped customs scanning system players should have a chance of being issued as a suspect in smuggling and if caught should escalate to being a criminal this will give incentive to bounty hunters operating as more than just bounty hunters but as public defenders and private investigatorson another note please see my thread on revamping boosters proposal revamping boosters and their production
there are a number of pressing issues with boosters and why they simply arent worth manufacturingutilizing by comparison to simply purchasing them from an npc manufacturerto begin in brief they are difficult to make and require a hefty amount of startup isk to efficiently produce even the weakest variants to that end their usage is largely dependant on the person using them and not the person who is manufacturing them further adding to the ailments that come with boosters is that the materials required for them can only come from ladar sites  which requires a specialization in and of itself to successfully reap the rewards minor as they may be from highsecstart off by buying or manufacturing a control tower that is capable of running all of the necessary starbase structures that will allow you to produce boosters this can be as little as 200000000 isk just to get the base set up not including fuel costs to add onto this issue its not practical to set this tower up in highsec if at all not sure if youre even capable of setting up drug labs in high sec what with the illegality of your product unless its synth tack on the cost of factional starbase charters as well as standings with said faction finally to make the issue of highsec drug manufacture even more difficult is that you simply cannot get past customs at the gates whereever you set up your manufacturing starbase thats where youll be selling your product from now on lowsecokay so lets try lowsec now you have an entire entourage of other difficulties there are simply no real restrictions preventing a pirate corp or someone whos roleplaying as a concord lackey from removing your starbase from the equation entirely so now you have to defend it how do you do that tack on the cost of turrets andor have a sizable amount of friends who are willing to back your project upnow weve run into another issue  and thats whether or not risking shipspods is even worth defending such a finicky project in the first place your only customer base is in lowsecnullsec as you cant effectively get your product into highsec and lets face it theres npc drug production going on that is always going to best you considering that all of this is going on while youre trying to find a unreliable mind you source of materials and youll probably wind up spending more isk time and effort just making the boosters in the first placethe actual issueon the assumption that youre lucky enough to get a safe consistent means of producing boosters youre now going to have to find a buyer this is a horrid process by itself as the high end boosters have sideeffectsdrawbacks which make their usage a little less rewarding you have a chance at random of gaining one of four major sideeffects if you botch it there are skills to reduce the severity of these effects and to reduce their chance  but shaving a 20 likeliness down to 15 isnt all that rewarding especially when the severity of such side effects are based on similar scales for the record those numbers are at both skills at level 5in todays world products arent made to revolutionize the world anymore innovations are made to make products more effective and efficient money is spent to reduce costs and difficulties so how do we do all of that to make boosters viable in new eden heres some ideas1 we need a way to manufactureproduce boosters at least low end ones without needing a starbase 2 the chance and severity of a boosters side effect shouldnt reflect the users skill but the manufacturers ability to craft it or used in tandem with the users skills3 there needs to be a method of getting illegal products into highsec with some manner of success that we the players can affect the chances of see my thread on smuggling proposal revamp contrabandcustoms scans4 materials used to make boosters should reflect how powerful the booster itself is two ways we can do this is to decrease the difficulty in procuring said materials such as alchemy with moon goo or to increase the amount of materials currently in the universeedit spoke with another player about the ladar gas clouds and a really good idea that came up was to have the gas clouds both more frequent and a bit more static in the form of actually acting as part of the nebula of the particularly region sort of like asteroid belts but not so much this would incentivize the production and usage of boosters to a im going into combat i need this advantage regularity
needs more supporti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1well this topic has made for good readingalthough now tangled in this i agree with the opmy suggestions to fix would be as follows   any war transferred would only ever stay on the same time scale andor outcome of the original warany transferred

10
yup spot on 1
yup 1 marvellous
agreed and for gods sake if a war is supposed to be mutual then should either party be able to back out at any time
why he works according to rules ccp implemented i knew few other corps that exploited that earliermy suggest agressor defender mutual helper a and d can invite ms paying fee according to their size  and pay that fee every warpayment cycle a stops paying  war ends in 24h for d and m  untill on of them pays and a becomes automaticly d and d becomes a with ms staing on their sides d surrenders  ms war ends in 24h m stops supporting a or d  he is still involved for 24h m wants to separate from current war but start own combat as a  can do instant  just need to pay bill
one of the positives about the eve background fiction is that it isnt generic humanity discovers aliens cliche 827
i like that eve has so much conflict sans aliens im against it more or lessnote there are aliens in eve but not sentient ones
its no secret that in eve whenever the topic of mining comes up many players simply roll their eyes among all the activities in eve it would appear that mining is the most passive activity of all to the point where if you are mining in accordance with ccp rules you will most likely have your web browser open in one window while keeping an eye on your ore hold on the main game screen all the while taking note every moment or so if any hostiles are in the areaalthough ccp has recently given a few gifts to miners lately it is unfortunate that there has been no report of any changes to game play i think that mining should be more like other professions in the game in that it is more interactive and that attentiveness is rewarded by speeding up the rate in which the ship is able to extract orethis post has nothing to do with going after the players using bots but i do believe that by making mining more fun it can reduce the amount of people using such tools i believe that people simply use them because mining is dull and boring and the income generated is still less than folks who run higher level missionsthe purpose of this post is simply to generate ideas from the rest of the player base on what sort of changes you believe could make mining more interesting and interactive

this is a predictible result of the barge buff as the same deflationary tool set available to highsec miners is available to nullsec miners as well because value  demand  supply it stands to reason that there needs to be a mechanism to limit the uptake of minerals i do not believe that in light of the current exhumer yield and hit points that such a mechanism currently exists in either nullsec or highsecin a sense i support a rebalancing of some sort but until the deflationary mechanism itself is addressed by adding considerable new risk to miners in both highsec and nullsec i see a rebalance as a bandaid solution at best inevitably every mineral and ice product in the game will be deflated to a point approaching its floor like locusts miners will consume resources and glut the market until the resources are worth nothing and then move on completely unhindered to the next victims this will happen in highsec and nullsec alike because there is insufficient risk to miners in either localethis is not a partisan issue this all comes down to value and ease of acquisitionhe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom
the situation you describe isnt hypothecial but rather a daily ocurrence fleet 2 has the option to go to another incursion system get moar bigger gunz or my favourite  more guns and people that have proper skills for the ships theyre flying the number of incursion runners ive seen flying battleships with suboptimal cruiser skills is staggering this may come as a shock to you but contested sites are just as much pvp as if i shoot your spaceship in the face
csm representatives please consider directly asking ccp to have a moments thought about valuevalue is not some philosophical ideal at its core value is a simple function of mathematics it can be reduced to a very simple equationvalue  demand  supplyobserve that with this model if supply is constant and demand increases value increases likewise if supply is constant and demand decreases value decreaseson the other side of the coin if demand is constant and supply increases value decreases likewise if demand is constant and supply decreases value increasesmore advanced manipulations where delta values of supply and demand are compared are possible with only slightly more mathematical ability the model will remain consistent regardless and reliably accurate in a predictive sensewhere these principles apply directly to goods they also apply to the professions surrounding the harvest or manufacture of those goods this is not just a problem that can be resolved by hoping for equilibrium new players rely on a vibrant economy when they select a career path new miners inparticular probably dont want to hear that nobodys mining anything right now because there is a supply glut i feel comfortable in asserting that this is an intuitive glimpse into the new players psychelately it seems that certain design elements might be losing sight of this fundamental principle supply seems to have less and less barriers to successful acquisition on many many fronts nowhere can this be argued moreso however than in highsecurity spaceon behalf of eve players and independent of partisan bias i wish to invite the csm and ultimately ccp to run the thought experiments using the model above i believe that given the chance anyone will find this equations predictive value to be highly accurate beyond that i think these principles should serve as a guide for future development the devaluation of entire professions is a serious matter and should be taken as such by every player in eve if we want to keep this games economy both virtual and real healthy for the long haulshould ccp inquire as to methods of modulating supply and demand i believe risk to be one of the best methods imaginable hopefully the csm does toothank you for your considerationhe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom

when there is risk impeding the collection of resources supply uptake is naturally inhibited this ensures higher prices meaning higher value it also ensures that successful miners are more highly valued by association because the ore they mine and the ice they harvest is more valuable so is their profession as a whole its contribution grows due to the dynamics risk invokes on supply and demand when risk is high supply goes down and demand goes up thats good for business unless you fail obviously if you fail though youre contibuting to the health of the economy by helping to keep prices high until you manage to succeedor so the equation saysive 1d both of your comments thanks for the feedback and the questionshe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom
value does roughly equal demand  supply but its modified by inflation as in some of these other threads one of the major reasons for the changes in ore prices over the last several years is because the value of an isk is diminishing and not necessarily because of changes in supply and demand
please explain the mechanism which is devaluing isk if it is neither supply nor demand relatedthankshe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom
basically there are too many isk faucets in eve as it stands every day that goes by it gets easier and easier to make isk think of your first day in game 100 isk seemed like a lot now its laughable we have reached a point where more isk flows in than is consumed by isk sinks
you seem to describe a situation where the supply of isk is on a runaway trajectoryeven isk is subject to the foibles of supply and demand however that means it too has valueas your inflationary picture proveshe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom

i think the best option is to put customs officer scanning in the hands of playersif a player scans your ship and the scanner reveals contraband have that ship automatically be flagged a suspect then everyone can gank it for the next 15 minutes this gives another purpose to cargo scanners beyond finding targets for highsec gankers
rather than reprocessing corpses for implants you could run with the lore presented in this chronicle and produce something along the lines of a booster the back story could be something like quafe has decided to restart the quafe project this time marketing it to capsuleersthe product quafe would be some sort of booster that uses corpses from pvp among other things inits production and players could make it like any other booster you could even have a whole line of quafe boosters all requiring corpses but using a different blend of additional chemicals to get different effects not knowing much about boosters im not sure where a new line of boosters could or should be included or what benefitsside effects they should offer it would provide a use for corpses other than trophies and provide another source of income for pvpers though also it links up with some back storyjust a thought
jetcan of veldspar 5009609jetcan of bistot 4622106it looks like the info sheet on bistot needs some rewordingbistot only available in 05 and below and is less valuable then what comes from veldspar available in every asteroid belt in over 5000 solar systemsplease reply with some more fitting descriptionsmy ideas would just get filtered by the forum so
ah welcome to supply and demand economics bistot while being part of the abcs has a lower value because people dont need it as much as veldspar things are working as intended in a freemarket system
its more the problem that veldspar in large quantities is needed for most everything if that gets fixed suddenly the abcs become more worthwhile again

just reading the csm ccp meetings dated june 2012 and extracted the followingaleks continues by emphasizing again that this addedrisk element to the war dec system makes using it to achieve objectives impossible since the wardec system is designed for limiteduse engagements like taking down a pos or similar objective unlimited allies pushes all war dec conflicts to absurd levels war decs should be about a group deccing another group and maybe some of their friends UFFFD not against everyone in evewell thats fail aleks explains that in the future this might be a neat idea but under the current system anyone can be locked into a mutual war forever and this discourages anyone from wanting to risk allying with someone even if they are being paid for their workand thats just been amplified
1we too are stuck in an endless cycle of awesome wars not of our choosing hard to take paying contracts now easy to kill loads of ships though

ah so heres one of the smugglingcontraband threads that the forum search function why i decided to use it i guess i figured id give it another chance could not find for meanyway ive recently given the topic of contraband smuggling some thought and ive posted my idea for a new customs system on the fi forum and i welcome some feedback linky
i agree with this for the most partin fact the ops point 2c inspired me to formulate a system that comes close to this its open for feedback on the fi forum link
1this is another case of the players saying wait that bit wont turn out good and ccp going on with it
i think that they should just fix it by allowing the agressor to retract the war and make it so that once a corp is decd it can join an alliance but that alliance cannot have corps drop while it is at war basically if the defender wants help from an alliance the alliance has to man up and take responsibility for the war thus no corps dropping
1 this needs to be fixed
not working as intended but hilarious nonetheless maybe our current wardeckers feel like welping more tengus
this can be done by introducing additional risk into the profession of miningrisk adds value because it requires skill to overcomerisk is a healthy barrier to acquisitionhe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom
what sort of risk are you referring to pve missions for example are more interactive and i believe that what makes them more enjoyable to do as compared to mining where you just sit there mining the inherent risk in mining is really dependent on the conditions in the local area wormhole mining is the most dangerous followed by lowsec and finally null and high sec i can tell you that the fear of being attacked does not add to the fun factor of mining in any way whatsoever i would say that it actually make mining less fun and less desirable of an activity due to the fact that other activities such as mission running or exploration are more safe since you are not a sitting targetthe point of the thread was not to talk about the risk vs reward of mining but to simply say that i think that the fundamentals of mining have been unchanged since eve first came out the mining barge was the only recent addition i believe that mining could be made more enjoyable by perhaps adding a second method of collecting ore from the asteroids which requires more interaction i didnt want to throw ideas out there but just to give an example perhaps mining could also be performed by flying a new type of ship that applies a charge to the asteroid and the asteroid is remotely detonated the resulting fragments would then need to be run through a ship equipped with a sort of grinding apparatus and tractor beams which would pull in the chunks of ore the speed at which this is done would depend on the skills of the pilot to make it even more challenging perhaps even some pieces would need to be avoided as they would cause damage to the grinding apparatus if they were to be processed this method of mining would be much more involved because the pilot would be focused on destroying and then processing the resulting debristhis is just an example but i want to know what anyone else out there thinks i think that keeping the passive method of mining may be alright but i am hoping to see an alternative method which will speed up the process with the necessity of having the pilot interact more during the process i dont want to see mining become something as nebulous as the overall manufacturing process but something that is more enjoyable for those wishing to take more control of the operation
here is an idea without raising anybodys hopes that anything like this will ever be implementedget rid of the static ore yield make the yield of each individual asteroid change over time the change should be random but a smooth transition  so a high yield asteroid will stay that way for several minutes and then the yield will smoothly fall off it wont just suddenly drop the asteroids yield is then multiplied by your ships yield to determine how much ore you getnext change the survey scanner to a single target module the scanner will tell you the yield of the targeted asteroid and if you keep running it it will draw a graph of yield over time you can then observe the pattern and see if its rising or droppingthis means that in order to get the most ore for your time you have to keep an eye on several asteroids and switch your mining target as the yield of your asteroid decreases this would have several results afk mining is still possible but your yield will be much lower than that of somebody who is actively watching the game mining in groups is even more beneficial as more people can keep an eye on more asteroids at the same time and all switch target when one asteroid increases its yield this requires at least a basic form of communication broadcasting the highest yield rocks thus is at least a degree less boring than the current system a new fitting consideration is introduced do you fit more scanners and devote more time and attention to scanning and getting the best pick of the belt or do you fit for more raw yield on your miners and survivability as an unintended consequence 00 mining can be easily fixed just make the average yield of asteroids in lower security areas much higher so a veldspar rock in a 09 will on average produce more veldspar than one in 07 however a dedicated miner watching their rocks should still be able to pull decent amounts of ore from a highsec rock compared to an afk miner in nullsec
buff to barges have absolutely nothing to do with any of this at all the market change i speak of has happened slowly over two years and not over night or post patch also the hulk saw no increase in yield so no increase in its ability to pull rocks out of a belt or gravimetric site so you can scratch that idea off the boardvalue  demand  supplyi agree that the free market should be allowed to do what it is supposed to do but not to a point it breaks gameplay or the overall balance to the game itself ccps interest in balancing risk verse reward and the pure inability to do t1 production in 00 are problems that needs to be solvedmy proposal reduces the quantity of high end minerals available increased difficulty to access those minerals gives us a way to make use of it where it is mined so less gets shipped to empire increases the risk of isk miningthe locusts effect is not a industry thing some mmo players will go to where they can earn the highest income for least time spent and will follow that until it crosses a risk vers reward threshold that has too much risk for what they are comfortable pilots out in null are willing to take that risk but the reward has fallen to a point where it is left to question the isk for time spent aspect the only reason for this issue is the design of the complexes created in dominionanother thing ccp and players not interested in miningindustry normally overlooknot every hulk pilot is only interested in earning isk out of the 00 corps i have been in through the years most pilots would enjoy the chance to build supply a market to support the corp and alliance they are in and not just be isk farmers that need to buy ships and fits from jita

that is correct thnx

fantastic idea my only comment give it a skill of its own and price it down just a bit from the other freightersits a specialist after all

 this and no to idea of memorising individual
oh yes 1 to the idealets force those afk crybabies to do some pvp while they are in nullsecps it will never happen tho afk cloakers are usually 4th or 5th account of the same guy its pure profit for ccp hence they will not address this issue just deal with it i guess p
wait sorry whos a cry baby the afker who is afk or the crybaby crying about the afker who is afkin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
ofc cloakers who cry at every attempt to target their immunity in nullsec theres a place for this way of playstyle in eve  hisecyou can stay there for ages without anyone targeting you dont even have to turn on cloak 
i like the idea of a crew but it has to be done right i like that idea that it is like a rig and the ship does jot need it to fly that said i troll the forums three to five hours a weekend a lot of what i see isfellow pilots saying ccp needs to fix someaspects of the game i feel that this would instantly be a mechanic thUFFFDt would broken ccp would have to a lot and a lot of work to make it work that said ccp could turn the crew into a a much needed isk sink in the game and it terms of xp for the crew why not have the crew use your training queue in order to train a crew then the pilot has to load a skillbook into the slot that xp doesnt go to the pilot but that crew member now the pilot has a choice do i train myself or my crew for younger pilots UFFFDm sorry but forolder pilots i hear a lot from my corp and alliance that they dont know what totrain this could give pilots something to improve ships they love to and not feel like they are wasting timeand won could also sell the crew like toons that more training a crew has the more iskiessorry about grammar and spelling typed this on my phone
bear in mind that anytime something gives a tangible enough advantage without disproportionate costs it will stop being optionalthis is what happened with rigs back in the day they used to be a one size fits all type thing that costed you an arm and a leg making them very much an optional thing for ships cruiser sized and below now with various rig sizes and overall lower costs unless you are a newbie or flying a throwaway t1fit there is absolutely no excuse not to fit rigs and gain that extra edge you just contradicted yourself here i dont want this because it would just be nice i want this because itd be nicei would do everything in my power to make sure it is a quick fight with minimal chance of losing my bonuses ie i would do nothing but gankactually no we already have a lucky variable its called ecm and it is quite possibly the most loathed mechanic in the game yeah no welcome back to reality just because someone proposes an idea it doesnt mean it is automatically good ideaand posts that disagree with an idea or proposal are usually the most helpful because they point out the flaws in the idea its your job as the proposer to work around those flaws and see if you cant come up with solutions for them
uhmmm yes your brain is full of shityor arguments about rigs are totally broken but i am not going to lose any more time with your stupidityi hope to see more posts about how the idea of crew or any other idea can be improved in order to make the game funnier without trying to convince people with stupid arguments that you are right and others are wrong
well any improvements of the game has been rebalanced think about pi and rigs in the beginning they had just one sizethats an idea more skill queues sounds challenging

oh my proud caldari pig 
if that were the case darths complaint wouldnt be made because prices would look skyhigh due to inflation not responding to normal market pressures as they areisk faucets have always outnumbered the sinks and i hate to tell you that 100 isk was never that much  i started in 2007 and easily made my first million inside of 8 hours despite and actually aided by doing the tutorials of the time even then a million didnt amount to much inflation hasnt meant much to ship and module prices to be honest they go up as they become flavor of the month then go down on the next nerf only to rise again when some new change is made the economy fluxes all the time but actual inflation is pretty slight for the most part bolded that last part to avoid a future conversational trap  there are areas that have hit inflation but not many and not majoras to the opdarth once again risk is not the only way to lower supply and increasing demand would work just as well crimewatch 2 might help with that or might not hard to say and if ccp could help break up the power blocks out in null demand might rise as well even on the supply side making mining more interactive and thus thinning the herd of bots and afk miners would do more in my opinion than any little bit of extra risk especially not by the methods of adding risk most people usually think of i would also add that new players are more than capable of coming up through mining the socalled market glut which i personally have seen no sign of at all except in a fairly minor drop in ice prices still leaves plenty of profit for the new miner even if they dont venture beyond veld seriously  there have been times in the past like when i tried to start mining when trit prices dropped under 3 isk and new miners were doing fine thenand that was long before the suicide ganking nerfs hit i guess the only possible reason many of us can see for people wanting to add risk to mining is that it is no longer easy to suicide gank miners and at that i saw at least three mackinaws ganked in one single ice belt in the last two days
you wield that equation of yours like a bludgeon but i think your grip on it is faulty you are simultaneously arguing that inflation is running wild while arguing that the value of minerals is dropping so far that new miners cant make a living at mining the markets dont support you
tell that to the poor ice minersediti gave this some more thought in context of what the markets are doingif isk faucets exist they are by their nature an inflationary mechanism i concede this as it is actually fundamental to my pointfurther we can acknowledge i believe that material faucets are deflationary mechanisms it seems selfevident anywayso if the value of isk is going down requiring more to purchase anything of value but the price of materials specifically highsec ice stays constant its actually lost value if the price goes down its lost a ton of valuelooking at the market i fail to see how the data dont clearly elucidate that pointedithe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom
howeverin order for your argument to be valid there must be abundant evidence of outofcontrol inflation or even significant inflation however there is no such evidence the price of t1 ships has barely budged since i started playing and even the price of t2 has gone up by much less than 100 in five years there is nothing to support a significant devaluation of isk or a market glut of minerals
a year ago i could buy a dominix hull for 53m isk i know because i bought a lot of themnow they go for around 88 or 89m apiece ever though the price of highsend minerals have actually gone downif there isnt inflation where did the extra 60 value come fromother things though have come down drasticallydoes anybody remember how much cap recharger iis used to go for before inventionone thing about the eve market that does differentiate it from the real economy is that it can be atbitrarily redefined by ccpsee also npc shuttle sell orders and the drone regionsanyway i think were beating a dead horse here in sincerity my opinion is that risk and reward are out of balance and clear roles were not adequately defined for the exhumersif yours is different i can respect thattheres really no way we can know for absolute certainty precisely whats going on with eves markets though because players and ccp alike can change it tomorrow if they choosehe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom

no active cloakers cry at every attempt to completely destroy their play stylealmost every suggestion to counter afk cloaking will completely eliminate the feasibility of traditional cloaky activitiesinterestingly the two suggestions that dont do that have nothing to do with cloaks rather local and cynos
ive always been of the opinion that the proposed local changes are too much the idea of a blackops cyno jammer i see no problem with except that it wouldnt stop people whining about cloakiesi spent all yesterday evening chasing and camping four cloakies some of them were almost definitely afk and they rarely moved about it does get a little tedious but we got one of them and i am more than happy to chase the others around for home defence purposes ive always laughed at people complaining about them because ive had to deal with people doing it since very early in my eve career and never really had any problems with them it always infuriates me that people just come straight to the forums to whine that there is no counter to afk cloakingin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
well most solutions i saw would only force them to move few km every half hour ie the probing sugestion if thats to muchof an activity in nullspace for them well no commentits just silly for me that in game suposed to be all about technology you can use magic invisibility hat that saves you from pvp in a place made for pvp
if anyone needs a ticket back to bloody hisec its the nullbears who cry their eyes out because  gasp  another player is in the same system as they are the fact that you want ccp to introduce mechanics that will allow you to kill afk players is utterly idiotic and it speaks volumes about how bad of a player you are you cant fight someone whos active so you want ccp to give you a kill button on players who arent there whats next you want them to let you kill players who are docked ones who are logged off if you cant deal with that little name in local get the hell out of nullsec because you are terrible and have no claim to the rewards of 00
did you even think this through its a stupid suggestion so if you honestly think its a solution and i use that term loosely as there isnt an actual problem then you may not be too brightlets break it downit hinders active playing  reconnaissance can rely on sitting in a key location and watching whats happening or moving into an advantageous position and waiting for the right opportunity to hit forcing these pilots to constantly move ruins thatso far thats one big negative to active playerslets move on to afk players and see how this change would affect themafk player double clicks in arbitrary direction leaving his ship to float in that direction foreveroh look at that theyre moving so this system doesnt do a damn thing to afk cloakersso your suggestion doesnt help against afks but works against activesand were back to square one the fact that nullbears are the biggest cowards in eve bigger than even the hisec bears  who at least have the balls to admit they dont want to risk their stuff
noone says its as simple as putting probes and scanning cloakers down in 5 sec clearly rage hinders your ability tosee the problem here and what the solutions proposed areand so far the afk cloakers are worst cowards in nullsec carebears coming to null know they may be forced to fightcloakers dont have to bother with that no to afk living in null i say p
clearly rage and fear makes you see a problem here when there isnt one i dont see one at all i deal with cloakies on a daily basis there is no problem camping your system move next door if he follows you hes not afk therefore set up a gate camp and catch himin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

where did the op copypaste this fromits said that if you truly understand a subject you would be able to explain it in the most simplest terms so anyone can understand the fact that the op cant do that heavily implies that he himself doesnt truly understand what hes talking aboutwhich leads to the obvious conclusion that he must have copied it from somewhere and pasted it here in a thread so op where did you copypaste this fromsummary of eves last four expansions
i authored everything in it myselfwhat would you like me to explain to you betterwhen supply is low and demand is constant value is high thats pretty basic there are only three variables and we know two of themhow about i put it another waygold is more rare than sand so its more valuable tooangora rabbits are more valuable than cottontails for the same reasonin eve online the game we play less ore on the market means its value is higherthat makes the profession of mining more valuable tooso ccp need to do things to make obtaining ore harder to buff mining as a profession not make it easier and more readily automated that means bottingare you keeping up now he who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom
there is a net gain of 25 trillion isk into the economy every month there is also a major influx of raw materials from moon mining belt mining npc markets and mission loot there is also a major outflux of raw materials destroyed ships primarily if there is a net influx of isk into the economy while the raw materials balance out ie influx  outflux then the value of isk decreases and the iskvalue of raw materials increases since nearly all goods are constructed from raw materials they then have an iskvalue change even if supply and demand remain the same in other words the eve economy is far more complex than you make it sound
mineral faucets are not isk faucets and mineral sinks are not isk sinks when a miner sells his haul in a market no new isk is created it just changes handsif youre concerned about inflation of isk look to explicit isk faucets the only isk faucet from mining is the trickle of bounties paid from killing belt ratsif miners reduce yield on their barges or just lose more ships to gankingit works out the same in the end the price of minerals go up but that doesnt necessarily gain the miners anything it certainly wont make your dominix cheaper one number got bigger and the other smaller the product of the two numbers will only shift for the amount of time it takes the market to correct the imbalance the people who benefit are speculators sitting on mountains of minerals who buy cheap announce an interdiction and then sell dear but that doesnt affect the value of isk either except to the degree that it pulls isk out of active circulation and concentrates it in the hands of the speculators
a significant tweak will be occurring on the 16th today of this month
if you have to bump for more discussion then the thread subject isnt really worth discussing eve is not dying like so many morons cry its just gotten stale and boring in my opinionsummary of eves last four expansions
i would say yes to this but it genuinely think there needs to be a complete rewrite of the overview code inside of eve there are several bugs and usability issues that are not just ui basedas stated elsewhere in these forums ccp is highly unlikely to actually take a design made by a player all the way to implementation unless its a call to compete in a competition like the player created starship competition though even then the designs were augmentedwhat would be best is to get a dev to confirm they have taken on board players issues with the current state of the overview and confirm that they are seeking to rewrite the code to something more reliable and usablereliability is not something we can help as its all about efficient coding we can of course point out the bugs in the overview and suggest exactly what usability features we would prefer to have
still a good idea so here you go
1would be nice if they looked at mutual wars allowing free wars too while rvb loves pew all these wars soon add up
1 no its not
can you read fella i never inferred your terrible solution to be a very quick and easy 5second probe job the points i made hold true even if your terrible solution is a much longer and more complicated processthe bottom line is it interferes with legitimate active reconnaissance pilots while doing nothing to actual afk players ps afk players are effectively noneentities there is no need to do anything to them in the first place ignorance of the activities how they work how long they take and how your terrible solution would ruin them can be excused  i can hardly expect a stupid carebear who does nothing but mine or shoot rats to understand such things after all reconnaissance takes time its not unusual for an active scout to sit in one location for extended periods of time whether thats sitting at a tower watching a fleet form and relaying information or waiting in a particular strategic location ready to decloak and grab something or act as a warp in or whateveras for calling afk cloakers cowards that simply does not make sense venturing out into real life and leaving the computer game is not some act of cowardice its just something we well most of us do and as there is literally nothing they can do to anyone still in game there is no issue they are not there they cant hurt you theyre not cowards theyre not anything theyre noneentities the fact that youre so terrified of them is pathetic go back to hisec
well you should take a chill pill and read before you call people names as i written before afk cloakers are not of a big issue for me you would know that if you could read instaead of instaraging and in particular read again what afk cloakers are and what they are meant to achieve by staying for 34 weeks in one place and the solution still stands imo as technology without counter is just stupidmaybe lets see real world reconnaisance that way maybe you understand what im getting at if thats hard for you to grasp is the real world reconnisance without risk of fail  no is it sucessful way of gathering info  yes that simple lets just keep it real
how many times now have you purposefully ignored the arguments against your silly ideas based on how they ruin legitimate activities of active players im not going to bother repeating them because you clearly cant refute any of themhigh sec space is that way 
amarrians are alien enough
the info sheets shouldnt reference value or price of the minerals at all even in general abstractions as those are set by the market
is currently being used in the game as a manipulation tool to increase prices of market buy orders so that sell orders prices gradually  rapidly riseif you look closely the most commonly manipulated items currently in the game are only those of either value or rarity possibly other items too that are not listedie plex officer loot null sec ice compressed ore so what would be the solution to this skill itself can remain as it isenable negative balance of personal wallet how would that work read morechange when is used to put up a buy order and someone comes along to fill the buy order then the order must be filled and succeed regardless if the player who put it up the order doesnt have money in his wallet his balance will then go negative which is what we all know is called debt so by far this is the simplest solution to the whole problem while you cant be in debt in this game to any npc company as its literally impossible since eve does not have a npc corporate banking system so a negative balance to your personal wallet is the only solutionlike they say new saying you are responsible for your own finance if you can risk losing a ship you can risk losing money simple as that
no negative wallets can not be ever implemented as a result of player to player transactions a negative wallet means that isk is popping out of thin air a debt only matters when it has consequences in eve where you can simply biomass a character debt is meaningless1 place a buy order with your alt for 1b 250m put in escrow 750m remains2 transfer 750m from alt to main3 fill the order with your main main gets the 250m from escrow and 750m from the game alt ends up 750m in the negative4 biomass alt5 you just summoned 750m isk into the gamethere is a way to get rid of mt scams while maintaining the intended functionality if there is not enough money combined in escrow and in the buyers wallet to pay for the minimum accepted quantity of items in an order that order is temporarily hidden from the marketplace it will not be visible in the market window and the broker will not attempt to fulfill it only when the buyer acquires enough money to cover at least the minimum amount the order is restored
nobody said i wanted my dominix to be cheaperin fact id like to see mining be such a valued profession that it were worth doing it at your keyboard paying attention in an effort to not fail thereby reaping great rewardyou know the way it should be instead of default easy modedefault easy mode will create a supply glut regardless of whether isk devalues or notthats a recipe for economic disasterhe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom
you dont have to convince me that mining is dull i hardly ever do it outside of corp ops at least then i have people to talk to nor do you have to convince me that more exciting mining would be more exciting and should be more rewarding my point is that your attempt to argue the problem from an economic perspective isnt workingwill mining has been in eve for how long unchanged any supply glut would have shown itself long since the recent buff just moved the solo miners from cargoexpanded max yield hulks to mackinawsa trade of convenience over yieldif a mineral becomes too devalued people either stop mining or buy a ton of it cheap and sit on it until scarcity planned or otherwise raises the priceif i were to point out any problems with the current resource system i would point to insane mineral compression in the form of certain modules and dropsmetal scraps really ccp but that still has nothing whatsoever to do with the value of isk
i was under the impression that the new mackinaw outmined the old hulk yield for yield is that mistakenwhat about new players entering the mining profession is it good for the game for players to hear dont mine right now theres too many minerals on the market what about players who just dont care about the least common denominator such as afk miners and bots they wont stop why should they more isk is more isk than no isk is so no matter how low minerals get miners will keep miningwe are in agreement about mineral compression i think but where you see it as one blemish i see it as systemici can respect that you dont think this is an economic issue but i cant agree with you it goes beyond economics which is what makes it so importantno new miner should ever have to discover that the lack of barriers to successful acquisition mean that his income is literally as low as it can possibly be that is just not a good message to send with game design or with a free markethe who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller darth gustavs axiom

locking a wardeccing corporation by making the war mutual is imho a very important feature the bitingoffmorethenyoucanchew risk provides crucial balance to the initiative advantage the aggressor has and this needs to staythis is also why it should be possible to hire allies or join an alliance even in a mutualized war rewarding those few defending corporations that decide to fight back properly instead of hiding in newbie corporations and whining about it on the forums how wardecss are unfairas an agressor being locking into a mutual war with a corp that then goes into hibernation is simply the risk of agression but i do think mutual wars should be confirmed every month or so to end wars with corporations that are completely dead the testserver showed that there are still wars going on from 2005 of corps that are now long dead and forgottenthe fixed need though and it seems like an easy one is to simple make the war follow the original defender extending to any alliance it joins but not remaining copied there except for a cooldown period when the original defender leaves againwhy isnt this fixed yet ccp operation write down all the things check out the list at

any change to the availability of minerals in null should be combined with a big increase of fuel consumption by jump mechanics especially jump freighters and bridge networks and titan bridgesit adjoins null and empire at the hip logistically and economically for almost no risk negligible cost and very little effort this is one of the most important causes of why null is empty because it simply isnt stimulated to cultivated their own systems with mining and production why would you if you can simply get it from empireits also the main reason why the dronepoo actually became a problem not because it was so easy to get minerals in the drone regions that was actually a great thing a breeding ground for capitalheavy alliances migrating to the west looking for better moons and anoms like some mongol horde only to be replaced a year later by the next horde that took over their region when they leftsadly due to jump freighters mostly all those cheap minerals were mostly dumped onto the empire market instead putting all miners except bots out of business and sadly a lot of that isk then likely vanished into rmtbut any change to the availability of lowends in null will likely be moot as long as it remains safer cheaper and easier to buy them in empire and if you improve mining in null too much itll just be the drone regions all over againso fine change the roids but increase the fuel consumption of jump mechanics substantially as well sure the prices will go up for the nullbears but that will be a good incentive to actually develop claimed systems and populate them with renters to mine for you it will also stop massive naptrains from curbstomping alliances on the other side of the galaxy keeping null population culledthat will definitely improve null vitalityoperation write down all the things check out the list at

why should cloaking change when the reason for afking remains untouchedif you had any idea of the topic at hand you know afking was the counterdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
remove afk cloaking no theres been 0 good reasons to do it cloaking is part of this game and it is working atm

hey allone of my personal issues with eve and perhaps some others is the way you can play and earn isk whilst afki think perhaps the following changes could help limit thismining in high secsince the change to the mack it is now easier then ever to afk mine in hsa possible way to combat this would be by changing the way belts rats workinstead of them just spawning and doing zlich put a timer on where if they are not destroyed after x time a new wave will appearthis wave will include bigger rats which do more damage and will also scram the target shipalso a change the npc rats so they change targets to include dronesin order to stop people from farming the additional rats make them give no bounty and no dropsi feel this might help combat afk mining and perhaps some bots without having to nerf or buff anythingmissions  complexes  anons  sigs sitesccp have already annouced changes to the ai and hopefully they will continue down this path i would like to see more npcs using neuts ecms webs and scrams introducedhowever i feel that more needs to be doneintroduce random elements into each of these effectively so you have a general idea what you are going to face but never 100 not only would this help with the afk but it will also help making these slightly more interestingi would use sites in wh as a guide as you can not afk these due to the npcs ai
if the act of being afk itself offends you you will have to suggest something against traders haulers pi moon mining manufacturing etc who make money while offlineif its not just the fact that they are afk you will have to provide reason why youre picking on these two groups in particular
as another player said in another threadits a little different but the argument stands can you come up with a way to remove afk play without hurting active players so far no one hasyour proposal does nothing to squelch afk play without hurting active players the main problem is that active players who mine are indistinguishable from afk players who mine their behavior is exactly the same and that is the fault of mining mechanics not playerssummary of eves last four expansions
best way to discourage afk gameplayfrolic around in gankdestroyer find afk suicide afk afk forgets to elarn the error of his ways suicide again rins repeatnow either youll get rich off hulkageddon or people will stop afk mining in yieldfits either way is a win in my book
i suggest you actually figure out what is meant by earning isk whilst afkpi is passive incoming as in moon miningmanufacturing will only earn you isk if you done your sum correctlywhy are so you for people being able to mine and run missions  sigs  anons etc whilst afki am pretty sure ccp did not design these activities to be run in this way
how does anything i have suggested hurt active playerslets use the belt npcs as an exampleif you are active then you kill the ratss before they call in for help if you cant kill them you warp off or ask for helpif you are afk then your ship goes pop same goes with missions and suchif ccp introduced random spawns and you are active you either kill them or warp off if you are afk boom 
let it go guy your argument is invalid now youre just stomping your feet and whining maybe you can take solace in that youre not the first one to fail at this argument scores of forum trolls attempt this argument all the time and not one has produced a valid counter pointsummary of eves last four expansions
lmaothink it is you who is failing i bet you are one of those people who are screaming about the up and coming changes to the ai 
1 want to limit afk mining of ice belts make ice roids deplete that forces people to target new roids and reactivate lasers which means they are around waves of rats wont do anything as ice belts are full of drones which automatically aggress and destroy npcs those npcs already do target drones but a hobgoblin will destroy them long before they destroy the hobgoblin 2 afk mission runners are not really a problem and the new ai will make it more difficult on them anyway and players typically dont run anomalies and plexes while afk they are almost always near the keyboard and paying some attention i personally agree more randomness should be included in missions incursions sleeper sites and most pve against npcs 3 what about afk hauling in my opinion its fine as the warpto15 autopilot pretty much ensures they operate slow as  and risk getting suicide ganked if they haul anything of value 4 you didnt mention afk cloakers im proud of you here good job 5 there are lots of offline activities as has been pointed out that earn massive isk pi rd basically all si activities moon mining and reactions trade etc are those problematic too i think not and hope you feel the same especially those activities that require leaving structures in space that can be attacked while they are offline
goodi think that a temp ban of a deliberate use of an obvious exploit that is within direct violation of the eula to the letter is actually going easy on the violatorsevery mmo that ive played logs pretty much everything you do and done to you in text format that is why when you put in a petition they want some information that they can use to narrow the search through the wall of text to get to the part that mattersif it happened there is proof
lets keep the support for this idea flowing and hopefully get some attention from either csm or ccpi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
as a solo lowsec miner living out of a pos with a medium intensive refining array id really like to see some major changes with the refineries and your proposal addresses many of themhowever i think the revised capacity values for all 3 types is too largeespecially for low sec were constantly having to return to the pos to avoid being ganked so we cant mine for more than 1hr at a time and frequently no more than 1530 minutes i always drop off new ore at the refinery whenever i stop by so id really appreciate it if there was a refinery with near 100 efficiency targeted at processing no more than 100k every 30 minutes this help make me think the extra risks im taking operating in lowsec are being rewarded  another major issue is that in order to keep safe in lowsec i need a large tower and to pay for the large tower i have to moon mine and moon mining takes up a ton of cputhe moon harvestorssilosreactors are constantly competing for available cpu with the refinery if were updating the refineries lets pay careful attention to how it might impact the industrial player in lowsec and minimizing cpu is extremely helpful i dont mind other tradeoffs to make that worksuch as the reduced ore capacity to no more than 100k or 30 minute cycles rather than 15 minute lastly there needs to be some way to reprocess in a posmy system might get camped and i may need to tear down some existing things to manufacture new shipsetc or while im mining i kill rats but have no way to reprocess the rat loot wo trying to go through camps to the nearest station im fine if the reprocessing isnt as efficient as a station make 1020 lessbut i would hope that we could include scrapmetal reprocessing in with an update to the pos refineries even if it is only usable on the smallest one and has a small penaltythanks

currently asteroid belts replenish during downtime at 700amgmt5 daily this gives one side of the world a giant lead in getting the ore immediately as it spawns and leaving nothing for the other side who go to work at that timeore replenishes once every day right nowi suggest staggering it so the belts refill every eight hours three times a day
heh this topic seems to be alive and well remove captain kanki from forums yes he lacks the skills to present any reasons for hes points of views or working solutions for the topicso anyhow fuelbays  they will not ruin anything and ccp needs to think about the balance not us you can still afkcloak but not indefinetly and thus the problem is solved for everyonethe one who want to play cloaky games can the one trying to find cloakers can do that also and many other things would be improved
why is this thread still going onheres how it isan afk cloaker is afk so he is not doing anything so why does he bother you simple answer because your scared that he will do somethingnow there are already very good counters to afk cloakers you can set up a standing fleet so you can get a quick warp in on anyone who is attacked by him you can specifically bait and kill him or better yet you can move next door to do your rattingmining whatever if he follows you to next door then hes not afk and thus all your stupid argument against the afk cloakers are invalidpeople need to use a little logic i dont get how people can be so dense and unthinking there is literally no reason to change afk cloaking are you kidding you want anyone who cloaks to pay for fuel and be fine with that also lets not forget the fact that if they run out of fuel for any reason the cloak is completely useless let me say it again there is no good reason to change cloaking anywayin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
the point is not that afk cloakers can kill people while afk but that you can afk 95 of your time and still be a very effective killer i would certainly agree that cloaking is a fun and valid part of the game and that any fix should not break actively playing with cloaked shipsbut you shouldnt be able to log in just after downtime press one button and interdict a system for 23 hours its disproportionate and its actually less fun suppose instead that cloaks burned a steadily increasing amount of cap neglible for the first 10 minutes you need to be cap fit to sustain past 20 mins and unfeasible past 30 minutes followed by a 2 minute cloak cooldown periodit would make hunting while cloaked still perfectly valid but it would also make hunting cloakers a fun part of the game at the moment if we organise a fleet to try to deal with someone in our space its quite frankly generally rather boring we might get them and do from time to time but generally defensive efforts of an organised gang of people can be completely neutralised by the other player simply alt tabbing and playing a different game as a nullsec fc i want my fleet members to have more fun blowing people up and less time being blueballed
anyone can be afk 95 of the time and still be an effective killer ships that use cloaks already are specifically weaker because of the use of covert cloaks and the other cloaks slow target speed and ship movement etc they are already paying for the privilege of being able to cloakif you dont agree with people being able to be afk and then kill people perhaps you should also propose some method of kicking people out of stations if theyre afk in a station for more than 30 minutesalso there are already counters for afk cloaking something you failed to pass comment onas for it being boring dealing with afk cloakies well so whatin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
first off im laughing with no humor here if your saying we need to add risk to mining it shows youve never been into mining our whole existence is a risk you cant run you cant hide you can only fight rats add the hulkedon and its massive group of pimply faced retards looking for yet another reason for an easy gank and the picture gets more dismal miners are the few in the game that each year have to ask themselves  do i want to stop literally playing my game for one whole week of payed time or do i want to chance losing a hundreds of millions in a split second the only value risk adds to a miner is the value of stomach ulcers ok so ive kicked that useless horse enough moving onasteroid depleted  automatic shut down of strip minermy biggest gripe so follow me here for a second when an asteroid is depleted it vanishes so can you tell me how my strip miner spent the last 3 minutes strip mining a ghost at what point did tangible matter turn into a mirage because thats all your mining using a survey scanner barely helps even when your sitting there button mashing the thing for hopeful updates i wish wish wish eve would add logic to this when an asteroid is depleted your strip miner should auto shut off not keep cycling for 4 more minutes or at least add a survey scanner for the micro manager that will allow you to constantly monitor the ore depleting as result of eve not doing anything about it there are these two options1 survey scan till asteroid is mostly gone then button mash your strip miners off and on so you dont waste time if every 10 min you spend 3 min uselessly mining  do the math that is a lot of wasted time button mashing your strip miners isby far not the way to go either2 avoid all this and scan till an asteroid is 80 empty and move on until the next miner comes along and finds an entire asteroid belt thats useless because every asteroid has about 1000 units left in it and this has happened more than i want to talk about i would cuss and swear here accept that wont cut the frustration please eve miners are the very core of eve without us eve wont be able to field 90 of their ships for anything mining is already patience demanding beyond measure add a couple lines of code for a simple auto shutoff is all i ask survey scanners are next to useless now last but not least  a thank you to eve i was partially bummed but at the same time pleased at the new changes to the strip miners yes some of our options were cut but we were presented with a good deal more null sec is now open to mine by the heavy risk takers prices have dropped on some ores and those complaining are vastly the mega corps that are angry at having to share with the little guy the new extended ore hold on the mackinaw is fantastic now for those that cant get a whole group of transports to back them up we can happily mine without having to jettison cargo and have it stolen and then get blown up by some half equipped bs thats passing by that was partially a jab at the guy that suggested more risk taking for we miners
bahno need to change any of the eve mechanics to make mining more interestingjust try to mine in lowsecit is thrilling and heart pounding and the logistics aspect to get materials back to high sec has its own rewards especially with pos managementso honestlywhat ccp needs to do to make mining a good profession mining yield outside of highsec has to riseyes profit right now is mostly based on how much time is spent mining and lowsecnullsec cant compete with a 100 safe environment unless the yield of highsec is reduced and yield of lownull is increased low sec miners are lucky to get 20 of the mining time that they would have received in highsecso assuming roids are equal and they almost are these days they need a 500 yield increase to be equiv to high sec profit allow mining corps to somehow build up defenses in lowsec beltsyes they have a pos in the system perhaps but it provides no assistance outsideand a pirate can hunt through belts and find any miners in them in under a minute sometimes just seconds this environment greatly favors the pvp focused pilot rather than miners it has almost completely driven out the entire mining professional from lowsec so perhaps have some way for miners to invest in defenses for individual beltsa new skill that controls efficiency and a miner is limited to 1 improved belt per char which must be associated with a pos the defenses should cost isk and be more of a way to give the miner more time to get himself to safety than any real protection im thinking of an additional pos module that redirects some of the pos shield out towards the nearest beltnot sure of the mechanics yet but it sure would liven things up and get miners into lowsec and in that environment  no one would be calling the profession afk boring or dull
the skill makes the module use more cap forgot to add a cap bonus to the duration bonus
better solution split isk in accordance w damage done this way shiny fleets will stop being parasites during contests
join public incursion communities problem solved
are you suggesting i watch the three minute timer for my ore repeat till my cargo is fullalso have you ever mined in high secyou have to change targets all the time cause the roids are so small gotta check on it every 39 minutes not an afk job
i have an alt that does nothing but mine in hs as its one of the easiest ways to earn isk afk 
then youre a poor tool3000 mining yield  600000 isk a minute with hs oreso 10 minutes is 6000000 isk1 hour is 36000000 iskmining yield is based on max skilled orca pilot support with a hulk mining so really you need two people afking to achieve this yield then you have to add the fact that youre constantly switching asteroids switching belts cause theyre so empty yeah

1 supportedspeaking as a new player and after buying a years sub after my first 2 months and 15 daysa month in to my year and im sort of wishing i had not the shear size of the game is great as a new playeruntil you find you cant do muchwit
no im not kidding and as we both have the oposite points of views i could say the same to you that are you kidding by saying that they cloacks are finethe threat is about removing or fixing afk cloaking so give a solution or be quietall you cloak lovers always say is that its working its working of course its working when you can be afk cloacked 2357 and rat on 3 other accounts at the same time in empire or in your own precious bear systemand if your so dence that you cant see this from other points of views then you better stop postingso more solutions and less crying that is working
there was no content in that post  you said i was crying when im the one happy with how it is and that i was dense and that afk cloaking is a threat without putting forward any argument for why and then told me not to bother posting if i cant empathise with your side of the argument when you clearly are just as bad as melets put this straight with facts rather than bogus opinion 1 afk cloakers are afk therefore not doing anything2 if theyre not afk you can kill them3 they cant stop you doing anything except through fear4 if your afraid to do something you can change system to do it without fear5 if they follow you theyre not afk therefore see point 26 cloaks reduce the combat effectiveness of a ship by using up slots or from adverse effectsif your still worried about the fact they can be safe whilst afk well then you should propose to get rid of pos shields and the ability to dock make a counter argument or dont bother respondingin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

my suggestion would be to rebuild the war system so that it is the defender corp also not allowed to join an alliance so you can prevent the free duplicate wars further in the case of a mutual warmembers of the defenders corp does not leave the corporation to prevent that the old chars parked in the corporation so that the war can be kept on the runif you already take a mutual war so you should also take the blood flowing with usage of the option of mutual war should the war until after the period of 7 days can be removed againand check this lolz mail from my mutal target von fleetadmiralharpergesendet 20121022 0453an darhtvaderrin so i see you left dabrid and you know i was being serious when i said i would destroy your corp now its good that you left dabrid how ever you still need to pay me 25b i wont have you publically apologise for your insolence i think you losing your corp was an adequate substituteafter i get the 25b i will let you drop the war from cinr and accept your surrenderas an added bonus ill see if i can get 1 or 2 corps off you  i cant get them all because some are random but i can pull atleast 2 off youif not ill just hunt you and your members and bring war and chaos to your new corps  fun and lulz for every one  what are your intentions
this is bad and you should feel badcorps in a wardec should be able to join an alliance ccp isnt allowing it for agressors because game design failure but removing it for the defender is even worsteasy fix  remove the mutual wardec mechanism lower the wardec fees so rvb can still pewpew without paying billions of isks each month and allow a defender to pay the wardec fee itself so if you want to countergrief the griefers feel free to do so maybe at a lower cost half cost 
this is bad and you should feel badcorps in a wardec should be able to join an alliance ccp isnt allowing it for agressors because game design failure but removing it for the defender is even worstare you  kidding me  i have many wars not targets all targtes jion a alliance left the alliance and leave the corp  this is not a war this is bullshit all wts go into a npc corp and i can not jion a alliance you tell me this is a good wardec mechanism 
nope ive been saying the same thing since the first memorial post was mentioned i didnt know the guy i think i spoke to him once and whilst its unfortunate he was murdered no other way to put it by some cowardly nutjobs id say 90 of people on here didnt know him eitherlet the people who knewappreciatedloved him do their own memorials because then it has some real meaning and not some pointless pixel memorial that all the people who seem to count being shot by someone in a game as knowing them or the oh yeah he flew in my system once crowdi think the simple memorial on mittanicom is as good as any could be

1 not true there is the psychological warfare side of things in this one also2 not true even how much you want to find them and do what you can you might not still get them3 true but industrialists are usualy easy to kill so they can also use force4 true but it will not resolve the issue of the afk cloaker being somewhere afk5 see point 26 and it is your choice will or will you not fit your ship with cloaks if you do not like the disadvantaged over the advantages then do not fir a cloakill drop the dence things so this wont go into a fight over whos more dencer but i ment with they crying part that most posts are crycrycry no solution crycrycry and i did not mean you in specific though it would be nice that you would give also an solution to this and so if you would have to make an solution to this what would it be how would you remove afk cloakingmy solution is still that claoks should use fuel heavy water its cheap and easy to get mayby add something that allowes you to extract heavy water from ice so you dont need to go to a station to get it and special cloak ships could have the fuel bays1 you could still afk cloak for some time if needed2 game would be more tactical as you need to think more what you do with your cloaked ships3 you can still do psychological warfare if you want4 cloaks would realy not change there would be just something new in them something new that you need to keep in your mind and now just fly mindlessly all over the placeoh and ccp is removing pos shields or they are planing to do so so no need to propose that 
1 this is eve metagaming is a big part of it crying to get rid of a kind of metagaming is dumb2 if theyre not afk then they are doing something from just traveling to hunting theyre doing something that gives you opportunities to catch and kill them it may be difficult and you may fail that doesnt make his point not true though3 if industrialists make themselves easy targets by minmaxing and going it solo thats their own problem4 it doesnt resolve the issue what god damn issue a player is afk alone in a system as you moved next door to do things how is that an issue why does ccp need to do something about that doesnt resolve the issue of the player being afk what a mindboggingly stupid statement5 see point 26 another mindboggingly stupid statement cloaking is a necessary mechanic in numerous situations  its been balanced so it can be used in these situations without being overpowered  saying people should outright not use it at all is just unrealistic and stupidps if you insist on insulting people at least learn to spell dense correctlythere is no problem that requires a solution additionally your proposed solution does nothing but interfere with active players and activities it hinders long term reconnaissance missions and utterly destroys wormhole space arguably itd contribute to the stagnation of nullsec as intel gathering activities are a big deal and imposing idiotic limitations on them in order to curb an entirely different thing is just terrible not to mention the fact that the thing it is trying to fix isnt something that needs fixing in the first place someone being afk is not some unbalanced gamebreaking issue that ccp needs to look into i cant comprehend how stupid one must be in order to consider it as such
i understand the sentiment that somebody who is afk should not be able to have a direct effect  influence within gameyes somebody who was afk has never killed anybody the issue is that you never know if that person is afk or noti do not agree cloaks need fuel or a timer as this has for too much potential to hurt other areas of the gamei would much prefer to introduce a new class of ship say a destroyer and new types of probes to help scan down cloaked shipsthe way it would work would be that the scan time would be a lot longer then normal probes and only the new ship type can equip the probes if the person is not afk and is moving around there is no problem as it would be impossible to scan them due to the scan timehowever if the person goes afk they run the risk of being detectedi do not see anything wrong with this
like i said that if you do not have any solutions for this then do not post you realy need to be realy dense to not understand that im saying its broken and i want to hear solutions for it not crying that its not broken if the fuel idea is bad then present a better one
thatd still utterly destroy wormhole space as the presence of sigs even if it took a long time to scan would tell you ifhow many cloaked ships are in your systemyou seem to be arguing against not knowing whether someone is afk or not rather than cloaked ships being invincible like some others make a point of but i still disagree with the existence of any issue you dont know if that player is active and you shouldnt know if theyre active imo you shouldnt be able to just know that kind of thing if a player wants to appear afk to lull someone into a false sense of security they should be able to your destroyer idea would prevent that kind of metagaming shrinking the sandbox purely for the benefit of cowardly null rattersminers who want perfect safety in 00 of all places
the reason i dont have any solutions is because there isnt a problem regarding point 4 in the earlier post you went on to explain that you can and i assume do just move system to do your business leaving the afk in an empty system  which you claimed was a problem i explicitly asked how thats a problem because it doesnt make a lick of sense a single player entirely by himself in a system is not at his keyboard how is that a problem youre demanding solutions and trying to dismiss me because i didnt provide any but you cant even say what the problem is how can you expect solutions if you cant define the issueps really two ls

with the toggling mutual option the right click mutual menu doesnt function at all this has led to much confusion for people that leave dec shield the only option that does work is to use the drop down menu at the far right side and to uncheck the mutual box
i think that many people who have posted forget that they were young in this game onceone of the biggest problems ive seen in this game is small corps of veteran players who grief noobie corps and players in an attempt to grief them out of the game by running protection rackets there are loads of these corps and they have no shame and see a 3 day old destroyer kill the same as a titan killuntil people are aware of that then all the other changes mean nothingi dont normally troll but when i do i do it on general discussion
but you have to be wary of how active it has to be problem comes pi can be active but you can also do 90 of it from behind a pos remotely only ahving to fly tot he planet for all of 15 seconds at a time to pick up and drop offyou make mining too active and youll end up with the same thing we have now people focusing too much on whatever activity it is to get max yield not even realizing 5 destroyers ahve been sitting 10k away casually locking on to blastem basically what im saying is mining should be active but not in any way that would prevent the player from immediately ebing able to notice and begin responding to possible threats in other words every last minigame suggestion people have proposed can go jump off a cliff
would it be wrong to assume that you are a muricani dont normally troll but when i do i do it on general discussion
you saying its broken is simply an opinion you have the right to that opinion and you used it to post a thread what you do not have is the right to deny somebody else the ability to post thier opinionyou made a thread on a public forum with your opinion youre now finding other people whos opinion differs from yoursthey are telling you there is no problem and thus no sollution required welcome to whats called interacting with people you seem rusty if i were you id work on it

how much do you think chribba would take for his character billions upon billions im sure
i hope this never happens who you are and what your reputation is is one of the key things in our sandbox allowing that to easily be changed would not be good at allnot even if you include previous names in the char infoc
i sign this topic every time its made because my character name is terrible
mine is worse and as for my alt but even so i dont think that name changes are a good idea
very very few people have any kind of reputation that would make this a problem the rest of us are stuck with whatever names we chose or inherited and theres really not a good reason why we shouldnt be able to change them with limitations
ugh not this again name changes would be bad for the eve the reputation you generate in game is tied to your name having the ability to whitewash that reputation should never be allowedand claiming that putting it in the employment history is a fix is a crock of poopi dont what to have to check the employment history of every unknown in canse he has a different name in therealso please read this thread for dev and gm responses on first pagejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
nope being able to not change your toon name in eve is one of the few things that make the difference between healthy paranoia about who youre hiring and crazy paranoia that means you shoot everyone in the face as soon as they ask to join
you should already be doing that when you hire someone i dont see how this is a problem
im not talking about when hireing someone im talking about when someone enters local or warps into your grid or is hanging around the jumpgates in your home system or waiting outside a station you are usinghireing someone isnt the only time in eve when its useful to recognise someoneim happy to pay for spaceships online i would be less happy to pay for check everyones emphistory everyday onlinejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

as to why he had a key logger i dont know its just what he told me he had unless he watched me type my info in and memorized it which would be amazing with the numerical passcode i usedas to me learning a lesson yes i should be way more careful next time but in hind sight he broke ccp rules guidlines and regulations to commit this act which ccp will most likeley cover as this was not an ordinary scam more like he stole my personal info for private use this clearly violates ccp guidlines rule and regulations good sir

with the amount of support this has im suprised ccp or the csm hadnt replyed to this
being brought into the dec shield mutual war circle jerk by a dec shield ambassador corp has educated us on how broken the new war system is please fix this broken mechanicalso being told by a gm this is working is intended is pretty silly id be really surprised if they didnt fix this in december
well be ready to surprised then considering the mess he made ccp soniclover probably isnt up to taskoperation write down all the things check out the list at

if the only effect afk cloaks have is psychological warfare then the counter is dont fall for it there absolutely does not need to be a counter to afk players im sick of hearing this dumb argument from cowardly nullbearsand again anticloaking ships or probes would utterly destroy several areas of the game stop bloody suggesting it
this kind of gives active cloakers a huge shaftingdepending on how far you are talking about for yplus it could really ruin wormholes ping your dissruptor and click dscan any hidden hostiles in your wh will be listedjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
also remove the ability to list things on the market or remove the items youve listed when you log offalso skill training should only train while youre logged onalso production runs should only run while youre logged onalso research should only run while youre logged onalso sov should only be held while at least 1 member of your alliance is logged onetc etc etc etc etcyoure playing the wrong game if you think that the person playing afk is the reason you keep failing
hence why disruptor has x chance based off yrange the specifics would be up to ccp to sort out however the range wouldnt touch the entire solar system something like a 14 au bubble the presence of this unique ship on the active cloakers dscan would alert him to the danger so he could himself move out of rangeim not suggesting an iwin ship vs cloakers im suggesting something with a chance to detect thembtw this t2 destroyer would also be gimped somewhat by the cloak disruptor fit like the covopst3 ships aregreaterinsightskillknowledge
you have a very binary thought process i am suggesting a ship that could engage in a hunt for a cloaked ship not push a button and instantly reveal all cloakers in the systemim not a cowardly nullbear im a player of this game and i think being able to perform a task in the game of eve without an appreciable chance of being countered by another player to be a broker mechanici assume you either profit from this mechanic personally are unable to coherently think through the possibility of creating a ship that could actively search for an active cloaker who could spot him on dscan and actively evadeit makes perfect sense that covert ops would have counter cover ops working against them stop defending a broken bloody game mechanicgreaterinsightskillknowledge
i have a very binary thought process regarding this issue because it is a very binary issue introducing a ship or probe or some other mechanic to detect cloaked ships utterly destroys wormhole space even if you make it a convoluted or timeconsuming process or even if you give it some chance to not find anything on a given scan it still wrecks wormhole mechanics a deliberate design of wormhole mechanics was the inability to detect cloaked players at all introducing a mechanic to detect them regardless of what limits you put on it undermines thatadditionally it doesnt solve any problem because there is no problem youre suggesting things that have nothing but negatives all because your psyche is so frail and battered that a single other player in a massively multiplayer game at that who isnt even there causes you to freak out and stop what youre doingquitits ridiculous htfu or go back to hisecedit as for counters afk players do not need a counter i do not see you suggesting things that would allow me to kill you when youre afk in your pos or outpost so its a bit hypocritical to be demanding mechanics to kill other afk players because the mere sight of them causes you to inconvenience yourselfon top of that cloaks are already balanced there are plenty of limitations put on ships capable of cloaking so by themselves theyre not much of a threat even if theyre active
first explain how introducing a new ship with a specialized module that has the ability to with skill have a chance to temporarily disable all cloaks will destroy wh space considering its a specialized ship would its presence not alert the covop pilot to the potential danger perhaps use a fuel cost or charges perhaps a huge cool down or massive cap usage to fire the disruptor so as to not make it spammableafk in pos  can seige said pos with a greater chance of success than moving within 2000m of the cloaker in systemafk in station  granted you cannot pod individual however an alliance can take over the station and remove his ability to redock with a greter chance of success than moving within 2000m of the cloaker in systemlol frail and battered psyche thats cute anyway as i previously stated i play this game and i seek to improve it likewise i havent demanded anything only suggested something that in fact existed and continues to exist in reality as allowing an enemies submarine free reign in your waters without any ability to hunt for it is very dangerous see wwii battle for the atlanticperhaps the crux of this obviously highly emotionally charged discussion is the need to differentiate between types of cloak one for the spy and one for the ambusherthe spy could continue to gather information without risk only his time and effortthe ambusher could be revealed by the disruptor but has a shiptype that is more capable in combat than the spygreaterinsightskillknowledge
has anyone taken a look at the character bazaar recently pretty funky calculations to determine character worth going on over there for examplethe 46m sp miner worth 2 billion iskthe 26m sp pi pilots being sold for 2 billion isk eachthe three 27m sp mining pilots being sold for 15 billion each the 65m sp miner going for 3 billionwhat do these have in common if you guessed massively inflated prices youd be right prior to plex being introduced as a way of paying for character transfers these characters would be worth anywhere from half to a quarter of what they are now these are simply examples if you look for yourself you will see that every single character is worth massively more than they should be and just in case any of you think this is coincidental that this is a natural playerdriven market phenomena that will subside just in case you forget this has been a trend since the introduction of plex for transfer i give to you these quotes whats wrong with someone incorporating the cost of transfer into the character price you might ask well thats just it its a clear violation of the ccp character bazaar rules and resources where it says and i quote to summarise and to finally get to the point of why ccp should remove the usage of plexs for character transfers the use of plex for character transfers has had two negative consequences for the character market as a whole first it has created a culture in which in clear violation of ccps rules and regulations of the character bazaar it is not only acceptable it is necessary for the seller to place the cost of the character transfer upon the buyer if they wish to turn a profit and avoid paying cash for the transfer secondly it has massively distorted the worth of characters in the character market leading to low sp characters being sold for their estimated worth  12 billion isk a gross distortion of the characters worth thus and in conclusion ccps introduction of using plex as an alternative method of payment for character transfer has created several negative and easily foreseeable consequences which must be addressed
i dont understand your point here the owner of the character is responsible to pay the character transfer fee but why shouldnt the prices be inflated to transfer that cost to the seller if you buy milk in the grocery store everyone that touches the product between you and the cow that produced it adds a markup there are reallife man hours associated with transferring a character both in the form of development time gm time etc so ccp charging to do this is extremely reasonable additionally allowing people to use plex for the transfer rather than rl cash makes selling characters available to a wider range of players finally if it costs me 15 to transfer that character rather than a plex do you really think im going to value my rl cash at below the plex to cash conversion rate tldr1 ccp has the right to add a markup to character transfers be it in cash or plex because it costs them money to perform that service 2 as long as i can buy plex with my cash and isk with plex there exists a cash to isk conversion rate so any cash payment has an isk equivalent value 3 third party markup costs are always transferred to the buyer from the seller thats just standard business policy you accept it anytime you buy something in game or out
i accept your premise that in the real world at least cost incurred by the seller are transferred to the buyer however this is not the real world this is a highly artificial and tightly regulated economy overseen by the creators ie ccp as such there are rules which if you do not follow you will be punished for in this instance the rule is that the seller shoulders the cost of character transfer not the buyer to ad absurdum your analogy this would be analogous to the buyer being forced to pay UFFFD15 worth of their own money to pay the transfer fees since we can assume that a plex bought out of game for a set amount can thus be ascribed a real world value the principle of my statement is the same is there a difference between being forced to pay UFFFD15 to buy a character and paing a plex worth UFFFD25on a side note my first conclusion is objective it has analysed the empirical evidence to arrive at a logical conclusion and that process can be observed and duplicated by another individual my second conclusion is thus subjective as it is simply my opinion felt the need to clarify that
1 the eve market works very similar to the real world market and while it is centered around space pixels it is a highly functional market economy based on supply and demand in most ways eves economy is much less regulated than the real world market while it is monitored by ccp it is not tightly regulated the price you pay for goods and services is almost completely determined by player created supply player determined demand and player market manipulations not by npc buysell orders sure there are several sources and sinks of isk and commodities that ccp controls but those are pretty much kept static so the market equalibriates around player activities in short ccp could regulate supply and demand but rarely do 2 eve sellers are selling things for profit to do that they must transfer all costs incurred in creating and delivering that product to the seller the character bazaar is no different why do you think it should this is not a communist society where people devote their efforts for the general good they devote their efforts for profit 3 this rule does not mean the owner of the character cannot or should not factor in the costs of transferring a character into the sell price of their character why do you think it would or should the point of the rule is to explicitly state whom is responsible for the character transfer fee that ccp demands for their delivery service
the message for booting corps from alliance conveys incorrect information as wellif you kick this corporation out of the alliance they will still be in all wars that are currently ongoing for the alliance the wars will be copied over to the corporation being kicked out and they will be automatically retracted are you sure you want to throw them outthe wars are not automatically retracted thats the old system that auto retracted the wars the text message needs to be updated
i added few more proposalswis poker rooms espionage tactics theft tacticsindustry some additional mini games to the already existing production mechanics where if u decide to do them if u are good u can minmax the production output
because as ive already said the inability to know if there are cloaked ships in wormhole space is a deliberate design adding a ship that will with a few clicks tell you ifhow many cloaked ships are in the wormhole defeats the god damn point you may not be too familiar with wormhole mechanics or the typical styles of gameplay but take it from people whove spent years doing it introducing a ship or mechanic thatll not only tell you cloaked ships are there but let you find them is horrific and destroys what makes wormhole space unique and interesting you claim its presence would alert the covops pilot but what relevance does that have great they know that the enemy knows they are present despite wormhole space being specifically designed to prevent that now what the jig is up already good job ruining an entire area of space with your peabrained ideaas for sieging a pos or taking over an outpost they both take a lot of effort and provide the person sitting in them ample time and opportunity to get out safely additionally sieging a pos or taking over an outpost doesnt undermine core mechanics of 00 spaceyou want to improve the game and i appreciate the good intentions but take it from someone who actually knows your suggestion would make the game worse in many ways
mmm clever use of the word peabrained i like what you did there and although such infallible logic has rocked me back to my heels i will nevertheless attempt a rebuttalthe premise of your entire argument is thus  it will ruin wspace as this area of the game is designed around the concept of stealth and cloaking fine so wspace eminations altereliminate using a disruptor which is btw mounted on your ship not a probe you launch now wspace is maintained as it is and working as intended you can breathe a sigh of relieifi would ask you now then why a cloaks should show up in local why the creation of a second type of cloak specifically fit for combat cov ops ships versus purely information gathering ones wouldnt eleviate that problem and how these two changes wouldnt in fact go hand in hand with a disruptor module mounted on a specialized hull that could detectdisrupt the ambusher cloak for combat shipsyes seiging a pos or a station are hard finding a cloaking and flying within 2000m of him in a solar system are a ct hair short of impossible if i was so inclined i could create 1000 subscriptions train them to fly a covops and flood nullsec with afk cloakersimagine the tearsis this a mechanic your willing to defend without comprimisegreaterinsightskillknowledge
the problem with the disruptor ship is that it does something than no other ship or ship based module in eve can do apply an effect across a whole systemthis is a bit op about as much as the old aoe dd imo and if you limit it in any way so that it is not op you make it only useful against active cloakers and hence does nothing to counter afk cloakersedit2 read back a bit more carefully and this was not entirely what was suggested i apologize for derping and you may return to your semidebateedit and anyone who gives tears over 1 potentially afk guy is a fool there are plenty of options to deal with invaders and there are many systems that do not have afk cloakers or anyone for that matter
i see your point and raise you 1 off grid boosting shipps never stated cloak disruptor had to have a system wide range probably in the aus thoughagain allow me suggest another type of cloak ambusher that can be fitted by combat ships that can be countered with disruptor covops intelligence gathering ships can retain the old spy type cloak and remain utterly undetectablegreaterinsightskillknowledge
nooooooooooooo
and im of the mindset that ill only pay so much for a character or will only sell for a certain amount these posts that say keep in mind im using plex to pay for the transfer means nothing to me heres my price take it or leave it i dont care how you pay for the transfer fee if youre over priced youre over priced i will not buy a toon that i do not feel is worth the iskand since were on the topic of value ive always had a hard time wrapping my head around how people try to standardize value that toon or car or house or whatever may be worth x to you but to me its worth y who are you to tell me what somethings worth im no economics expert but to me value is 100 subjective
actually yes yes it does whilst i can agree that everyone who sells something is looking to make a profit or at least minimise their loss the point i was trying to make with the artificial market was not that the eve market was tightly controlled but that the character bazaar and only the character bazaar was ccp may not have an active interest in controlling the prices save in one or two instances but im sure they have an interest in making sure the rules of the market are followed now again to my point which you seem to be missing if the rules of the market prohibit the seller from placing the costs of transfer on the shoulders of the buyer then by adding the price of 2 plex to the sell price that is literally what they are doing and thus in doing so they are breaking the rules of the artificial market  now to reiterate a previous point and expand upon it slightly why should i pay an extra UFFFD25 since that is what i am doing as we have established that plexs have real world value to allow the seller to break the rules if somebody wants to make a profit on a character that is fine i used to buy and sell characters all the time before the introduction of plex for transfer and what kept the price relatively stable was the absolute knowledge that you were wholly and simply paying for the character now youre paying for the character and the transfer fee and that is simply unacceptable
this same rule i use when i go to estate sales and auctions know what youre willing to pay for something and stick to ityes and no you can objectively measure the value of a given object by determining what people are willing to give up in terms of real costs or opportunity costs to obtain that object subjectively you may be willing to give up less or more than someone else for the same object but its average of those values that determine the market value of that object and all of that assumes i remember my freshman economics classes
sara brandie wroteif the rules of the market prohibit the seller from placing the costs of transfer on the shoulders of the buyer then by adding the price of 2 plex to the sell price that is literally what they are doingto quote the rule again no where in the rule does ccp specify that price of a character sale may not be determined with consideration of the costs of the transfer all the rule states is that the actual character transfer fee at the time of the transaction on the account support page must be paid to ccp by the transferor not the transferee or some third party there is currently no way for the transferee to pay for the transfer via the account support page nor has there even been interpreted as such this is a hangover rule from the days when the transferring of characters was paid for via cash only people in the character bazaar were dealing in monetary transactions and per other areas of eula we are not allowed to put down any forms of realworld currency for items andor characters in the game thus if you paid for the character transfer fee externally from the system you were technically violating the eula even if you were paying for the actual character with isk if you enter into an agreement with the seller of character for the value of the character plus two plex that you purchase separately with your own money and transfer ingame i doubt ccp would object to the transfer alternatively you could just pay the price of the character which then includes the tranferors purchase of plex or his financial investment the actual calculation of plex price into a character transfer is a matter of the market determined by active traders and investers in character transfers if they have all mutually assented to calculating their prices based on them paying for their character transfers now in terms of plex instead of realworld currency that is a matter of efficient capitalism and does not violate the ruleto be clear youre also mistaking the definition of value with the definition of price

agree that this would not only be informative and useful but is required and long overdue1
note i did edit after i realized i misunderstood also i forgot about offgrid boosting which i have been against for quite a whileyour two cloak idea would not have any effect whatsoever on afk cloaking because an afk cloaker of the kind people worry most about is not a combat ship rather a covert ops with cynothere is simply no idea that modifies cloaking mechanics or cloaks that would do anything to afk cloakers without making active cloak activities much more difficult or tedious than they already are yet ive been thinking for a long while on this if anyone comes up with one i might even buy them a plex maybe not committing to that though
yes i am ill get to why in a momentfirst i am glad you appreciate how destructive such a ship or other similar suggestions would be to wormhole mechanics and of course disallowing the use of such a ship or similar mechanic in wormhole space would of course preserve the glorious superior mechanics of wormhole space itd feel a bit clunky to say ah but  strange system effect just so happens you cant use that ship now but itd at least preserve the sanctity of wormholeshowever i still entirely disagree with such a ship because there are again legitimate activities and playstyles in nullsec space which would be massively hindered im sure ive mentioned this before but long term reconnaissance missions whether its observing an enemy fleet or waiting in a strategic location to provide jumpwarp in points etc rely on the ability to sit cloaked in one location for extended periods of time i feel that being able to locate these brave agents is detrimental to the game as it helps entrench residentsdefenders by making even simple acts of observing them or getting in position much more difficult there are further arguments in favour of cloaking such as countering the stupid instant and infallible local tool by introducing doubt  are you there or are you afk some kind of mechanic to detect stationary cloaked ships would remove this doubt providing people with even more security and intel than they already have and remove the one tiny thing players can do to help counter the overpowered local tool no to that i sayand above all else i dont understand why you feel you should have the right to find and kill afk players in your system anyway you already have every advantage yet you are so mad that they simply have the ability to sit in your system doing nothing pahas for you creating an army of afk alts yes i fully support that i will defend that without question or compromise as theyre all afk and incapable of doing anything there is no problem it may scare some local bears to see twonk1 twonk2 twonk3 etc in local and they may think theres a big fleet out to get them but the ability to employ such forms psychological warfare and metagaming are what elevate eve online above the wowlevel dreck that mmo game space is dominated by
ok so then i need 10000 subscriptions and to afk cloak 1 system at a time preferably an enemy staging system or other strategically important location perhaps cashing the node get the point no counter  potential for abuse eve needs to move towards a full pvpsandbox style and away from this sandbox with the grade 3 teacher watching version of it which means every action must have a way to stop itnegate itdeal with it etc by the player baseyou have highlighted several concerns with being able to reveal or detect a cloaked ship which show me that 1there is a serious problem with the existing system and 2 the solution rests with the creation of new mechanics adjustment of old onesa revamp of the dscanner a very cool idea needs to updated badly
remove afk  cloakingthere are 2 distinct parts here1 afk  mining  ratting  hauling  market trading2 cloaking  intel spy  cyno drop  safe travel  bombing  terrorizing  bounty huntingplease pick one and make arguments on it separately then check to make sure your suggestion does not negatively impact any of the other listed areas if it does go back to the drawing board and start over after finding your best answer please post it along with all your back research for peer reviewthat is all
but it is balanced the difference is locals intel is guaranteed whereas the psychological effects from afking are notplus why shouldnt there be psychological warfare in this game i think its a great additionlets face it when they decloak they are just as killable as you this really is a none issue and you can take precautions sure you may still diaf but as i said the only guarantee here is the easy mode local intelwant changes to cloaks then lets deal with the reason for afking first pleasedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
not to invalidate your perspective id like to get into that shortly however i have yet to receive a response to the proposal of diversifying cloaking modules based on task and effectiveness versus one uber cloak would really appreciate some feedback also considering within that suggestion is the allowance to maintain undiscoverable cloaking as it standsbut perhaps that is for another thread either way lets look at the reasonhs for afking i presume you have some ideas as you brought it upgreaterinsightskillknowledge

ive mentioned the biggest issue with that idea it does nothing to solve afk cloaking just adds unnecessary complexityan afk cloaker would just make sure to use the same setup as the active spy and thus will still be invincibleall the idea would do is make devs work more and make cloaky hunters have a little more risk in an already highly risky low reward profession either that or i just suck with bombers there simply is no way still considering betting a plex on this to hinder afk cloakers without making things more difficult for active cloak activities some of which are already difficult and risky for very little reward note while modifying cloaking itselfthere may be a way to remove the silly terror that is afk cloaking but the answer lies with the other mechanics responsible not cloaking cynos local etc or just growing up and learning the many ways to deal with potential intruders already used by wh corps and a few sov holdersedit devon thank you for at least being reasonable with your debate style i really like the lack of personal attacks and whining rare thing but makes these discussions actually enjoyable
my perspective that psychological warfare is a great addition could indeed be argued either wayas far as the different cloaks idea is concerned i refer once more to my post lets sort out the reason for afking first then lets look at cloaks even with this diversifying cloaks idea you end up gaining more intel power on top of the already powerful local intel tool that surely cannot be seen as a balanced approachthat being said i actually like the status quo and dont wish for any changes but if you want cloaks to change then local should be changed to stop its easy mode intel system the fact that you can afk without a cloak and gain the same psychological effects means your focus should be on local if indeed afking is your targetdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

nothat character could be getting a name change because of a transfer or change in preference in the dystopia future of eve that is not likely the case it would get abused bad reputations would be too easy to avoidportraits donUFFFDt really show anything we older players all lost our original ones backgrounds hair and clothes can change without plex resculptures are far less noticeable than that it is so minute a difference that is doesnUFFFDt matterhow your character looks is not intelthe name of your character is intel
anything that hurts the character bazaar is a good thing its a necessary evil imhocost of transfer is what 20 that already puts cash in favor of isk esp with rising plex prices if this was not the case i would suggest it as a compromisepeople make serious isk off of characters you may have to shell out more isk to get the plex but you will just have to find a way to make it back on the character sale thats called business and inflation
i would love this i can see arguments for not making a jump capable one i think it could be argued that rapid deployment for war ie jumping ships is a job for carriers yes i know jump frieghters can and are used to get behind enemy lines still i think that saying that moving fleets of fitted ships is and should remain part of what carriers are for however you wouldnt use a carrier to move ships through nonhostile space during peace times you would use a dry dock cargo vessel it is big relatively helpless slower than a carrier but capable of moving more at a time that is the sort of job i see for a ship like this i vote making it a tier 2 freighter rather than a tech 2 freighter since it is more of a repurpose than a complete redesign oh and 1 either way

if dust succeeds it might be wise to attempt to apply a similar business model to eve and attempt to ween the game off of subscriptions slowly and attempt to move to a free to play model this would be a major change for the game would take a lot of work and certainly wouldnt happen over nightso how would aurum modules and hulls work with out turning into pay to winaurum modules would be identical to tech ii modules in every way however they would have much less intensive skill requirements this would allow people to purchase and use tech ii modules if they hadnt normally acquired the skill for it it also gives those who attain normal tech ii modules the normal way a slight advantage as depending on the modules they would use less capacitor have greater range or would hit harder because of the supporting skill in the end regardless of skills an aurum module would never be able to attain greater performance then a tech ii modules only equivalentaurum hulls would be identical to tech ii ship hulls but would require much less skills to fly them allowing people to pay to get into a hull with out some of the supporting skills but would give people who trained to use the actual tech ii hull advantages from its supporting skills you would have to do some tinkering with actual ship command skill bonus where for example a person who had heavy assault cruisers skills trained wouldnt be able to squeeze more performance out of an aurum hull then a normal hac for instanceaurum version of sacrilege amar cruiser skill effects both amar cruiser skill and heavy cruiser skill bonus once again an aurum hull would never be able to out perform a tech ii hull it would only attain equivalent performancethe other difference would be the hulls and the modules if they had a model in game like guns would also have different artwork to allow people to get these ships or modules simply for variety or customization sake or even for bling factor like all other aurum products they could also be sold on the marketwith the changing of how people train for ships and how skills like recons heavy assault skills etc become racial another advantage of this is it will also give players the opportunity to quickly get access to another races tech ii hull if there willing to pay extra in isk or in aurum for iti think the best way to do the acquisition of these hullsmodules is the aurum purchases a blue print copy with a certain number of runs and that it would take basic minerals from the market to produce these vesselsmodules people get the most bang for there buck then these aurum bpc would have fixed mineral build values and would be unaffected by manufacturing skills every one builds them at the same rate for the same mineral cost you dont just purchase one hull or one module with your money you would get a set this mineral cost may sound like a  idea considering that people just spent cash on this product but if a good value was arrived at i think it would be a reasonable cost in addition to the creation of the aurum hullmoduleby making these ships and modules equal to and not greater then tech ii modules and hulls i think it avoids the gold ammo gold hull problems of fearless fameif this is still idiotic and game breaking please say so and more importantly please explain why
wont ever happen can you imagine what eve would be like if everybody had unlimited altsgodwhat a nightmarenow if they found a way to simply prevent you from running more than one client at a time on any given pcgreatall for itbut i seriously doubt many others would agree with me simply because they rely on said alts as did i at one timeccp on the other hand would probably lose revenue with such a model
two things as pointed out above making eve free to play will usher in a golden age of alts watch single players control mining fleets of 10 hulks and 2 orcas or create fleets of drakes that are all fit the same exact way shoot at the exact same time all at the same targetbest part is that this is already legal the only limitation is how much money you are willing to spend on how many accounts why would people spend real money on ships and weapons that are no better than t2 stuff when they can simply wait for the passive skill que to do its thing i certainly wouldnt especially if im not paying anything to keep an account open in the first placemaybe some more impatient people will get these gold ships and mods but i doubt they are enough impatient people that will get ccp 5 million usd a month 15 usd  350000 subscriptions and i doubt they will hang around for long either when they find out that their pimp ship that they paid real money for can be easily killed by 15 people in random t1 crap
no this topic there is only remove afk cloaking there is just one part here if we go for all afk activities we can close the game right now cause you can list manufacturing reserch invention pi and almost all other industry based activities to your part 1 and without those there will be no eve cause you would not have ships to blow up
the problem isif you are attacking this particular problem because you have an issue with people being afk then it is only fair to be consistent and work on getting rid of all mechanics that allow for afking after all it isnt fair that people can gain an advantage when they are not on the computerif you are attacking this on the basis that cloaking itself isnt directly counterable well look at the ships themselves they are actually quite gimped with regards to direct combat and wont stand up in a fair fightif you are against afk cloaking because you fear cyno drops thats a different mechanic system separate from cloaking you can alter it so that normal cynos need to spool up but what about covert cynos taking the point above in account that cloakingcapable ships are weak in direct combat how is a person supposed to last long enough to pin down a target remember only stealth bombers have no targeting delay and they have minimal tanking ability and live long enough for a cyno to spool upbeyond that if you create mechanics that allow for system scans of cloaking ships you effectively negate any point to cloaks in general because any anticloaking ship that can scan a system becomes standard for any serious 00 and wormhole dweller and if you make it localized then you are doing nothing against afk cloakers who sit in safe spots well out of the way of any celestial object and instead directly nerf active cloakers who are trying to do things in their tinfoil shipsthe most important issue though is how are people supposed to take their enemies by surprise if local tells everyone in the area that a potential hostile is in system keep in mind afk cloaking was born because of thisevery time i have gone to nullsec in a ship as soon as i appear in local everyone docks up and they will never come out ever until i leave or am killed by the thousand man horde this makes for very few opportunities to engage anyone or do any real damage no matter how well i preparedthe only counter i have is to devalue local by sitting in the system until they are used to my presence
well i wouldnt actualy mind about the fact that if i would need to make the ships activly but its just not happeningthere are too few of us versus the people getting blown up in the ships that we make so if the build mechanics would change in a way that every build would need active game time it would mean that you would run out of ships realy realy fastalso i would go for the remove local idea cause it would be a good change to the game actualy but as long as its there then removing afk cloakers is the choice what i would like to have
i think the quoted poster was providing a guideline for those making suggestions to counter afk cloakinghe was saying in order to come up with a counter method you must check each activity listed to make sure you are not impacting them in a negative waythis has so far been shown to not be possiblealso some posts have gone missing from this thread
well being as local is the reason for afking in the context of psychological warfare then its the thing that should be looked at without locals instant intel afking would be pointlessdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
after reviewing over much of the conversation i find the crew application interesting while it does sound like have been playing star trek online this is still eve online a very different game in itself crew aspects would lead to crew skills they would also lead to many asking for crew abilities as well as being able to walk in your ship it would also lead to ship interiors which will then lead to useless console button pushing oh wait i almost forgot arent the pilots in a pod directly connected to the ship yuppers but having crew serf might sound good in some aspects one must know how and when to stop and draw a line if crews are given to ships can i as a pilot murder that crew slow down some of your ship functions hmmm its all interesting until you get really into it perhaps capital ships can have limited crew otherwise we tend to think that clear skies is actually how we use the ships in eve online while the show is great it is not the full story of how ships operate in eve online in truth no one real knows the full answerjust remember folks this game is better the sto and it has less usless attributes then sto please dont try to make it replicate useless attributes have a purpose in the gamei would say yes to carriers and titans having a limited crew operate the fighters and some of the ship functions perhaps different aspects to each faction would crew the ships you can get crew through missions you do as well as on the open market
i think the title is misleadingi thought this was a thread about having a  in the game and came in with high hopesalas i think the op meant ship crew and since we already have hundreds of threads on this topic i will leave disappointed
sleepers are descended from humanity im sorry bud but eve sorta stands out in the scifi world because it doesnt have aliens and we kinda like that highsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community see wwwminerbumpingcom

where are the csm and the devs on thisthis is the singularly most abused and broken continual gameplay mechanic in the game and yet they are never anywhere to be seen on the topic 1 to the op 10 to the csm we still have one right and 100 again to ccp for trying to achieve one goal and by not thinking it through property again achieving exactly the opposite effect again
btw i dont want to walk around in stations fight a fail fight on a ps3 or see pretty trails coming out of the back of my ship i just want you to fix what is broken now before you go on to make something else that will be broken
i happen to agree at the moment that the aggressor needs to be able to shut down a wardec like this i will 1 dec shield for catching uk in the wardec and infinity to ccp on two fronts1 allowing this to happen in the first place2 being unable to deal with the wardec as a harassment complaint when its clearly stated that this is mechanic abuse done deliberately nothing can be done by the gms gogo ccp
so i was out scanning around today came up with an idea to help make lowsec piracy a more viable profession it ties in with factional warfare and i believe that it will be a small scale conflict driver throughout fw lowsec across the entire game my thought is that if youre a pilot not a member of any militia you come across a militia pilot in a ls system controlled by any of the other militias it doesnt matter which as long as the system doesnt belong to your targets militia you decide to engage that militia pilot and kill them what benefit does this grant you as a nonfw pilot not much a kill mail maybe some tears you take a sec status hit and have to wait out your gcc and hopefully get some lootmy proposal is that if you kill any militia member in a system that belongs to another militia you would be paid a portion of the lp reward that the kill would normally be worth by the faction that controls the system essentially you could be paid by the factions for disrupting their opponents and protecting their territory without having to join a militia privateeringif you join the militia of course the reward would be far better but this would open up the fw loyalty point stores to outside players and would drive non militia players to fight in these fw systems far more it makes being a 10 lowsec pirate a much more viable play style almost a real profession it would allow them to make money from the lp stores like the majority of fw pilots however it should not be anywhere near as profitable as actually joining the militias i feel that it opens up a large subsection of the game to new and interesting game playblog
while privateering makes sense because well its already happened in this worldi dont like it i dont want to buy from the same grubby stores as fw scrubs 
so everyone would agree that lets remove local
there are enough threads on this topic i suggest you post in those rather than start a new one
i am against anything that is experience based on activity since eve is based on time no xp grindhowever as crews are part of the lore even on pod ships just not needed for the same tasks as on normals i would like a way to mess around with such after the rebalance is finished
not letting this one go out quietlyi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
reread first post in thread it is a tier 2 furthermore it leaves the option for a jump capable t2 varianti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
hmm watch carefully they do breathe it is part of the idle animations though perhaps thats been fixed
yeah month and a half old here been away from a week and about to log in find out that the fw based wardec we had going has now gone into a meltdown of decshield with the original party still not even at mutual war with us and now i cant even think of undocking unless i want to deal with every  who uses decshield for lulzkills gunning for me whenever i undock at any time in any ship anywhere for any reasonyeah  good game ccp
1 to op for actually working out the mechanics and finding the exploitinfinity to ccp for not contemplating this mechanicin general i like shooting at people and being shot at this is kind of dumb though ragnar can standbut my  paying altarmy m
it seems its still possible to leave dead corps floating all over the place including inside an alliance
i agree would be amazing to see this happen
agreed
a bump for being able to reward people in an alliance for a job well donei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
how about missions that encourage players to use different ships and fittingsfor example missions where a friendly is under attack and needs to be repaired while under attack by pirates maybe a friendly bs is under attack by a swarm of drones its your job to go in and web each drone so that the bs can destroy ita booster dealer is doing a trade in a deadspace complex its your job to go there cloak up wait for the trade decloak scan cargoholds and then call it the police ratsherping your derp since 19potato  url
great suggestions s i said different kind of missions d be really welcome
i had never considered the ramifications of having free to play also mean maximum alts yikes i dont know how you would control that with out screwing over people who already have like ten accountsas for impatient people theyre everywhere i hope dust is successful and as i have been playing it i assumed most people would be like me in thinking the only thing you would spend real money on would be a skill booster and then let your actual game play do the talking skill wise but there is a growing group of players who really think the quickest way to level is with aurum gear instead of implantssome people dont want to have to wait 30 days to fly a hull or more you might be shocked at the number of people willing to plunk down cash for a ship if the price is rightnow eve pvp is awesome and it may not get you sp to win pvp fights but i think it there are people crossing over from dust they might take the same idea with them of if this tech two aurum hull is better i should grab a couplethe idea here is that in pve you usually dont loose ships to make any sort of income off of aurum ships modules they would have to be focused on pvp modules and shipsim trying to create and oppurtunity for ccp if dust is successful its going to bring in quite a different crowd then what were used too all the fpsr i have met on dust i have always told them to get an eve account started and there dust merc will bathe in isk one day
i know that some of us take part in verry large fleet corp and alliance battles but have you ever thought of having a marker you can place there as in a monument to what occured there as well as including a short text about what occured there  of course you would have to type that up yourself  but it would allow us to express ourselves in another totally different way that and it would allow us to honour or fallen at the sites of these vast memorable battlegrounds
ttd  less than 1 second
heh not a clue what that means
most likely time to destructionalternatively time to dong
problem contracts linked in trade channels cannot be accepted or bid upon if not in same regionsolution 1 make contracts be able to be accepted and bid upon from anywhere in the worldsolution 2 make a world type contract that probably cost more to setup will also act as a isk sink but can be accepted and bid upon from anywhere in the world
contracts are fine the way they are
no you cant bid on contracts or accept public ones unless you are in same region
has it occurred to you that that is intentional
try flying more than one jump from jita
as a lifelong pirate i would support a system like this if it was endorsed by npc pirates rather than local fw the prominent regional pirate faction makes more sense to hand out rewards for killing people disruption lawful activity and such and this would mean such a reward system would not be restricted to fw areas part of the appeal of being a criminal is the complete lack of affiliation with any sort of governmental organization and i dont know how many pirates would be willing to compromise that to become glorified fw conscripts edit also rewards given for killing people should not be claimable until you have 5 sec status or lower
thats a pretty good idea maybe require your standing towards the pirate faction to be above a certain point to be eligible for the rewardsblog
no because that would probably require some amount of pve grinding which most pirates have no patience for also most pirates probably have greatly negative standing to most if not all npc pirate corps if they were mission runners at any point i think the only major requirement to receive these rewards should be a deeply negative sec status perhaps rewards for killing someone with a very positive sec status could be higher than if they had a neutral sec statusedit after giving it some thought i think that the standing requirement would not be a bad thing if pirate standings would be gained through killing capsuleers perhaps if a certain regional pirate faction required a high enough standing to get rewarded for pvp you had to destroy so many ships to become eligible for whatever the rewards are and then only after reaching that standing threshold do you receive tangible benefits to being a pirate
